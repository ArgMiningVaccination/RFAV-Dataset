However, if and how P. aminovorans interacts with V. cholerae has not been experimentally determined; m oreover, whether any association between this bacterium alters the behaviors of V. cholerae to affect the disease outcome is unclear. Methods: Sequence analysis on microbiome data sets was used to quantify and identify bacterial species in human stool sampl es. Infant mouse intestinal colonization model, co -culture assays, and microscopy were used to characterize the in vitro and in vivo interactions between P. aminovorans and V. cholerae. Genetic mutants of V. cholerae were tested to identify the components essential for these interactions. Results: Here we show that P. aminovorans and V. cholerae together form dual - species biofilm structures at the air -liquid interface, with previously uncharacterized novel features. Inside the dual -species biofilm structure s, expression of Vibrio exopolysaccharide ( vps) genes is induced in the presence of P. aminovorans . Importantly, the presence of P. aminovorans within the murine small intestine enhances V. cholerae colonization in the same niche that is dependent on the p roduction of VPS and other major components of mature V. cholerae biofilm. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that biofilm formation of the enteric pathogen V. cholerae is enhanced by a specific gut commensal P. aminovorans, and these two species together form a robust biofilm structure . The strong interaction between the two species could explain the increased abundance of this microbe in cholera patients in endemic areas. Our studies further illustrate that multi -species biofilm formation is a plausible mechanism used by a gut microbe to increase the virulence of the pathogen, and this interaction may alter outcomes in enteric infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-70-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Modelling Surface Charge Effects on Nanoparticle Accumulation in Bacterial Biofilms Abstract Body: Interactions between biofilms and nanoparticles have gotten increasing interest amongst scientists for applications in medicine, ecotoxicity and biogeochemical cycling. Comprehensive health and safety assessments in these areas require models which quantif y nanoparticle uptake into biofilms and consequent toxic effects, or nanoparticle -biofilm interaction models. To develop the nanoparticles - biofilm interaction models necessary for these applications, a mass -transport model for nanoparticle transport in bio films was developed which accounts for nanoparticle diffusion and macro/microscale electrostatic interactions within biofilms. Nanoparticle diffusion and macroscale electrostatic captured using a modified Nernst -Plank equation. Microscale electrostatic interactions were accounted for using protein -type binding kinetics. Dimensionless mass -transfer relations were developed from this model for different rate -limiting assumptions by solving the general component balance using both analytical and numerical techniques. Model results were compared with experimental accumulation behavior in literature. Deviations of nanoparticle accumulation from first-order kinetics were replicated. A previously described distinction between binding and partition ing of charged nanoparticles into gels was also replicated. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-73-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Model for assessing the pH changes of Streptococcus mutans biofilms in real -time Abstract Body: Background Streptococcus mutans is one of the most common species in oral biofilms, associated with tooth decay. Once on the tooth surface, S. mutans can produ ce glucan which promote biofilm formation. carbohydrates and produce pyruvate. Pyruvate is metabolised to lactate and secreted in the form of lactic acid. Lactic acid lowers the environmental pH and promotes demin eralisation of the tooth's enamel leading to the formation of dental caries. Methods In the present study we have established a dynamic in vitro model using radiometric pH nanosensors to assess acid production and thus the metabolic activity of S. mutans biofilms. The radiometric pH nanosensors are comprised - sensitive fluorophores (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC -D) and Oregon Green reference fluorophore (5 -(and -6)- carboxytetramethylrhodamine dextran (TAMRA -D)) that is pH insensitive. The pH can be calculated by the ratio of green to red fluorescence. Results We have previously successfully used the nanosensors to monitor pH changes in environmental microniches in static and flow biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In the present study we further developed and validated the model and use of pH nanosensors, growing biofilms in a flow system in artificial saliva media to mimic the conditions in the oral environment. We were able to monitor pH changes and assess the metab olic activity of the biofilms in real -time. Conclusions The developed method can be used successfully in assessing the metabolic activity of growing S. mutants biofilms in real -time Control Number: 2022 -A-74-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Genomic analyses of biofilm -forming and non -biofilm -forming populations processing en vironments Abstract Body: Biofilms are microbial communities embedded in self -produced extracellular substances (e.g., curli and cellulose) and can cause the recalcitrant contamination of meat with pathogenic and generic Escherichia coli . The objectives of this study were to : 1). To determine the phylogenetic relationship of biofilm forming and non-biofilm forming E. coli from various stages of beef processing; 2). To characterize genetic elements involved in biofilm formation in E. coli . A total of 114 E. coli isolates from be ef carcasses before hide -on wash (BHW; n=20) and after hide -on wash (AHW; n=20), and from beef carcasses before (CH0H; n=20) and after chilling (CH4H; n=20), fabrication equipment before n=20) and after (EAC; n=13) le genome sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqX platform. The isolates from each source had equal number of extremely strong biofilm formers and non -biofilm formers as determined by the crystal violet staining method except for the EAC population where only t hree non -biofilm formers were available. The sequences were processed and annotated using an in - house workflow. Each genome was in silico typed for phylogroup. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on core genes. Genome wide association analysis was carried out using Scoary. The 114 isolates belonged to four phylogroups, A (n=33, 50.9% of the biofilm formers and non -formers, respectively, followed by the A phylog roup at 23.0% and 35.9%, respectively. Unlike isolates in all other groups, the EAC isolates were exclusively of phylogroup B1. The core genome tree showed intermingle of biofilm formers and non -biofilm formers even though clustering of closely related iso lates were spread out the entire tree. No genes were overrepresented in the biofilm formers, compared to the non -biofilm formers, based on Scoary analysis, with the criteria of present in >60% of the biofilm former group, but absent in > 60% of the non -biofilm formers. Interestingly, missing genes in the bcs operon (cellulose synthesis) did not always result in a cellulose negative phenotype, contrary to the csg operon (curli) and curli phenotype, as determined by the commonly used Congo Red method. The fin dings show redundancy in genes involved in biofilm formation for coli . ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-75-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Title: IMPACT OF \"DEEP CLEANING\" SANITIZATION ON NATURAL BIOFILM COMMUNITIES AND THE SURVIVAL OF Salmonella enterica Abstract Body: Background: Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. Previous studies suggested that certain S. ent erica serovars may be better at adapting to the environment with stronger survival ability via mixed biofilm formation and subsequently, a higher chance of causing food contamination. In the meat industry, one action taken to address pathogen contamination is a Deep - Cleaning (DC) sanitization of the entire processing plant environment that many large processors perform annually or semiannually. However, the immediate and long -term impact of such procedure on natural biofilm disruption and pathogen recoloniz ation is unknown. Here we investigated the impact of DC sanitization on environmental biofilms and the subsequent S. enterica colonization and stress tolerance. Methods: Floor drain samples containing environmental microorganisms were collected from variou s areas at a meat plant with S. enterica prevalence before, 1 week, and 4 weeks after DC sanitization. Biofilm formation by microorganisms in 12 drain samples without Salmonella presence was tested on 96 - well plates with crystal violet staining under proce ssing temperature (7oC). The ability of the samples to recruit and/or protect from quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) treatments co -inoculated S. enterica strains was determined. The community structure of each drain sample was determined through 16S metag enomic sequencing and analysis. Results : Post -DC samples collected from 8 drains formed significantly higher biofilms than the respective pre -DC samples. Salmonella colonization exhibited no difference between the pre - and post -DC biofilms at each drain lo cation. However, Salmonella survival in QAC - treated pre - and post -DC mixed biofilms varied depending upon the drain locations and higher survival was positively correlated with the biofilm matrix. Results of 16S metagenomic sequencing exhibited community s tructure shift which might be associated with the phenotype of biofilm formation and Salmonella tolerance in the environment. Conclusion : DC sanitization may disrupt the pre -existing microbial community and alter the natural population composition. Disrupt ion of the environmental biofilms may have unexpected effects due to the resulting lack of competition within the multispecies community and the survival or recruitment of species with high colonizing capability. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-76-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Disrupting Biofilms by Targeting Response Francisella tularensis . Abstract Body: Two -component systems allow bacteria to detect, evaluate, and protect themselves against changes in the environment. Response regulator proteins are critical components of these systems, directly controlling gene expression. As such, altering response regu lator function can inhibit biofilm formation. Here we focus on the highly virulent bacterium Francisella tularensis . Francisella is a Tier 1 Select Agent due to its bioterrorism potential and contains only three response regulators: QseB/PmrA, KdpE, and Bf pR. QseB and BfpR have explicitly been found to be involved in regulating the production of biofilms. We employ a structure -function based approach to understand how these response regulators are controlling the expression of biofilm formation genes and ar e developing small molecule inhibitors to disrupt response regulator function. Here we present our structural and biochemical efforts to date and explore the role of 2 -aminoimidazole based compound in impeding Francisella 1: Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishin g Title: Role of flagellar associated fliL in and host independency of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus The host -dependent (H -D) Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus , bacterium can spontaneously shift to axenic, host -independent (H -I) growth under laboratory conditions. H-I strains were shown to be able to form biofilms. The genetic elements involved in this shift are less understood. Methods In this work, 350 spontaneous H -I strains of B. bacteriovorus H-D100Sm were assessed based on biofilm -formation biofilm H-I isolates displayed predatory abilities, and enhanced biofilm -formation under low temperature (18\u00b0C), in pH ranging from 6 to 8, and with divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+). Enzymatic the biofilm -matrix comprises extracellular proteins, carbohydrates and little DNA. The genomes of H - D100Sm and of seven H -I strains from three biofilm -forming classes were sequenced. The LBFs MHI154 and MHI167 had only a single in the flagellum machinery gene fliL (Bd1076 ). FliL is associated with the stator proteins MotAB. Moreover, MHI153, one of the two MBFs, had a single mutation in motA . Both LBFs had an intact flagellum machinery but motility. Expression analysis revealed that flagellar motility, chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and prey -invasion -related genes were significantly deregulated in both LBFs. Furthermore, fliL deletion in HBF backgrounds led to reduced biofilm -formation. Lastly, fliL complementation in MHI154 restored a wild -type like H -D phenotype, while, fliL deletion from the H -D wild -type resulted in MHI154 -like phenotypes. Conclusions Taken together, these results support a central role for FliL as necessary for maintaining the H -D phenotype, and affecting initial steps of H -I biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Biofilms Publishing Title: ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE TO CIPROFLOXACIN OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS GROWN IN PLATELET CONCENTRATES Abstract Body: Introduction/background. Platelet concentrates (PCs) are manufactured to treat thrombocytopenic patients. To maintain platelet functionality in PCs, units are stored in gas -permeable containers at 22\u00b12\u00b0C under constant agitation. Staphylococcus aureus is a significant safety threa t to transfusion patients as it can be missed during screening of PCs with automated culture methods. S. aureus virulence factors include ability for biofilm formation, enhanced resistance to antibiotics, and high mutational rates. Resistance to ciprofloxa cin is due to genomic mutation of antibiotic targets, or the expression of efflux pumps such as the one encoded by the norB gene. The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a major health threat worldwide. The goal of this study is to assess the resistance of S. aureus strains and derivative mutants to ciprofloxacin in PC storage conditions. Methods/study design. S. aureus PS/BAC/169/17/W, a strain isolated from contaminated PCs, was grown in PCs and Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB). RNA was extracted for RNAseq and high -throughput transcriptome analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes in PCs in comparison to TSB, RT -qPCR was performed to validate transcriptome analyses. Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays for planktonic cells an d biofilms using ciprofloxacin were performed in TSB (37\u00b0C) and PCs (22\u00b12\u00b0C) for the PS/BAC/169/17/W isolate and two ATCC control strains. Results. The comparative transcriptome analyses revealed upregulation of genes implicated in resistance to quinolones , including genes involved in efflux pump and target modification. The efflux pump encoded by the norB gene was significantly upregulated in PCs (>1 to 4.7 -fold) and RNAseq results were validated by RT -qPCR. MBC assays for ciprofloxacin revealed increased resistance in biofilms compared to planktonic cells in PCs and TSB (64 \u00b137 fold and 284 \u00b148 fold, respectively). Additionally, planktonic cells exhibit enhanced resistance to ciprofloxacin (3.81 \u00b10.73 -fold) in PCs in comparison to TSB, whereas biofilm cell s resistance remained similar (1.00 \u00b10.05 -fold) in both media. Discussion/conclusions. Increased antibiotic resistance by S. aureus during PC storage may pose a challenge for optimal treatment of transfusion patients receiving contaminated PCs. Further res earch is needed to confirm these findings with other S. aureus isolates and different antimicrobials. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Publishing Title: COMPARATIVE TRANSCRIPTOMIC STUDY OF UNTREATED AND ANTIBIOTIC -TREATED BIOFILM CELLS REVEALS GENES INVOLVED IN BIOFILM -SPECIFIC ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN CLINICAL STRAINS OF ACINETOBACT ER BAUMANNII Abstract Body: Background; Our biofilm strain Acinetobacter baumannii ST1894 has demonstrated the highest -recorded reduction in susceptibility to antibiotics when grown in the biofilm. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic changes that occur during biofilm formation, as well as the transcriptional response of biofilm cells to antibiotics treatment. Methods; The comparative transcriptome analysis was performed between biofilm and biofilm cells tr eated with sub -inhibitory doses of imipenem and colistin. Results; The RNA sequencing analysis showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs)between mature biofilm cells and The DEGs induced by imipenem and colistinin biofilm s RND multidrug efflux pumps, fimbrialproteins, AHL synthases, and matrix synthesis proteins. The expression levels of genes encoding acinetobactin biosynthesis proteins, DNA replication, and D - and L -methionine transporte rs were downregulated when the biofilm cells were treated with imipenem and colistin. Conclusion; In this investigation, we found the antibiotic -induced or suppressed biofilm -specific genes, as well as the regulatory small RNAs responsible for antibiotic r esistance in biofilms.Targeting antibiotic -induced or repressed biofilm - specific genes represents a new paradigm in the development of innovative and effective therapeutics for biofilm Number: 2022 -A-83-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: INVASIVE NON -TYPHOIDAL SALMONELLA SEROVARS AND CHRONIC GALLBLADDER COLONIZATION Abstract Body: Background : Non -typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars have a broad host range and cause gastroenteritis in humans, but invasive NTS (iNTS) bloodstream infections have increased in the last decade, resulting in >650,000 deaths annually. Typhoidal Salmonella colonize and form biofilms on gallston es (GSs) to result in chronic, asymptomatic typhoid infection. iNTS lineages may have adapted to person -to-person transmission via identified mutations in virulence, bile resistance, and biofilm formation. As such, we sought to determine iNTS lineage capac ity for biofilm formation and the development of chronic infections via biofilms adhered to GSs in the gallbladder (GB) in our mouse model. Methods : Bacteria were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and Crystal Violet Biofilm assays were performed on bacteria diluted in TSB + 1% human bile and grown in 96 -well plates coated with cholesterol at 30\u00b0C for 4 days. RDAR morphology was assessed on YESCA agar plates with Congo Red and Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Biofilms were visualized by confocal microscopy in glass chamber coverslips without cholesterol, with bacteria labeled with the Styo9, cellulose with Calcofluor White, and curli with rabbit -curli antisera. Mice were fed a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks, infected intraperitoneally, and monitored for organ bacteria l burden and mouse survival. Results : Only L2 and UK were defective for the RDAR morphotype, which correlated both with reduced biofilm formation and the bcsG mutation. Meanwhile, ST19, L1, and L3 were RDAR positive, matching their functional bcsG gene, bu t not consistently with a functional csgD . The biofilm formation heirarchy via crystal violet was L3>ST19>UK>L1=L2. By confocal microscopy, L2 and UK had significantly less curli and cellulose. Despite having a functional bcsG , L1 also had significantly lo wer cellulose. All iNTS strains were able to colonize the mouse GB, liver, and spleen similarly, while L3 had a higher bacterial load in the GB and increased mouse lethality. Conclusions : ST313 iNTS lineages predominate clinical isolates, and these lineage s are confirmed to have variable biofilm characteristics that correlate with lineage -specific mutations. Despite variable biofilm densities, all lineages disseminate in the mouse and colonize the GB. Thus, is important for clinicians and epidemiologists in endemic settings to consider iNTS serovars as pathogens. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-87-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: In situ physical treatment of biofilms: A novel approach for catheter salvage in central -line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Abstract Body: Background: Central -line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) account for one third of all deaths from h ealthcare associated infections. Despite ongoing initiatives to adopt or adhere to evidence -based recommendations ( i.e., care bundles) and increased use of antibiotic impregnated catheters, the incidence trend for CLABSIs has remained flat or increasing. T he underlying pathophysiology is related to biofilm formation on catheter surfaces which offer constituent bacteria significant protection from host response and antimicrobial therapy. Thus, definitive therapy frequently requires removal and replacement or guidewire exchange of catheters with associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. In prior work, we have found that modest elevations in temperature, like those used for other clinical thermal therapies, (1) soften biofilms, making them more likely to be me chanically (i.e., shear) dispersed; (2) reduce the total biomass from a surface; and (3) augment antibiotic killing of constituent bacteria within a biofilm. Here we perform the first in vivo study of the use of heat and shear stress as a catheter salvage strategy in a rat model of CLABSI. Methods: Fifteen Sprague -Dawley rats were surgically instrumented with a 3Fr jugular catheter that was subsequently inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis . There were three experimental groups (N=5 each): Control - no treatment, Shear - cyclic fluid only, and Shear+Heat = cyclic shear with target biofilm temperature 45\u00b0C. Bacterial burden on the catheter and vital organs were assessed by quantitative culture and thermal injury was evaluated by histopathology. A m ultiphysics computational model of periodic flow with heat transfer was developed to characterize the time -dependent temperature distribution in the catheter and surrounding tissue. Results: The Shear and Shear+Heat groups had a statistically significant ( p<0.01) > 2 -log reduction in catheter bacterial load (median \u00b1 IQR of Shear+Heat: 3.0\u00b11.4) without increase in systemic bacterial burden. We observed evidence of thermal injury in the tissue surr ounding the catheter. However, the computational model, which had excellent agreement with experimental results, suggests that an optimal temperature and treatment regimen that removes biofilm but does not cause tissue injury is feasible. Conclusions: Further in vivo investigation combined with computational modeling are needed to specifically define the parameters of that therapeutic window. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-88-ASM -BIO a great threat to human health with the tendency to form biofilms to circumvent the activity of antimicrobials. Biofilms play significant roles in persistence and severity of bacterial infections. In Ghana, MDR KAPE pathogens are emerging within the hospital environment and it is unclear how AMR influences bacterial biofilm phenotype; It is likely associated with its genetic content, especially with plasmid - mediated colistin resistance ( mcr) markers to antibiotics (polymyxin B - PMB). There is paucity of information on how mcr genes influence biofilm formation in PMB - resistant KAPE pathogens. This study determined the phenotypic roles of mcr in biofil m formation of KAPE pathogens during antibiotic pressure. Methods: Clinical and environmental KAPE strains were profiled for biofilm formation (crystal violet assay). Cell viability was determined by colony counts (CFU/ml) after biofilm formation. AMR prof iles to conventional antibiotics (Disc diffusion) and PMB (microbroth diffusion) were determined. Mcr was screened with primer -specific PCR and the minimum biofilm inhibitory and eradication assays determined the phenotypic effect of the markers on biofilm formation. Results: KAPE strains formed biofilms - 66% strong, 25% moderate and 1% weak respectively. Average viable cells of 4 log CFU/ml after biofilm formation. More than 70% AMR level to conventional antibiotics >256 \u00b5g/ml MIC mcr-3 (25%) were detected in the strains. Biofilms increased with increase in PMB concentration in the inhibition assay. In the eradication assay, there was with mcr genes. The presence of the resistant markers increased the biofilm biomass and cells displayed viability after inhibition and eradication assay. Increasing antibiotic concentration to inhibit/eradicate biofilms may increase trea tment failure with increased AMR. Biofilm is a lifestyle adaptation with virulent tendencies, which can be compounded by the presence of resistant markers. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-89-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: The CRISPR -Cas system differentially Typhimurium Abstract Body: Background: In addition to it s promising role in providing bacterial immunity, the CRISPR -Cas system (C -C) has been implicated in alternative functions like governing virulence and bacterial physiology. Salmonella possesses a type I -E CRISPR -Cas system -II, operon. Herein we present that the CRISPR array and cas genes modulate the expression of various biofilm genes in Salmonella Typhimurium, whereby surface -attached and pellicle -biofilm formation is distinctively regulated. Method: The CRISPR -Cas mediated regulation of biofilm by S. deleting CRISPR crisprI, crisprII, and cas C positively regulates surface -attached biofilm while inhibiting pellicle biofilm formation. Results of suggest that flagellar (fliC, flgK) and curli (csgA) genes were repressed in knockout strains, causing reduced surface -attached biofilm. Conversely, the mutants displayed altered pellicle -biofilm architecture. They exhibited bacterial multilayers and a denser extracellular matrix with enhanced cellulose and lesser Curli, ergo weaker pellicles than those of the wild -type. Cellulose secretion was more in the knockout strains due to the upregul ation of bcsC, necessary for cellulose export. We determined that crp is upregulated in knockout strains, thereby inhibiting the expression of csgD and hence also of csgA and bcsA. The conflicting upregulation of bcsC, the last gene of the bcsABZC operon, could be caused by independent regulation by the CRISPR -Cas system owing to a partial match between the CRISPR - spacers and bcsC gene. The CRP -mediated regulation of the flagellar genes in the knockout strains was probably circumvented through the regulatio n of Yddx governing the availability of 28 factor that further regulates class3 flagellar genes (fliC, fljB, flgK). Additionally, the variations in the LPS profile and expression of LPS -related genes (rfaC, rfbG, rfbI) in knockout strains could also contr ibute to the altered pellicle architecture. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the C -C system facilitates surface -attached biofilm by suppressing CRP production and the flagellar genes. Further, the system represses the formation of pellicle biofilm by a ffecting the EPS deposition in the extracellular matrix, indicating that the C -C system differentially regulates surface - attached and pellicle biofilm formation by altering the expression of biofilm - associated genes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-90-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: A GENOMIC GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING BIOFILM FORMATION IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS CLINICAL ISOLATES FROM EGYPT Abstract Body: Background: Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal, yet it can cause infections ranging in severity form mild skin infections to life threatening ones, such as bacteremia. The infections become chronic and more tolerant to antibiotic treatment when the pathogen can form biofilms, making these a challenge to modern medicine. We assessed the prevalence of genes important in biofilm formation relative to isolate genotype. Methods: We performed Illumina Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of 56 clinical S. aureus isolates obtained from different specimens from patients presenting to Alexandria Main University Hospital in 2015. We analyzed the genomic data to determine the prevalence of adhesion fib. We also sought genes responsible for infection persistence, such was linked to Multi -locus sequence type (ST) and spa type (t) inferred from NGS data. Resu lts: Out of the 56 isolates, 8.9%, 19.6%, 26.8%, 14.3%, 14.3% and 16.1% carried 13, 12, 11, 10, 9 and 8 of the assessed genes, respectively. The ST -1/t127 clone represented 62.5% of the isolates carrying 12 or 13 genes, whereas 82.4% of the isolates carryi ng 8 or 9 genes belonged to ST -239/t037 clone. All ica and ebp genes were present in 100% of the isolates; sdrC, sdrD genes were detected of the isolates, respectively. clfA, fnbA were present in 71%, 70% and 64% of t he isolates, respectively. cna and fnbB were least prevalent at 25% each; isolates carrying cna were in the ST -1/t127 clone in 50% of the cases, were from pus or blood in 71.4% of the cases, and from females in 57.1% of the cases. fnbB positive isolates we re from ST -1/t127 in 78.6% of the cases, from pus in 50% of the cases, and from males in 57.1 of the cases. sdrD was only missing in ST -361 isolates. ST - 239/t037 was the most frequent clone isolated (37.5%), all of which lacked fnbB and cna; in this clone, 28.6%, 33.3% the isolates carried fnbA, clfA and clfB, respectively. None of the isolates carried eno or fib. There was no clear association between the number of genes an isolate carried and either gender or specimen type. Conclusions : There seems to be a clonal association between genes implicated in biofilm formation and persistence and isolate genotype, which necessitates stricter infection control measures to guard against the spread of infections caused by these strains. ---PAGEBR EAK--- Control Number: 2022 -A-92-ASM -BIO Topic and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: PROTEOSTASIS DISRUPTION LEADS TO COLLAPSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF Bacillus subtilis BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background All cells have evolved a protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network to ensure proteome integrity. Proteostasis imbalances affect the folding of many proteins and cause detrimental effects such as decreased cell viability and antibiotic tolerance. Thus, tar geting proteostasis has been proposed as a novel antibacterial strategy. Could targeting proteostasis also be a means to \"attack\" biofilms? By using the Gram -positive model organism Bacillus subtilis , we studied whether biofilms, as well as other phenotypic traits, are affected upon proteostasis imbalances. Methods We disrupted proteostasis by temperature increase (which causes protein misfolding and aggregation) and by single and double deletions of the dnaK and tig genes, encoding the major chaperones DnaK and Trigger factor, that both assist in protein folding. We observed biofilm architectures on solid media and used fluorescence reporters to study matrix production and motility in biofilms at a si ngle -cell level. Results Biofilm architecture was severely affected by high temperatures and by a dnaK tig double, but not single deletion. Lack of both chaperones was accompanied by a decrease in heat tolerance, swarming, and morphological defects. Struct urally aberrant biofilms contained a sub -population of cells producing increased amounts of matrix, and seemed to exhibit an abnormal spatial distribution of different cell types. Conclusions Conditions disrupting proteostasis lead to irregular biofilm str uctures with increased amounts of matrix. Antibiotics targeting proteostasis are likely to dysregulate biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- 2022 Publishing Title: Synergistic Interactions In Multispecies Biofilms Formed Associated Contaminants Abstract Body: Title: Synergistic Interactions In Multispecies Biofilms Formed By Surface - associated Dairy Microbial Contaminants Introduction Diverse bacteria on food contract surfaces exist as a result of their intricate interactions on food contact surfaces in the form of bio films. We aimed to determine the most detrimental multispecies biofilm combinations of bacteria that thrive following cleaning and disinfection (C&D) on the surface of a pasteurizer in the dairy industry. We hypothesized that some bacterial species would s timulate more biofilm formation in combination with other species due to some unknown interactions Methodology A total of 26 strains belonging to 11 species and 12 genera, recovered from the surface of dairy pasteurizers following C&D were subjected to singl e and mixed -species biofilm trials. All bacteria were divided into groups of 7 species each (3 groups) and members of each group were mixed in all possible four -species combinations (99 combinations in toto ) to find out the most problematic combinations of species. Biofilm forming abilities were determined using 96 -well polystyrene surfaces using Brain -Heart Infusion medium and later confirmed on stainless steel surfaces using 6 -well microtiter plates with skimmed milk and BHI. Results: Only two species prove d to be good biofilm formers (Microbacterium lacticum : OD 595 = 3.72) in single culture. Out of the 3 groups, 10 four -species combinations in one group showed greater biofilm biomass in mixed culture. The highest synergy (OD 595 = 14) was observed among Of these four strains, only M. lacticum was capable of forming abundant biofilm in isolation under the in vitro conditions investigated. There was a ~ 4 -fold increase in the bio film mass when all strains developed a biofilm together. Study involving cell free supernatant of the cooperating strains showed that cell viability as well as physical presence of cooperating strains were required for the observed synergy in biofilms. In a 24 -h mixed species C. indicus were found 9.5 cm2 polystyrene surface area) as 1x106, 3x106, 1.7x105, and 2.7x105, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that certain species combinations are more prevalent due to cooperative interactions, and this may be a reason behind their tolerance to C&D regimes, but their emerging properties in the above -mentioned combination has yet to be determined usin g cutting -edge technologies in our further work. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-95-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE NATIVE POPULATION BACTERIAL BIOFILM FROM INDUSTRIAL MINE WATER FOR ESTIMATION OF HEAVY METAL UPTAKE Abstract Body: A commonly used approach to neutralize or remove harmful pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated w ater is by using live microorganisms. The biota of polluted water bodies is a known source of microbiological diversity capable of bioremediation. Biofilm development boosted the capability of heavy metal absorption in a few experiments, and they chose thi s approach of bioremediation over planktonic cells because of their high tolerance advantages. The major cause of heavy metal contamination in water is the disposal of industrial waste and other hazardous trash into rivers without treatment. These bodies o f water are toxic and their association with potable water induces a variety of health issues in humans like hyperexcitability, abdominal colic, pulmonary edema and others. In this work, the water source in B Valley Government school( Karnataka, India) has been selected. It's affected by heavy metals contamination. The main objective is to isolate the microorganism from these polluted waters and treat them or the effluent generated at the same disposal site. The effectiveness of the isolates to reduce heavy metals was tested using the ICPMS technique. In present work, the heavy metal elements content Cu Pb (76.190%) were all reduced by the microorganism treatment. Following the discovery of the microorganisms, a comparative study to determine the rate and percentage of heavy metal removal from the contami nated water was conducted. Three distinct types ( planktonic cells, Bio film and Immobilized cell ) of bacterial forms were found to have comparatively good results in decreasing the heavy metal concentration. It has been observed that biofilm properties h ave given better positive results. These natural biological consortia microorganisms represent valuable tools that could be of high potential for the phytoremediation of oily seawater.

The recent resurgence of whooping cough or pertussis in many countries is largely the result of asymptomatic infections. Most individuals who contract pertussis either are asymptomatic or show very mild symptoms. We propose that biofilms enhance the survival, prolong the human carriage, and facilitate transmission of Bordetella pertussis (Bp). Compared to on abiotic surfaces, the mechanisms that drive bacteria to form biofilms, the biofilm architecture, and matrix composition and determinants in humans are ill -defined. There is a critical need to study biofilms in m odel systems that replicate the human environment. Methods/study design. Well -differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) grown at the air -liquid interface were infected with GFP - tagged wild -type Bp strain (Bp536), and three distinct mutant -derivatives (lacking production of Bps polysaccharide, filamentous hemagglutinin, and adenylate toxin). Scanning electron microscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy were utilized to analyze biofilm formation and the extracellular mat rix (ECM) composition. COMSTAT 2.0 and IMARIS were used to determine mean particle size, biomass, thickness, and roughness coefficient of the biofilms. Results. Bp formed structured biofilms on HBECs, which were covered by a matrix composed of Bps and eDNA . Multiple distinct forms of extracellular polymeric substances and biofilm cells were visualized: tripartite (consisting of biofilm cells encased in Bps and eDNA); bipartite (containing Bps and eDNA), and cell clusters, Bps, and eDNA individually. Bps and filamentous hemagglutinin were critical for Bp adherence to and biofilm formation on HBECs. Surprisingly, we found that the production of adenylate cyclase toxin did not reduce biofilm formation on HBECs, a phenotype that differs from previous reports usi ng artificial surfaces. Discussion/conclusions. We report for the first time extensive heterogeneity in the interactions of bacterial cells and ECM components during biofilm formation in a human model system. We emphasize the significance of these differen t morphological forms in contributing to Bp survival in humans. This study highlights the need to analyze host -pathogen interactions under conditions and systems resembling their natural infectious environment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-99-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Mechanisms Promoting Biofilm Disassembly and Dispersal Publishing Title: EXPLORING THE ROLE MEMBRANE VESICLES IN BIOFILM DISPERSION Abstract Body: Background: In recent years, researchers have focused on dispersion as a mechanism for biofilm control due to the increased susceptibility of dispersed cells. In Pseudomona s aeruginosa , cell -to-cell signaling, such as cis-2-decenoic acid (CDA), induces dispersion. Current research shows that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) formed by another signal, Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), are required for and produced at higher le vels during dispersion. This study explores the link between these signaling molecules and OMV production during dispersion, investigating how CDA may be acting alongside PQS, with abilities to induce OMV biogenesis, traffic itself within OMVs, and induction agent cultures through centrifugation, filtration, and ultracentrifugation. Isolated OMVs were then quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis and lowry or lip id assays. OMV production during biofilm dispersion was assessed by dispersing 5 -day biofilms grown in continuous culture with glutamate (18mM), nitric and biogenesis ability of CDA, cultures were grown to statio nary phase and treated with CDA for 2 hours. Synthetic MVs were prepared using dry film hydration of 18:1 (9 -Cis) PC (DOPC) with and without CDA. Dispersion ability of these synthetic MVs was tested on 5 -day biofilms grown in semi -batch. Dispersion was me asured by OD600 and viability counting. Results: Although all dispersion inducers showed increased OMV production suggesting a broad role for OMVs in dispersion, CDA significantly displayed the highest OMV production for all dispersion types. Furthermore, C DA showed the ability to induce OMV biogenesis. Additionally, it was observed that MVs synthesized with CDA were able to induce biofilm dispersion significantly better than CDA signal alone. Conclusions: Together, these results show the importance for OMVs during multiple types of dispersion and indicate the specific potential for CDA to mediate its own transport through OMVs during dispersion. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 mutans modulating bacterial accumulation and pathogenicity. In particular, the fungal presence can enhance S. mutans growth and biofilm virulence under sugar -rich conditions associated with severe childhood tooth -decay (dental caries). However, how C. albicans interacts with different streptococcal species within mixed -biofilms to enhance pathogenic potential remains unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of C. albicans in modulating streptococci growth and b acterial population shifts in an inter -species biofilm model as well as its impact on acidification and enamel demineralization. Methods An inter -species biofilm model was established C. albicans , and S. gordonii . betwee n S. mutans and S. gordonii was determined in the presence or absence of C. albicans to examine the fungal impact on bacterial proportions under pathogenic (with sucrose) and non -pathogenic (without sucrose) conditions. High -resolution confocal imaging, biochemical/microbiological assays, and acid production measurements were employed to analyze the biofilms. In addition, the effects of biofilms on human tooth -enamel demineralization were assessed via quantitative transverse microradiography. Results We ini tially analyzed the characteristics of dual -species ( S. mutans C. albicans ) biofilms. Our data showed that the presence of C. albicans promoted S. mutans overgrowth within biofilms and enhanced the production of extracellular glucan -matrix, resulting in accumulation of more acidogenic biofilms (vs. dual -species). In addition, the inclusion of C. albicans increased both enamel mineral loss and demineralized lesion depth despite the presence of buffering saliva. Interestingly, biofilm treatment with an antifungal agent (nystatin), effectively inhibited C. albicans growth and its influence on streptococci population shifts, reducing enamel demineralization. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that C. albicans colonization favors the overgrowth of S. mutans and enhances acidogenic biofilm accumulation resulting in increased enamel demineralization, highlighting the importance of controlling the fungal influence on biofilm pathogenic potential. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-104-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: NOVEL NANOHYBRID SYSTEM FOR TARGETING PATHOGENIC ORAL BIOFILMS IN VIVO Abstract Body: Background Dental caries is an intractable biofilm -associated disease caused by microbial interactions and dietary sugars on the host's teeth. Commensal bacteria help co ntrol opportunistic pathogens via bioactive products such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2). However, high -sugar consumption disrupts homeostasis and promotes pathogen accumulation in acidic biofilms that tooth -decay. Here, we exploit the pathological (sug ar-rich/acidic) conditions using a nanohybrid system to increase intrinsic H 2O2 production and trigger pH -dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for precise biofilm virulence targeting while promoting commensals growth. Methods Dextran -coated i ron oxide nanoparticles synthesized and covalently conjugated with glucose oxidase The catalytic activities of the DexIONP -GOx and microbial targeting were assessed treated topically twice -daily with DexIONP -GOx to mimic clinical treatment. Antibiofilm efficacy and spatial organization were as sessed via fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with biochemical/microbiological methods. The efficacy of DexIONP -GOx on caries development in vivo as well as impact on oral -gut microbiomes were evaluated using an established rodent caries model com bined with microbiome analysis. Results The DexIONP -GOx efficiently catalyzed glucose present in biofilms to increase intrinsic H 2O2, which was converted in situ by DexIONP -core with peroxidase -like activity into ROS in response to acidic pH. Notably, it s electively kills S. mutans (pathogen) without affecting S. oralis (commensal) via preferential pathogen -binding and in situ ROS generation. Furthermore, nanohybrid treatments potently reduced dental caries in a rodent model. Compared to chlorhexidine (posi tive-control), which disrupted oral microbiota diversity, the nanohybrid had significant higher efficacy without affecting soft -tissues and the oral -gut microbiomes. Conclusions The data show therapeutic precision and efficacy of a novel nanohybrid system against a biofilm -related disease in a controlled -manner activated ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-107-ASM -BIO and Function Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: PHASE SEPARATION OF EXTRACELLULAR NUCLEIC THEIR ROLE BIOFILMS Abstract Body: resident bacteria. This phenotype is attributed to extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as extracellular DNA (eDNA), polysaccharides and proteins that protect by forming viscoelastic networks. eDNA in pa rticular is important to the viscoelasticity of Pseudomonas biofilm. The viscoelasticity arises because it self -assembles into networks by forming higher order structures such as Holliday junction intermediates and Z -form DNA (Buzzo et al., 2021; Devaraj e t al., 2019), and as we recently demonstrated, G -quadruplex extracellular DNA (eDNA) (Seviour et al., 2021). Understanding these higher order structures in biofilm matrix could explain differences between the properties, organization and function of extrac ellular and intracellular DNA. Methods: Here, we investigated the structural basis for the ability of extracellular nucleic acids of P. aeruginosa to impart viscoelasticity and phase separate, specifically with regards to the nature of the extracellular nu cleic acids.To address this the following was performed:(i) Extracellular nucleic acids extraction and purification. (ii) Biochemical and biophysical analysis on the purified nucleic acid gel isolate and biofilm matrix using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR ), Circular Dichroism (CD) and bulk rheology. (iii) Single molecule FISH (smFISH) with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to visualize the localization of extracellular RNA in P. aeruginosa biofilms. Results: Purified nucleic acid extract the display ed same networked viscoelastic behaviour as biofilm. Matrix and eDNA network dissolution occurred following alkaline transesterification and resulted from extracellular RNA (eRNA) hydrolysis while eDNA preserved its chain structure. Specific eRNA were foun d by smFISH to be colocalized with and bound to eDNA fibres in model and clinical P. aeruginosa biofilms. The identity of eRNA in fibers was independent of total RNA expression. Discussion: This work suggests an extracellular function for RNA as key struct ural component of biofilms. smFISH was used for the first time to visualize the distribution of eRNA in P. aeruginosa biofilms. The increased versatility of RNA could enable DNA to form networked structures. Understanding the nature and distribution of ext racellular nucleic acids is a big step towards explaining viscoelastic P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix assembly and, along with an understanding of the nature of the eDNA and eRNA association, will inform new biofilm controls. ---PAGEBREAK Control Number: 2022 -A-118-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Biofilms, Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF SYNTHESIZED SILVER NANOPARTICLES ON BACTERIAL BIOFILMS OBTAINED FROM WATER AND POULTRY DRINKERS Abstract Body: Background Biofilms formation in a variety of inanimate surfaces are responsible for a host of diseases affecting animals and humans and their products also serve as potential zoonosis. This study investigated the presence of pathogenic bacterial biofilms in water and crevices of poultry drinkers as well as the removal of the biofilms using synthesized silver nanopart icles. Materials Drinking water and swabs of poultry drinkers' crevices were collected from ten poultry houses. Isolation and characterization of bacterial isolates were carried out using standard microbiological techniques. Identified bacterial isolates w ere screened for biofilm potential using the complimentary and confirmatory techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out on bacterial biofilm formers using the agar well diffusion method. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) was synthesized using funga l isolate from the water samples. Synthesized AgNP was confirmed by physical change in colour, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV -Vis spectroscopy. Potential of AgNP in the removal of bacterial biofilms were evaluated. Results Sixty bacterial isolates were identified from both the water and poultry drinkers. The predominant bacterial isolates were: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis . Complimentary test revealed that fifteen isolates were biofilm formers while the confirmatory test showed only 9 isolates to be biofilm formers. Klebsiella pnemoniae showed highest resistance to most of the antibiotics while Bacillus subtilis was the most susceptible isolate. AgNP prevented the growth of the bacterial biofilms with hi ghest inhibition zone of 30mm. Conclusion This study revealed the presence of biofilms and antibiotic resistance bacterial isolates in water and crevices of poultry drinkers' and as well showed the potential of AgNP in removal of biofilms. Hence, good drin king water and frequent washing of poultry drinkers are recommended. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-123-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Attachment Publishing Title: WspA domains influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm Authors: Lindsey O'Neal , Zehui Suo, Caroline S. Harwood, Matthew R. Parsek Background: To establish chronic infection, bacteria build biofilm communities on a suitable surface ins ide the host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a pathogen involved in chronic cystic fibrosis airway infections, uses a signal transduction pathway called Wsp to sense surfaces. In clinical and environmental isolates, the gene encoding the Wsp receptor, wspA , is fr equently mutated to generate a locked -on Wsp signaling system resulting in constitutively high levels of c -di-GMP. While we currently understand the genetic changes that result in a hyperactive Wsp system, we do not understand how these mutations alter Wsp protein structures, protein interactions, and signaling. This work examines the role of Wsp proteins, individual protein domains, and commonly isolated wsp mutations in biofilm formation and Wsp signaling. Methods: We systemically engineered deletions of each wsp gene and evaluated its role in biofilm formation using confocal microscopy. Additionally, we generated both random and targeted mutations in the wspA gene and assessed how these mutant alleles influence P. aeruginosa biofilm formation using confoc al microscopy, crystal violet assays, and colony morphology for each of the mutant strains. To understand how loss of wsp genes or mutant alleles influence protein interactions, we used bacterial two hybrid assays to map protein interactions within the Wsp signal transduction cascade. Results: We found that loss or or wspC in a wspF background eliminates biofilm formation. Furthermore, we identified point mutations within the ligand binding and HAMP domains of wspA that result in The WspA, are essential for biofilm formation. Additionally, mutagenesis studies revealed that mutations in the WspA ligand binding domain and HAMP domains result in a locked on Wsp system which suggests these domains are essential for proper signaling. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-129-ASM -BIO Topic Title: Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus Colonization on Plastics Influenced by Temperature and Strain Variability Abstract Body: Background: Marine bacteria often exist in biofilms as mi crobial communities enclosed in a protective, self -secreted matrix and attached to surfaces, like plastic. Growing concerns exist regarding plastics traveling over distances and acting as potential vectors of pathogenic Vibrio , especially in a warming clim ate. It has been generalized that Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus attach to plastic surfaces. Different isolate strains of these Vibrios exist having different growth and biofilm forming properties. We hypothesized that Vibrio strains may res pond differently to environmental factors and affect their colonization of marine plastics. Methods: Coupons [glass (GL), low -density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), were placed in 24 -well non -treated microplates with modified seawater yeast extract (MSYE) broth supplemented with calcium chloride. Clinical and environmental isolates were inoculated and incubated at 25, 30, 35\u00b0C with low shaking (125 rpm) for 24h to form biofilms. Biofilms were detected per coupon using crystal violet staining with optical density determined at 570nm. Biofilms were removed from coupons using a vortex and sonication method, and colony forming units to estimate cell densities per coupon were determined using MSYE agar plates. Hydrophobicity was determined by p -xylene microbial adherence assays. Results: All strains of both species attached to GL and all plastics at 25, 30 and 35\u00b0C. As a species, V. parahaemolyticus overall produced significantly more biofilm and had significantly greater cell densities on LDPE (p < 0.05) and PP ( p < 0.05) compared to GL. However, temperature did not significantly influence V. parahaemolyticus biofilm biomass (30\u00b0 p = 0.33; 35\u00b0C p or cell densities (30\u00b0C p = 0.63; 35\u00b0C p = 0.61). As a species, V. vulnificus overall produced significantly more biofilm biomass, but not cells, on LDPE ( p < 0.05) and PS ( p < 0.05) compared to GL and only biofilm biomass was significantly enhanced at 25\u00b0C compared to 30\u00b0 ( p < 0.001) and 35\u00b0C ( p < 0.001). However, biofilm biomass and cell densities greatly varied among individual strains of both species at 25, 30 and 35\u00b0C. All stra ins were found to be hydrophobic at 25, 30 and 35\u00b0C. Conclusions: Different strains of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus can rapidly form biofilms with high cell densities on different plastic types. However, this study suggests the colonization proces s is highly variable and depends on species, strain, and plastic type, especially under different temperatures. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-137-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: MORPHOLOGY AND Biofilms are viscoelastic materials produced by microbial life that are able to withstand a great variety of external stresses, due to the properties of the extracellular, polymeric matrix. Rheology has been used to identify the key factors contributing to the biofilm polymeric matrix strength in bacterial species such as Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These rheological methods have been applied mainly to bacterial biofilms and despite an increase in fungal infections , the current knowledge on the factors implicated in fungal biofilm strength is still limited. To bring a new understanding on how changes in the fungal cell wall and matrix properties affect mechanical properties of their biofilms, we investigated the pri ncipal opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans . Methods We report the mechanical properties of C. albicans biofilms using parallel plate rheometry. Different C. albicans mutant strains were tested to evaluate the effect of cell wall compositio n and extracellular matrix on viscoelastic properties. To complement the rheological results, confocal microscopy was used to evaluate changes in the biofilms' cell morphology. Results Small amplitude oscillatory tests revealed a strong solid -like behavior for all C. albicans biofilms, with the viscoelastic moduli nearly independent of frequency when grown under hyphae -inducing conditions. Changes in the chitin synthase CHS8 resulted in a smoother morphology, with less hyphae on the microscopic level but did not impact the mechanical properties. However, mutations on the membrane protein FKS1 and the gene pmr1 implicated in the production of the matrix mannan resulted in biofilms with a lower yield stress compared to the wild type. Conclusion By combining rheology with confocal analysis, we were able to relate microscopic changes in the cell morphology to the viscoelastic behavior of fungal b iofilms. We apply the results to address how cell morphology and extracellular matrix composition affect the mechanical strength and persistence of albicans biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: BACTERIAL MOBBING: TARGETING AND COMMUNICATION IN Pseudomonas aeruginosa COMMUNAL ATTACK BEHAVIOR TOWARDS PHAGOCYTIC PREDATORS Abstract Body: Pseudomonas aeruginosa attacks a variety of organisms including phagocytic predators. Attacking large specialized bacterivores is a risky proposition, especially when using type three secretion system, requiring a direct contact with the target cell. Because bacterial populations tend to be orders of magnitude larger than predator populations, bacteria can rely on numerical superiority in most situations. To assert this advantage a sufficient number of individuals must be recruited and attack should be synchronized in order to overwhelm predator target handling capacity and injecting it with a large dose of virulents. To test these ideas we employ a method allowing measurement of bacterial adhesion kinetics in seconds - minutes timescale in the presence of various predators and effectors. The pseudomonas quinolone signal, a quorum sensing signal unique to P. aeruginosa , is involved in regulation of this behavior, causing immediate increase in surface adhesion in the presence of predators. Targeting individual predators relies on predator pr oduced nitric oxide NO synthase reduces bacterial adhesion to it, while introduction of NO produce changes in adhesion kinetics within two minutes, similar to the behavior seen in the presence of predators. Behavioral reaction to the pseudomonas quinolone signal seems a natural adaptation - quorum sensing signaling is a fast process and can be tied to fast downstream effectors, offering bacteria selective benefits in competitive and dynamic pre dation scenarios. Reaction to predator produced NO offers a new insight to the reaction of P. aeruginosa and other microbial species to sub inhibitory concentrations of this radical. Dispersal of P. aeruginosa biofilms in reaction to nM concentrations resu lts from biofilm bacteria recruitment into the planktonic population in order to participate in mobbing behavior, reacting to the edge of the NO gradient diffusing from the phagosomes of a distant predator. Adhesion behavior observed in the presence of \u00b5M on NO is the last step of this attack sequence, as bacteria react to NO concentrations found microns away from the surface of an active phagocyte, initiating adhesion and deployment of the type three secretion system. Put together these findings paint a fast and dynamic outlook of bacterial existence, different from the protracted dance of population growth and gene expression, a perspective enforced by the limitation of our tools and the different scale of human and bacterial existence. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-144-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: SINGLE -CELL MANIPULATION OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA USING A MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM Abstract Body: Background Microfluidic systems are robust and versatile tools that utilize the properties of fluid mechanics to govern fluid flow at the microscale. The precise and consistent control afforded by using droplet -based microfluidics allows for microbial appl ications such as particle encapsulation. Novel techniques like this to encapsulate and further study the physiology and interactions between bacterial cells are needed to understand clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginos a (Pa). The interactions between individuals and groups of Pa cells are of significant interest due to their highly virulent behavior and persistence in immunocompromised patients. Thus, droplet -based microfluidics presents an opportunity to isolate Pa and observe the impact of environmental changes at the microscale. Methods A flow -focusing microfluidic device was used to manipulate the relative discontinuous (deionized water or fluorescently labeled gelatin solution with Pa cells) and continuous (mineral oil and surfactant solution) phase flow rates to control droplet generation and diameter (m). Droplets were transferred to incubation chip microwells (e.g., 20 L) and observed using confocal microscopy in the presence and absence of antibiotics. Pa cells were then isolated and single cell RNA -sequencing performed using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' RNA -sequencing platform to generate transcriptomic profiles of each droplet population. Results Here a microfluidic system has been optimized to generat e monodisperse water/gelatin -in-oil droplets and encapsulate Pa in fluorescently labeled gelatin droplets. Droplets were treated with antibiotics and developing heterogeneity in response to antibiotic treatment was observed using confocal microscopy and at the transcriptomic level, utilizing single -cell RNA -sequencing. Differentially regulated genes were identified using bioinformatic approaches, both in the presence and absence of tobramycin and colistin. Conclusions Among other high -resolution methodologi es to encapsulate aggregates and single -cells, droplet - based microfluidics is a promising tool to isolate and observe the development of aggregates from single bacterial cells in designed spatial confirmations. Here we show how this microfluidic system can be used as a high -resolution tool that allows for Pa isolation on a single -cell level in biocompatible materials and coupled with single cell genomics to understand bacterial response to antibiotic treatment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-145-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: PHAGE MOBILITY IN BIOFILMS TRANSFORMS THE FITNESS LANDSCAPE OF GENERALIST -SPECIALIST COMPETITIONS Abstract Body: Background Phage host -range evolution has been studied for many decades establishing many important empirical and theoretical results. However , theory examining this evolution in biofilms is less well understood. Here, we examine phage generalist - specialist competition in biofilm simulations to explain host specificity evolution in spatially structured biofilm environments. Methods We use an age nt-based simulation framework that models bacteria growing in a biofilm environment. Individuals are attached to a solid surface and nutrients diffuse from the top of the system toward the growing bacteria. When the biofilm reaches a specified height, phag es are added to the system. We examine two host bacterial species and two phage types: generalist and specialist. In this study we focus on parameters which have fitness costs for the generalist phage: incubation time, burst size, and adsorption rate, as w ell as a property determining how readily the phage diffuses through biomass, termed impedance. Results We examined the cumulative number of infections of the generalist vs the specialist as a measure of fitness (infection frequency), as well as the surviv al of the biofilm. We find that in low impedance scenarios, where phage are able to easily diffuse through the biomass, the biofilm is nearly always eliminated. The infection frequency in those cases depends primarily on the cost for the generalist: either incubation time or burst size. At low and very high costs, the generalist outcompetes the specialist. The high cost results are due to having slowed down the infection sufficiently such that the biofilm is able to produce more biomass for generalists to i nfect. At higher impedance, phage have difficulty penetrating the biofilm. Here we replicate a previously observed effect where bacteria form a physical barrier, where the specialist phage is largely prevented from accessing its host population. Additional ly in high impedance, we see that if the burst size of the generalist is low, then that phage population will be unable to sustain an infection. The outcome of the competition depends primarily on the generalist burst size at high impedance. Conclusions The bacterial property controlling phage movement in a biofilm, impedance, can dramatically shift the entire fitness landscape of competitive interactions among phage specialists and generalists. Impedance does so by modifying the relative importance of phag e burst size, incubation period, and adsorption rate. Body: Background Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid maintain a symbiotic relationship in nature. This symbiosis is dependent on V. fischeri 's ability to form a biofilm, disperse from that biofilm, and luminesce within the inner crypts of the squid. In culture, optimal luminesc ence by V. fischeri requires LitR, a transcription factor that positively regulates the light -producing lux operon. Conversely, we discovered that LitR negatively impacts biofilm phenotypes, but how it mechanistically controls biofilm formation is unknown. Methods/Results To address this, we examined whether the litR mutant biofilm depends on either of two critical components of the V. fischeri biofilm, SYP and cellulose polysaccharides. Deletion of a structural gene for either SYP or cellulose polysacchar ide, sypQ or bcsA , respectively, disrupted the litR mutant pellicle under static conditions. However, in shaking conditions, the mutant biofilm was due primarily to cellulose. -galactosidase assays corroborated these the litR mutant had increas ed sypA and bcsQ transcription when grown without shaking, but only increased bcsQ transcription when grown with shaking. To determine how LitR affects syp regulation, we focused on a trio of sensor kinases, SypF, RscS, and HahK, that tightly regulate syp transcription through the response regulator SypG. SypF is considered the central sensor kinase because its histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) domain is critical for SypG activation. We constructed a litR sypF double mutant and found that the litR mutan t pellicle depends on the presence of SypF for its cohesiveness as the double mutant no longer formed a sticky pellicle. Inclusion of the SypF HPT domain into the litR sypF mutant restored pellicle formation, suggesting that the phenotype of the litR mutant is dependent on RscS or HahK. Indeed, the litR rscS mutant had reduced pellicle formation whereas the litR hahK mutant retained its pellicle, suggesting that the litR mutant relies on the presence of RscS and not HahK for its enhanced pellicle. Conclusions Future work will address whether LitR could potentially inhibit rscS transcription to decrease phosphorylation of the SypF HPT domain to negatively affect biofilm formation. Further understanding of LitR, and how V. fischeri utilizes a single transcription factor to regulate its many processes, will allow us to better understand the V. fischeri -squid symbiosis. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-152-ASM 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: SPECTROSCOPIC DETECTION OF WEAK AND HARD -TO-DETECT LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES AND USE Abstract Body: Backg round Bacterial biofilms are complex microbial systems formed by the cells and extracellular matrixes [1]. The monospecies biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes is known to have a low biomass due to poor matrix formation ability on most substrates [2]. O n the other hand, the cells are reported to attach on surfaces more firmly than other food -borne pathogens, possessing a higher disinfection resistance [3].Classical detection techniques are time -consuming (culturing) or require toxic stains or use of spec ialized microscopy protocols with costly fluorescent agents. They have different limitations and are inconvenient to be used in food industry. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast and nondestructive dry -lab technique and have shown to possess a great application possibility in biological systems including biofilms [4 -7]Methods A novel biofilm formation protocol as a simulation of industrial conditions was used in this study. The following parameters were used to discover the formation conditions of L. monocytogenes biofilms by this system: types of strain, broth, surface (stainless steel and high density polyethylene), incubation time, stressed or optimal and static or dynamic conditions, dilution of medium and inoculum, temperature. Some samples with v isible and not visible biofilms were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The spectra of the samples in the visible and NIR range (350 -2500 nm) were recorded. Afterwards, they were stained with crystal violet to locate the biofilms on the surfaces. The optical density of crystal violet dye and biofilm mixture was measured to assess the effects of parameters on biofilm formation characteristics of L. monocytogenes . Spectral data was coupled with multivariate analysis to develop the analytic al detection method. Results Normal incubation time between 7 -9 days, shaking, stainless steel substrate, extended incubation on dry surface were found to improve stained visibility and biofilm strength. In case of moderate samples, classification algorithm s performed well (up to 100% accuracy) with the detection conditions like the previous work with other species. To apply the algorithm on the samples that show very slight biofilm presence with CLSM and none with crystal violet staining, method settings had to be specifically tailored and eventually successful model validation results (83% accuracy) were obtained. Conclusions Near infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics was found as a successful method for detection of biofilms including the weak one s. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-163-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: NON -DESTRUCTIVE, IN -SITU DETERMINATION OF BIOFILM GROWTH DYNAMICS IN REAL TIME Abstract Body: Background. Biofilms, biofouling and biocorrosion are common problems in industry and medical fields resulting in significant costs. To minimize the effects of biofilms, development of effective biocidal treatments and antimicrobial surfaces require quantitative biofi lm growth studies to determine treatment efficiency. To minimize costs and logistics, non -destructive sampling of surfaces for biofilm growth dynamics allows for real -time monitoring over extended time frames. Remote, non -contact sensors offer potential to monitor relative biofilm density and physiological activity over time. Methods. This in -situ approach utilized electrodes positioned above the biofilm under non -growth conditions as well as in growing bacterial suspensions analyzed with electrochemical im pedance spectrometry (EIS) to compare results from biofilms to that of bacterial suspensions. EIS (conducted at frequencies of 100 kHz to 10 mHz) provides label free monitoring and delivers specific information regarding numerous multifaceted parameters th at change throughout the cellular growth cycle, is insensitive to non -living matter and reflects factors related to cell viability, membrane integrity, and the overall metabolic state of microbes. The use of equivalent circuits provided another means of da ta analysis that correlated to cellular energy levels over time. Results. With electrodes positioned above biofilms in previous studies, communication between working and counter electrodes detected biofilms by the tangential flow of signals through biofil ms. This approach was used to detect the presence or absence of microbes at cell densities <1.2 \u00b5g protein /cm2. Here we took the next step and demonstrated (with growing cell suspensions) that EIS provides real time data of microbial activity correlated to respirometry and conventional growth analyses and compare to biofilms. Following electrochemical cleaning of electrodes before each analysis, electrochemical activity was linked with physiological status in batch cultures during glucose utilization and repeated during glucose supplementation. Rapid increases in cellular activity due to glucose supplementation wer e detected in real time. Conclusions. EIS provided a means of monitoring microbial physiological status, in -situ and in real time without the need for sample acquisition. Future studies will focus on these combined results for real time, in -situ, quantitat ive monitoring of actively growing biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK Number: 2022 -A-184-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Biofilms, Consortia and Publishing Title: SHORT -TERM CO -EVOLUTION OF LACTOCOCCUS LACTIS AND LEUCONOSTOC MESENTEROIDES IN BIOFILM ACCELERATES VARIANT EMERGENCE AND COEXISTENCE Abstract Body: Background In nature, bacteria coexist in polymicrobial complex communities dominated by interspecies interactions.

Spatially structured and heterogenous biofilms enable niche differentiation and local interplay, supporting greater diversity.

Cultures were passaged every 24 h by either dilution (planktonic) or bead -transfer (biofilm) for 16 days. Evolved variants and a ncestors were compared in their growth parameters, competitiveness in reestablished co - cultures (qPCR), and protein abundances. Results Evolution experiments displayed that, in planktonic co -cultures, L. mesenteroides predominated and tended to outcompete L. lactis, but in biofilms, both species coexisted. Comparative analyses of L. lactis biofilm variants revealed an increased culture yield, biofilm formation, and prolonged generation time exclusively in co -evolved variants.Furthermore, the performance of e volved L. lactis variants when co -cultured with L. mesenteroides . Biofilm assays showed a higher proportion of evolved L. lactis strains than their ancestor when co - cultivated with ancestral L. mesenteroides . Interestingly, in co -cultures wit h evolved L. mesenteroides, L. lactis was strongly reduced. However, evolved L. lactis strains could persist better than their ancestor in these conditions.Combined, this shows that coexistence in biofilms selects for variants adapted to the biofilm life cycle and the other member's presence, reflected in their enhanced persistence and prevalence in the mixed biofilm.Additional proteomic analyses of mono - and co - cultures are still in progress. Still, preliminary data on global proteomes of mono - and co -evol ved L. lactis variants suggest that their proteomes were more distinguishable by the selected ancestor (lineage) than the cultivation method. Conclusions This study emphasizes spatially structured biofilms' importance in maintaining species diversity, as in terspecies interactions and the biofilm setting were conditional for the emergence of novel phenotypic variants. ---PAGEBREAK Pathways, Consequences and Control Publishing Title: Selection for - and impact of - evolved genotypic variants in multispecies biofilms Abstract Body: Background In nature, microorganisms live in complex interacting communities with spatial structure, such as biofilms, which facilitates local co -existence of different genotypes. Here, we examined the effects of spatiotemporal dynamics on evolution of adapted varian ts over a short timespan to identify links between interspecies interactions in biofilms and selection pressure for new phenotypes possibly impacting the structure and composition of the biofilm matrix. Methods Co-isolated environmental species Bacillus thuringiensis , Pseudomonas laurentiana and Pseudomonas brenneri were used for a short -term co -evolution experiment in both a static cultivation system, allowing for biofilm development, and conditions favoring pla nktonic growth, to examine the impact of selection pressure on coexistence in the presence and absence of spatial structure. Evolved strains were phenotypically characterized and sequenced to identify mutated genes and altered functions. Further, to better understand the selection pressure, the matrix composition was characterized to examine the impact of the novel variants when present. The matrix characterization was performed by proteomic analysis of extracted samples and by screening with 78 different, fluorescent lectins. Results We show that new phenotypic variants of B. thuringiensis with altered spore development were more abundant when grown in communities compared to monospecies B. thuringiensis cultures. The increased abundance of the new variants , when coexisting with the other species, was found in both biofilm and planktonic setting. For one specific lectin, we observed differential binding by the wildtype B. thurigiensis strain in dual -species vs. mono -species cultures, which was not the case f or the variants. Based on the full genome sequencing data, changes were linked to spore development. Conclusions The results reveal that interspecies interactions directly affect extracellular traits of coexisting species in a biofilm. Furthermore, this st udy demonstrates that coexistence can influence the selection pressure and emergence of new variants that directly affect the biofilm organization. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-197-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: The Efficacy Of Antioxidant -Antibiotic Combination Therapy On Achromobacter Xylosoxidans In A Cystic Lung Cell Model Abstract Body: Background : Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder causing dysfunctional ion transport resulting in accumulation of viscous mucus that fosters chronic bacterial biofilm -associated infection in the airways. Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an increasingly prevalent CF pathogen associated with lung disease in CF [1]. Current research lacks an understanding of effective treatment options for chronic biofilm - forming Achromobacter spp. infection of human lung [2]. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic or additive effect of an antiox idant -antibiotic combination + bronchial epithelial cell (BEAS -2B) model for CF infection. Methods : This study investigated synergy between the commonly used CF antibiotics ciprofloxacin (0.5-128 \u00b5g/mL) and colistin (0.5 -128 antioxidant N -acetylcysteine at neutralised pH (NAC neutral ) (0.5 - 16.3 mg/mL) against three Achromobacter sp. strains grown as planktonic and biofilm cultures [4]. Potential synergism was screened for using checkerboard assays, from which fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) were calculated. Synergistic (FICI 0.5) and additive (0.5 > FICI 1) combinations were tested on 48 hour old mature biofilms and intracellular infectio n using invasion assays. Results for colony forming units (CFU/mL) were derived from growth in an (ASMDM -1) + -Eagle - Medium (DMEM). Results : We found evidence of synergy between NAC neutral , ciprofloxacin and colistin in FICI analysis in planktonic culture, but these results were not corroborated in biofilm -based testing. While many combinations did not correlate with FICI analysis, CFU/mL reductions of log 10 1-2 were still observed in clinic al isolates compared to controls in the ASMDM+BEAS -2B cell model. Conclusions : Our findings suggest that while planktonic FICI analysis may not directly translate to biofilm growth, the combinations investigated were still able to significantly reduce bact erial loads in the BEAS2B -artificial sputum model compared to the components alone and the untreated controls. Future directions include refining synergy testing to function in biofilms and determine the detailed mechanism of action of NAC to better predic t synergy in other pathogenic species. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-198-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Signals and Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: STAPHYLOCOCCAL ENTEROTOXINS CONTRIBUTE TO BIOFILM FORMATION BY STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS IN PLATELET CONCENTRATES Abstract Body: Background: Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus in platelet concentrates (PCs) is one of the major causes of missed detection of this bacterium during routine PC screening with automated culture systems. This heightens the chances of false -negative screening transfusions and pre -disposes PC transfusion recipients to elevated risk of sepsis. Moreover, S. aureus can secrete exotoxins, including staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) during PC storage. In this study, we investigated the effect of enterotoxins in biofilm formation by S. aureus in PCs. Methods: Comparative transcriptome analyses of S. aureus strains grown in Trypticase Soya Broth (TSB) and PCs were performed to determine biofilm and SE gene expressions. SE protein production was verified in S. aureus spiked TSB and PC cultures by Western blotting. CRISPR -Cas9 technology was employed to generate SE types G and H deletion mutants, whose growth and biofilm formation in TSB and PCs were analysed in comparison to the wildtype. Results: RNAseq data revealed no differential expression for key biofilm genes whereas SE genes were significantly upregulated (>1 to 6.7 folds) in PCs compared to TSB. Additionally, Western blotting assays confirmed presence of SE proteins in contaminated PC cultures. Remarkably, increased growth was observed for S. aureus derivati ve SE mutants, while their formed biofilms were significantly reduced ( -6.8 to -2.4 folds) compared to wildtype strain in PCs and TSB. Discussion/Conclusion : The principal reasons for failed S. aureus detection during PC screening is its slow growth and bi ofilm formation. Interestingly, accelerated growth and decreased biofilm formation by mutants imply contribution of enterotoxins to growth retardation while promoting biofilm formation. This is possibly linked to accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum sensi ng system that is affected by cell density, and which indirectly regulates expression of enterotoxin and biofilm -related genes positively. This study highlights involvement of SEs in S. aureus growth dynamics as well as biofilm production, thus plausibly c ontributing to overall missed detection of S. aureus during PC screening with culture methods. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-199-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: Peptide -Responsive in Marine Bacteria Alteromonas -Inducing Peptides and Implications for Copiotrophic Lifestyle Abstract Body: Background The ocean's biological pump is a major pathway of CO2 sequestration, driven by aggregation and sinking of particulate organic matter. While bacteria appear to be important players in the aggregation and decomposition of marine particles, ther e is little experimental evidence for how these different activities may be coupled through the behaviors of the specific bacteria involved. Methods We have found that Alteromonas sp. 4B03, isolated from a chitin enrichment culture of coastal marine bacter ia, forms cellular and particle -associated aggregates resembling marine snow in the lab. An OD -based method has been developed to simultaneously measure growth and aggregation in pure cultures while varying media conditions. The aggregation behavior of A. macleodii 27126T, the type strain for this genus for which genetic tools have recently been established, was also examined. Results A survey of culture conditions revealed a variety of nutrient - dependent aggregation phenotypes in Alteromonas sp. 4B03. This strain exhibits rapid aggregation amid a transition to fast growth when transferred to peptide - containing media such as peptone, tryptone, or marine broth. Notably, A. macleodii 27126T exhibits a very similar peptide -responsive aggregation behavior. Syste matic variation of culture conditions indicates that peptone contains a specific fraction that triggers exceptionally strong aggregation in 4B03 but is also rapidly consumed. Spent media experiments confirm this hypothesis. Media comparison indicates that small peptides (2 -5 AAs) are sufficient to trigger aggregation, and this is further supported by preliminary metabolomics. Comparison of synthesized peptides of defined length helps to further narrow down the peptide size with strongest triggering activity . Ongoing work is aimed at determining the molecular basis of peptide -responsive aggregation in using forward and reverse genetics approaches, as well as evaluating the benefit of aggregation for the ability of Alteromonas spp. to grow on particle -bound pr oteins. Conclusion These findings help explain the prevalence of Alteromonas spp. on marine particles and the give us new insight into the strategies used by these strains to direct their aggregation behavior in response to relevant environmental cues. Gen etic investigation has the promise to reveal the mechanistic basis of peptide -responsive aggregation in Alteromonas spp.; which may be novel or have features shared with more well - studied biofilm -forming marine bacteria, such as members of the genus Vibrio. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-201-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: Outer Membrane Lipoprotein and -Barrel Protein Complexes Mediate Surface Sensing in Escherichia coli Abstract Body: The envelope is not only a barrier that protects bacteria from the environment but is also a site for the transduction of signals critical for bacterial colonization and pathogenesis. The Cpx envelope stress response is a major adaptive system of Gram -nega tive bacteria that senses and mitigates stresses impacting envelope protein homeostasis. Past studies have suggested that the Cpx response may be important for biofilm growth, but its precise role remains to be fully characterized. The outer membrane (OM) lipoprotein NlpE activates the Cpx response during including hydrophobic glass beads and undifferentiated Caco -2 epithelial cells, further implicating the Cpx response in growth on surfaces. However, the mechanisms of NlpE signaling from the OM remain largely mysterious. In this study, we investigate how NlpE mediates surface signaling by characterizing its interacting partner proteins in the OM and determining the structural components of NlpE which are required for signaling. We report a novel interaction between NlpE and the major OM protein OmpA by co -immunoprecipitation and crosslinking assays. Both NlpE and OmpA are required to activate the Cpx response in surface -adhered cells, suggesting these proteins coopera te to sense signals relevant to biofilm growth. Furthermore, NlpE activates the Cpx response upon OmpA overexpression, and this signal is transduced via the NlpE C -terminal domain. Mutating residues involved in OmpA dimerization or cell wall binding abolis hes NlpE -dependent activation of the Cpx response during OmpA overexpression, suggesting that regulation of the physical properties of the envelope is key for NlpE signaling from the OM. Overall, our findings suggest that NlpE is a versatile envelope senso r that takes advantage of its structure, localization, and cooperation with other envelope proteins to play a key role in allowing E. coli to sense surface attachment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-205-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: ELECTROCHEMICAL QUANTIFICATION OF P. AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS, AND REDUCTION USING EXTRACTED BACTERIAL SECONDARY METABOLITES Abstract Body: Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa has shown resistance to nearly all classes of antibiotics, and is routinely responsible for implant infections, with these biofilms often undetected until the patient develops bacteraemia or the implant is explanted. Therefore, new technologies to detect biofi lms earlier are needed, as well as new antibiofilm -metabolites to inhibit formation and target established biofilms. Such techniques as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) which measure biofilm formation on an ele ctrode and detect redox -active secondary metabolites in the growth media above the electrode, respectively. Methods In this study, we highlight the application of EIS and SWV in a 96 -well plate format on carbon electrodes. These methods can be applied to r eal-time monitoring of biofilm formation and were validated using crystal violet (CV) staining of P. aeruginosa (PA14 & LESB58) biofilms at a concentration range (OD600 0.05 -1). We have also isolated 11 actinomycetes from Scottish marine sediments and extr acted their metabolites from liquid culture. These metabolite extracts have been quantified for their ability to prevent P. aeruginosa biofilm formation using EIS, SWV and CV. Results amplitude (\u00b5A) in SWV measurements indicates plankt onic cell growth, and a decrease in impedance (Z) indicates biofilm formation. SWV peak amplitudes at - 0.35 V at 0, 2 and 4 hours, gave 6.47, 18.27 and 29.61 A respectively for OD600 1 LESB58 biofilms, and 0.63, 3.97 and 9.64 A for PA14 biofilms at the s ame time points and starting concentration, and directly correlated to pyocyanin production. Whilst those exposed to 1 mg/mL of metabolite extract showed no significant change. Over 4 hours, impedance (Z) decreased from 3680 to 1797, and 3775 to 849 for PA 14 and LESB58 biofilms respectively, and this can likely be attributed to P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, as there was no significant difference in EIS measurements over the 4 hours for the media only control (3782 at 0 hours, and 3378 at 4 hours). Conclu sions Our results show that we have successfully extracted an antibiofilm agent which is active against P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, and this can be quantified using electrochemical approaches. Next, P. aeruginosa biofilms will be formed on medically r elevant materials and the ability of the metabolite extracts to reduce these biofilms will be quantified using and SWV. ---PAGEBREAK Number: 2022 -A-239-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: CITRATE STIMULATES A NOVEL ADHERENCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains extensive regulatory networks which allow the bacterium to establish chronic infections in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. Adherence and metabolic diversity provide advantages to P. aeruginosa persisting in the lung environment, esp ecially when competing against other microbes. Citrate is a metabolite produced by many microbes and is commonly found in the lungs. Citrate can serve as a carbon source, signal, or chelator for P. aeruginosa. Previous studies have shown that the CbrAB two - component system is required for citrate catabolism, and we have found CbrAB also regulates a novel adherence phenotype in the presence of citrate. Methods: Screening of a P. aeruginosa kinase mutant library and known biofilm mutants identified genes and conditions required for citrate -induced adherence. Results: We have shown that citrate stimulates adherence to surfaces in several P. aeruginosa strains and clinical isolates. This adherence requires CbrAB but is independent of canonical biofilm factors including type IV pili, flagella, and pel matrix components. We have also found that addition of Mg2+ or buffering the pH to prevent citrate that citrate affects P. aeruginosa as both a chelator and a signal, stimulating surface adherence through CbrAB. CbrAB activity relieves translational repression by Crc, known as Car bon Catabolite Repression (CCR). We are undertaking further genetic and proteomic screening to identify downstream CCR targets which may mediate citrate -induced adherence. As Mg2+ intercalates between LPS molecules on the cell surface to stabilize the oute r membrane, our data also suggest that effects on the outer membrane contribute to citrate -induced adherence. This work reveals a novel adherence strategy conserved across several P. aeruginosa strains which may be relevant in diverse polymicrobial context s. ---PAGEBREAK --- Publishing Title: THE MASTER REGULATOR FleQ POST -TRANSCRIPTIONALY REGULATES THE fluorescens (Pf) relies on the secretion and rep eat-in-toxin (RTX) adhesins LapA and MapA at the cell surface. Previous studies have determined that surface display of the adhesins is post -translationally regulated by the cyclic -di-GMP receptor LapD and the protease LapG, but little is known about the m echanisms that regulate adhesin production. Here, we identify the master regulator FleQ as a protein that post -transcriptionally regulates the production of LapA and MapA. Methods: A markerless deletion of the fleQ gene was made in Pf and assessed for its ability to form a biofilm both in static 96 -well polyvinyl chloride plates and in microfluidic devices. Expression of the lap and map genes were determined by qRT - PCR and production of the respective adhesins was determined by whole cell lysate western blo t analysis, while cell surface localization was determined by dot blot analysis. Additional factors contributing to FleQ - dependent lapA and mapA regulation were identified via transposon mutagenesis of the fleQ mutant and screening of these fleQ-derivati ves for candidates that formed more biofilm. Arbitrary PCR and sequencing were used on the candidates to map the transposon integration site. Results: A strain lacking FleQ forms a poor biofilm in static assays and only forms a monolayer of attached cells in microfluidic devices. The loss of FleQ leads to modest increases in lapA and mapA expression, but a marked reduction in the production of these adhesins as well as reduced localization at the cell surface. The mutagenic screen revealed that transposon i nsertion into lapG , the flhAF operon, and the gacS promoter leads to increased biofilm formation in a fleQ strain. Conclusions: Together, our data suggest a post -transcriptional mechanism by which FleQ regulates biofilm formation through the modulation of LapA and MapA production, which may be mediated by modulation of the Gac/Rsm Pathway. It additionally suggests a novel role for the flagellar regulators FlhA and FlhF -A-252-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: CHEMOTAXIS SYSTEM REGULATED FLAGELLAR ROTATION, BUT NOT CHEMOTAXIS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE BIOFILM FORMATION OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI Abstract Body: Background : Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria attached to surfaces. A key first step of biofilm formation is surface attachment, a step well known to be promoted by motility. Motility is regulated by the chemotaxis system, and thus chemotaxis signaling is proposed to contribute to biofilm initiation by promoting the interactions between the cell and surface. However, whether this idea accounts for the full role of chemotaxis's contribution to biofilm initiation is not clear. In this work, we explored the roles the chemotaxis system plays during biofilm formation in Helicobacter pylori , which is one kind of human gram -negative pathogen that forms biofilms to resist multiple antibiotics. Methods : H. pylori biofilms were formed w ith standard media (Brucella Broth with 10% heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum) in static conditions. Biofilms were quantified using crystal violet. Chemotaxis was monitored using the soft -agar plate assay. Results : We determined biofilm formation for mut ants lacking each chemotaxis signaling protein. Compared to wild type, , biomass, while others ( cheZ and cheV3 ) formed lower amounts. Epistasis analysis supported that CheY, the downs tream chemotaxis signaling protein, is also downstream for biofilm initiation. However, instead of chemotaxis behavior, our data suggested that a key signal was flagellar rotational direction: Mutants that in elevated biofilm initiation, while mutants that caused the opposite, clockwise (CW) - biased, resulted in decreased biofilm initiation. This idea we supported with increased biofilm biomass from fliM alleles that are chemotaxis -independent but locked in a CCW mode. Conclusions : We show that chemotaxis proteins in H. pylori play varying roles in biofilm initiation, with some promoting and others inhibiting. Our data suggest that the chemotaxis system, but not chemotaxis behavior, is involved in biofilm regulation. The roles of chemotaxis proteins on biofilm formation are strongly correlated with their functions on flagellar rotation. Our model is thus that flagellar rotational direction is a signal that regulates biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-255-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Biofilms, Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: EFFECTS OF CHELATED COPPER TREATMENT ON THE MICROBIOME AND RESISTOME OF THE BIOFILM OF AN AQUACULTURE TANK Abstract Body: Background - In aquaculture systems, parasitic infections and excessive algal growth are prevented and/or treated by chelated copper. Although studies have shown that copper treatment can encourage the growth of microorganisms with metal resistance genes (MRGs), few of these studies have explored the effects on the environmental microbiome or on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This is an important gap since MRGs and ARGs are often co -selected due to metal efflux systems also extruding the antibiotics from the cell. MRGs and ARGs can also be located next to each other on mobile genetic elements capable of being transferred between bac teria. Determining whether this co -selection occurs in the aquaculture environment is important since increases in ARGs or opportunistic pathogens due to copper treatment can have negative implications on fish health. Methods - This study was an opportunis tic sampling of a tank (12,870L) containing twenty Florida pompano ( Trachinotus carolinus) after a mortality with confirmed parasitic biofilm samples were taken for metagenomic shotgun sequencing during four time points (one before co pper treatment, and three after treatment was completed). Reads -based analysis was conducted with the AMR++ pipeline which performs quality control, aligns sequences to a database of prokaryotic resistance genes (MegaRes) to determine the resistome, and determines taxonomic diversity with Kraken2/Bracken. Results - Beta diversity was significantly different between the 11 Days Pre -Treatment and 50 Days Post - Treatment samples in both the microbiome and resistome. MRG and ARG abundances increased over time an d were significantly positively correlated. MRG and ARG richness also increased over time, with no MRGs detected before treatment started. Conclusions - Although the initial point of copper treatment is to remove problematic organisms, our research shows i t can also potentially can cause an increase in the richness and abundance of MRGs and ARGs. This potentially creates another problem if any of these organisms infect the already stressed fish. It also suggests the biofilm can act as a reservoir for resist ance genes well after copper treatment has ended. The results from this study are the first step in understanding the environmental microbiome and resistome risks associated with copper treatment and provide potential guidelines to farmers regarding their potential effects on fish health. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-261-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: REAL -TIME SENSING OF BIOFILM Abstract Body: Background Biofilms are complex microbial communities encased in a protective polymeric substance attached to surfaces making biofilms highly resistant to removal. Each year, trillions of dollars are spent on biofilm related problems. Therefore, accurate and sensitiv e systems that promptly detect unwanted biofilm growth are needed. One technique that can monitor biofilm growth in situ is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We have developed microfabricated EIS sensors that are small, low-cost, and amendable for monitoring biofilms across many applications. Methods EIS sensors were microfabricated using deposition, lithography, and wet etching processes. GFP Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown in a microfluidic flow - cell for 24 -36 hrs. Real time biofilm growth and treatment (i.e., chlorine, Lonza Proxel GXL biocide, and Furanone C -30 quorum sensing using EIS and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CL SM). Results EIS sensors were able to detect initial attachment of cells, biofilm growth, and biofilm removal (Figure 1). During initial attachment of cells and biofilm growth, impedance decreased until reaching a plateau, suggesting the formation of a bio film monolayer. Conversely, impedance increased while treating biofilm monolayers, implying detachment and removal of biofilm from the sensor surfaces. CLSM images confirmed the presence of biofilm followed by removal of biofilm after treatments. Discussio n/Conclusion Biofilms are more resilient to treatments compared to planktonic cells, making biofilm removal challenging. However, microfabricated EIS sensors can detect biofilm in the early stages of growth, signaling the optimal time to intervene. Overall , microfabricated EIS sensors provide exciting opportunities to monitor biofilm growth in situ. Future studies will focus on deployment of sensors into modern infrastructure susceptible to biofilm growth. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-265-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: CHARACTERIZATION OF A HOMOLOGOUS CPX ENVELOPE STRESS RESPONSE SYSTEM IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PAO1 Abstract Body: Background: Gram -negative bacteria monitor the integrity of their cell envelope, a multicompartmental dynamic structure of inner and outer m embranes, through envelope stress response systems (ESRs). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa , envelope stress resulting from cell contact with surfaces is hypothesized to act as an inducing signal for biofilm formation, a critical stage in virulence. While multipl e ESRs have been described in this pathogen, the Cpx two -component system, known for linking envelope stress to biofilm formation and other virulence -related processes in other Gram -negative pathogens, is relatively uncharacterized in P. aeruginosa -membrane of response regulator CpxR (CpxR -P). CpxS is subject to regulation by periplasmic adaptor protein CpxP and outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE. The Cpx system is de -repressed when these proteins are degraded or mislocalized during envelope stress, allowing CpxR -P to direct expression of genes involved in envelope homeostasis and various virulence -related functions. Methods: We conducted a comparative ana lysis of Cpx loci among - Proteobacteria, and mutants of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 Cpx system for susceptibility to cell envelope stressors. PAO1 lacks an nlpE homolog, the PAO1 is comprised of a more elabora te operon structure than its E. coli counterpart including two putative inner membrane proteins of unknown function. A cpxR- mutant of PAO1 exhibits decreased tolerance of stress conditions that impact periplasmic protein folding. Conversely, individual mu tants of all other members of the putative Cpx system exhibit increased stress tolerance, potentially due to intracellular accumulation of activated CpxR -P. PAO1 Cpx does not impact tolerance of stress compounds targeting the bacterial outer membrane, sugg esting this system functions specifically in inner membrane and/or periplasmic stress signaling. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings support a model in which multiple Cpx adaptor proteins modulate activity of the PAO1 CpxSR system, potentially providing a functional substitute for the lack of a homologous regulatory lipoprotein NlpE. Future studies will assess the role of Cpx in PAO1 biofilm dynamics, i.e. surface sensing and/or maintenance of cellular homeostasis within the biofilm matrix. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-268-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: INVESTIGATING NATIVE MUCIN INHIBITION Body: Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is proficient at establishing chronic infections due to its ability to form biofilms. This process typically begins with surface attachment. In a host, these surfaces are usually covered in a layer of mucus. The main structural component of mucus, the glycoprotein mucin, can prevent surface attachment of P. aeruginosa . Viscosity mimics do not exhibit this phenotype. Mucin -glycans, but not the individual monosaccharides, can additionally inhibit attachment, al l suggesting that P. aeruginosa is sensing and responding to specific biochemical mucin structures. Methods: Micro -channel slides are aeruginosa PAO1 with or without mucin for 1 -5 h to allow for attachment. Unattached bacteria were washed away, and the remaining bacteria were microscopically viewed and quantified in ImageJ for individual cell counts. Results: Attachment inhibition occurred with nati vely purified mucin but not industrial, which instead promoted surface colonization. Motility mutants exposed to mucin have lowered levels of attachment and a flagella pili double mutant had full abolishment of attachment. A hyper -piliated mutant had incre ased attachment in mucin relative to wild type. Mutants associated with other aspects of attachment, such as elevated secondary messengers, rhamnolipid production, Las quorum sensing, and chemotaxis were similarly inhibited by mucin. Transient mucin exposu re surprisingly retained the attachment inhibition phenotype in P. aeruginosa . Pre -coating a surface with mucin did not prevent attachment. Lab adapted strains of P. aeruginosa presented varied levels of attachment in the presence of mucin, with PAK being the most resistant and PA103 the most sensitive. Conclusions: Our work thus far suggests mucin inhibits surface attachment in a mechanism independent of those primarily associated with adhesion. Transient mucin exposure still reduces P. aeruginosa attachmen t, suggesting that mucin causes P. aeruginosa to become surface adverse or blind in some unknown manner. Mucin also does not appear to physically prevent P. aeruginosa surface localization surface, as pre -coating with mucin did not inhibit attachment. Furt hermore, the varied attachment levels of lab adapted strains indicate a conserved mechanism of mucin attachment inhibition. Completion of this study will further our understanding of innate host defenses in preventing biofilm establishment. ---PAGEB REAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-271-ASM 1: Publishing Title: CHANGES IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM MATRIX COMPOSITION DUE TO GROWTH Abstract Body: Background : Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disease that causes the accumulation of sticky mucus in the airways, which is thought to impede the eradication of P. aeruginosa and promote its biofilm formation. Biofilms are bacterial communities that are encased in an extracellular matrix, which promotes bacterial aggregation and protects the biofilm bacteria from antibiotics, enzymatic digestion, and host immune responses. P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix can contain extracellular DNA (eDNA), various proteins, and three different types of exopolysaccharide (EPS): alginate, Pel, and Psl. As CF progresses, anaerobic microenvironments in the airways arise over time, which is thought to be due to the sticky mu cus and biofilms. Some past studies showed that P. aeruginosa form biofilms in anaerobic conditions. However, whether P. aeruginosa assembles biofilms with different matrix components relative to aerobic biofilms is unknown. As such, we sought to identify any changes in P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix composition with growth at varying oxygen levels. Methods: Initially, we examined differences in biofilm formation in aerobic versus anaerobic growth conditions using several different biofilms culturing systems, including static biofilms, colony biofilms, and flowcell biofilms. Additionally, we analyzed matrix composition using solid -state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To do so, we first analyzed P. aeruginosa biofilms with known EPS and the resulting \"standa rd spectra\" will be compared to biofilms grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to assess any changes in the matrix composition. Results: In line with observations by others, we observed that P. aeruginosa forms biofilms under both aerobic and anaero bic growth conditions, and in some cases, forms more robust biofilms when grown anaerobically. Our NMR data will be useful to pinpoint any specific changes in matrix composition due to anaerobic growth, including changes in types or amounts of EPS. Conclus ions: Determining biofilm matrix changes due to changes in the environmental oxygen levels will help us better understand how P. aeruginosa survives during the progression of CF. Our study will also provide a platform for investigating co -cultures of P. ae ruginosa biofilms with other Number: 2022 -A-279-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: SURFACE SENSING IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA : ACTIVATION OF THE PIL -CHP SYSTEM THROUGH TYPE IV PILI ACTIVITY Abstract Body: BACKGROUND: The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas flagellum and type -IV pili (T4P) in order to sense and traverse surfaces. T4P function by pulling the cell across a surface through rounds of pilus extension, surface binding and retra ction that is powered by extension (PilB) and retraction (PilT/PilU) hexameric ATPases. Pa cells that have engaged a surface and perform the T4P -dependent surface motility, known as twitching, increase production of the second messenger cAMP through the Pi l-Chp pathway. This rise in cAMP allows cells and their progeny to become better adapted for surface attachment and activates virulence pathways through the cAMP -binding transcription factor Vfr. While many studies have focused on mechanisms of T4P twitchi ng and identifying members of the Pil -Chp pathway, it is not yet known how the surface contact signal is relayed from T4P to the Pil -Chp system to increase cAMP. Here we identify a novel binding partner of the protein at the start of the Pil -Chp pathway, P ilJ, and screen for mutants that affect cAMP levels as well as PilJ binding and biofilm formation. METHODS: To determine binding partners between T4P proteins and PilJ, we used the bacterial adenylate cyclase two hybrid (B2H) system. Mutagenic PCR was performed on the pilT sequence and mutant alleles were screened for loss of interaction with PilJ using the B2H system and then functionally screened using a twitch assay. pilT alleles producing stable PilT proteins were incorporated into their native locus us ing homologous recombination. A fluorescent cAMP reporter was then incorporated into the chromosome using the mini -ctx system. Intracellular cAMP levels were monitored using fluorescence microscopy over the first 7 hours of biofilm formation. RESULTS: Our initial B2H screen identified PilT, a retraction motor, as being able to interact with PilJ. We have identified one stable allele of pilT that no longer interact with PilJ but is still able to perform twitching motility. Expression of this allele and other stable versions of PilT resulted in different levels of cAMP during biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the role T4P motors play not only in pili extension and retraction but also in signal transduction. The retraction motor PilT is essen tial for pilus function and surface sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and our work is beginning to elucidate the mechanism by which PilT function leads to cAMP production. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-280-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: MECHANISM OF BIOFILM FORMATION IN DESULFOVIBRIO VULGARIS HILDENBOROUGH Abstract Body: Background Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenbor ough ( DvH) are a major cause of microbially induced corrosion of steel pipelines impeding industrial processes. The mechanism(s) driving biofilm formation by these microbes are not yet known. Early evidence implicates a large adhesin, DvhA, to be involved in biofilm formation by DvH. dvhA and its neighboring genes code for proteins similar to the components of the Lap system that regulates biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens and DvhD are regulating DvhA localization, and hence, biofilm formation in this sulfate reducer. Methods : To assess the mechanisms of biofilm regulation by Lap - like components of DvH, we heterologously expressed the protease DvhG in Pfl lacking the native regulatory system ( lapGlapD ). In this background, we also swapped critical amino acid residues in LapA known to be targeted by the LapG protease with the predicted target sequence of DvhA. We used crystal violet a ssays to probe for biofilm proficiency and dot blots on intact cells and supernatants to probe for the localization of HA -tagged adhesin. Results : Our results indicate that upon DvhG expression, cells become deficient in biofilm formation compared to the empty vector control. Additionally, dot blot analysis of DvhG expressing cells revealed higher amounts of adhesin associated with the supernatant than the cell surface, compared to the empty vector control where most of the adhesin remained surface -associate d. These results imply that DvhG can process the DvhA target sequence, releasing the adhesin into the supernatant and rendering the cells incompetent for biofilm formation. We also observed reduced processing activity of DvhG towards LapA and LapG towards DvhA, indicating specificity -DvhG interaction. Additionally, contrary to periplasmic LapG, DvhG is predicted to be inner membrane bound. DvhG loses its proteolytic activity upon removal of the transmembrane helix, indicating a key difference from t he Lap system. Conclusion : In this work, we were able to analyze a part of the DvH Lap -like system in non - native Pfl. While the two systems do not appear to effectively crosstalk, DvhG seems to be functionally similar to LapG in efficiently processing its adhesin DvhA and thereby formation. ---PAGEBREAK 2022 -A-283-ASM -BIO Natural Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: BIOFILM AGGREGATES IN BIOSOLIDS CAN BE USED FOR GROUNDWATER BIOREMEDIATION Abstract Body: Background Biosolids are waste products formed during wastewater treatment processes and they are made up of aggregates containing microorganisms. These biofilms were formed during anaerobic digestion which encourages the growth of anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Pre sence of chlorinated contaminants in wastewater causes the presence of dechlorinating bacteria in biofilm aggregates, which can end up in biosolids. In this study, biofilm aggregates in biosolids were applied for bioremediation of trichloroethene (TCE), wh ich is an organic contaminant that can cause serious health issues. To enhance dechlorination in a TCE -contaminated site, a trench was constructed using biosolids containing biofilm of archaea and bacteria. Limestone and biochar were also added to increase buffer and sorptive capacity of the soil. Methods Bench -scaled studies were conducted with a mixture of biosolids and limestone and based on the results, the trench was installed in the site. Nine months after installation of the trench, the biofilm that was formed on trench -filling material was compared with the biofilm formed on soil particles from up and downgradient the trench, using molecular biology methods. Results An assessment of the microbial community of the biofilms on biosolids particles indic ated the presence of methanogens, acetogens, and dechlorinating bacteria in these samples. Bench -scaled studies with a mixture of biosolids and limestone confirmed the presence and activity of methanogens. Although some studies believe that high methanogen esis can adversely affect dechlorination, in this study, dechlorination was not adversely affected by the activity of methanogens. Instead, acetogens and methanogens can produce co -factors and enzymes which are vital in complete TCE dechlorination. Nine mo nths after installation of the trench, TCE levels decreased significantly downgradient from the trench. Soil samples collected from the site indicated that the microbial biofilm formed on soil particles is significantly affected by the biosolids in the tre nch filling material. The number of obligate dechlorinating bacteria has also increased within the trench, when compared to the samples from upgradient the trench (p <0.05). Conclusion Using biosolids as cheap and nutritious waste material in bioremediatio n of TCE - contaminated groundwater has shown to be successful in encouraging dechlorinating bacteria biofilm formation on soil particles and decreasing TCE levels. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-293-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: Distinct roles of multicopy flagellin genes in motility and adhesion to stainless -steel surface in a metal corrosive marine bacterium Abstract Body: [Background] Biofilm for mation on metal surfaces is thought to be one factor that accelerates microbiologically influenced corrosion. We isolated Marisediminitalea sp. FT01 from natural seawater as a strong biofilm former on the metal surface, which causes metal corrosion. Howeve r, how FT01 establishes biofilm formation on the metal surface and its genetic determinants are unclear. Surface attachment is the first step in biofilm formation, involving swimming motility driven by flagella. We found that FT01 possesses 5 copies of flagellin genes ( fliC1 -5) in the genome and decided to investigate the relationship between the multicopy flagellin genes and adhesion to stainless steel surfaces. [Method] We observed the flagella structure of each strain by TEM. For the swimming motility ass ay, we inoculated the bacterial cell suspension to artificial seawater medium (ASWM) soft agar plates and incubated them at 30\u00b0C for a day. To examine the initial attachment to metal surfaces, we cultured FT01 with stainless steel coupon in ASWM for 1 h. C ells attached to the surface were observed by CLSM. [Result] FT01 possesses a single polar flagellum. We constructed multiple flagellin mutants to determine which flagellin genes are responsible for flagellum structure and motility. fliC1 fliC4 displayed s ignificantly shorter flagella than WT loss of swimming motility. In contrast, fliC3 and fliC5 showed no difference in flagellar length and motility, indicating that the main structural components of FT01 flagellum are FliC1 and FliC4 flagellins. Sinc e active motility is required for adherence, we compared the surface attachment in the flagellin mutants. We found that the cell attachment to stainless steel surfaces was suppressed in not only fliC1 fliC4 but also fliC3 and fliC5 . These suggest that F liC3 and FliC5, which are not required for flagellum structure and motility, are necessary to attach metal surfaces. [Conclusion] These data show that multiple flagellins have distinct roles in FT01, even though FliC1 -5 proteins share more than 40% amino ac id residues. Since FT01 can acquire iron ions essential for proliferation via metal corrosion, biofilm formation on stainless steel surfaces is one of the survival strategies in an iron - depleted marine environment. The redundancy of the flagellin genes is thought to be important for active attachment and biofilm formation to the metal of FT01 in the ocean. ---PAGEBREAK --- ASSOCIATED GROWTH IN PSEUDOMONAS Abstract Body: Background: The traditional model of biofilm growth suggests that bacterial communities grow in an extracellular matrix until a mass dispersion event occurs at maturity. Newer models suggest that biofilm communities have larger and more immediate impacts on bacterial growth outside of biofilm limits. Here, we report on observed continual shedding of bacteria from biofilms when grown under continuous culture conditions. Methods: Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were studied using a new experimental platform for g rowing biofilms in chemostats, allowing any shed or sloughed cells to migrate into media to grow planktonically, settle and seed secondary biofilms, or be washed out as waste. Two dilution rates were employed to investigate whether rate and availability of media impacted population size. The sizes of planktonic populations were quantified daily, and biofilm and total secondary biofilm populations were quantified at 96 hours. A cocktail of homoserine lactones was also used to assess potential biofilm stabili zation. Microscopy was used to analyze planktonic populations. Results: The addition of a homoserine lactone cocktail did not significantly affect the size of planktonic or biofilm populations at any dilution rate, although the cocktail did lower variabili ty in biofilm population size at both low and high dilution rates. Population size of biofilm -associated and planktonic populations were weakly negatively correlated (= -0.58). While total biomass was highly variable between trials across all conditions, planktonic population size grew quickly (within 24 hrs) and was rapidly replenished even when washout rate was high. Microscopy analysis indicated that while some sloughed bits of biofilm were present in the media, the majority of cells were growing as individuals. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the traditional model of biofilms as self-contained and growing to maturity before dispersal is incomplete. We found rapid and steady shedding of individual cells alongside sloughing. Once separated, planktonic and biofilm -associated cells responded independently to environmental conditions, suggesting that these populations, although clonal, undergo independent population -level dynamics. Secondary biofilm production was also largely constant. Taken together, our results highlight the difficulty inherent in attempting to clear both planktonic and biofilm populations using singular approaches, suggesting that new approaches are necessary if we are to control biofilm/planktonic dynamics. ---PAGEBREAK --- 4-ETHOXYBENZOIC ACID (4EB) ATTENUATES BIOFILM FORMATION AND VIRULENCE FACTOR PRODUCTION IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ATCC 6538 Abstract Body: Staphylococcus aureus is a leading causative agent in diverse infections including surgical site wounds, prosthetic j oint infections, and nosocomial bacteremia. S. aureus infections are frequently multidrug resistant and their ability to form biofilms is a confounding factor. There is a need for anti -biofilm, anti -pathogenic agents that control S. aureus biofilm infectio ns with reduced selection for antibiotic resistance. Using crystal violet staining and viable plate counts, we determined that ethanol extracts from Rhamnus prinoides (gesho), a traditional East African medicinal plant, reduced biofilm formation with limit ed inhibition of planktonic growth. Analysis by GC -MS identified ethyl -4-ethoxybenzoic acid as an active agent. A structure -activity analysis determined that 0.8 mg/mL 4 -ethoxybenzoic acid (4EB) inhibited biofilm formation by 90 percent relative to untreat ed controls with 15 percent reduction in the specific growth rate. 4EB also potentiated vancomycin activity and decreased alpha -hemolysis. The mechanism of activity of 4EB is presently unknown. An analysis of the impact of 4EB on exoprotein concentrations by SDS -PAGE found that 0.8 mg/mL reduced Hla (alpha -hemolysin) and SplB/C (serine protease) concentration by nearly 60 percent. RT -qPCR analysis determined a reduction of 110 -fold decrease in transcriptional levels of hla and 90 -fold decrease in splC, enco ding alpha -hemolysin and serine protease C, respectively. The relationship between the measured changes in exoprotein concentrations and the impact of 4EB on S. aureus biofilm formation are a subject of current inquiry. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-354-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Biofilms, Consortia and Publishing Title: ICE NUCLEATION ACTIVITY OF MICROPLASTICS Abstract Body: Background Changes in the global climate have drawn attention to incorporating atmospheric ice nucleating particles (INPs) into global climate models, as ice crystals in clouds are important components of the hydrological cycle. Research suggests that fibrous micropl astics are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, yet their ability to nucleate ice and potential impact on clouds and climate are unknown. At temperatures warmer than -38\u00b0C freezing is not spontaneous and occurs with INPs through a process known as heterogeneous i ce nucleation. The present study focused on the ice -nucleating ability of fibers from clothing textiles (CT). Methods Clothing textiles were collected from common manufactured apparel and consisted of acrylic, polyester, nylon, or combinations of cotton, p olyester, viscose, and elastane, as well as dryer lint. Subsamples of each were placed into filtered MQ water and subject to ice nucleation assays. Three assays were performed: (i) untreated CTs, (ii) CTs treated with lysozyme, and (iii) CTs treated with l ysozyme and 30% hydrogen peroxide, to determine any biological and organically induced effects on ice nucleation associated with CTs, respectively. CTs were stained with Syto -9 and imaged on a confocal scanning laser microscope to visualize biofilm. Result s Results from ice nucleation assays showed that clothing textiles were effective ice nucleators active from -6 to -12\u00b0C, similar to common biological ice nucleators. However, subsequent lysozyme and hydrogen peroxide digestion stripped the ice nucleation properties of clothing textiles, indicating that ice nucleation was biological in origin. Microscopy confirmed the presence of biofilm on clothing textiles. Discussion Given the ubiquity of microplastics in the atmosphere, biological fragments attached to fibers could contribute significantly to atmospheric ice nucleation. Research linked with field observations is needed to understand the nature of the biofilm attached to CTs and quantify microplastic associated INPs water. ---PAGEBREAK 2022 -A-381-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Natural Title: Factors effecting interactions are known to impact GC interactions with the host, including changes in antibiotic sensitivity, resistance to host serum factors, and GC adherence to host cells. However, it is unknown how variation in gonococcal sur face structures impacts these interactions, or the role of variation of individual surface components plays in the overall disease process. Microcolony formation can be differentially initiated by simple changes in the biophysical properties of the bacteri a, such as changes in lectin -like interactions between Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and opacity proteins (Opa) or pilin retractile ability. To begin to dissect these complex interactions, we used a series of variants derived from MS11 expressing single phase invariable Opa protein, characterized pilin sequences and/or defined LOS structures. We assessed how various structural combinations impact their ability to form aggregates or to produce biofilms. Cells expressing pili aggregated better and produced more r obust biofilms, as measured visually by microscopy and biochemically by crystal violet staining. We compare the surface charge of GC that expressed the same LOS but lacked Opa or pilin expression and isogenic GC expressing a single phase -invariant Opa and found that Opa expression significantly reduced the overall negative charge on the bacterial surface, with OpaE having the least change in surface charge (2.9 mV) and OpaJ having the most (13 mV). This increase in positive charge appeared to alter how GC initiated microcolony formation and biofilm structure. MS11 that expressed different pili all aggregated in a similar fashion no matter if they expressed Opa or not. However, expression of different variants of Opa altered the overall organization of the bi ofilm. Truncations in LOS reduced the amount of biomass achieved. Overall, these data highlight the importance of pili in initiating GC -GC interaction and suggest that phase variation of Opa and LOS regulate the interaction, contributing to infection progr ession. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-385-ASM Biofilms, Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: Hydrogel -Based Synthetic Soil Aggregates Co -Encapsulating Solid Carbon Substrates and Bacteria Abstract Body: Introduction : Soil matrix complexity hinders mechanistically examining how the spatial distribution of substrates and microbial communities in soil aggregates drives environmentally relevant carbon fluxes. Synthetic soil aggregates embedding solid carbon substrates an d carbon cycling communities in hydrogels could provide a powerful method to bridge this gap. Here, we demonstrate this concept by encapsulating a cellulose degrader with particulate cellulose as sole carbon substrate. Methods: Ruminiclostridium cellulolyt icum was encapsulated with mm PEGDMA hydrogel beads using an anaerobic, millifluidic set -up. Fermentation products were monitored as activity indicator during incubation. Spatial organization of substrates and cells in the hydrogels were visualized by staining 10 m thick hydrogel sections with SYBR Green (cells) and Calcofluor White (cellulose and PEGDMA). Results: Hydrogel encapsulation extended lag times by 7 days compared to conventional growth but did n ot affect fermentation rates or yields. Cells were evenly distributed in the hydrogel, while addition of microfibrillated cellulose was necessary to achieve good distribution of particulate cellulose. After incubation, cells were observed both alone in the hydrogel matrix as well as attached to degraded cellulose particles (Figure). Conclusions: Here, we provide proof of concept for an experimental model that embeds defined solid carbon substrates with carbon cycling microbes. This approach can be used to in vestigate spatial organization of populations around solid substrates in diffusion -limited environments. Additionally, the compatibility of this experimental model with microscopic techniques could help connect single cells to larger -scale processes, a cri tical challenge for environmental sciences. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-388-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Initiating Contact: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Attachment Publishing Title: Substrate stiffness impacts colony formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa by modulating twitching motility Abstract Body: Background Biofilms stem from the surface colonizatio n of a wide variety of substrates encountered by bacteria, from living tissues to inert materials. A wealth of environmental parameters impacts bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Here we explore the role of substrate rigidity on early biofilm develo pment in Pseudomonas polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogel substrates, which rigidity can be tuned from ~1 to 100 kPa. These surfaces were next embedded in microfluidic channels, and in situ imaging of bacteria adhe ring to PAA hydrogels was performed in time -lapse experiments, under constant flow of medium, in order to study early colony formation by P. aeruginosa PAO1. Results Our experiments show that there is a strong dependence of colony phenotype on the underlyi ng substrate stiffness. On kPa), P. assembles into dense hemispherical colonies, while on stiffer substrates it forms thin spread -out colonies (figure: colonies imaged after 6h). By tracking individual bacteria, we show that this difference in bacterial organization derives from a difference in bacterial surface motility. We propose a simple mechanistic model for the function of type -4 pili (T4P) on a deformable substrate, that accounts for the observed results. Finally, we sh ow that this modulation of twitching motility by substrate stiffness can have far -reaching consequences for the biofilm, e.g. regarding EPS distribution or gene regulation. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that substrate rigidity directly impacts the twitching behavior of bacteria, which in turn strongly influences the way individuals assemble into colonies. This process allows P. aeruginosa to immediately respond to the substrate's mechanical properties upon adhesion, with important consequences for earl y colony morphology and biofilm development. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-391-ASM Topic 1: Natural Biofilms, Consortia and Simulations Publishing Title: EVALUATION OF BACTERIAL BIOFILM FROM SURFACE AND BOREHOLE WATER SAMPLES Abstract Body: BACKGROUND The evaluation of bacterial biofilms from surface and borehole water samples was conducted. Water samples were collected from 10 selected water sources that are of economic importance; aseptically using sterile containers and transported to the laboratory. STUDY DESIGN The collected water samples were allowed to stand in a secluded environment for four (4) weeks at 270C \u00b1 20C for biofilm generation. Loop full 350C \u00b1 20C for 24 hours. RESULTS The as Stenotrophomonas pavanii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeruginosa . The results of the physico chemical analysis showed qualities within the WHO standard, except samples from Nkisi River and Ori Stream with BOD slightly higher than 4mg/l. Evaluation of the bacterial isolates showed that the organisms exhibited growth in wide range of substrates(carb ohydrates), temperature and different salt concentrations, and in medium containing metal salts. Statistical analysis showed that for Stenotrophomonas pavanii, FeCl 2 is negatively correlated with pH with significant difference of -.998 at P< 0.05 and there is correlation between CaCl 2 and NaCl at P<0.01. The water samples were treated with two different concentrations of chlorine; 3mg/L and 5mg/L to evaluate the effect on biofilm formation. No biofilm formation was observed on the containers with water samp les treated with 5mg/L of chlorine concentration while biofilm formation was observed on 3mg/L concentration of chlorine. Antibiotics sensitivity test result showed sensitivity of all the bacterial isolates to chloramphenicol. DISCUSSION/ CONCLUSION: A hea lth survey with questionnaire on the families and individuals using the selected borehole and surface water showed that 80% of the survey group observed biofilm on their water storage containers. Exactly 60% never washed their containers and 70% of the gro up suffers from different illnesses ranging from typhoid cholera, dysentery to gastroenteritis, meanwhile about 20% were indifferent about diseases. The results revealed that the ten water sources could generate bacterial biofilms, consisting of bacteria, which could be pathogenic to humans and suggest that higher concentrations of chlorine (5mg/L) could be used in water treatment to prevent biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Poster Session I I Abstracts Control Number: 2022 -A-71-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Publishing Title: CHARACTERIZING BIOFILM -RELATED GENES DURING PELLICLE WITH AEROMONAS AUSTRALIENSIS Abstract Body: Background: Pellicles are biofilms that form at the air -liquid interface. Pellicle formation has been well studied among gram -positive bacteria, but not in gram - negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or its cocultures with other bacterial species. We demonstrated that specific strains of E. coli formed pellicles in single culture, when cultured with Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and E. coli O157:H7 but not with Aeromonas australiensis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify whether the presence/absence of unique genes was responsible for pellicle formation and investigate the impact of cell -cell communication on dual -species pellicle formation. Method: This study applied comparative genomics to identify the presence/absence of unique genes in pellicle form ation, and mutational and transcriptome analyses to investigate the expression levels of multiple biofilm - related genes during pellicle formation under different conditions. Result: Comparative genomics indicated that pellicle forming strains do not harbor unique genes relative to in non -pellicle forming strains; however, the expression level of biofilm -related genes differed, especially for the genes encoding curli. Further, the regulatory region of curli biosynthesis is phylogenetically different among pe llicle and non -pellicle forming E. coli strains. The deletion of either bcsG , or the region upstream of the curli operon abolished pellicle formation. Besides, the addition of quorum sensing molecules (C 4-HSL), synthesized by Aeromonas species, to pellicle forming strains abolished pellicle formation and implied a role of quorum sensing on pellicle formation. The deletion of autoinducer receptor sdiA in E. coli did not restore pellicle formation when cocultured with A. australiensis but modulated expression level of genes for curli and cellulose biosynthesis, resulting in a thinner layer of pellicle. Conclusion: This study identified genetic determinants for pellicle formation. Pellicle formation was not associated with the presence of unique genes that are absent in other strains but relates to differential regulation of core genes. Pellicle formation in E. coli was abolished in presence of A. australiensis and this partially relates to production and sensing of acyl -homoserine lactones. These results facili tate better understanding of the mechanisms for pellicle formation in E. coli and related organisms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-81-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: CELLULAR ARRANGEMENT ALONG GRADIENTS INFLUENCES NUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION IN PSEUDOMONAS BIOFILMS Abstract : Oxygen and nutrient gradients form in biofilms due to competing rates of diffusion and consumption. Colony and pellicle biofilms formed by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa subzones arranged along these gradients. We have elucidated mechanisms and microenvironmental conditions that contribute to biofilm structural organization. Methods/Results : We use thin sectioning and confocal microscopy to visualize the distinct multicellular patterning P. aeruginosa biofilm su bzones, using light -sheet microscopy. Mature biofilms show two subzones: an ordered zone at the biofilm -air interface, within which cells are arranged in vertical striations, and a disordered zone at the biofilm -nutrient interface in which cells are randomly oriented. This arrangement can be modulated by changing the availability of oxygen or nutrients. We also use molecular approaches to identify genes contributing to cellular arrangement and have found that mutants lacking pili, w hich are appendages involved in movement and attachment, form biofilms with dense bundles of cells. We have identified additional factors contributing to arrangement by screening mutants deficient in individual sigma factors and quorum -sensing regulators. A mutant lacking the sigma factor RpoN, known to be involved in the regulation of pilus production, phenocopies the pilus -null mutant. Furthermore, the removal of two quorum - sensing regulators eliminates the ordered region in the biofilm. Through the use o f fluorescent microsphere uptake assays and a rhamnose inducible system we have found that these differences in cellular organization likely leads to changes in how substrates are transported through the biofilm. Conclusions : Our ability to visualize biofi lms at high resolution across depth and opposing gradients provides insights into the multicellular growth of bacteria and allows us to investigate the mechanisms underpinning structural differentiation. Together, these findings inform a model describing t he integration of global signaling pathways to establish subzone architecture in developing Biofilms DETECTION AND SEMI -QUANTITATIVE SCORING BIOFILMS IN VENOUS LEG ULCERS Abstract Body: Background: Biofilms are recognized as an important factor in the delayed healing of chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers (VLU). Improved methods for the detection of wound biofilms will aid clinical studies and diagnostics. Methods : Debridement specimens were collected from 64 VLU subjects. If possible, specimens were obtained from Weeks 1 (baseline), 2, 4, 6 and 8 for each subject, resulting in 189 sp ecimens. The specimens were fixed with paraformaldehyde, cryoembedded, and cryosectioned. Two staining methods were used, general staining (GS) with SYTO9 and and in-situ hybridization cryosections were imaged using a Leica SP5 confocal scanning laser microscope (see figure). Specimens were scored for biofilms using a 6 -point scale; 0 = no bacteria observed, 1 = single individual microorganis ms, 2 = small microcolonies (10 -100 cells), 3 = large microcolonies (> 100 cells), 4 = continuous biofilm, and 5 = thick (> 10 um) continuous biofilm. A score of 2 or greater was considered positive for biofilm. Results: The two methods yielded similar res ults, with 43% and 48% of specimens positive for biofilms with GS and FISH, respectively. FISH is dependent on the number of ribosomes per cell, an indicator of metabolic activity, suggesting that the biofilms were active. FISH was better for detecting coc ci present within tissue, which were likely masked in GS by WGA binding to both tissue and Gram -positive bacteria. GS enabled better visualization of biofilms and the surrounding tissue and host cells. Conclusions: Overall, the two methods were complimenta COMPARATIVE STUDY OF INTRACELLULAR BIOFILMS FORMED BY CLINICAL ADHERENT INVASIVE E. COLI Abstract Body: Background: Patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD) present an abnormal colonization of Proteobacteria in the intestine. Among them, the family of Adherent Invasive E. coli (AIEC) is predominant. This family is defined by the ability to adhere to epithelial cells, i nvade them and by the uncommon capacity among pathogenic E. coli to survive within macrophages. While many bacteria have evolved to hijack the phagocytosis pathway, AIECs reside in the stressful environment of the mature phagolysosome (acid pH, oxidative s tress, nutrient starvation etc ). We have shown that the AIEC reference strain, LF82, form Intracellular Bacteria Community (IBC) associated with the production of an extra -bacterial matrix composed of sugars, and amyloid fibres that glues LF82 together. I BCs protect AIECs from macrophage's attacks and antibiotics. LF82's IBCs persist in the phagolysosomes for several days and are sufficiently robust to resist macrophage death in an antibiotic rich medium until a subsequent phagocytosis. In the recent years , the characterization from Crohn's disease patient of several new strains with AIEC phenotype revealed their wide genetic diversity. As strains with AIEC phenotype are found in each E. coli phylogroup, we questioned if this intracellular strategy represen ts a common trait of AIEC strains. Methods: In order to study the AIEC family, we collected and sequenced the genome of 12 clinical strains. First, a comparative genomics study was conducted on them. Then, in vitro and ex vivo tests were performed with the aim to evaluate the survival of clinical strain, as well as their capacity to produce biofilm matrix. Results: The results revealed that AIECs present various capacities of biofilm matrix production. During infection, these capacities translated in dispar ate rate of intra -macrophage survival, differences in the capacity to form IBC or to survive as independent cells, diversity in the components of the matrix structuring the IBC and finally in different maturation process of the IBCs. Conclusions: Interesti ngly, these differences do not correlate with the phylogroup of the clinical strains suggesting that horizontally acquired genes or small polymorphisms contribute to define the survival strategy of AIEC. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-146-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: Determining how nutrient Abstract Body: Background: Cases infections are increasing yearly among Fibrosis (CF) population. Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) is particu larly problematic due to its strong drug resistance and its correlation with rapid lung function decline. Biofilm formation, which enhances MAB drug resistance in vitro , is controlled in part by carbon and nitrogen availability in some NTM species. It is unknown if MAB aggregation is similarly regulated. The regulatory nodes that control aggregation are also unclear. Finally, MAB biofilms spatial arrangement and its relevance to CF airway colonization remained underexplored. This study therefore aims to: 1) Determine how carbon and nitrogen availability affects MAB biofilm formation, 2) identify how the CF sputum environment impacts the evolution of MAB biofilm phenotypes, and 3) define the spatial arrangement of MAB biofilms in situ. Methods: In Aim 1 , an in vitro aggregation assay was used to identify how carbon and nitrogen availability in synthetic CF medium (SCFM)impacts MAB aggregation dynamics. In Aim 2 , we artificially evolved a MAB strain in SCFM to determine how adaptation to the CF sputum environme nt impacts biofilm formation. Colony morphology and aggregation dynamics were characterized and whole -genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify emergent mutations. In Aim 3 , we used MiPACT -HCR, a novel tissue -fixing and imaging method, to survey th e in situ environment of multiple NTM -positive sputum samples. We determined the composition, distribution, and 3D structure of MAB biofilms in sputum. Results: Preliminary evidence suggests increased nitrogen content correlates with MAB biofilm dispersal. Evolution of MAB in SCFM generated new distinct colony morphology and a hyper -aggregating phenotype. WGS analysis identified mutations with releva nce to metabolism and metabolite transport. Finally, preliminary imaging shows that MAB can exist as both single - species aggregates or large polymicrobial biofilms in situ . Conclusion: The study is still ongoing. Future work will focus on identifying the r egulatory pathways, including specific flux -dependent metabolites, that mediate MAB aggregation in response to nutritional flux, using targeted metabolomics and molecular genetics. Additionally, using the information gained from in situ characterization, w e will generate a laboratory model that can simulate MAB biofilms as observed in CF sputum. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-151-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Physiology and Publishing Title: Triple -Species Bacterial Vaginosis -Associated Biofilm Growing A Tract Abstract Body: Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the world's leading vaginal infection affecting primarily women of reproductive age. This infection is characterized by a reduction of protective vaginal Lactobacillus species and an increase in facultative and strictly anaerobi c bacteria that create a polymicrobial biofilm on the vaginal epithelium. The exact etiology of BV and the microbial interactions that lead to the development of infection are still controversial, however, some bacterial species including Gardnerella spp., Prevotella bivia , and Fannyhessea vaginae , roles in the early stages of incident BV. To further understand how these species interact, in vitro models that better mimic the vaginal environment are required. Methods: We aimed to characterize triple -species biofilms of G. vaginalis , P. bivia , and F. vaginae growing in a rich medium, New York City (NCYIII), or in a chemically defined medium simulating genital tract secretions (mGTS). Each species was first grown planktonically, and then in eith er single -species or triple - species biofilms and subsequently analysed by and confocal PNA -FISH probes. Results: Compared to NYCIII media in which all three bacterial species easily grew, growth in mGTS was more stringent; wi th only P. bivia and a small amount of G. vaginalis able to be detected after 72h. For single - species biofilms, only G. vaginalis was able to increase its biomass in mGTS on a 48h period. Conversely, in NYCIII media, all species were able to grow and form single - species 48h -biofilms, at different extents. When comparing triple -species biofilms by confocal microscopy we were able to detect the incorporation of each species in the polymicrobial biofilm, independent of the growth media used. However, clear differences were observed in the structure and species organization of each polymicrobial biofilm. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary data on the growth of key BV -associated bacteria in single and triple species biofilms in two different types of me dia. While all three bacterial species grew very well in rich NYCIII media, on mGTS only G. vaginalis was able to grow on single - and triple - species biofilms. This work provides essential analysis for characterization of the interactions that can happen be tween BV -associated species on biofilms. We anticipate our ongoing work will contribute to a better understanding of the nature of incident BV. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-154-ASM -BIO Topic and Publishing Title: Pilin antigenic variation affects genome -wide transcription and antibiotic tolerance by modulating type IV pili interactions Abstract Body: The human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of gonorrhea, one of the three most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Gonococci can exist as planktonic cells or as part of colonies or biofilms, depending on the presence of dynamic cell appendages called type IV pili (T4P). The gene encoding the major pilin, pilE, is naturally hypermutable by antigenic variation (AV), resulting in one of the highest rates of genetic change known for prokaryotic systems. As a consequence, the pilE sequences in different clinical isolates are highly divergent. In this study, we addressed the effects of the pilE sequence variation on T4P - dependent processes including surface motility, T4P -T4P interactions, colony formation, and antibiotic tolerance. To this end, isogenic gonococcal strains with pilE sequences from different isolates were generated whose sequences differ as a result of AV. T4P functionality is strongly impacted by AV. We show that some variants are semi -functional; they power twitching motility, yet they are strongly impaired in g enerating attractive force between T4P. Consequently, colony formation is inhibited and antibiotic tolerance decreases. By means of RNA sequencing, we addressed changes in gene expression caused by AV. Principal component analysis shows that strains with s emi-functional T4P cluster together with an unpiliated strain, which expresses one quarter of the annotated genes differentially compared to colony -forming gonococci. This indicates that the major transcriptional changes caused by AV are related to the fac t that AV affects the attractive force caused between T4P. Taken together, we show that antigenic variation generates T4P with different functionality and suggest that it has important functions beyond facilitating the escape from immune surveillance. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-159-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: THE ROLE OF DIGUANYLATE CYCLASE IN THE FORMATION OF BIOFILMS ON PET PLASTIC Abstract Body: Background As polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and other plastics accumulate in oceans and landfills, researchers have identified microbial populations that degrade these pollutants. Previous studies performed on polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) have shown th at these novel degradation processes require formation of a robust biofilm on the plastic surface to promote hydrolytic enzyme activity. Bacterial biofilm formation is in part controlled by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) proteins that induce production of the messenger bis -(3-5)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c -di-GMP). Several hypothesized DGCs have been identified in our group's previously isolated environmental consortium of five bacteria strains, three Pseudomonas and two Bacillus specie s, that degrade PET. Methods To determine the impact of biofilm formation on PET degradation in this system, PB10_087, encoding a hypothesized DGC responsible for biofilm -related c - di-GMP production, was selectively knocked out of the genome of Pseudomonas isolate 9.2. Assays were used to assess the effect of the DGC's deletion on biofilm -associated phenotypes in pure culture and in consortium with Bacillus isolate 9.1 (Consortium 9). The swimming and twitching motilities of the knockout mutant were compare d to that of the wild -type Pseudomonas via plate -based assays. Congo red assays measuring extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production and crystal violet assays measuring cellular adhesion were also performed. Differences in biofilm formation were th en related to degradative ability via an ongoing 6 -week assay measuring the change in weight of PET pellets inoculated with Consortium 9. Results As expected with a DGC knockout, overall cellular adhesion was significantly reduced for the mutant in pure cu lture and in consortium. Surprisingly, the mutant displayed increased swimming motility and EPS production in pure culture, with no significant difference observed in twitching motility. Trends after four weeks of the change in weight assay indicate no sig nificant difference between change in weight of PET pellets incubated in wild -type and mutant -containing cultures, though this data is still preliminary as the assay is not complete. Conclusions Taken together, these results reveal a possible genetic pathw ay necessary for biofilm formation in this system and allude to a lack -of relationship between biofilm formation and PET degradation, opposite to what has been observed for PP and PE degradation systems. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-169-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Title: Mucispirillum schaedleri : CORDED BIOFILMS AND Abstract rod isolated from the murine gut, where it appears to play a role in resistance to infection and colitis. Strain ASF457 displays two morphotypes in liquid culture: the rod, a nd a \"round body\" similar to that documented in spirochetes. Data here address the ecological significance of round bodies and document a striking biofilm morphology in vitro . Methods All procedures except centrifugation and imaging were performed in an anerobic chamber using equilibrated media and buffers. Four -day-old M. schaedleri ASF457 biomass was harvested from AMM/NO 3 broth culture, resuspended in medium to OD600 = 0.05, and introduced into flowcells or into chamber slides. Biovolume and vitality were assessed using confocal micrographs of 18- and 48 -hr-old Live/Dead -stained biofilms. Cells from the initial broth culture were also examined by electron microscopy, and round bodies as well as rods were enumerated by imaging flow cytometry. Results TEM and confocal microscopy showed round bodies to be c -shaped cells closely appressed to the walls of a membrane -bound sphere. The contents were sometimes amorphous and stained with propidium -iodide. Round bodies were 22% of cellular particles in 3 -day-old broth culture, but 48% in 6 -day-old culture. They were abundant in chamber -slide biofilms but sparse in flowcell -grown biofilms. In chambers and flowcells both, biofilm cells were arranged in braids hundreds of micrometers in length. Over the period from 18 hrs to 48 hrs, biovolume in chamber -grown biofilms tripled and maximum flowcell -grown biofilms, biovolume increased 40 -fold with maximum height of 65 \u00b5m. Conclusions M. schaedleri round bodies are indistinguishable from those i n the taxonomically unrelated spirochetes. In spirochetes, the ecological significance of these cells is disputed. In M. schaedleri , round bodies frequently have poor membrane integrity and/or low transmembrane potential, their content is often amorphous, and an age -dependent increase in round bodies occurs in broth cultures. Round bodies are abundant in chamber -slide biofilms, but less so in flowcell -grown biofilms. Together, these results suggest that round bodies are senescent cells which arise during ba tch culture. Whether grown as batch culture in chamber slides, or as continuous culture in flowcells, M. schaederli biofilms have a striking corded morphology ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-177-ASM -BIO Topic Physiology and Biofilms Publishing Title: Biofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel coupons in cantaloupe juice characterized by SEM and RNA Seq Abstract Body: Background : Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a foodborne pathogen which caused an outbreak in 2011 in the USA associated with whole cantaloupes. Lm cells can contaminate both the cantaloupe surface and the food processing environment and promo te biofilm growth. This study is to understand the impact of cantaloupe juice on Lm biofilm formation on stainless steel coupons using Cryo -Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and RNA Seq technology. Methods : The cantaloupe outbreak strain Lm FS2025 was gro wn on stainless steel (SS) coupons in filter -sterilized, 50 % dilution of cantaloupe juice and TSB for 3 d at 24 \u00b0C statically. Planktonic cells were removed by washing coupons with distilled water. Lm cells on SS coupons were frozen in liquid nitrogen and visualized with a Hitachi SU -7000 SEM. Biofilms were harvested by sonication in 0.1 % BPW with 0.02 % Tween80 and centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min. Total RNA was extracted using the Invitrogen RiboPure Bacteria Kit. The library was prepared with Ill umina Stranded Total RNA Prep, Ligation with Ribo -Zero and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 2000. RNA Seq analysis was applied to compare the RNA expression profiles of Lm biofilms on SS coupons after growth in 50 % cantaloupe juice vs TSB. Resu lts: SEM images revealed a different attachment profile of Lm on SS coupons. In TSB, Lm cells were mainly found in scratches/groves of the metal surface, whereas, in cantaloupe juice they were evenly dispersed and attached to the smooth surface as well. Additionally, Lm aggregation was observed on the SS surface in cantaloupe juice. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a total of 991 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which were significantly up -/downregulated with at least 2 -fold change (461 and 530 genes, respectively, P<0.05). Functional annotation of these DEGs indicated that they mainly participate in metabolism, signaling, and virulence. Conclusions : These data highlight the profound differences in the attachment patterns of Lm on SS surfaces and the gl obal transcriptome after growth in cantaloupe juice vs TSB. This provides the basis for future functional characterization of genes with potential roles in biofilm formation and virulence of Lm in cantaloupe juice, as well as for development of mitigation practices for Lm biofilms on produce and food contact surfaces. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-185-ASM -BIO Topic 1: and Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: KEEP IT TOGETHER: EMERGENT MULTISPECIES BIOFILM MATRIX Abstract Body: Background The biofilm matrix contributes to the establishment of microbial cells on very diverse surfaces, stabilizing biofilms and providing cells with protection against multiple hostile conditions. Moreover, the biofilm matrix can also retain nutrients, enzymes or quorum sensing molecules, favoring the establishment of social inter actions among biofilm cells. Multiple studies have been conducted to characterize matrix determinants and their regulation in single species biofilms, while these remain scarcely understood in multispecies biofilms. We have previously isolated and characte rized differential gene/protein expression specific of the four -species biofilm. Methods We combined bioimaging using fluorescent markers and fluorescent lectins but also matrix proteomics in order to quantify i) the impact of matrix mutants on species abundance and intermixing, and ii) the expression of extracellular matrix de terminants in mono - vs. multispecies biofilms in different bacterial multispecies consortia. Results To characterize matrix composition, we performed a screening of 78 different fluorescent lectins in mono - and multispecies biofilms applying confocal laser scanning microscopy and identified five binding to our samples. Remarkably, some matrix glycoconjugates, enriched in galactose/ N - galactosamine, were only produced in the presence of other species. Interestingly, such polymers seemed to be produced by the least abundant species, M. oxydans , but co -localized with the most abundant strain , X. retroflexus , suggesting a close interaction between these species. Additionally, matrix proteomics of mono - and multispecies biofilms evidenced differential expression of secreted and surface - associated proteins, such as enzymes and flagella, respectively. Conclusions Our data suggest that the presence of other species influences matrix composition and evidence biofilm emergent properties in the four -species consortium. While bioimaging provided structural biofilm information and localized production of polymers, matrix proteomics contributed to identify specific traits differentially expressed in the presence of other species. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-186-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Determinants Publishing Title: STREPTOCOCCUS GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY TITANIUM Abstract Body: Background: Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogenic fungus and Streptococcus gordonii, an early bacterial colonizer abundant in the oral cavity, are known to form mixed robust biofilms with increased virulence, leading to mucosal damage and inflammatory response. Such cross -kingd om interaction is promoted by polymers (glucans) synthesized by Streptococcal glucosyltransferase (GtfG). However, the role of GtfG from S. gordonii in single and mixed biofilms with C. albicans has never been examined with regards to synergistic growth, extracellular glucan matrix production and overall biofilm accumulation on dental implant titanium (Ti) surfaces. Methods: S. gordonii wild type strain CHI1 and AMS12 strain (Sg gtfG) with no GtfG activity were used in single or mixed biofilms with C. albi cans strain SC5314. Biofilms were allowed to form for 24 hours over Ti surfaces under static conditions at 37\u00b0C, in a 5% CO 2 incubator 10% FBS + 10% BHI). production was promoted by exposure to 1% sucrose or glucose (negative control). Biofilms were analyzed by immune -FISH stain and confocal microscopy with 3D biovolume reconstruction for biofilm and glucan with viable exposureincreased biofilm biovolume for S. gordonii CH1 strain, for AMS12 strain, due to increase of extracellular glucan production by CH1 strain GtfG activity. In mixed biofilms, C. albicans presence led to a further increase in glucans for CH1 even in the presence of sucrose. Interestingly, GtfG activity and glucan presence significantly increased Candida counts on mixed biofilms on Ti surface. Conclusion: On Ti surfaces S. gordonii GtfG activity and synthesized glucans seem to be increased by fungal presence, which may in turn promote C. albicans overgrowth, allowing mixed biofilms to present higher glucan matrix biovolume and higher fungal counts, when compared to mixed biofilms with gtfG biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-214-ASM -BIO Topic Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: Microbial corrosion of carbon steel by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract Body: Microbial corrosion or biocorrosion enhances deterioration of metal surfaces and causes massive loss of metall ic structures, leading to considerable economic losses. However, there are limited studies that elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying biocorrosion. Here we investigated biocorrosion of carbon steel by P. aeruginosa . We grew biofilms on mild carbon steel coupons in the CDC bioreactor under oxic conditions for 14 days. We confirmed the presence of a biofilm on the coupons by microscopy and enumerated viable cell counts. On average, there were 7.89 x 105 CFU/mm2. The biomass was then subjected to transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, which is currently pending. After removal of the biomass and corrosion products from the metal coupons, corrosion was measured by weight loss and reflection confocal microscopy. The coupons lost 0.21 \u00b1 0.09% of its weight when incubated in the presence of bacteria, while only 0.09 \u00b1 0.04% were lost from uninoculated coupons (n=9; p < 0.05, Student t -test). Furthermore, pitting on the coupon surface was observed by confocal microscopy with 61% of images exhibiting pits of 6 \u00b5m deep when the coupon was exposed to bacteria, in comparison to 13% of images from uninoculated coupons. Having established our system, we plan to test the effects of coating the coupons with hexagonal boron nitr ide and graphene on biocorrosion, in addition to testing if highly expressed genes or abundant proteins in the biofilm are important for biocorrosion. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-216-ASM -BIO Determinants Publishing Title: BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background: The extracellular matrix is essential to the integrity of biofilms, protecting the multi -cellular aggregate from physical and chemical disruption. Many infectious agents are known to form biofilms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and, due to its role in bi ofilm integrity, the extracellular matrix is a potential therapeutic target. For P. aeruginosa biofilm matrices, the interaction between the exopolysaccharide Psl and the protein CdrA is essential for matrix integrity. However, the mechanism of this intera ction and the functional structures of each CdrA and Psl are not known. We have begun to characterize the structures of CdrA and Psl individually, as well as in complex to gain insight on how they promote matrix integrity. Methods: We purified both CdrA an d Psl as single species with high purity and employed a variety of in vitro , biophysical methods to characterize the structures and interactions of purified CdrA and Psl. These methods include circular dichroism transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Structural models based on amino acid sequence suggest that CdrA forms an elongated structure of mostly beta sheet motifs. Examination of the CdrA secondary str ucture using CD supports the presence of beta sheets. SV -AUC experiments indicate that CdrA is primarily monomeric at low concentrations (100 - 800 nM), with a molecular weight of ~170 kDa, as expected after known cleavage events. Additionally, CdrA sedime nts with a high frictional ratio, consistent with an elongated protein shape. Some higher order species were also detected with SV - AUC and were visualized by TEM. Using solid -state NMR, we find that Psl has additional chemical modifications beyond those cu rrently known for the soluble Psl fraction. In the presence of Psl, no significant changes were observed in the structural properties and self -assembly of CdrA under currently examined conditions. Conclusions: CdrA forms monomeric and higher order species in the presence and absence of the exopolysaccharide Psl. The establishment of these biophysical assays has allowed us to begin to interrogate the functional structural and molecular interactions of CdrA and Psl to determine how this interaction results in extracellular matrix stability for P. aeruginosa biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-219-ASM -BIO Physiology and Publishing Title: CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SELF -PRODUCED MICROSCALE Body: Background: Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms are frequently responsible for hospital -related and medical device associated in fections. Biofilms are structurally and mechanically heterogeneous, resulting in the formation of pH gradients due to the nonuniform distribution of nutrients or metabolic waste products. Previous work has shown that S. epidermidis biofilm mechanics can be modulated through external pH changes, where biofilms can be softened in higher pH environments. However, the extent that biofilms self -regulate their pH to regulate and maintain their mechanics remains unknown. Methods: To elucidate the relationship betw een self -produced pH gradients and S. epidermidis biofilm mechanics, we simultaneously map pH and mechanical properties at the microscale using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled with image analysis. Briefly, a pH -sensitive fluorophore was u sed to map pH and passive microrheology of fluorescently labeled bacterial cells was used to measure local mechanics. pH gradients and mechanical properties were mapped throughout biofilm development (12 -, 18-, 24- hour biofilm growth) and in different shear stress environments (static, 0.1 Pa). Results: We find that local pH and mechanics display significant interdependence where regions with lower pH are mechanically stiffer and regions of higher pH are mechanically softer across growth conditions. Additi onally, biofilms have stiffer mechanics and lower pH close to the biofilm -substrate interface despite differences in the range and heterogeneity of the pH values and mechanical properties between growth conditions. Reported pH values ranged from 4.8 -6.6 an d creep compliance values spanned three orders of magnitude from 10-1-101 Pa-1; these values align with previous reports of gross measurements of staphylococcal biofilm pH and mechanics. Conclusions: We simultaneously mapped S. epidermidis biofilm pH and m echanics at the microscale and revealed that biofilms have lower creep compliance at low pH (stiffer) and higher creep compliance at higher pH (softer). This indicates that pH gradients within S. epidermidis biofilms can contribute to the maintenance and regulation of their mechanics. Understanding biofilm mechanics is important for developing mechanics -targeted biofilm control strategies. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-220-ASM 1: Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: CRYSTAL -CLEAR: MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS INTO CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE SECRETION Abstract Body: Background. Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, is produced by plants and different microorganisms, including many bacteria that secrete bacterial cellulose (BC) as a major component of their biofilm matrix via multicomponent Bcs secretion systems. Depen ding on the producers, BC can present chemical modifications and/or different structural assemblies that can lead to diverse degrees of crystallinity. Highly ordered or crystalline cellulose is quite attractive due to the great number of developed biotechn ological applications and, thus, the derived economical interest. Although BC superproducers, such as G. hansenii , have been long identified, the role of the accessory subunits that determine the secretion of crystalline cellulose by acetic acid bacteria, remain largely unknown. Structural design. To understand the role of those accessory subunits, we employed a combination of biochemical, functional, single particle and in situ CryoEM methods to uncover structural and mechanistic insights into BC secretion system organisation. Results. We identified how the proteins responsible for the crystalline cellulose packing arrange into large filamentous structures. In addition, we show that, in situ , those assemblies share extraordinary morphological similarities wit h the recently discovered cortical belt, an intracellular cytoskeletal element that spatially correlates with the cellulose exit sites and the packed crystalline cellulose ribbon. Lastly, we detect specific protein -protein interactions between the componen ts of the macromolecular structure and the regulatory module of the cellulose synthase, corroborating a model for inside -out determination of cellulose crystallinity. Conclusion. We demonstrate that our proteins organize into a supramolecular cytoskeletal s caffold that likely stabilizes the cellulose -extruding synthase nanoarrays through an unexpected inside -out mechanism for assembly.

(2015) Trends in microbiology .(4) Nicolas, W.J., Ghosal, D., Tocheva, E.I., Meyerowitz, and Function Publishing Biofilms are communities of bacterial cells enclosed in an extracellular matrix. Among the components of the biofilm matrix, exopolysaccharides and accessory proteins have been s uggested to play dominant roles in biofilm surface adhesion. However, how they function at the molecular level remains a mystery. Efforts have focused on studying the attachment of individual cells, but little is known at the molecular level about how biof ilm cells collectively adhere to surfaces in mature biofilms and how this mechanism differs from the single -cell case. Methods: Here, we combine mutagenesis, biochemistry, single -cell imaging, and bioinformatics to show how Vibrio cholerae achieves surface adhesion towards hosts and diverse environmental substrates through dual adhesin molecules with overlapping but distinct functions. Results: We show that Bap1 and RbmC -prism mutants exhibit adhesion defects and identify the main contributor to biofilm a dherence to abiotic surfaces. Taking a closer look at the amino acid sequence, we identify that positively charged and aromatic groups mediate adhesion to abiotic surfaces. Testing with Caco -2 cells, asialofetuin and human intestinal epithelial slices, we show that RbmC binds to host cell surfaces with N - and O -glycans while Bap1 loses this glycan binding ability. In vitro and in vivo assays provide evidence of direct binding between VPS and the conserved - propeller domain. Conclusions: We find that the bi ofilm adhesins in V. cholerae adopt a modular approach that, through evolution, acquired specialized functionalities to attach to diverse surfaces while maintaining their affinity for the native exopolysaccharide. The double -sided -tape -like design may be g eneralizable to other biofilms that rely on a synergy between extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-235-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: Development of mass spectrometry based approaches to assign Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to phylotype groups Abstract Body: Background an opportunistic pathogen with incredible genomic variability and transcriptional flexibility. Recent pan -genomic analysis of sequenced strains of P. aeruginosa have revealed that their genomes separate into up to five different phylotypes. These five p hylotypes can be differentiated by the presence, absences, or truncation of specific marker genes. Based upon this analysis, 98% of sequenced P. aeruginosa strains are categorized within the phylogroups 1 and 2, with only approximately 40 identified as phy lotypes 3, 4, and 5. Two of the genes deleted or disrupted in phylotypes 3 and 5, respectively, are rhlC and phzH. RhlC is required for the production of the di -rhamnolipid (di -RL) biosurfactants and phzH is required for production of phenazine -1-carboxami de (PCN), a member of the redox active phenazine class of metabolites. We hypothesized that mass spectrometry based approaches could be leveraged to identify strains within phylotypes 3 and 5 for prioritization of total genome sequencing to support further genetic studies. Methods Seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including two laboratory strains (PAO1 and PA14) five clinical isolates (nmFLR01, mFLR01, SH1B, SH2D, and SH3A) were grown as static biofilms in Synthetic CF Medium 2 (SCFM2). SCFM2 is a c hemically defined artificial sputum medium designed to replicate the in vivo CF lung environment in vitro. Subsequent to growth, the bacterial cultures were extracted and liquid - chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) based metabolomics data were collected. The production of P. aeruginosa small molecule virulence factors, including di -RL and PCN, by the strains were analyzed by classical and feature based molecular networking. Presence or absence of rhlC was measured by PCR. Results Strain SH3A p roduced exclusively mono -rhamnolipids, indicating it was unable to produce di -rhamnolipids, while levels of PCN production were below the limit of detection. As SH3A only produced mono -rhamnolipids and the rhlC gene is absent from its genome, we hypothesiz e that it is a member of the clade 3 phylotype Conclusions This work provides evidence that strain SH3A is a member of phylotype 3. Further studies are being undertaken to confirm this observation, including determining whether its genome contains genes fo r the production of ExlA and ExlB, but not genes for the production of phzH, ExoS, ExoU, and PA14_14300. Methods to identify potential phylotype 3 and 5 strains from publicly available metabolomics data are under development. ---PAGEBREAK --- Contr ol Number: 2022 -A-236-ASM -BIO Topic Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: ALGINATE OVERPRODUCTION IS NOT THE DRIVING FACTOR IN ENVELOPE STRESS RESPONSE MUTATIONS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Abstract Body: The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilm -based infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa undergoes selection in the CF lung environment, which results in mutations in mucA . MucA is the inhibitor of the envelope stress response sigma factor AlgU. Mutations in mucA lead to AlgU misregulation, resulting in a mucoid phenoty pe characterized by alginate overproduction and poor CF disease outcomes. Although mutations frequently arise in mucA, we have shown that, paradoxically a portion of mucA is essential for P. aeruginosa viability in an AlgU activity -dependent manner. To determine if alginate was responsible for mucA essentiality, we deleted algD , a key alginate biosynthetic gene, as well as the genes encoding three major AlgU - activated transcriptional regulators (AlgB, AlgR, and AmrZ). None of these mutants alleviated the mucA requirement, suggesting that alginate overproduction is not, at least solely, responsible for the mucA viability defect. Interestingly, mucoid mutants revert back to a non -mucoid state in the CF lung via secondary site mutations that are mainly in algU . While alginate overproduction is commonly thought to be responsible for non -mucoid reversion, our results show that reversion occurs even in the absence of alginate production. Preliminary work shows that MucA mutants containing algD mutations appear to a cquire suppressor mutations at a rate that is comparable to MucA mutants producing alginate. Additionally, we have found that these secondary -site mutations are in algU , supporting the hypothesis that AlgU activity is the driving factor of reversion. Toget her, our results suggest that regulation of AlgU itself is key to mucA essentiality and the driving Control Number: 2022 -A-237-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: MONITORING SPATIOTEMPORAL PREBIOTIC TREATMENT RESPONSES IN A PERIODONTAL MULTISPECIES BIOFILM MODEL Abstract Body: Background Periodontitis is initiated by a complex interplay between bacterial interactions in the oral community, its environment and the host. Although novel treatment approaches prove to be effective, they are not always well understood. Revealing unknown mechanis ms behind treatment responses highly benefit from in vitro periodontal models. This study uses a 700 mm2 drip flow biofilm reactor to investigate spatial and temporal effects of L -arginine (a known oral prebiotic) treatment on a periodontal multispecies bi ofilm model. Methods The drip flow biofilm reactor is inoculated S. for a short anaerobic recirculation phase, followed by a continuous aerobic feedi ng phase with half - strength medium. Daily metabolic analysis and confocal imaging combined with end-point qPCR measurements return metabolite consumption and production rates, and structural and compositional biofilm features, respectively. Additionally, preliminary multiple particle tracking experiments are performed. Thereto, red carboxylate -modified microspheres with diameters of 1 and 0.5 \u00b5m are incorporated during biofilm growth. Their Brownian motion is measured to characterize microrheological proper ties of the biofilm. Results Over a time course of three days, the periodontal biofilm reaches stable metabolic, structural, and compositional conditions. Subsequent exposure to L -arginine destabilizes the biofilm in terms of volume, thickness and metaboli sm after the first day of treatment. The biofilm becomes thinner and shows metabolization of L -arginine into ornithine by the streptococcal strains. After a 4 -day treatment, the biofilm developed into a less pathogenic biofilm, mainly caused by a reduction in bacterial numbers of F. nucleatum with more than 2 log values. Initial particle tracking results point at a higher mobility of 0.5 \u00b5m particles in biofilms treated with L -arginine. Interestingly, if after initial exposure L -arginine is again left out o f the medium, bacterial numbers of F. nucleatum as well as structural biofilm features shift again to values similar to the control biofilm. These results indicate the importance of measuring microrheological properties. Conclusion This study demonstrates the strength of a drip flow periodontal biofilm model in studying dynamic treatment responses. In ongoing work, structural destabilizing effects on the oral biofilm are further investigated via multiple particle tracking experiments. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-241-ASM -BIO Topic 1: is the causative agent of cr own gall disease and attaches by its pole to plant tissues. Polar cellular attachment and subsequent biofilm formation is mediated by the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). UPP-dependent attachment can be environmentally modulated, and a prominent example is t he effect of limiting phosphorus (P i), which stimulates attachment via the PhoR -PhoB two -component regulators. requires an initiating glycosyl transferase (WbaP) designated uppE that likely adds the first monosaccharide of the UPP subunit to an isoprenyl lipid carrier in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane. Although uppE null mutants are attachment deficient, under phosphorus (P i) limitation this requirement is abolished. A. tumefaciens encodes WbaP homolog designated uplP which r escues the uppE mutant under limiting P i. UppE is 517 aa and has 4 transmembrane (TM) segments, a predicted re -entrant 5th segment (with a conserved DX 12P motif) partially spanning the membrane, followed by a large cytoplasmic domain with the catalytic site. UplP is 241 aa with only the re -entrant TM domain and the cytoplasmic domain. Expression of a uplP -lacZ fusion is elevated by the PhoB response regula tor. In fact, ectopic expression of uplP compensates for UPP - dependent surface attachment in uppE null mutants in both high and low P i. A truncated version of UppE missing its 4 TMs, and matching UplP in length, was also able to drive surface attachment in uppE /uplP null mutants when expressed ectopically. Thus UPP production can be driven by either of two functionally redundant WbaP proteins, and the 4 TMs of UppE are dispensable. We propose a model in which uppE is required for WbaP activity and UPP produ ction unless uplP expression is induced, such as under P i limitation. However, the stimulated attachment under P i-limitation is not due to uplP alone, since ectopic expression under replete P i, does not stimulate attachment to the extent observed with P i limitation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-243-ASM -BIO Topic 1: and Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: STALLED INHIBITS Abstract Body: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that attaches to surfaces by a single cellular pole, via the production of the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). UPP production relies upon a Wzx -Wzy type polysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. UPP is composed of two distinct forms, one char acterized by N-acetylglucosamine residues (UPP GlcN) and the other by N-acetylgalactosamine residues (UPP GalN). Each UPP species is thought to be polymerized by a distinct Wzy -type polymerase. A pathway - specific transposon mutant screen, based on loss of Co ngo Red binding to reveal UPP defects, identified two predicted dTDP -L-rhamnose biosynthesis genes, rfbA and rfbD. These genes were implicated primarily in UPP GalN production. Nonpolar deletions of rfbA and rfbD were generated in backgrounds with intact UPP, only UPP GalN, only UPP GlcN, or no UPP, and these validated the initial screen. Mutants with both UPP species disabled failed to attach, but surprisingly rfbA and rfbD mutants with either one of the UPP speci es intact had increased biofilm formation, adherence, and auto -aggregation. These phenotypes required the remaining UPP polymerase. Deletion of these genes in the UPP GlcN disabled strain appeared to confer a more drastic increase in attachment than in the opposing UPP GalN disabled derivatives. Coincident with these UPP phenotypes are motility defects. In the original screening background (elevated cyclic diguanylate monophosphate, cdGMP, and disabled for le while rfbA mutants motile. Flagella are still produced, but the mutants are impaired for swimming. In several derivatives of the rfbD mutant the motility defect is suppressed when UPP GlcN is produced, reinforcing a connection between the pol ysaccharides and motility. Despite isolation from a genetic screen aimed to detect decreased UPP production, the rfbD and rfbA mutants seem to alter UPP production or chemistry to increase attachment and biofilm formation and to also impede flagellar motil ity. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-244-ASM -BIO 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Investigation of Papain and Levofloxacin in the Eradication of E. coli Biofilms Abstract Body: Background: Biolm formation is a signicant problem in healthcare.

Methods: Four groups will be used:1) just E. coli biolms (control), 2)papain before and after biolm maturation, 3) papain before and levofloxacin after biolmformation, and 4) papain before and papain and levofloxacin after biolm formation. E. coli arecultivated for single colonies and then grown in a shaking water bath to achieve an absorbance of1.0nm at OD600. E.coli will either be plated directly or mixed in at equal concentrations withpapain, and then plated, 24h later and after biolm formation papain or levoflox acin will beadded depending on the group. To assess the eectiveness of the treatments, crystal violet (CV)staining and ethanol will be used and the absorbance will be recorded at 570 nm. The biolmformation rate percentage:(absorbance of treatment/absorba nce of control group)*100 (n=24)will be calculated. Colony Forming Units (CFUs) will also be used. For this method, maturebiolms will be scraped from their plates and diluted by a factor of two and plated. TheCFUs/mL will be calculated: (# of colonies*tot al dilution factor)/volume of culture plated in mL(n=24). The fewer CFUs the more eective the treatment was in eradicating biolms. Results: Experiments are currently underway, and CFUs and CV staining results will beavailable in late September. Conclusions :The use of papain is a novel and accessible method toeradicate and prevent biolm formation as it can be tapped directly from the fruit, oering amore cost -eective alternative to current treatments. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-253-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure Publishing Title: Transcriptomic profiling of the Rosenthal2, Boo Shan Tseng11School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 2Department of Microbiology and Immun ology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC Due to the gradients of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products that form within the biofilm as it grows, cells within a biofilm experience different environments and, therefore, vary in their gene express ion. This heterogeneity within the biofilm not only makes the resident cells physiologically distinct from planktonic cells, but also different from cells elsewhere in the biofilm. Since biofilm heterogeneity increases the tolerance of the population again st a variety of stressors, it is important to understand how cells within a biofilm are organized into distinct subpopulations, how these subpopulations respond to specific stresses, and how they coordinate with each other to form a robust community. Howev er, biofilm heterogeneity has been poorly understood due to the lack of appropriate and accurate methods. The current state -of-the-art technique to study biofilm heterogeneity is a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) -based method that allows for the investigation of up to 100 transcripts at the same time within the cells of a biofilm. While it provides information about spatial heterogeneity, this method requires selecting a subset of genes to be probed and is labor intensive. Here, we expand upon thi s by developing a method to study biofilm heterogeneity at a full -genome scale. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as our model organism, we apply single -cell RNA sequencing, a powerful tool that allows us to investigate the expression of all genes at the cell l evel, to biofilms. Our approach is to homogenize biofilms, perform single -cell RNA sequencing, and bin the subpopulations based on their transcriptomic profiles. This will allow us to identify unique transcripts in each subpopulation. Based on the assumpti on that biofilm cells with similar transcriptomes will be localized together in the biofilm, we will use these unique transcripts to identify the primary location of the subpopulations within the biofilm via FISH to regain the spatial information lost duri ng homogenization. Ultimately, we aim to identify distinct spatiotemporal subpopulations within a biofilm via their gene expression profiles and to find new genes important for biofilm function. Keywords (up to 3): biofilm, -BIO and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: NUTRIENT -DEPENDENT EFFECTS PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM FORMATION Abstract to the resilience of biofilm -resident pathogens is their protective extracellular matrix. Several studies suggest that ex tracellular matrix proteins are vital to biofilm formation. Previously, we identified 60 candidate biofilm matrix proteins in the opportunistic pathogen and paradigm biofilm organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa . One highly abundant candidate, OprF, has also been identified in other P. aeruginosa proteomic analyses of the biofilm matrix. However, the role of OprF in biofilm formation is unclear, as the published data conflict. Results Here we show that this conflict may be due to differences in cultivation method s. A oprF strain grown in TSB under static conditions for 24 hours produced 60% less biofilm than the isogenic wild -type strain. In contrast, this biofilm defect was absent when oprF was grown in LB, suggesting that the effects of OprF on biofilm formati on are nutrient -dependent. While both media contain protein digests as the primary carbon source, the major differences are that TSB contains glucose, potassium phosphate, and a lower sodium chloride concentration. We modulated these media components indiv idually to test if the difference in oprF biofilm phenotypes in these two media is attributable to these three ingredients. Under conditions of low sodium chloride or in the presence of glucose, oprF forms significantly less biofilm than wild type, like the observed TSB phenotype. The effect of sodium chloride on oprF biofilm formation is not likely due to a change in medium osmolarity, as the addition of glucose did not affect osmolarity but did change the biofilm phenotype. To address when the oprF biofilm defect begins, we grew biofilms to various time points in TSB. The oprF strain produces biofilms equal to wild type at 1, 4, 8, and 16 hours, suggesting that the defect develops between 16 -24 hours of maturation. Furthermore, although oprF mutants h ave been shown to produce more PQS, which has been linked to biofilm dispersal, we found that the oprF biofilm defect was independent of PQS production. Interestingly, oprF biofilms grown in TSB exhibit viable cell counts equal to those of WT, suggesting that the 60% reduction in biofilm biomass is due to decreased extracellular matrix, which we are currently testing. Conclusions Together, our data show that multiple media components affect the role of OprF in biofilm formation and suggest that OprF impac ts late -stage biofilm development. We are currently investigating if a common mechanism underlies the effects of these components on oprF biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-269-ASM -BIO and Title: Pseudomonas of exopolysaccharide (Psl, Pel, and Alginate), extracellular DNA, and proteins. P. aeruginosa forms biofilms in the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung that prevent clearance by antibiotics, and secretes a diverse re pertoire of infection -promoting toxins and enzymes. The zinc metalloprotease Pseudomonas Elastase (encoded by the lasB gene) is a major component of the secreted proteome of P. aeruginosa . Elastase and cell -cell adhesion pr oteins during infection, promoting immune evasion and dissemination. We hypothesize that Elastase is a biofilm -matrix associated protein and that this interaction is stable and mediated through interaction with the exopolysaccharide Pel. Methods: Elastase interactions with the biofilm matrix were assessed in a flow -based tube biofilm reactor system. Elastase matrix abundance was determined by Western Blot. To assess the stability of Elastase -matrix interaction in a tube biofilm system, an inducible lasB strain was initially cultured with induction. After biofilms were established, lasB induction was relieved and Elastase levels were measured over time to determine stability of matrix interactions. To determine which matrix components bind Elastase, exopolysac charide mutants were assessed for their ability to retain elastase in a tube reactor. Results: Elastase is a matrix retained enzyme. Elastase is stably maintained in the biofilm matrix at least 12 hours after inducible LasB production is shut off in flow c onditions. Elastase is enriched in the Pel-dominant biofilm matrix of wspFpsl mutants, but not in the matrix of the Psl - dominated wspFpel strain. Discussion: Elastase is stably maintained in the biofilm matrix by the exopolysaccharide Pel. Matrix associatio n of Elastase may have clinical ramifications, as CF clinical isolates commonly express Elastase and produce Pel in vivo. Elastase association with the biofilm matrix may serve as a way to concentrate exoproteolytic power near producer cells to promote imm une evasion, nutrient acquisition, and turnover of matrix proteins. While Elastase is the major exoprotease produced by P. aeruginosa , the role of other exoproteases produced by P. aeruginosa in biofilm biology remains understudied and is an active area of interest. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-272-ASM -BIO Topic 1: and Function of Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: DEFINING A ROLE FOR ANCHORING AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS Abstract Background: Attachment is vital for surface association and biofilm formation. Stable attachment of Agrobacterium tumefac iens requires polysaccharide (UPP). extracellular polysaccharide adhesins, but only a subset have discrete polar localization. Some A. tumefaciens UPP biosynthesis and secretion proteins are similar to those of the Caulob acter crescentus polar holdfast . A. tumefaciens elaborates two distinct UPP polysaccharides (UPP GlcN and UPP GalN) whereas the C. crescentus has a single holdfast polysaccharide. The C. crescentus holdfast is anchored to the cell by the holdfast anchor (Hfa) protein complex. The A. tumefaciens UPP anchoring system is not defined and there are no Hfa homologs, indicating that the anchoring mechanism is distinct. Here we focus on UppF, an O -antigen li gase homolog required for attachment, and its role in UPP anchoring to the cell. Methods: Congo Red colony staining and biofilm assays were used to detect and quantify polysaccharide presence and function. Genetic analyses were used to demonstrate the role of uppF in UPP function. Key site -specific UppF point mutants were examined for loss of UPP function and their interaction with UppF wt. Results and Conclusions: UppF shares antigen ligase. We hypothesize tha t UppF anchors the UPP to the cell via outer membrane LPS. In a UPP -overproducing background, a uppF colony stained intensely with Congo red, a polysaccharide -binding dye, indicative of UPP production, but loss of uppF decreased biofilm formation. This su ggests the uppF mutant is defective in stable UPP association with the cell surface rather than UPP biosynthesis, consistent with an anchoring defect. The predicted UppF membrane topology is similar to WaaL, including a large periplasmic loop that contain s both a conserved arginine required for O -antigen ligation and a conserved active site histidine. Point mutations impact these conserved residues, UppF R287A or UppF H319A, resulted in the inability to complement a uppF mutant for biofilm formation co mpared to the UppF Wt. WaaL forms multimers and may function as When either the UppF R287A or UppF H319A were expressed in a UPP+ background, there was a dominant negative phenotype resulting in reduced biofilm formation. These data suggest that UppF may form multimers and that UppF 2022 -A-273-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: ASSEMBLY OF ROBOTIC SUPERSTRUCTURES FOR BIOFILM REMOVAL AND PATHOGEN DETECTION Abstract Body: Background The use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) provides a promising route for biofilm treatment since it displays peroxidase -like activity that efficiently catalyzes H 2O2 for antimicrobial effects, while magnetic field enables precise control over its positio ning. However, current approaches cannot be applied to biofilm removal from complex topographies and lack the ability to retrieve biofilm samples for diagnostic purposes. Methods Biofilms were formed on saliva -coated 3D printed slabs, 3D printed teeth or ex vivo human teeth using different microorganisms, including albicans SC5314, and human in u ltrafiltered (10 -kDa cut -off) tryptone -yeast glucose 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 to mid -exponential phase. Saliva -coated substrates were mounted vertically in 24 -well plates and inoculated with bacterial or fungal cells in containing 1% (w/v) sucrose at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for 43 h. The culture medium was changed at 19 and 29h. The IONPs were synthesized via a solvothermal method, while the magnetic fields (from 0 to 90 mT) were controlled by Arduino and generated by H elmholtz coils. Results We show that application of dynamic magnetic fields leads to the assembly of IONPs into bristle -shaped robotic superstructure. We find that the superstructure can extend, retract and generate shear stress (from 10.4 to 229.8 N m-2) to dislodge biofilms formed on complex surface topographies with microscale precision. Unexpectedly, its shape conforms to various surface geometries such as repeated circular, square, and triangular patterns while producing reactive biomolecules for effec tive biofilm removal and microbial eradication. Furthermore, it can collect bacterial, fungal, and viral components allowing quantitative measurement for diagnostic analysis. Finally, we show an application for automated biofilm removal and pathogen detect ion on natural, ex vivo human teeth that mimic the complex anatomical and surface features. Conclusions Our data reveal that the robotic superstructures are capable of mechanochemical biofilm removal, microbial killing, and multi -kingdom pathogen detection from complex surface topographies including human teeth. This approach could lead to autonomous, multifunctional antibiofilm platforms to advance current modalities in oral care and in other fields contending with biofilms on hard -to-reach surfaces. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-275-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: Characterization of hypothetical proteins essential for temperature -dependent adaptation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract Body: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram -negative opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with infections in open wounds, medical implant devices, burn victims, and within the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa infections are worsened by its ability to form robust biofilms, which have been shown to increase antibiotic resistance a 1,000 -fold compared to its planktonic c ounterparts. Not only can P. aeruginosa infect humans, but it is also capable of thriving in other ecosystems including water/sewage lines, infections in plants and in natural bodies of waters. With such a wide range of environments, finding potential drug targets unique to environmental versus host ecosystems can play a role minimizing the emergence of antibiotic resistance in human infections that arise from environmental reservoirs. Our lab aims to characterize genes that regulate or impact biofilm forma tion in response to temperature shifts. Using a commercially available transposon mutant library of P. aeruginosa PA14, we have been able to characterize about 6,000 mutants based on their ability to form biofilms at 23\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 37\u00b0 and 40\u00b0C. Each mutant has a gene which has been inactivated due to the insertion of a transposon sequence. When a mutant is characterized as a defective biofilm former, then we can conclude the associated gene is essential for biofilm formation at a given temperature. We have been able to characterize several known and unknown genes as uniquely required for biofilm formation at environmentally -relevant temperatures (23\u00b0 and 30\u00b0C), and/or host - relevant temperatures (37\u00b0 and 40\u00b0C). In this work, we describe the characterization of no vel hypothetical proteins required for biofilm adaptation to environmental temperatures. We explored the role of these hypothetical proteins in a plant infection model to determine the importance of biofilm thermal adaptation in environmental colonization. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-278-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure Title: Novel Biosynthetic Gene Body: Background Streptococcus mutans is widely associated with initiation of early childhood caries. A novel biosynthetic gene cluster, butyrolactone -ladderane hybrid (BL-BGC), has been reported in the most prevalent S. mutans strain (genotype G18) observed in high caries risk population of children. The purpose of this study is to assess the role of the BL -BGC in cariogenic and fitness traits using mutans UAB -10 -BGC was used as the wild -type strain and a BL-BGC mutant was generated using insertional mutagenesis with kanamycin resistance cassette. Isolates were plated on Todd Hewitt Agar (THA), cultured and then sub -cultured to an optical densi ty OD 600 in Todd Hewitt Broth inoculated at 1:1,000 in THB +1% 200 L plated in a 96 -well microtiter plate. Three biological and three technical replicates were used per assay. Growth curves were assessed using 1:100 in THB only. OD 470 was measured every 30 minutes using an automated plate reader. Known cariogenic S. mutans UA159 was used as a cross experiment control. Biofilms and growth curve were incubated in 5% carbon dioxide at 37oC for 16 hours. Biofilms were assessed for biomass (crystal violet assay), intracellular polysaccharide iodine assay), pH (alamar blue assay). Results The BL -BGC mutant demonstrated a significant increase in cell density OD 470 (p<0.001) and a significant reduction (p <0.001) in biofilm formation as compared to wild -type. Growth curve data indicated a growth defect when sucrose is absent for BL -BGC mutant. Since biomass was almost completely inhibited in the BL-BGC mutant sub sequent IPS, pH and environmental stress biofilm data was affected. Wild -type UAB -10 also produced significantly less biomass than UA159, which is consistent with previous reports by our lab for this strain. Conclusions The finding that BL -BGC dramatically impacts biofilm formation within S. mutans was surprising since previous work with single gene knockouts (butyrolactone and ladderane) did not show any significant difference in biomass. BL-BGC also had a significant impact on the growth of S. mutans whic h is sucrose dependent. Although the successful knockout of the BL -BGC cluster was confirmed by PCR, whole genome sequencing is currently in process to confirm. Future studies will evaluate the transcriptomics and metabolomics of these strains to determine the role of BL -BGC in the regulation of biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-296-ASM -BIO and Function Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: Background pathogen that is the causative agent of numerous infectious diseases. It is highly resistant to antibiotic treatments and is one of the most common causes of chronic nosocomial infections, primarily due to its excellent biofilm -forming ability. The biofilm matrix consists of diff erent extracellular components, such as polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA. Recent studies demonstrate that several bacteria utilize functional amyloid fibrils (A) to fortify the extracellular proteins, Fap A -F. FapC and FapB contain repeated motifs that contribute to the -sheet structure, but FapC is believed to be the main protein to form Fap fibrils. Our goal in this research was to chara cterize the effect of A on biofilm formation and structure in P. aeruginosa and to understand their assembly mechanism. Methods We overexpressed the fap operon in P. aeruginosa and performed a static biofilm and motility assays. Next, we created a two -plasmid system that alternately lacks one of the fap operon components in order to characterize the role of fap Operon components in biofilm formation. Additionally, we wanted to asses weather A and polysaccharides in the biofilm matrix interact. We performed a static biofilm assay on P. aeruginosa strains lacking several polysaccharide encoding genes. Lastly, to test whether the A could serve as a target for anti -biofilm treatment and used the synthetic D -enantiomeric ANK -6 peptide designed against A struct fap operon resulted in inhibition of motility abilities and in elevated biofilm formation in P. Aeruginosa. We observed that the induction of A depends on the expression of the whole operon. The results also indicate that in the absence of FapB, FapC expression is not enough for biofilm formation. Additionally, we observed that in the lack of specific polysaccharide ( pel), the A contribution to the biofilm formation is minor. Finally, when treated with ANK -6, biofilm leve ls were lower by 50%. Conclusions We can conclude that the fap operon is a significant matrix factor in biofilm and it has possible interaction with polysaccharides. over all, the findings of this research constitute an essential step toward a better understanding of the functionality of the amyloid's fibrils in P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix, and pave the way to design novel anti -biofilm drugs that target the amyloid component in the biofilm matrix. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-299-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT REGULATION Clostridium perfringens BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background Pathogenic bacteria adapt to the host's internal and external environment to establish the infection and survive in the environment. Temperature is one of the important environmental cues for pathogens to recognize inside and outside of the hosts. Clostrid ium perfringens , a Gram -positive, obligately anaerobic bacterium, causes gas gangrene and food poisoning. They produce the proteinous extracellular matrix at the external host temperature (25\u00b0C), forming thick elastic pellicle biofilms that confer stress t olerance to oxygen and desiccation. In contrast, biofilms with less biofilm matrix tightly adhere to the surfaces at the internal host temperature (37\u00b0C). Thus, temperature -dependent biofilm morphology change is one of the survival strategies for C. perfri ngens to adapt to various environments (Obana et al. 2020. npj biofilms & microbiomes). We hypothesize that temperature -regulated genes other than the biofilm matrix have a role in the adaptation. In this study, we aim to identify the genes expressing differentially at different temperatures and elucidate the regulation mechanism. Methods We quantified the gene expression by RNA -seq and RT -qPCR. To analyze the promoter activities, we constructed and used fluorescence reporter strains. Results RNA -seq analysis showed that 39 genes were differentially expressed at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C in C. perfringens . These included genes involved in utilizing host -derived such as myo -inositol ( iol), citrate, and acid metabolism, as well as the biofilm matrix operon. Amongst these genes, the expression of the iol operon was substantially increased at 25\u00b0C. We found that temperature did not influence the iol promoter activity while the half -life of iol mRNA was notably increased at 25\u00b0C. These suggest that the temperat ure- dependent expression changes of the iol operon are caused by the regulation of mRNA stability. Conclusions This study has revealed that Clostridium perfringens alters the expression of various genes involved in the utilization of host cell components at different temperatures. Furthermore, we found that the iol operon, which is necessary for the utilization of myo -inositol, an abundant nutrient in host cell components and soil, is regulated by the temperature at the post -transcriptional level. C. perfrin gens may quickly optimize the metabolic activities in response to the surrounding environmental changes, such as host death and excretion, in accordance with changes in biofilm morphology. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-310-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: GROWING BIOFILMS IN CHEMOSTATS Abstract Body: Background: In nature, most bacteria grow in biofilms. But laboratory techniques have traditionally focused on plankto nic growth for bacteria, leading to questions concerning what biofilm growth -related phenomena may be overlooked when using these in vitro techniques. Platforms for growing biofilms typically use microplates or small growth chambers that limit population s ize. Here, we develop a continuous culture system for biofilms that allows observation of not only biofilm - associated cells, but also bacteria leaving the biofilm and subsequently growing planktonically. Methods: Pseudomonas coverslips. Nascent biofilms are placed into the growth chamber of a Kubitschek - style chemostat with Davis Minimal Media and limited glucose. Planktonic growth is sampled from the outflow and quantified at 24 -hour intervals. At 96 hours, the biofilm is harvested, homogenized to a slurry, and then quantified by multiple methods. Results: Significant and sustained planktonic growth was observed in all trials, in contrast to traditional biofilm models in which disper sal is highly regulated. Growth of biofilm -associated P. aeruginosa was consistent but population size varied widely. The size of both planktonic and biofilm populations and their respective variability overall differed with the dilution rate of media into the chemostat, although this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Experimental platforms for biofilms are limited in number and type. Our novel system for growing biofilms in the laboratory allows for investigation of changes and dyn amics at the molecular, cellular, and population levels. In addition, this new system allows for investigation of differences in environmental and selection effects. Furthermore, biofilms grown in chemostats permit the study of two additional and likely im portant phenomena: 1. the decoupling of the dynamics of planktonically growing bacteria that originated from within the biofilm community and 2. the birth of secondary biofilm communities founded by members of the original biofilm. Chemostats allow for exp eriments to be designed to investigate hypotheses centered on these questions. We are currently developing additional approaches to explore these and other aspects of biofilm -associated growth using the chemostat experimental platform. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-316-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: EVOLUTION OF BIOFILM -ADAPTED GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES IN CLINICAL PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ISOLATES Abstract Body: Background The overall success of a pathogen depends on its ability to efficiently adapt to challenging conditions during infection. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for its remarkable adaptability, comprehensive knowledge of how it uses distinct adaptive mechanisms to increase its fitness is limited. Methods In this cross -sectional study, we analyzed genomic sequence variations and transcriptional profiles (recorded under non -selective planktonic as well as biofilm growth conditions) of >75 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from various infection sites to dissect the driving forces of bacterial adaptability. Results Gradual changes in gene expression patterns were found in clinical isolates when analyzing transcriptional profiles upon t he switch from planktonic to biofilm growth state. Specifically, the number of regulated genes (biofilm vs. planktonic) decreases, which we propose can be associated with increasing adaptedness of a clinical isolate. Our data indicates that loss -of-functio n mutations in the quorum sensing regulator LasR are partially responsible for the repeatedly observed adaptive gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we found that clinical isolates representing a biofilm -adapted state additionally exhibited increased lev els of the intracellular messenger c -di-GMP already during planktonic growth. The multi -layered integration of a plethora of adaptive traits suggests that clinical P. aeruginosa strains follow directed evolutionary pathways toward a constitutively expresse d, biofilm -adapted transcriptional profile that becomes independent of the environmental trigger. Conclusions The fixation of a biofilm -adapted transcriptional profile, such as that found in strains isolated from chronically infected CF patients, appears t o occur at various regulatory layers and involves the combinatorial accumulation of distinct adaptive traits. The insights gained in this study promise to provide a better understanding of the evolution of P. aeruginosa when adapting to the conditions enco untered during biofilm -associated infection, and thus promises to identify potential targets to combat difficult -to-treat chronic infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-326-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY FOR DISRUPTING BIOFILMS AND DECREASING BACTERIAL VIABILITY IN ISOLATED AND COCULTURED BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background Two common bacteria associated with medical devices are Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa ), and their development into biofilms impedes antibiotic effectiveness. A proposed treatment uses hyperthermia based on Photothermal Therapy (PTT). PTT use s near -infrared (NIR) light to stimulate photothermal nanoparticles (NPs) for the generation of heat. By embedding NPs in medical -grade silicone -based implants, localized hyperthermia at the interface of the implant and biofilm leads to rapid bacterial cel l death and precision treatment. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of PTT from NP -embedded silicone to augment the effectiveness of antibiotics against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm. Methods : PTT nanoparticles a ratio of 10mg of nanoparticles into 1g of silicone to form disks 5 mm in diameter and 1mm thick. Stimulation with 800 nm light rapidly increases nanocomposite (BSe) temperature. S. aureus (XEN40) and P. aeruginosa (PA01) were cultured on BSe disks for 24hr. Planktonic bacteria was removed, and biofilms were treated with 200ug/mL Ciprofloxac in (CPFX) and simultaneously exposed to 800 nm light at 5W for 25 seconds (PTT). Bacteria were quantified by counting colony -forming units (CFU) immediately following PTT. CFU data was compared to control biofilms grown on silicone disks with no NPs (Si di sks). Results: XEN 40 biofilms grown on BSe disks showed a 0.7 log reduction when treated with CPFX. When treated with CPFX and PTT, XEN40 biofilms grown on BSe had a 1.3 log reduction compared to CPFX alone and a 1 log reduction compared to biofilms grown on Si disks exposed to CPFX and PTT. After treatment with CPFX, PA01 biofilms grown on BSe had a 1.5 log in CFU. CPFX and PTT led to a 2.7e7 difference from treatment with CPFX alone, and a 1.2e7 difference from biofilms grown on Si exposed to the same treatment. Conclusions: PTT using medical -grade silicone embedded with PCPDTBSe nanoparticles generates sufficient heat to kill S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in biofilms. This heat generation increases the effectiveness of relevant antibiotics. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-339-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: EX VIVO TONGUE BIOFILM MODEL FOR ORAL MALODOR FORMATION Abstract Body: Background. Oral malodor is a serious concern for many in society, impacting health and wellbeing. Current in vitro models for oral malodor do not capture microbiological diversity and physiology of the human oral microbial ecosystem sufficiently to substa ntiate findings for applications. Here, we aimed to establish a human ex vivo tongue biofilm model for identification of novel functional ingredients for oral malodor. Methods. Tongue biofilm samples, collected from human volunteers were transferred to a g as-tight chamber with a stabilizing artificial saliva buffer in presence of different biofunctional compounds, including antimicrobials, polyphenols, sugar alcohols and potential prebiotic substrates. Formation of volatile sulphur compounds was monitored f or two hours using an automated gas chromatographer with a sulphur -specific detector. For more in - depth analysis of both sulphuric and non -sulphuric volatiles, accumulated gas was trapped on a sorbent tube and used for ad -line volatile metabolome analysis. Gas formation of samples was analyzed. Results. Different suspension buffers for the tongue biofilm samples impacted functionality and stability of the samples differently. Phosphate buffer and other nutrient free buffers generally led to a loss of microb ial VSC production capacity during incubation. Diluted and pre -reduced cultivation media led to stable VSC production capacity. We found a concentration - dependent reduction in VSC production capacity in presence of antimicrobials compounds such as zinc ace tate, sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine. More variable results were obtained with sugar alcohols, prebiotics and polyphenols. Of the sugar alcohols and potential probiotics, only maltose resulted in a significant reduction of VSC's. Both ammonium sulfate a nd sodium nitrate reduced VSC. This was also observed for arginine, but not for histidine. Polyphenols did not impact VSC production. Of the non -sulphuric volatile compounds, significant effects were detected on the formation of indole and 3 -methylindole. Prebiotic substrates affected SCFA production but generally did not impact volatile sulphuric compounds. Conclusions. The experimental procedure established enables efficient evaluation of compounds for their effects in the formation of sulphuric and non - sulphuric volatiles. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-345-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure of Biofilms Publishing Title: BACTERIAL QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI (QTL) MAPPING - A NOVEL METHOD FOR DECIPHERING THE GENETICS OF BIOFILM ARCHITECTURE Abstract Body: Background: Biofilms constitute the predominant form of microbial mass on Earth. In these complex microbial communities, c ells are encased in an extracellular matrix composed of chemically diverse biomolecules. Biofilms of different bacterial species and even closely related strains are characterized by marked variability in spatial architecture. The functional properties of these stratified communities are intimately related to their overall physical structure and genetically determined. Thus, characterizing the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms controlling the three -dimensional spatial organization of biofilms is essential in order to better understand their complex behavior and ultimately to improve therapeutic and community bioengineering strategies. Methods: To identify the genetic factors and mechanisms shaping variation in biofilm architecture, we applied a n ew method called bacterial QTL mapping. QTL mapping techniques are powerful tools in eukaryotic genetics for identifying the genetic loci that affect a phenotype of interest. However, the potential of this method for linking phenotypic to genotypic variabi lity in bacteria has remained unexplored because it relies on sexual recombination to break linkages between genetic variants. Our approach uses genome shuffling by protoplast fusion to mimic the effects of sexual recombination in bacteria. Using as parent s two closely related Bacillus subtilis strains that show marked differences in biofilm 3D structure, we constructed a panel of highly diverse recombinant strains. We developed custom automated tools and machine learning methods to measure the biofilm arch itecture of the QTL population in a high -throughput manner and to extract quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the surface -attached structures. Results: The recombinant strains showed extensive phenotypic variability in colony architecture and s preading abilities. We detected genetic hybrids that form structures strikingly different from those of the parents. These results suggested that co -occurrence and/or interaction between genetic determinants from different strains shape the overall structu re of the community. Using statistical computational methods, we are currently working on identifying the genetic variants responsible for building distinct 3D architectures Conclusions: We developed a new platform for identifying the genetic basis of biof ilm traits. These studies would lead to better understanding of biofilm structure -functions relationships. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-348-ASM -BIO Topic Title: ALGINATE aeruginosa is a gram -negative bacteria capable of persisting in a variety of niches due to its ability to form surface -adhered structures called biofilms.

In addition to known matrix components, we hypothesize that the biofilm matrix is extensively functionalized through re taining a diverse array of proteins. Our lab has previously identified and characterized two Psl -associated proteins. However, additional protein -EPS interactions remain unexplored. Alginate -producing mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa are of particular inter est due to their high resistance to antibiotics and association with a worse prognosis in chronic cystic fibrosis infections. Methods: We predict that an alginate -dominant biofilm matrix retains functionally diverse proteins via direct interactions with al ginate. To test this, purified P. aeruginosa alginate was used to isolate alginate -associating proteins from cell -free supernatants. Then LC used to identify the alginate -associated proteome. Results: We discovered that a distinctive proteome is retained by P. aeruginosa biofilms forme d using the negatively -charged EPS alginate. alginate -associated proteins that were identified protein (CbpD), and a secreted aminopeptidase (PaAP). These proteins appear to be retained in the matrix of bi ofilms grown under continuous flow. Characterization of the functional contribution of these matrix proteins to the biofilm community is ongoing. Conclusions: This is expected to provide additional insight into the mode of action of key virulence factors s ecreted by P. aeruginosa . Ultimately, this study will expand our understanding of the impact of specific EPS types on biofilm matrix proteome composition. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-356-ASM and Function Extracellular Biofilm Determinants Publishing Title: of bacter ial cells encapsulated in a three - dimensional, self -produced extracellular matrix that enable the bacteria to adhere onto biotic and abiotic surfaces. The extracellular matrix of Typhimurium biofilms is composed of curli, which for 85% of the matrix, cellulose, BapA, O -antigen capsule, colanic acid and extracellular DNA (eDNA) which protect the resident bacteria from diverse environmental stresses such as antibiotics and the host -immune response. Studies have shown that curli plays a significant role in the establishment of the extracellular matrix. Curli interacts with eDNA and cellulose to create a -mesh like network that stabilizes the biofilm, aids in surface adherence and confers properties of elasticity to the biofilm. Although curli, cellulose, eDNA, and their interactions have been studied, it is not clear how BapA, O -antigen capsule and colanic acid contribute to Salmonella biofilm structure. Methods Here, we examined the individual role of the matrix componen ts, in biofilm formation and biofilms by Congo red -Coomassie blue staining and the biomass by crystal violet assay of the mutants. Next, we utilized the open -source tools for computational analysis of 3D structure that was developed by our group to identify the contribution of each matrix component into the material properties of the biofilm. Results Curli was the most significant contributor to the rigidity and the 3D structure of the biofilm architecture, however we identified contributions of each matrix component to the material properties of the biofilm using the above - mentioned assays. Conclusions Our results show th at curli is a significant contributor to biofilm formation and architecture more so than any of the other matrix components. Understanding the contributions of each component of the extracellular matrix to biofilm formation and rigidity, with curli being t he most significant contributor, could lead to improvements in therapeutic treatments of STm biofilm associated diseases. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-361-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: MICROCAPSULE -TEMPLATED POLYMICROBIAL AGGREGATES TO ENABLE THE STUDY OF AGGREGATE PHYSIOLOGY Abstract Body: Background Microbes predominantly live in aggregates or biofilms, a lifestyle that generates physiological characteristics exceeding each cell's genetic contributions. Aggregate -associated physiology, including enhanced stress tolerance, is consequential in human hea lth, industry, and the environment. Despite its importance, our current inability to manipulate community and structure in environmentally sampled or lab -cultured aggregates limits the investigation of aggregate -related phenomena. Here, we present a reprod ucible, high hydrogel -shell microcapsules. culture method is paired with time -lapse microscopy to study the early -stage aggregate formation dynamics and emergent community physiology of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , two pathogens implicated in human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and chronic wounds. Methods PEG-maleimide shelled microcapsules are made using: (1) drop - based microfluidics to generate cor e-shell precursor droplets; (2) dextran and PEG phase separation to create a distinct core -shell boundary; and (3) maleimide chemistry to ensure particle symmetry and biocompatible gelation. Iso - and poly - microbial aggregates grow from single cells in thes e microcapsules, accessing nutrients via diffusion through the hydrogel shell. The resulting aggregates are stressed by suspending the microcapsules in antimicrobial or nutrient -depleted aqueous solutions. The physiology of microbes during cultivation and treatment is monitored via time -lapse confocal microscopy. Results (1) Using two medically relevant bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we compare iso - and poly -microbial culture in hydrogel microcapsules to other microculture platforms, including water -in-oil drop emulsions and solid hydrogel particles . (2) We demonstrate that hydrogel microcapsule cultivation produces templated iso - and poly -microbial aggregates that express biofilm physiology. (3) Finally, we assay the aggregates templated using hydrogel microcapsules for their response to starvation and antimicrobial stress. Conclusions This work presents a robust, well -characterized me thodology for the high -throughput production of microscale microbial aggregates and demonstrates their utility in testing the response of early -stage biofilm community dynamics to various stresses. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-362-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: MYCOBACTERIOPHAGES EXHIBIT ANTIBIOFILM ACTIVITY AT HIGH MULTIPLICITIES OF INFECTION Abstract Body: Background: Biofilm formation has been shown to be a very effective survival mechanism used by many bacteria pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, unlike other bacteria, mycobacterial biofilms tend to be very rich in lipids, and this accords them much more resilience than their carbohydrate -based counterparts'. Mycobacteriophage therapy, as an up and coming technology, is envisaged t o revolutionize the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), particularly involving antibiotic resistant Mtb. Antibiofilm activity therefore, is a highly sought after characteristic of mycobacteriophages intended for therapeutic use. Methods: Phages were isolated f rom soil and sewage samples and were initially characterized based on their plaque morphologies, adsorption rate, burst time and burst sizes. Then the spot assay was used to determine the mycobacteriophage host range of (n = 60) Mtb clinical isolates from pulmonary and extra pulmonary sites. The phage -susceptible Mtb (n= 46) were grown in 7H9 broth on MBEC\u00ae plates for one and two weeks in order to establish active and standing biofilms, respectively. The biofilms were infected with a cocktail of three broad host range mycobacteriophages at five multiplicities of infection (MOI) 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 for one week. After phage infection, residual biofilm mass was measured as the optical density (600nm) of the biofilm associated dye following crystal violet staining. Phage anti -biofilm activity was expressed as the percentage reduction in biofilm of the no -phage treated -biofilms. Results: Four out of the six mycobacteriophages isolated displayed a host range of more than 50% against the Mtb clinical isolates. Mtb isolates from the pulmonary origin were more susceptible to phage infection compared to those of extrapulmonary origin. The mycobacteriophages cocktail reduced biofilm formation up to 40% in active biofilms and up to 30% in standing biofilms. Despite varying susceptibility to phage infection, there was no significant difference in antibiofilm activity against pulmonary and extrapulmonary Mtb isolates. Finally, we found that phage antibiofilm activity was directly proportional to the MOI. Conclusion: Overall, our findings demonstrate the antibiofilm potential of mycobacteriophages, and continue to endorse phage therapy as a treatment alternative to our failing antibiotic arsenal. We recommend further investigations to understand the basis of the observed host preference in mycobacteriophages. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-364-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Development of Standard Protocols to Assess RelA Inhibitors Abstract Body: Background The key enzyme in the process of metabolic quiescence and persister cell formation in bacteria is RelA. RelA is a highly conserved pyrophosphotransferase. This enzyme is responsible for sensing amino acid starvation and is self -regulating within a bacteria l biofilm. RelA catalyzes the reaction between GTP and pppGpp (guanosine ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate). These molecules a transcriptional change resulting in the formation of persister cells. Previ ously, a novel class of compounds for the inhibition of RelA has been developed in our lab. This work aims to use standardized methods to probe the efficacy of these compounds against bacterial biofilms. Using a novel protocol to obtain viability count on both persister cells and active cells within a biofilm. In previous studies this has been difficult as aggregates of cells form a single Colony Forming Unit (CFU). Methods To disrupt the biofilms and its aggregates to get accurate CFU counts, two methods h ave been employed: a mechanical approach using sonication and chemical and biochemical approach utilizing DNAse, Chloroquine, monoclonal antibodies, and mixture of these. These methods were compared and then utilized to test RelA inhibitors for their effic acy. Results Both the mechanical application and biomechanical approach have shown efficacy disrupting the biofilms to obtain accurate CFU counts. The different intensity of sonication and chemical/biochemicals were used to disrupt the biofilms and its agg regates. These two approaches allow us to detect a reduction in formation of persister cells and higher antibiotic susceptibility. Conclusion In the mechanical approach, the sonication method uses sound waves to break the biofilm aggregates apart. In the biochemical approach, chloroquine helps reversal of mature biofilm (Z -DNA form) back to its early biofilm (B -DNA form) and DNase degrades the B form of extracellular DNA (eDNA) present in the matrix. The monoclonal antibodies target to disrupt the DNA bindi ng proteins where it stabilizes the eDNA in the biofilm matrix. Combination of monoclonal antibodies with chloroquine give more accurate CFU/mL counts. These methods have allowed us to probe the efficacy of the RelA inhibitors demonstrating the reduction i n persister cell formation and increased antibiotic susceptibility. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-374-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Growing biofilms in microdroplets for the development of a high -throughput methodology to characterize biofilm communities Abstract Body: Background Microdroplets \u2014sub-nanoli ter oil -water emulsions that generated as ultra -high -throughput independent bioreactors \u2014serve as a powerful tool to interrogate microbial community interactions. Our group employs microdroplets to dissect diverse natural communities into subset comm unities to study how membership influences community behavior. However, these studies have focused on planktonic growth, and current options of studying biofilms using microfluidics in the literature remain limited in throughput and design. Methods Thus, w e explored the use of hard plastic beads to grow biofilms within nanoliter droplet cultures of minimal defined media. For ease of visualization, we utilized fluorescent strains of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens . Results We demonstrate that biofilms can form on and between polystyrene (PS) beads under static conditions and that these biofilms are durable enough to resist certain physical manipulations. We additionally co -encapsulated our test strains with PS beads and can detect bacterial growth within these droplets. Future work will focus on developing generalizable and high -throughput methods of detecting biofilm formation on the beads. Moreover, we will refine the co -encapsulation system to more precisely tune and stand ardize the average number of beads per droplet, which may create environments that are more favorable for biofilm formation. Finally, we will develop methods to manipulate pooled beads that have been extracted from droplets, removing planktonic cells from downstream analysis. Conclusions Our bead encapsulation system represents a tradeoff between throughput and manipulatable experimental factors. Unlike microfluidic flow cells, which can only support a set number of growth chambers, our system can generate any number of droplets. And unlike encased droplets, whose shells can only be formed from limited material types, our system can encapsulate beads made from a wider range of materials, allowing for the study of biofilm formation on diverse surfaces. Howeve r, our microdroplets are unable to support continuous flow culturing. Thus, this encapsulated bead system could be used in parallel with other microfluidic methods or as an initial screen to select promising candidates for lower -throughput methodologies. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-389-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Metabolism, Physiology and Structure Biofilms Publishing Title: IDENTIFYING HOW DOS OF MYCOMEMBRANE COMPONENTS Abstract Body: Background: Chronic pulmonary bacterial infection is the primary cause of respiratory failure and death amongst Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Pulmonary infections by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS), are notoriously difficu lt to treat, demonstrating persistent infections recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy. Biofilm formation allows chronic pulmonary pathogens to survive antibiotic therapy and is triggered by specific environmental cues. One such cue, low oxygen concentrations , is prevalent in CF sputum. NTM enter dormancy through the DosSR two -component system under anoxia, which changes cellular physiology and increases antibiotic tolerance. A critical early step in NTM biofilm formation is cell -cell adhesion, characterized b y the formation of cellular aggregates in liquid culture. Cell surface remodeling is a known way that MABS adapt to the host lung, and previous studies have implicated regulation of glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) to be involved in biofilm formation. Here we hypothesize that under hypoxic conditions, activation of DosSR influences aggregation through cell wall modification. Methods: To elucidate how these systems regulate biofilm formation, we have created a library of mutants of DosR regulon components and GPL b iosynthesis genes. We use an in vitro aggregation assay to quantify changes in aggregation throughout culture maturity, allowing for exploration of early biofilm formation. In addition, use of a bioreactor system will help to quantify the impact of low -oxygen environments on NTM biofilm formation. Results: Preliminary data indicates that NTM require oxygen to transition between an aggregated and planktonic state. In addition, mutation of the dosR hypoxic response regulator results in disrupted regulation of aggregation. Finally, we have determined that a GPL deficient mutant of the model NTM Mycobacterium smegmatis constitutively aggregates, indicating that GPLs may be required for dispersal. Conclusions : By identifying key regulatory components of NTM biofi lm formation and how they shape early biofilm formation, we hope to identify targets for novel therapeutics to prevent or disperse biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Poster Session III Abstracts Control Number: 2022 -A-79-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Signals and Mechanisms Promoting Biofilm Disassembly and Dispersal Publishing Title: IMPACT OF SMALL RESISTANCE IN ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII Body: Background; The study aimed to evaluate the underl ying mechanisms by which sRNA00203regulates the expression of genes involved in the development of biofilm -specific antibiotic resistance. Methods; sRNA prediction and differential expression analyses were performed using total RNA -seq data obtained from b iofilm and planktonic cells. The expression of the gene encodingsRNA00203 was verified using SYBR Green and TaqMan assays. The sRNA00203 -mutant strain was constructed using double allelic exchange facilitated by suicidal vectors. The mutant strain was also complemented with a gene encoding sRNA00203 using the pWH1266 -telR system. Results; The expression of sRNA00203 was 45 times higher in biofilm cells than in planktonic cells. Deletion of the gene encoding sRNA00203 decreased the biomass of the biofilm by sRNA00203 -mutant strain than in the wild -type strain, respectively, Inactivation of the gene encodingsRNA00203 sensitized the biofilm cells to imipenem and ciprofloxacin, not to colistin. TheMBEC of imipenem was 128-fold lower in the sRNA00203 -mutant than in the wild -type strain.Deletion of the gene encoding sRNA00203 decreased the expression of genes involved in matrix synthesis, efflux pumps, and lipopolysaccharides -specific inhibition of sRNA00203 presents a strategy for treating -specific infections or resensitising biofilms to imipenem and ciprofloxacin. This is the first study to show the effects of sRNA00203 on biofilm - specific antibiotic resistance, which could beused as drug targets for treating Acinetobacter biofilm infections.

The rapidly increasing acquisition of antimicrobial resistance by K. pneumoni ae and the emergence of multi -drug resistant strains is an alarming problem in today's healthcare system worldwide. The virulence of intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents by K. pneumoniae increases dramatically with biofilm formation. Therefore, the rapeutic strategies alternative to antibiotics are required urgently against the rising resistance. Methods: Overall, 220 samples were collected from microbiology laboratories of various hospitals within KPK Pakistan. The K. pneumoniae was identified by mo rphological characteristics through different biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene typing. Different plant crude extracts were prepared in three solvents, water, methanol and N -hexane and evaluated against the K. pneumoniae in comparison to widely used antibiotics. Results: The isolates of K. pneumoniae were resistant to various broad - spectrum antibiotics including, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, Cefradine, Cefuroxime, Ceftazidime, Fosfomycin, Linezolid, Oxy -tetracycline and Gentamicin. Conversely, various pla nt extracts in different solvents were found to have anti -biofilm activity against the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates . Conclusions: K. hospital -acquired biofilm -forming pathogen causing severe life -threatening infections. K. pneu moniae worldwide rate of morbidity and mortality is high even with adequate use of antibiotics in treatment. In this study, 220 isolates of K. pneumoniae were isolated and tested against a variety of broad -spectrum antibiotics and medicinal plant extracts K. pneumoniae were found resistant to many tested antibiotics while various plant extracts showed antibacterial activity against the isolates.

Biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment due to multiple tolerance mechanisms (phenotypic resistance). This causes persistence of biofilm infections in spite of antibiotic exposure which predisposes to antibiotic resistance development (genetic resistance).

AERUGINOSA QUORUM SENSING INHIBITOR Abstract Body: Role of anti -miotic major nosocomial infective agent and a leading cause of serious infections in patients with i mmune deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and in patients with mechanical ventilation or with burn wounds. The multi -drug resistance in Pseudomonas is largely associated with increased mortality in the absence of novel therapeutics. Due to this increasing occurre nce of multidrug resistance, the World Health Organization classified P. aeruginosa as one of the most critical pathogens requiring the development of novel therapeutics. Also, it has been assigned critical priority in the recently released Indian Priority Pathogen List to guide research, discovery and development of new inhibitors. Here in this study, we have screened the FDA approved drugs against LasR, the master regulator of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa . We have found that some of the already approve d drug for human consumption can be repurposed and used as the inhibitor of quorum sensing. Here we have shown that Flurbiprofen an anti -miotic drug used against excessive constriction of pupil has anti -quorum properties and can be used as quorum sensing i nhibitor. To check whether it has anti QS activity or not we have measured the inhibition of biofilms and other virulence factor associated with QS such as swarming ability, protease, pyocyanin production and rhamnolipid production. Flurbiprofen have shown that there is significant decrease in virulence factor when treated with sub -MIC concentration (0.75\u00b5g/\u00b5L). This study can be very useful as it reports for the first time an anti -miotic can be repurposed as an anti - quorum and anti - biofilm agent and can b e used in eliminating infections and can be given in combination with the other antibiotics.

The detrimental role of Biofilms in the medical settings has been well established but not much information is available as regards biofilms in the domestic kitchen s. The aim of this study is to determine the population of the biofilms among the Carbapenem -Resistance -Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolated from kitchen sinks. Methods: A cross -sectional study was conducted in January 2022. Samples of 25 households were coll ected by rolling a swab stick a little down the sink holes in the kitchens. Isolates were identified by standard microbiological procedures and the isolated bacteria were screened for their susceptibility to antibiotics using the Kirby -Bauer disk diffusion techniques in line with the standards of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Isolates were identified as biofilms using Tube method (TM) and Congo Red Agar (CRA) methods of detection. Results: From the total 98 enterobacteri aceae identified, 18 were CRE and 08 were biofilms while 10 were planktonic cells. Conclusions: The economic importance of Biofilms in domestic kitchen cannot be swept under the carpet as they could be a source of recurrence infectious diseases in homes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-120-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Social and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: GENERAL STRESS RESPONSE OF SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM IN HETEROGENOUS BIOFILM COMMUNITIES AS A REACTION TO ECOLOGICAL COMPETITION: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS Abstract Body: Background: Social interactions are predicted to influence the emergence and spread of resistant strains in microbial communities, with the role of competitive interactions presumed as highly prominent. Numerous mechanisms seem to be implicated, yet the effects of com petition on population size, persistence, tolerance and mutation rate are deemed to be of the most importance. Nevertheless, the knowledge about the impact of such interactions on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is limited, particularly reg arding biofilms (habitats microbes commonly inhabit and where competition prevails). Overall, our study aims to understand how competitive interactions affect the emergence of resistance in biofilms and design strategies that interfere with these interacti ons in order to slow the development of AMR. Methods: We employed Salmonella Typhimurium as a model organism since it forms biofilms both in the environment and in the host, competing with various species. After selecting relevant intestinal bacteria exhib iting different levels of competition with Salmonella , we studied the impact of these interactions on the development of AMR via competition experiments, microscopy, gene expression analysis, fluctuation tests, experimental evolution, and mathematical mode lling. Results: Preliminary results indicate that competition profoundly influenced microbial physiology and led to the activation of the general stress response in Salmonella , mediated by the central regulator rpoS . In addition, several genes that are associated with enhanced mutation rate were upregulated. We confirmed that bacterial competition increased the mutation rate of Salmonella while the same induction was not observed in an rpoS knockout mutant. As such, communities experiencing higher levels of competition and a stronger upregulation of rpoS were associated with an accelerated resistance development to antibiotic treatment compared to the communities where competition was weaker. Conclusions: Our results show that interspecies competition can increase mutation rate and facilitate antibiotic resistance development via activation of the general stress response mediated by RpoS. In future research we aim to attenuate the enhanced mutation rate of Salmonella in mixed -species communities via RpoS inhibitors or strategies that would interfere with the mechanisms competitors utilize to compete with Salmonella . ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-121-ASM -BIO and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF INTRA AND INTER -SPECIES INTERACTIONS OF THE (Vp), a prominent member of the dental plaque, is an anaerobic diderm firmicute for which biofilm and intra - and inter -species aggregates formation are instrumental in its lifestyle. Its adhesin arsenal is composed of 12 monomeric and trimer ic adhesins (TAAs) of the autotransporter family (T5SS) presenting additional periplasmic domains compared to other previously described TAAs. We have previously shown that one TAA, VtaA, is involved in auto - aggregation and that both VtaA and a cluster of adhesins (VtaC -F) are involved in biofilm formation [1]. We now aim to further characterize Vp adhesins as molecular actors of co -aggregation between Vp and other bacteria and the role of their periplasmic domains. Methods Using deletion mutant library of Vp adhesins, we identified adhesins responsible for co-aggregation with various known members of the dental plaque by aggregation assay. We evaluated binding to surfaces by ELISA assay using whole -cell targeted antibody.After deletion of their respective p eriplasmic domain, we assessed activity of the previously identified adhesins by aggregation assays and western blot. Results and conclusions We evaluated the role of the different Vp adhesins in non -specific binding to surfaces and co -aggregation. While V taF promoted non -specific adhesion to surfaces, VtaA contributed to interaction with Streptococcus oralis and VtaE interaction with Streptococcus gordonii oris . Using a bank of S. gordonii mutants deleted for surface proteins [2], we identified the padA operon as responsible for binding with Vp. Implication of co -aggregation for the cells will be evaluated by co -transcriptomic experiments comparing WT strains and co -aggregation defective mutants. Periplasmic domains of the TAA s are either composed of a coiled -coil motif (found on VtaA, E and F) or an SLH domain. SLH domains of three adhesins of unknown function are being purified to investigate peptidoglycan binding activity. Deletion of the coiled -coil motif results in loss of function and reduced/absence of detectable proteins for the three adhesins suggesting an important role of this domain in production and stability of functional adhesins. Why these domains are not always presents in TAAs remains an opened question. This w ork will give us a better understanding of TAAs functionality and their impact on bacteria. 1 - B\u00e9chon et al. 2021 2 - Nairn BL ---PAGEBREAK --- Number: 2022 -BIO Topic 1: Asocial Biofilms Publishing Title: TRADE -OFFS CONSTRAIN ADAPTIVE PATHWAYS TO TYPE 6 SECRETION SYSTEM RESISTANCE BY DIRECTED EVOLUTION Abstract Body: Background: Many natural microbial communities, including biofilms, are characterized by intense competition for nutrients and space. One way for an organism to gain control of these resources is by eliminating nearby competitors. The Type VI Secretion System (T6) is a nano -harpoon used by many bacteria to inject toxins into neighboring cells. While much is understood about mechanisms of T6-mediated toxicity, little is known about the ways that competitors can defend themselves against this attack, especially in the ab sence of their own T6. Methods: Here we use directed evolution to examine the evolution of T6 resistance, subjecting eight replicate populations of Escherichia coli to T6 attack by Vibrio cholerae . Results: Over ~500 generations of competition, the E. coli evolved to survive T6 attack an average of 27 -fold better than their ancestor. Whole genome sequencing reveals extensive paral lel evolution. In fact, we found only two pathways to increased T6 survival: apaH was mutated in six of the eight replicate populations, while the other two pop ulations each had mutations in both yejM and yjeP. Synthetic reconstruction of individual and combined mutations demonstrates that yejM and yjeP are positively epistatic, with yejM requiring the mutation in yejP to provide a benefit. However, mutations we identified are pleiotropic, reducing cellular growth rates, and increasing susceptibility to antibiotics and elevated pH. Conclusion: These tradeoffs underlie the effectiveness of T6 as a bacterial weapon and help us understand how the T6 shapes the evolut ion of bacterial interactions in biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control 2022 Biofilms Publishing Title: The effect of gallbladder conditions on Salmonella persister cell formation Abstract Body: Background : Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). 3 -5% of individuals infected become chronic carriers with the gallbladder (GB) as the site of persistence. Gallstones (GS) aid in the development and maintenance of GB carriage, serving as a substrate to which salmonellae attach and form a biofilm. This biofilm matrix gives bacteria protection from the host immune system and environm ental stress. This shielded environment is an ideal place for the development of persister cells, a transient phenotype of a subset of cells within a population that allows survival after antibiotic treatment. Persisters can also arise in response to harsh environments such as the GB. Here we investigate if GB conditions affect the number of persisters in a Salmonella population. Methods : We simulated GB conditions in vitro using either ox or human bile. To culture biofilms we coated 96 -well plates with cho lesterol to simulate GS conditions. We then treated planktonic or biofilm Salmonella cultures with high concentrations of different antibiotics. Results : Human GB conditions significantly decreased the number of persister cells in biofilms treated with eit her ciprofloxacin or kanamycin in our lab strain of S. Typhi and had varied negative effects on persister numbers in several clinical isolates. In S. Typhimurium the addition of human bile also decreased the number of persister cells when treated with kana mycin. Interestingly, ox bile had no effect. Moreover, neither human nor ox bile influenced planktonic persister cell numbers in any of the conditions tested. Conclusion : Our data imply that conditions in the human GB can decrease the proportion of persist er cells in Salmonella populations, although the effect can vary depending on the strain. As expected, this effect appears to be restricted to biofilms. Additional studies could help develop an optimal treatment strategy that minimizes persister cells to c Number: 2022 Social and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: Cell group architecture dictates phage exposure in multispecies biofilms Abstract Body: Background Bacterial biofilm communities are highly abundant in natural settings, as are the threats faced by biofilm -dwelling microbes, such as phages. While biofilms formed by just a single species occur, multispecies biofilms are thought to be more typical of micr obial communities in the natural environment. How phage -host encounters change within multispecies biofilms remains mostly unexplored at the cellular spatial scale of interactions that ultimately underlie large scale patterns in biofilm -dominated microbial communities. Methods Our system consists of co - culture biofilms of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae under exposure to phages. Using microfluidic flow devices and confocal microscopy, we explore how the co -culture of these two bacteria i nfluences matrix section and biofilm architecture of E. coli , and how these changes in turn influence the ability of E. coli to protect itself from phage attack amid competition with V. cholerae. We explore how microscale biofilm structure is critical for cell-cell and cell -phage interactions leading to larger population wide patterns. Results Under certain conditions, biofilms dominated by V. cholerae can envelop E. coli cells into its densely packed biofilm architecture. If this occurs, incorporated E. coli cells are then shielded from exposure from phages, when they would otherwise lack their native biofilm defense to evade phage infection. These E. coli inclusions can t hen continue to proliferate with phages present. While co -culture growth allows for earlier protection from phages conferred by V. cholerae , it comes at the cost of competing with V. cholerae and a disruption of normal curli -mediated protection for E. coli even in co -culture biofilms over long time scales. Conclusions While typically these two bacteria negatively affect the growth of each other by competing for space and resources, the addition of phages changes this dynamic from being competitive to exploi tative for E. coli . ---PAGEBREAK --- -BIO and Asocial Biofilms Publishing Title: Quorum sensing controlled biofilm of P. mediates competition between P. E. coli , and E. faecalis Abstract Body: Despite competition for both space and nutrients, bacterial species often coexist within structured, surface -attached communities termed biofilms. While these communities play important roles in ecosystems and are agents of human infection, how multiple bacterial species assemble to form these communities and what physical and molecular processes underpin the comp osition of these poly -bacterial biofilms remains an active area of research. Using a model three -species community composed of P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and E. faecalis we show with microscale resolution that biased dispersal of the dominant community member , P. aeruginosa , prevents competitive exclusion from occurring, leading to coexistence of the three species. A P. aeruginosa bqsS deletion mutant no longer undergoes periodic mass dispersal, leading to local competitive exclusion of E. coli and E. faecalis . Introducing periodic, asymmetric dispersal behavior into a minimal, stochastic -spatial model increases the parameter space under which coexistence of competing species occurs, where otherwise one species displaces all others. This suggests that biased di spersal has the potential to be a strong mediator of interspecific competition in spatially assorted communities. Colonization experiments show that WT P. aeruginosa is superior at colonizing new areas in comparison to bqsS P. aeruginosa , but at the cost of decreased local competitive ability against E. coli and E. faecalis . Overall, our experiments document how one species' mediation of a competition -dispersal -colonization trade -off can go on to influence the stability of multispecies coexistence in spati ally structured environments. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control 2022 hominis. .

To unlock the full potential of these treatments, researchers n eed to consider the large impact that bacterial social interactions have on therapy outcomes. Of particular interest are cooperative resistance mechanisms, like -lactamases. It has been described how susceptible cells can survive high -lactam doses by th e producing cells' detoxicate actions, especially in biofilm. These producer/exploiter dynamics have been explored for intraspecies scenarios, yet not for interspecies. Translating this to combinatorial therapy, we hypothesize that exploitation by a probio tic could lead to its survival in the presence of a cooperatively resistant pathogen under otherwise lethal antibiotic concentrations, potentiating it to inhibit the pathogen when the antibiotic alone is not able to. Methods Biofilms of -lactamase producing Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) were grown in medium supplemented with 2,2' -bipyridyl, creating iron -limiting conditions (EcN) microcin action and mimicking the The efficacy of the cotreatment with cefotaxime (CTX) was evaluated for varying regimens. Results EcN is protected by the detoxification of ST at CTX concentrations reaching far above its monoculture survival potential. The strongest inhibition of ST was observed when inoculum densities were high, the inoculum ratio was evenly balanced and CTX administration delayed. However, due to negative -frequency dependent selection, EcN is not able to completely outcompete the pathogen under the assessed conditions. Conclusions CTX cannot inhibit biofilms of the cooperatively resistant ST, yet cotreatment with EcN significantly lowers its cell numbers. This indicates that cotreatment and exploitative competition by a probiotic can be a promising risk -spreading strategy, as suscepti ble pathogens will be inhibited by the antibiotic and cooperatively resistant pathogens by the probiotic. However, the degree of inhibition is limited. Whether this inhibition is sufficient in an in vivo context, where additional indirect effects of probio tics counteract the infection, remains to be investigated. Overall, our work provides factors that influence the inhibition of a cooperatively resistant pathogen and should be considered in the rational design of probiotic -antibiotic treatment strategies. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Biofilms Publishing Title: ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SOME MEDICINAL PLANTS AGAINST BIOFILM - FORMING METHICILLIN -RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS Abstract Body: IN VITRO ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SOME MEDICINAL PLANTS AGAINST BIOFILM -FORMING METHICILLIN -RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS Introduction: The prevalence of methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is slowly rising in Nigeria for the past few dec ades. Therefore, novel classes of antibiotics are indispensable to combat the increased incidence of newly emerging multidrug -resistant bacteria like MRSA. Plants have been commonly used in popular medicine of most cultures for the treatment of disease. Th e in vitro antibacterial activity of some Nigerian common medicinal plants used in traditional medicine has been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and anti - biofilm of these native plants and Aframomum melegueta (leaves, seeds, and stem) collected in Southwestern Nigeria against a panel of seven biofilm -forming MRSA. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum ricidal concentrations (MBC) of the plant extracts against MRSA were determined by the broth dilution method and the anti - biofilm assay of the most potent plant extract was performed. Result: The results revealed that, of the four plants, water extracts of leaves of Entada abysinnica, leaves of Croton macrostachyus, seeds and bark and seeds of Aframomum melegueta exhibited significant antibacterial activity. Based on the MIC/MBC ratio, the extracts of these plants were determined to be bacteriostatic in nature. Anti -biofilm assay showed that the extract of seeds of Aframomum melegueta and leaves of Croton macrostachyus fairly inhibited the growth of MRSA in the preformed biofilm matrix. Conclusion: These four medicinal plant species may re present a source of alternative drugs derived from plant extracts, based on folklore use and ethnobotanical knowledge from southwest Nigeria.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a biofilm forming bacteria commonly associated with chronic infections and more recently associated with new emerging pathogens like Asperg illus fumigatus (Af). Coinfections of Pa and Af are linked with poorer health outcomes in people with CF, but the underlying mechanisms of the interactions between these organisms are not well understood. Studies of Pa and Af have observed both competitive and synergistic interactions that can contribute to pathogenicity. Despite different observations, interactions between Pa and Af appear to be influenced by environmental factors and the spatial orientation of the pathogens. However, understanding of how these factors impact chronic infection is limited by the number of relevant in vitro models to study CF pathogen communities. Methods Here, we use an in vitro system that utilizes synthetic cystic fibrosis media (SCFM2) to create a physiologically relevant environment. Here we have osmotically adjusted SCFM2 to support the growth of human lung epithelial cells and the co -culture with Pa and Af. We use confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to quantify the spatial requirements for growth, interactions bet ween organisms, and the impact on Pa antibiotic treatment during co-culture. We use metaproteomics to define protein expression profiles of Pa and Af and compare with phenotypes and behavior observed with CSLM. Results CSLM data show human cells grown in i solation and co -cultured with Pa in osmotically adjusted SCFM2 have normal growth and morphology. CSLM also revealed Pa biofilm aggregates growing along Af hyphae without an observable killing effect. Our model also supports metaproteomic analysis of poly -microbial cultures; we can define and compare protein expression profiles and generate gene ontology analyses for each organism in a sample. Conclusions Here, we observe the inner workings of biofilm communities in a physiologically relevant environment. We find interactions between Pa and Af that haven't been seen with standard culture methods and corelate these observations with protein expression data. This data will improve our understanding of how Pa and Af interact in the CF lung and how they may be i nfluenced by or influence therapeutic treatments. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-143-ASM -BIO CELLS AND BIOFILM Abstract Body: Background : The environmental and widely -spread pan drug - resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the priority targets for the development of new antimicrobial agents. One of the promising antimicrobial approaches that may not develop resistance in the near future is antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation. In this study, we investigated the inf of the photosensitizer chlorophyllin and the cationic permeabilizer polyethylenimine (PEI), exposed to light -emitting diode (LED) on P. aeruginosa free-living planktonic sessile biofilm. Methods: The microdilution checkerboar d method was used to test antimicrobial susceptibility to determine bactericidal concentrations. As substrate for biofilms, the Calgary biofilm device was used. Quantification of the biofilm biomass was carried out using crystal violet assay. Results: The unilluminated chlorophyllin and PEI had no effect on eradicating the planktonic cells. On the other hand, the highest tested concentrations of the illuminated chlorophyllin alone (1000 and 2000 \u00b5g/ml) eradicated the planktonic cells by 100%. Interestingly, PEI (100 \u00b5g/ml) potentiated lower concentrations of the illuminated chlorophyllin (125 \u00b5g/ml) to completely eradicate the planktonic cells by 100%. The lowest tested concentrations of the illuminated chlorophyllin (31.25 -125 \u00b5g/ml) and PEI (100 \u00b5g/ml) sti mulated the biofilm formation. The highest tested concentrations of the illuminated chlorophyllin (2000 \u00b5g/ml) and PEI (1600 \u00b5g/ml), however, dislodged the established biofilm by 64 and 72%, respectively. Synergistically, illuminated chlorophyllin (125 \u00b5g/ ml) and \u00b5g/ml) dislodged the established biofilm by 76%. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that PEI ameliorates the antimicrobial activity of the chlorophyllin against P. aeruginosa planktonic and biofilm states. Further studies to investigate the e ffect of chlorophyllin and PEI on persister cells are in progress. Our findings may suggest that chlorophyllin in combination with other cell membrane destabilizing substances (lactic acid, EDTA, malate etc.) may be helpful to combat P. aeruginosa , a hypot hesis which will also be future. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-150-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Social and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PIGMENT PRODUCTION IS INDUCED BY GROWTH WITH PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND CONFERS CROSS -SPECIES PROTECTION AGAINST HOST IMMUNITY Abstract Body: Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly co-isolated from chronic lung and wound infections. Co -infections are more problematic than mono -species infections. Understanding the mechanisms of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus interaction is crucial for treating co -infections. Staphyloxanthin (STX) is a yellow pigment synthesized by the S. aur eus crt operon. It can promote S. aureus resistance to oxidative stress and neutrophil -mediated killing. Methods: S. aureus colonies, spotted at different distances from P. aeruginosa , were examined for changes in STX. Planktonically -grown S. aureus was treated with different P. aeruginosa exoproducts, and their STX production was measured. P. aeruginosa survival to hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) killing was quantified in the presence or absence of wild -type (WT) and STX -deficient S. aureus . P. aeruginosa burden was monitored during mono - or co -infection with S. aureus in the presence of human neutrophils and a mouse wound infection model. Results: The STX production in S. aureus , grown as either colony biofilms or planktonically, was elevated when exposed to the P. aeruginosa exoproduct, 2 - heptyl -4-hydroxyquinoline N -oxide (HQNO). This observed using both mucoid and non -mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. When subjected to H 2O2 or human neutrophils, P. aeruginosa survival was significantly higher when mixed with WT S. aureus , in comparison to P. aeruginosa cultured alone or with an S. aureus crt mutant deficient in STX production. In a mouse wound infection model, the burden of P. aeruginosa co-infected with WT S. aureus was the highest compared with P. aeruginosa mono -infection or co -infection with a crt mutant. Among all the clinical isolates sampled, 72.4% of the 29 P. aeruginosa isolates could induce STX production in co -culture with WT S. aureus . Additionally, WT P. aeruginosa could induce STX production in 75% of the 61 S. aureus isolates examined. Conclusions: P. aeruginosa HQNO can induce STX production in S. aureus . In turn, STX can protect both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa from H 2O2 and human neutrophil killing. Co -culture also enhances P. aeruginosa colonization in vivo. This STX -induction phenotype is prevalent among clinical isolates. The completion of this study will further our understanding of how P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cause co -infections cooperatively. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-161-ASM -BIO Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: Interkingdom assemblages in human saliva display group -level surface mobility and disease -promoting emergent functions Abstract Body: Background Fungi and bacteria often engage in complex interactions that cause many human infections with enhanced virulence, including severe childhood tooth decay. How such distinctive microbes from different kingdoms act in concert spatiotemporally to initiate biof ilms and to drive disease -promoting functionality remains unknown. Methods Interkingdom assemblages of Candida albicans (fungi) and Streptococcus mutans (bacteria) in saliva of patients affected by childhood tooth decay are analyzed via multiscale imaging. An experimental model is developed to investigate the dynamics of fungal -bacterial interactions in human saliva and their biofilm development on tooth s urfaces. The spatial organization, mechanical/antimicrobial tolerance, and growth dynamics of surface -attached assemblages are assessed using flow -cell microfluidics coupled with time -lapse confocal live imaging and computational analyses. An ex vivo human tooth enamel model is used to investigate the disease -promoting functions of the assemblages. Results We find native -state assemblages of C. albicans and S. mutans with highly structured arrangement in saliva from diseased patients. Bacterial clusters are attached within a network of yeasts, hyphae, and exopolysaccharides, which bind to surfaces as a pre -assembled cell group. The interkingdom assemblages exhibit emergent functions, including enhanced surface colonization and growth rate, stronger antimicro bial tolerance, and improved shear resistance, compared to either species alone. Unexpectedly, the interkingdom assemblages display a new form of migratory spatial mobility that enables fast spreading of biofilms across surfaces and causes more extensive t ooth decay. Using mutants, selective inactivation of species, and selective matrix removal, we demonstrate that the enhanced stress tolerance and surface mobility arise from the exopolymeric matrix and require the presence of both species in the assemblage . The mobility is directed by fungal filamentation as hyphae extend and contact the surface, lifting the assemblage with a \"forward -leaping or walking\" motion. Bacterial cell clusters can 'hitch -hike' on the mobile unit while continuously growing, to sprea d across the surface three -dimensionally and merge with other assemblages, promoting community expansion. Conclusions Our results reveal a self -organizing interkingdom assemblage in human saliva that behaves like a supraorganism, with disease -causing emerg ent functionalities that cannot be achieved without co -assembly. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-171-ASM -BIO Asocial Publishing Title: SURFACE DEPENDENT INHIBITION STRAINS Abstract Body: Background: The biofilm lifestyle is favored by many organisms and understanding inter -bacterial interactions that occur between co -isolated b acterial species can provide novel information about bacterial defense mechanisms, antibacterial targets, and the impact on host immunity during co -infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium abscessus inhabit the same soil and water reservoirs and both can cause pulmonary infection in people with inflammatory lung diseases and have been co -isolated in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). While P. aeruginosa is known to be a major CF pathogen, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs) are now t he 3rd leading cause of lung infection in PwCF. Despite the increased prevalence of M. abscessus in PwCF and its common isolation with P. aeruginosa , there is little understanding of the interaction between these two opportunistic pathogens. Methods: We in terrogated P. aeruginosa and M. abscessus interactions using liquid co-culture and dual -species biofilms using a colony biofilm approach. Antagonism was evaluated using P. aeruginosa contact dependent (Type III and VI secretion systems), contact independen t (quorum sensing and type II secretion system), motility and iron sequestration transposon mutants and the ATCC Type strain of M. abscessus 19977. Biofilm biomass and survival of each organism in dual -species biofilm were quantified by CFUs and compared t o single -species colony biofilms. Results: The bacterial interaction between P. aeruginosa and M. abscessus was an antagonistic interaction that favored P. aeruginosa and was observed in biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures. The antagonistic interactio n extended to multiple P. aeruginosa strains and against another NTM, Mycobacterium smegmatis . We observed more than a 2.5 Log 10 reduction in M. abscessus CFU (p< 0.0001) in biofilms containing both species. Reduction in M. abscessus CFU was also maintained in dual -species biofilms with transposon mutants of known P. aeruginosa inter -bacterial mechanisms of competition. Conclusions: We report a novel antagonistic in teraction between P. aeruginosa and M.abscessus that is observed only in biofilms suggesting that the biofilm lifestyle and likely direct contact between P. aeruginosa and M. abscessus contributes to antagonism. Surprisingly, canonical P. aeruginosa contac t- dependent and independent inter -bacterial mechanisms, as well as motility and iron sequestration do not appear to play a role in this antagonism, suggesting a novel inter -bacterial strategy. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-172-ASM -BIO Mechanisms Promoting Disassembly and Dispersal Publishing Title: MECHANISM OF NATIVE AND TO ENVIRONMENTALLY -INDUCED DISPERSION Abstract Body: Background. Native dispersion has been characterized as the terminal stage in biofilm development, apparent by single cells actively escaping from the biofilm, leaving behind central voids. The dispersing cell population furthermore demonstr ates increased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents relative to the biofilm that they escaped from. Much of what is known about the mechanism of dispersion, however, stems from environmentally -induced dispersion in response to nitric oxide and glutamate, not native dispersion. The goal of this study was to determine if native and induced dispersion are mechanistically similar, by determining whether factors previously characterized to contribute to environmentally -induced dispersion also play a role in na tive dispersion. Methods. Specifically, we determined if biofilms by P. aeruginosa strains impaired in induced dispersion demonstrated void formation by microscopy, and dispersed in response to the native dispersion inducer, cis -2-decenoic acid. Additional ly, c-di-GMP levels were evaluated using a P cdrA -gfp reporter and expression of genes encoding matrix degrading enzymes was evaluated by qRT -PCR. Results. Of the known factors contributing to and amrZ impaired the formation of central voids indicative of native dispersion. The same genes likewise contributed to inactivation of bdlA, rbdA, dipA , and amrZ likewise impaired the response to the native dispersion inducer, cis -2-decenoic acid. Similar to dispersed cells obtained in response to nitric oxide, natively dispersed cells demonstrated reduced cellular levels of c -di-GMP. Moreover, native dispersion coincided with a 20 -fold increased expression of pelA and pslG relative to biofilm cells, and a 100 -fold increase in endA and eddA expression. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that native dispersion requires BdlA, the phosphodiesterase DipA and RbdA, and the trans criptional regulator AmrZ. None of the previously reported dispersion cue receptor proteins, however, played a role in native dispersion. Moreover, similar to environmentally -induced dispersion, native dispersion coincides with an overall reduction in cell ular c -di-GMP levels but an increase in the expression of genes encoding hydrolases PelA and PslG and DNAses EndA and EddA. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that native dispersion is mechanistically similar to Publishing Title: ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE PATTERN OF BACTERIA IN URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN ASSIN FOSU GHANA Abstract Body: Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be described as a silent pandemic that thwarts the curative power of antibiotics and presents global health threats. Unfortunately, few studies have reported on AMR patterns of uropathogens in Ghana, and without relevant surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility, empirical treatment of UTI could end up becoming expensive and ineffective, resulting in increased morbidity and even mortality. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of UTI presenting to a hospital in rural Ghana, including the etiological agents, their antibiotic resistance pattern and selected resistant genes: ESBLs, MRSA and CRG. Methods This was a cross -sectional study involving 277 patients with clinically suspected UTI from August 2020 to May 20 21 at the St. Francis Xavier Hospital, Assin Fosu, Ghana. Urine samples were collected from the study participants and analyzed by culture. The bacterial isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods and a Vitek -2 automated system. They were then tested against a spectrum of antibiotics using the Kirby Bauer method. The following resistant genes were screened using Polymerase Chain Reaction: CTX - M, TEM, SHV, NDM, OXA, KPC and mecA. Results Of the samples analyzed, laboratory -confirmed UTI w as 56%, with the most common uropathogens isolated being E. coli (30.3%), followed by Enterococcus sp. (24.5%) and K. pneumoniae (18.7%). The prevalence of resistance was highest for tetracycline (78.7%) and lowest for meropenem (5.9%). Resistant genes wer e detected in the following CTM -X, 40%. 33.3% of the isolates harbored three genes and 36.7%, two genes. Conclusions This study demonstrated a high UTI prevalence of 56% with the most freq uent etiological agent being E. coli . Alarming resistance patterns were observed, with meropenem, and tetracycline have the lowest and highest resistance respectively. CTX -M, TEM, SHV, NDM and mecA were detected with CTX - M being the most common resistant g ene. This highlights the need for routine surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among these UTI -causing pathogens and the reviewing of UTI treatment guidelines. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-187-ASM -BIO Topic Title: H-NS Coordinately Vibrio fischeri MJ11 Abstract Body: Background : The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a broadly distributed interbacterial weapon found in both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria and can enhance the ability to colonize a host. Biofilm formation is also a common colonization factor for host -associated bacteria. However, little is known about how these two functions are coordinately regulated in bacteria. Vibrio fischeri is a beneficial symbiont of fish and squid and a model organism for studying biofilm and T6SS function. Previous work showed that V. fischeri requires syp-dependent biofilm formation to colonize the squid and uses a T6SS to eliminate competitors to prevent co -colonized crypts in the host. Although both biofilm and T6SS are active in the host, these functions are off under standard liquid culture conditions. Methods : We previously identified a hydrogel culture medium that activates T6SS, but not biofilm. Using this hydrogel medium, we isolated an hns mutant in a transposon screen to identify regulators of the T6SS in the fish symbiont V. fischeri MJ11. The hns gene encodes the DNA -binding protein, H -NS, a conserved global regulator of gene expression that aids in adaptation to changing environments. Results : Single -cell fluorescence microscopy revealed that, compared to the wild -type parent , the hns mutant makes more T6SS weapons in both liquid and hydrogel medium, where the hns mutant is more proficient at killing a competitor strain. Quantitative transcriptome analysis of the hns mutant and parent grown in liquid and hydrogel confirmed T6S S gene transcripts are more abundant in the hns mutant in both conditions, suggesting H -NS represses T6SS in the parent. Furthermore, that hns mutant colonies have a wrinkled morphology with tightly -adhered cells, which is consistent with Syp biofilm. Tran scripts for several syp polysaccharide synthesis genes, but not syp regulators, are more abundant in the hns mutant by one to three orders of magnitude, compared to the wild type, suggesting H -NS also represses syp expression in the MJ11 parent. Finally, disrupting the hns gene in the squid symbiont strains ES114 or ES401 does not confer a biofilm phenotype, suggesting the coordinate regulation of T6SS and biofilm is through an unknown, strain -specific mechanism. Conclusions : These findings reveal a new con nection between important colonization factors and presents an opportunity to further explore how a social behavior like biofilm formation could promote the asocial behavior of eliminating competition during host colonization. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-192-ASM -BIO Tolerance: Antimicrobials and Biofilms Publishing Title: IMPACT OF A COMBINATION THERAPY OF AN ANTIMICROBIAL AND DISPERSAL AGENT TO TREAT A MATURE METHICILLAN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (MRSA) BIOFILM Abstract Body: Background MRSA has been identified as a high priority multi -drug resistant pathogen by the WHO causing a significant healthcare impact. In the U.S. in 2019 alone, MRSA biofilm infections were believed to be responsible for the hospitalization of over 323 thousand patients, greater than 10 thousand deaths and at least $1.7 billion in healthcare costs (Craft 2019). The purpose of this study was two pronged. First, determine the conditions that produce a robust MRSA biofilm. Second, investigate a range of antibiotics, dispersal agents, and exposure times that are needed to eradicate biofilms. Metho ds For completion of the first prong, two MRSA strains, ATCC#: BAA -41 and 33592, were grown in 96 -well plates with six different growth medias for three different incubation periods. Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth with the add ition of glucose or NaCl were used to grow the biofilms for a period of 1, 3, or 5 days following which the biofilm biomass and number of colony forming units were determined. Based on findings from the first prong, biofilms were treated with the antimicro bials vancomycin, linezolid, or tigecycline alone, or with the addition of a biofilm dispersal agent in the form of DNase I or Proteinase K, for 6, 12, or 24 hrs and as high as 72 hrs for a few selected antibiotic conditions. Following the exposure to the antimicrobial, the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined using an XTT metabolic assay. Results BHI with the addition of 1% glucose produced the most robust biofilms after 3 -day incubation with 33592 producing a more robust biofilm than BAA -41. The testing revealed that no antimicrobial, used alone, was able to eradicate the biofilm, without replenishing the antimicrobial after 12 hrs, but the addition of either dispersal agent greatly improved the performance leading to the eradica tion of BAA -41 with the use of 750 \u00b5g/mL of vancomycin and 250 \u00b5g/mL DNase I following 24 hrs of exposure, and 33592 was eradicated with 2k \u00b5g/mL of vancomycin with 250 \u00b5g/mL of DNase after 72 hrs. Conclusion The results show the amount of antibiotic requi red to eradicate a mature biofilm is much higher than what can typically be delivered systemically, and that rarely will an antibiotic alone be sufficient for eradication of an established infection. Improved formulations that incorporate a dispersal agent in addition to an antimicrobial suggest a more successful treatment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-203-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Social and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: SOCIAL EVOLUTION OF SHARED BIOFILM MATRIX COMPONENTS Abstract Body: Background Biofilm formation is an important and ubiquitous mode of growth among bacteria. Central to the evolutionary advantage of biofilm formation is cell -cell and cell - surface adhesion achieved by a variety of factors, some of which are diffusible compounds that may operate as classical public goods \u2014factors that are costly to produce but may benefit other cells. An outstanding question is how diffusible matrix production, in general, can be stable over evolutionary timescales. Methods Vibrio cholerae biofilm was u sed as the model organism and a combination of bacterial genetics, competition assays, quantitative imaging, protein quantification, fluid -dynamics modeling, and ecological modeling were used in this study. Results We show that shared diffusible biofilm m atrix proteins are indeed susceptible to cheater exploitation and that the evolutionary stability of producing these matrix components fundamentally depends on biofilm spatial structure, intrinsic sharing mechanisms of these components, and flow conditions in the environment. We further show that exploitation of diffusible adhesion proteins is localized within a well-defined spatial range around cell clusters that produce them. Based on this exploitation range and the spatial distribution of cell clusters, we constructed a model of costly diffusible matrix production and related these length scales to the relatedness coefficient in social evolution theory. Conclusions Our results show that production of diffusible biofilm matrix components is evolutionarily stable under conditions consistent with natural biofilm habitats and host environments. We expect the mechanisms revealed in this study to be relevant to other secreted factors that operate as cooperative public goods in bacterial communities and the conc ept of exploitation range and the associated analysis tools to be generally applicable. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-204-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Social and Asocial Publishing Title: COMMUNITY CONTEXT OF MULTISPECIES AND PHAGE DYNAMICS Abstract Body: Background: The eco -evolutionary advancement of bacteria is greatly influenced by the presence of their natural predators, bacteriophages. Although bacteria mainly reside in biofilms, most bacteria -phage interactions are studied in planktonic cultures. Thus, there is a gap in how well we understand the dynamics of bacteria and phages in several natural settings. Further, the biofilm -phage studies that have been conducted have mainly been done so in mono -species biofilms. Methods: In this project we have modified the geno me of different robust biofilm formers, so they express different fluorescent proteins, respectively. Further we have isolated and characterized novel phages, targeting some of these biofilm hosts. This catalogue of bacteria and phages enable us to study t he importance of temporospatial arrangements of bacteria in different combinations during phage exposure with the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: The work is still in process, but we hypothesize that non -susceptible bacteria can partly sh ield susceptible cells, and that spatial organization is of great importance for the success of the viral infection. Currently, we characterize how cells distribute and affect one another in a biofilm depending on priority effects, and how this impact how well phages penetrate the matrix. Conclusion: This project is still relatively new, but in time this system will hopefully increase our knowledge on phage -bacteria dynamics in nature and perhaps impact how phages are clinically applied in respect to pathogen ic biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Tolerance: Title: DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF THE OCCIDIOFUNGIN ON BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT BY CANDIDA SPECIES Abstract Body: Background : Candida biofilms cause severe invasive infections in immune - compromised individuals including HIV -AIDS and diabetic patients, and people undergoing long -term chemotherapy or antibiotic or steroid treatment. As substrates for biofilm growth, medical implant s and prosthetic devices are additional sources for development of candidiasis. Although Candida albicans is the most common fungal species in biofilm -associated infections, non - albicans Candida species such as Candida tropicalis are increasingly reported in hospital settings. The biofilms formed by these two Candida species differ: C. albicans biofilms contain primarily hyphal form cells, whereas yeast form cells predominate for C. tropicalis biofilms. These differences in biofilm composition provides an a venue to examine the role of cellular morphology in sensitivity to the antifungal, occidiofungin, a compound demonstrated to prevent the morphological transition of Candida likely through its disruption of actin -based activities. Methods : We used an in vit ro biofilm developed on medical grade silicon elastomer to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of occidiofungin at attachment, early and mature stages of development for both C. albicans and C. tropicalis . In parallel, metabolic activity and cel l viability following antifungal exposure was measured by XTT and colony forming unit assays, respectively. Structural changes in biofilm post exposure were identified by confocal microscopy. Results: Our results demonstrate that occidiofungin was effectiv e against cells at all stages of biofilm development. Both Candida species showed dose dependent reduction in biofilm cell number following occidiofungin exposure with C. tropicalis 2-fold C. . Confocal Candida biofilms treated with sublethal dose of occidiofungin contained fewer hyphal cells compared to untreated controls. Conclusions: Occidiofungin exhibits broad efficacy against Candida biofilms despite differences in the morphology of cells within the biofilm . Together, these results suggest that occidiofungin may be an effective antifungal agent for the prevention and treatment of diverse infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Title: TOMATIDINE AS AGAINST S. AUREUS BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background : Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent issue associated w ith chronic infections. Tomatidine (TO) is a natural steroidal alkaloid that was found to specifically inhibit the ATP synthase of Bacillales. It exhibits a strong antibacterial activity against small -colony variants of S. aureus (MIC = 0.06 \u00b5g/ml). Althou gh it lacks antibacterial activity against the of S. aureus TO increases aminoglycosides (AMG) activity against prototypic planktonic bacteria by up to 8 times. This combination is of particular interest since AMG concentration that inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation is high. In this study we sought to investigate the synergistic interaction of TO and AMG on S. aureus biofilms. This combination could make ATP synthase inhibitors attractive for use against biofilm -associated infections. Methods The S. aureus strains used included MRSA strains, SigB, Agr m utants and a Bap -positive strain that present different biofilm phenotypes or types. Strains of clinical origins were also used, like those from cystic fibrosis patients. The synergistic action of TO checkerboard approach for inhibition of planktonic bacteria and to measure the extent of biofilm formation. Growth inhibition was revealed using absorbance readings (A 600nm ). Biofilm formation was measured by violet crystal staining. Result s are reported as a Fractional Inhibitory Concentration for planktonic bacteria (FIC p) and as a FIC for biofilm prevention (FIC bp). Preformed biofilms on Calgary Biofilm Device were treated with the combination and results are reported as viable bacterial count persisting in biofilms. Results There was no difference in the response of strains to the antibiotic combinations based on the type of biofilm produced (MRSA, SigB, Agr, Bap) or on the amount of production (high or low producers). TO was able to reduce the required AMG concentration to inhibit biofilm formation by up to 8 -fold resulting in a synergistic effect, with a FIC p and FIC bp <0.5. Also, for tobramycin - resistant MRSA, apramycin MIC was reduced by up to 8 -fold. Similar results were obtained for th e effect of the combination on preformed biofilms, where TO decreased the bactericidal AMG concentration by up to 8 -fold. Conclusions TO can reduce the concentration of AMG required to inhibit planktonic growth and biofilm formation. TO could extend the use of AMG for the prevention of difficult to treat biofilm -associated infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Social Title: PATTERNS OF IN Abstract Body: Background The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infection. One factor important to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis is its production of alkyl quinolones, which includes Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), the quorum sensing signal that cues regulation of the PQS system. In ad dition to quorum sensing, PQS and the other alkyl quinolones constitute a diverse class of molecules produced in response to antibiotics and other stresses. The alkyl quinolones have been shown important to cell death, iron sequestration, interspecies comp etition, and virulence. Several studies have shown that alkyl quinolone distribution within surface -growing P. aeruginosa , such as biofilms, is not uniform. However, the details and resultant impact of this heterogeneity within biofilms has remained unclea r. Here, we have investigated colony biofilms growing on nutrient agar as a model biofilm system to examine spatial and temporal alkyl quinolone distribution. We have used a combination of methods to correlate alkyl quinolone signatures with P. aeruginosa biofilm features that can be observed optically at different spatial scales. Methods By applying both mass spectrometry imaging and confocal Raman microscopy we can acquire two nine carbon congeners within a colony biofilm. We then compare these heatmaps to confocal fluorescence microscopy images to pinpoint intersections of these quinolones with microbial behavio rs. Results We found that the alkyl quinolone distribution of congeners shifts with changes in alkyl chain length and that the alkyl quinolones present in a region can shift dramatically over short distances. At the surface/air interface quinolones have be en found to become supersaturated. We see these molecules are often identified within chemical aggregates, particularly in older regions of the biofilm. The shape of these chemical aggregates varied, and some alkyl quinolone rich aggregates were found to b e spatially associated with regions of localized cell death. Conclusions More broadly, we hope to apply this correlated strategy of combining chemical and optical imaging to better discern the function and reach of these heterogeneous alkyl quinolone rich regions. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS COMPETITIVE LIMITING CONDITIONS Abstract Body: Background: The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause lung, skin, and eye infections. P. aeruginosa has been identified in prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) along with several other pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Corynebacterium striatum. In many polymicrobial scenarios, P. aeruginosa is known to exhibit a robust competitive response towards other bacterial species, employing its extensive arsenal of virulence factors and metabolic flexibility to achieve dominance. Results: We have found that when co -cultured with E. faecalis , P. aeruginosa exhibits an attenuation of competitive behaviors as exampled by reduced production of Pseudomonas quorum sensing signal (PQS) and pyocyanin and changes in biofilm architecture. Addi tionally, metabolic crosstalk can allow for P. aeruginosa growth in the presence of carbon sources it cannot metabolize when co -cultured with E. faecalis. In each the tested conditions, E. faecalis growth remained unchanged by the presence of P. aeruginosa , indicating a unique cooperative interaction between the two species. In co -culture biofilm assays, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis exhibit an architecture that is markedly different from either mono -culture alone. Methods: Using a variety of fluorescence microscopy, biofilm assays, and mass spectrometry, these results provide a temporal, spatial, and biochemical characterization of dual -species interactions in defined environments. Conclusions: These findings provide a framework for un derstanding how polymicrobial interactions can initiate colonization in specific infections environments through metabolic cooperation and alter the bacterial composition of polymicrobial infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Biofilms Publishing Title: A comparison of dosing levels required to kill Staphylococcal aureus biofilms verses planktonic using Abstract Body: BACKGROUND: Biofilms are naturally tolerant against clinical antibiotics, often requiring killing doses far greater thanwhat is needed for planktonic bacteria. Antimicrobial blue light (aBL) has antimicrobial efficacy against both the planktonicand biofilm phenotypes, but it is unknown whether biofilms demonstrate a natural tolerance against aBL similar to that ofclinical antibiotics such as levofloxacin and rifampin. We quantitatively assessed if aBL encounters dosage increases similarto antibiotics when u sed against biofilms in comparison to planktonic bacteria.METHOS: S. aureus biofilms were grown in a CDC biofilm reactor (72 h cycle) on titanium (Ti) coupons. Planktonicbacteria were grown in 10% BHI for 4 -6 h and 10 -12 h (log and stationary phases respec tively). Bacterial concentration on Ticoupons and BHI suspensions were all within 9.1 log10 \u00b1 .35. We tested planktonic bacteria in log phase at doses of 0.12mg/mL, 0.3 mg/mL and 30 min (150 mW/cm2) 3 denoted as baseline dose (PBD). The PBD was testedagainst planktonic bacteria in the stationary phase to determine if growth stage altered antibiotic/aBL efficacy. Then the PBDwas used against biofilms wherein the PBD was doubled until a 3 log10 CFU reduction was attained.RESULTS: Natural tolerance was observed in biofilms, indicated by the PBD's inability to achieve a 3 log10 CFU reduction.Levofloxacin demonstrated the leas t natural tolerance, but despite doubling the PBD up to the solubility limit, levofloxacin'santimicrobial efficacy against biofilms plateaued. aBL demonstrated greater natural tolerance, but as PBD doubled, aBL'santimicrobial efficacy that did not plateau. Rifampin reached its solubility limit before attaining a 3 log10 reduction againstplanktonic bacteria.CONCLUSION: Biofilms have a noticeable natural tolerance towards aBL, but a relatively minor one towards levofloxacin.Levofloxacin had a plateau effect limiting antimicrobial efficacy. Since aBL did not have the plateau effect, biofilms can bebetter managed by simply increasing exposure time, avoiding exacerbation of potential bacterial resistance. Additionalresearch should be performed to determine if ext ended exposure to blue light results in significant skin cell damage. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-242-ASM -BIO Topic Asocial Interactions Biofilms Publishing Title: BIOFILM ARCHITECTURE CONTROLS A TRADE -OFF BETWEEN PROTECTION AGAINST PHAGES AND PREDATORY BACTERIA Abstract Body: Background - Bacterial biofilms are held together by various, often species specific, secreted proteins, polysaccharides, and DNA - collectiv ely termed the biofilm matrix. Although biofilms have many fitness advantages conferred to them, matrix mutants are abundant within natural isolates, implying context -dependent disadvantages inherent to the production of some matrix components. Here we explore how biofilm architecture controls a tradeoff in the context of different predation pressures. Methods - The model organism Escherichia coli is used as a prey species, due to i ts highly characterized protection against bacteriophages. We use a predatory bacteria called Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus as the predatory exposure. We use microfluidics paired with confocal microscopy to answer questions relating to the spatial ecology of biofilm communities. Using a Matlab software called Biofilm Q, these spatial dynamics can be precisely quantified and graphed. Results - We show that stable biofilm architecture can decrease the fitness of E. coli when exposed to the bacterial predator B. bacteriovorus . In E. coli , mature biofilm structural rigidity is largely controlled by curli fimbria matrix protein. While the curli fiber mesh can protect E. coli from bacteriophage exposure within biofilms, B. bacteriovorus is retained by the rigid biofi lm structure that curli promotes. Further, this predator is capable of maneuvering through the matrix to access its prey. E. coli survival is only observed when there are mass dispersal events (sloughing) that clear the curli protein mesh and the majority of invading predators encompassed within it. In matrix mutants lacking curli, E. coli biofilms exhibit higher survival rates, as B. bacteriovorus has less stable biomass to reside in to find new prey. These matrix mutants disperse readily when disrupted by a predator, and thus clear the infection immediately. Conclusions - Our results illustrate that the same E. coli extracellular matrix component that is necessary for protection from bacteriophages also causes susceptibility to predation by B. bacteriovoru s. Protection against different sources of predation pressure can thus trade off against each other within biofilms, which may help to explain natural variation in the propensity to produce highly matrix -stabilized versus easily dispersing biofilms in the wild. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Publishing Title: ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN OF ENTEROCOCCUS ISOLATED FROM THE ORAL AND RECTAL CAVITY OF SUS SCROFA DOMESTICA (DOMESTIC PIG) AND IDENTIFICATION OF VRE STRAIN Abstract Body: Background of Study Enterococci are part of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals. The genus Enterococcus presently contain over 50 species, and E.faecalis and E.faecium are the most prominent isolated species, accounting for more than 80% of isolate. This genus has high leve l of intrinsic antibiotic resistance and over the past few decades more virulent strains that are developing resistance to antibiotics are emerging and causing many clinical infections. In Nigeria, studies have shown prevalence of VRE strain of Enterococcu s in animals and lifestock. Due to their ability to invade the extraintestinal region by translocation across an intact intestinal epithelium, they can shift from commensal to pathogen and this is of public health importance due the deleterious effect on man.Materials and Method This study was carried out in Nsukka local government in Enugu state, Nigeria. A total of 152 pigs were used for this work. The swab was collected aseptically from the oral and rectal cavity of the pig and cultured selectively on 6.5 % Normal saline in Nutrient agar and The pure isolate was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing to determine resistance using Erythromycin 15\u00b5g 30 \u00b5g (OXOID) antibiotics disc. Results Out of the 304 oral and rectal swab cultured, 116 (38%) was confirmed as enterococcus with a maroon red colony on Slanetz and Bartley agar and a dark brown colour colony on Bile Esculin Agar. Out of the 116 isolates used, the isolate's susceptibility to the different antimicrobial agents 10.4%, Linezolid 37.9%, and Teicoplanin 31%. Erythromycin 41.1%, nosocomial pathogens such as VRE are a great menace to both animals, humans and health care workers as they increase hospital stay, cost of infection tr eatment and sometimes lead to death. This study has shown a high prevalence of VRE infection in Nigeria, which might increase if measures are not put in place to reduce it. There is need for proper antimicrobial stewardship program to be established in Nig eria's animal farms and veterinary hospitals to control the use of antibiotics to treat infections in farm animals. More research are encouraged need to seek for newer alternative treatment for bacteria infection. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022-A-248-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Antimicrobials Title: MODELING MICROBIAL FIBROSIS Abstract Body: Background. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan genetic disease where the accumulation of thick mucus in the airways of persons with CF (pwCF) represents an excellent nutritional environment for pathogens such as Pseudomonas , Staphylococcus , Streptococcus, and anaerobes like Prevotella growing as mixed -microbial communities to thrive and cause disease. These communities are difficult to eradicate, at least in part, because they exhibit resistance and tolerance (collectively called \"recalcitrance\") to antimic robial therapy. The challenge for treating such polymicrobial, biofilm -like infections is supported by several observations indicating that interactions among microorganisms can provoke unexpected changes in antimicrobial sensitivity and lead to poor clini cal outcomes. Methods. To better understand why front -line CF drugs fail at eradicating microbial communities detected in the airway of pwCF, we leveraged published large microbiome 16S rRNA gene amplicon data sets to identify polymicrobial community clust ers that encompass most of the microbial diversity existing in the CF lung. We then experimentally modeled a mixed -species biofilm community including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus and Prevotella species by cultivating these microorganisms in artificial sputum medium (ASM). Using this new model, we tested the hypothesis that loss of LasR function in P. aeruginosa , a variant known to be frequently detected in the airway of pwCF and associated with worsened clinical outcomes, co uld impact the efficacy of tobramycin, a front -line CF drug, when grown in a mixed community. Results. We observed that, while wild -type P. aeruginosa biofilms are further sensitized to the presence of tobramycin when grown in a polymicrobial environment v ersus monoculture, loss -of-function LasR variants drive tolerance of P. aeruginosa in a mixed -species community. Mechanistic studies have allowed us to pinpoint that the redox -active molecules phenazines are responsible of comm unity -specific drug recalcitrance phenotype. Conclusions. Overall, our work highlights the importance of employing mechanistic approaches in combination with in vitro modeling of polymicrobial communities to probe clinically relevant phenotypes such as ant imicrobial susceptibility of pathogens, in the context of chronic microbial -based human infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-254-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Social Biofilms Publishing Title: ADDITION OF CARIOGENIC PATHOGENS TO COMPLEX ORAL MICROFLORA DRIVES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BIOFILM COMPOSITIONS AND FUNCTIONALITY Abstract Body: Dental caries is a microbe -mediated, fermentable carbohydrate -driven disease characterized by highly organized polymicrobial biofilm on tooth surfaces. A unique clinical feature of early childhood caries (ECC) is the synergistic interaction between the car clinical cross -sectional studies have revealed that C. albicans is associated with a highly acidogenic and acid -tolerant bacterial community in severe ECC, it remains unclear the mechanism(s) through which the cross -kingdom interaction modulates the composition of the plaque microbiome. Furthermore, cross -sectional studies have limitations regarding the determination of the significance of micr obial interactions between specific organisms in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we developed a novel in vitro saliva -derived microcosm biofilm system to assess the structural and functional characteristics of the saliva community by introducing exo genous pathogens and the influence of dietary sugars on the functionality of the oral microbiome. We applied shotgun whole metagenome sequencing and observed that the presence of C. albicans and S. mutans , alone or in combination, as well as the addition o f different sugars induced unique alterations in both the composition and functional attributes of the biofilms. Our work provides a novel biofilm model for investigating the functional microbiome in health and disease as well as developing strategies to m odulate the microbiome. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 and Asocial Interactions Biofilms Publishing Title: THE ART OF COMMUNITY BUILDING: GLYCEROL METABOLISM SUPPORTS ORAL Number: 2022 INTERACTIONS Catheter -associated urinary infections (CAUTI) account for 80% of hospital -acquired UTIs, often promoting more adverse outcomes, including higher morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have revealed that up to ~80% of CAUTIs are polymicrobial, with urinary catheters colonized by two or more bacterial species. Methods and Results Our study of patients with long -term indwelling catheters uncovered a positive association between the Gram -positive Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram -negative Klebsiella pn eumoniae in catheter polymicrobial communities. Using an artificial urine -based co -culture model for biofilm formation, we found a mutualistic interaction that results in enhanced growth and biofilm formation for E. faecalis when cultured in the presence o f K. pneumoniae . Using analytical chemistry techniques, we found that K. pneumoniae secretes factors into the polymicrobial community that promoted significantly more robust E. faecalis growth and biofilm formation. Additional analyses, including chromatog raphy and mass spectrometry are in progress to investigate the molecular nature of these factors. Finally, comparative transcriptomic analysis identified two groups of E. faecalis genes, associated with cell growth and biofilm formation, respectively, that were up -regulated by K. pneumoniae -secreted extracellular compounds. Among these, the virulence -associated Fsr quorum sensing system, a two -component signal transduction system known to be associated with biofilm formation, demonstrated prominent associat ions with both phenotypes. Validation studies are in progress to elucidate the mechanisms of how the Fsr system promotes polymicrobial interactions and how its expression is stimulated by K. pneumoniae . Conclusions Together, this study reveals a positive interaction between E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae , featuring the involvement of a quorum sensing system, that may enhance their co -colonization in the long -term catheterized urinary tract. A better understanding of bacterial interactions in the polymicrobia l community could help to develop new therapeutics to polymicrobial CAUTI. ---PAGEBREAK --- Since its discovery in 2009, Candida auris has been an increasing threat globally to public health due to its easy transmission and high resistance to both disinfectants and multiple antifungal drugs. C. auris has been isolated from both wounds and bronchoalveolar lavage, also common sites for P. aeruginosa infections. While antagonism between Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated previo usly, interactions between C. auris and P. aeruginosa have yet to be elucidated. Methods: In the present work, we examine differences in the growth of both planktonic and biofilm C. auris strains in the presence and absence of P. aeruginosa . Using colony c ounting, microscopy, and metabolic studies, we were able to quantify growth of each species in both monocultures and cocultures. Conditioned media from cultures were collected for further testing on additional strains to determine whether growth inhibition was due to direct attachment or released factors. Results: Growth of a C. auris strain from the newly discovered Clade V was inhibited tenfold when grown planktonically in the presence of P. aeruginosa in comparison to its growth as a monoculture. Likewis e, biofilm volume of Clade V was decreased when grown in the presence of P. aeruginosa relative to growth as a monoculture biofilm. Subjecting Clade V to the conditioned media nearly completely halted growth planktonically, suggesting that a soluble factor released by P. aeruginosa is responsible for this effect. The conditioned media had a decreased inhibitory effect on strains from other C. auris clades, which otherwise demonstrated no antagonism in coculture studies with P. aeruginosa . Similarly, the conditioned media had a limited inhibitory effect on C. albicans reference strain, SC5314. Heat -treated conditioned media yielded similar growth patt erns across all strains tested, implicating that the released factor is not dependent on secondary peptide bonds nor otherwise degraded by high temperatures. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to show an antagonistic interaction between P. aerugino sa and C. auris . P. aeruginosa produces and releases a heat - stable soluble factor that inhibits the growth of C. auris Clade V and, to a lesser extent, other clades of C. auris , suggesting that the growth inhibition is both species - and strain -dependent. P revious studies showed that P. aeruginosa phenazines can inhibit C. albicans growth; studies are currently underway to determine whether the observed C. auris inhibition is caused by phenazines or other factors. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-270-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Mechanisms Promoting and Dispersal Publishing Title: DEVELOPMENT OF A PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA STOPPED FLOW BIOFILM DISPERSION MODEL TO ASSESS MATRIX DEGRADATION Abstract Body: Background: In the fifth stage of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm developmental cycle bacteria actively escape the biofilm in a process known as dispersion. Dispersion is initiated when bacteria sense a cue or cues that originate from out side or within the biofilm. We hypothesize that degradation of the biofilm matrix, a protective network of exopolysaccharides, proteins, and eDNA, is necessary for the biofilm -encased cells to disperse. Previous studies have shown the expression of protein s capable of degrading matrix exopolysaccharides and eDNA induce P. aeruginosa dispersion. Furthermore, deletion of a protein involved in maintaining the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix structure leads to greater dispersion compared to wild type in the presen ce of dispersion cues. Together these findings suggest that matrix degradation is a key feature of dispersion . This study outlines preliminary data establishing a P. aeruginosa stopped -flow dispersion model to monitor matrix degradation activities. Methods : We adapted a method of stopping media flow to induce dispersion, which was previously used to study Shewanella oneidensis PAO1 biofilms were grown in a continuous culture tube reactor system. Then dispersion was induced by halting media flow for varying amounts of time. Biofilms that did not experience a disruption in media flow served as a control. Effluent and biofilm -associated cell fractions were harvested separately and enumerated by serial dil ution plating. An increase in the percentage of cells in the effluent from the total cell population is an indicator of dispersion. Experiments were performed in triplicate and analyzed using One -way ANOVA with Dunnett's Post -Hoc test. Results: The percent age of cells in the effluent fraction increased with longer durations of flow disruption. After 60 and 90 minutes of stopped media flow there was a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the effluent compared to the control (P -value < 0.01 and < 0.001, respectively), indicating that P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersion occurs following 60 minutes of stopping media flow. The presence of more cells in the effluent was found to be independent of significant cell growth. Conclusions: These data suggest that stopping media flow induces a robust, reproducible dispersion event which could be used to study biofilm matrix degradation activities involved in P. aeruginosa dispersion. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Publishing Title: PHAGE TREATMENT EFFICACY IN A P. AERUGINOSA MOUSE, WOUND -INFECTION MODEL, AND ASSOCIATED INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM MODULATION Abstract Body: Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic, nosocomial pathogen that is correlated with persistent infections within wound environments, leading to delayed healing. These infections are often recalcitrant to antimicrobial treatments and host immune defenses. Due to the resulting limited treatment options, development of novel therapies is a critical research priority. Methods Herein, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the well - characterized phage, PEV2, as a promising strategy for controlling P. aeruginosa infections in an in vivo wound infection model. Results Phage PEV2 was found to lack toxicity as no morbidity or mortality was observed with phage administration. Phage monotherapy significantly improved P. aeruginosa -infection outcome, decreasing bacterial burden within the wo und bed by 2.9 log, 72 h post infection. Moreover, bacterial infections substantially elevated neutrophil numbers, both in the blood and wounds, while phage treatment significantly lowered neutrophil circulatory levels and accumulation in wounds despite pr ior P. aeruginosa infection. This suggests that phage -related decreases in bacterial burdens caused lower neutrophil recruitment. Improved healing and overall reduced levels of inflammatory markers also were observed in phage - treated wounds relative to unt reated controls, which is presumably correlated with reductions in bacterial loads and direct downregulation of the activity of cells engaged in proinflammatory processes. Besides wound beds, spleens and livers served as major sites of accumulation of phag es and bacteria, presumably as a function of the roles of these organs in foreign -body removal from circulation. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that topical administration of phage PEV2 has a promising therapeutic potential in P. aeruginosa wound infec tion treatment, including positively impacting wound healing processes and reducing immune and inflammatory responses. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-295-ASM -BIO Publishing Title: EVOLUTIONARY INTERPLAY BETWEEN BIOFILM FORMATION AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE Abstract Body: Background : The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a worldwide threat. However, the development of antibiotic tolerant biofilms also constitutes an important cause of therapeutic failure due to their capacity to survive to very high concentratio ns of antibiotics. Considering that resistance can rise from tolerance, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance may interact and fuel each other. However, how this evolutionary crosstalk impact the selection for adhesion and resistance/tolerance is an open question. Methods : To investigate this question, a poorly adherent strain of E. coli was used in an experimental evolution protocol where replicate populations were first selected for their capacity to adhere and form a biofilm in a continuous -flow microfermenter. Both a strong and weak selection pressure for adhesion were used and the formed biofilms were then exposed to either a sub -inhibitory (1/4 MIC) or lethal (5MIC) amikacin treatment, thus mimicking clinical situations where the infection first settles before to be treated. Nine cycles were carried out alongside a control without amikacin treatment. Results : Applying a lower selection pressure for adhesion increased the genetic diversity nucleating the biofilms. However, these differences in popu lation genetic and evolution dynamic systematically resulted in an increase of the biofilm biomass after a few cycles in control condition, which was significantly delayed by the amikacin treatment. The dynamic of resistant mutant frequency over cycles fur ther showed a two -step process with, first a selection for resistance even if at very low frequency, followed by a selection for adhesion that ultimately took over the former one regardless the MIC increase of the resistance mutations. This dynamic was und erlined by mutations in fimH gene encoding the tip adhesin of type 1 fimbriae that dominated the end -point populations and conferred increased non - specific adhesion and/or biofilm formation. Additionally, the fitness cost of some resistant clones very like ly played a role in their outcompetition by the fimH mutants. Conclusion : We showed that all combinations between both strong and weak selection pressure for adhesion and survival to amikacin induced a bi -phasic selection dynamic resulting in biofilm bioma ss increase. This suggests that the biofilm structure conferred survival could be a more advantageous strategy to select in this context. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-297-ASM -BIO -DI-GMP AND QUORUM SENSING SIGNALING TO REDUCE BIOFILM FORMATION AND VIRULENCE IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Abstract Body : Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is notorious for its ability to form biofilm and its resistance to antibiotics. To find novel compounds against bacterial biofilms, we synthesized coumarin -chalcone conjugates (C1 -C12) based on nat ural compounds and investigated their activity against biofilms. Our data revealed that conjugate C9 strongly inhibited the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa without impairing bacterial growth and motilities. C9 also showed anti - biofilm activity against a nother two bacteria related to hospital acquired infections, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Further studies indicated that C9 decreased the transcription of exopolysaccharide psl operon and the synthesis of intracellular cyclic -di-GMP, a key s ignal molecular that controls biofilm formation and virulence. Besides, C9 was also found to be able to alleviate the virulence of P. aeruginosa by reducing the transcription of several QS signal molecules and regulators, including enhanced biofilm sensitivity to antibioitics, and reduced the survival rate under different adversity conditions. This study suggested that the coumarin - chalcone conjugate C9 could be used as a potential therapeutic bacterial biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Publishing Title: VIRULENCE FACTORS OF WITH PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Abstract Body: Background: C. auris is increasingly gaining momentum as an emerging pathogenic yeast that can serve as an agent for a wide variety of infections especially in hospital intensive care settings. Studies suggest that the aggressive pace of C. auris infections could be attributed to its resistance to first line treatment antifungals. History of fungal -bacterial infections in hospital settings suggests that there is a potential for manifestations of invasive coinfections with other pathogenic species of different microbiota such as Pseudomonas - Candida interactions. Hence, the need to investigate the effect of antifungals on the biofilm formation of candida auris independently and in interactions with other microbes. Methods: Two clinical isolates of C. auris , and Pseudomonas aerugin osa were used to test their biofilm formation in the presence of an antimicrobial, Amphotericin B. For monomicrobial biofilms, the 96 -well plate was prepared by suspending the 100L of the standardized cells into the wells in triplicates and 20L of the 0. 5M of Amphotericin B. biofilms, C. auris and P. aeruginosa , 100L of each were suspended along with 20L of the 0.5M of Amphotericin B. The supernatant was removed post -incubation of the plates and rectangles of about 5mm were cut out and placed in PBS to avoid drying out of the biofilms. The biofilms were visualized using an SEM, furthermore, an XTT assay was conducted as a quantification method based on the metabolic activity of the cells. Results: All the strains used were able to f orm biofilms although in a polymicrobial culture, the rate of biofilm formation was observed to be more rapid. The cells had high resistance to the antifungal and secreted a large number of extracellular enzymes. The XTT assay showed that the presence of t he antifungal in polymicrobial biofilms decreased cell viability. Conclusions: The development rate of biofilms in vitro becomes moderate/stationary after 24 hours under normal growth conditions. In the presence of amphotericin B biofilm formation is disru pted although the antifungal is only effective during the maturation hence the cells are able to repair themselves and form more biofilms once the amphotericin wears off. The formation of strong biofilms when in a polymicrobial culture is an indication of a synergistic interaction between C. auris and P. aeruginosa which superinfections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Number: 2022 -BIO Publishing Title: How Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses Type VI Secretion system to shape the structure of polymicrobial communities Abstract Body: Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and its biofilm lifestyle is associated with chronic infections. To esta blish and persist within dense polymicrobial biofilm communities P. aeruginosa utilises Type VI Secretion systems (T6SS) for direct competition. T6SS is a macromolecular weapon used to inject toxins into adjacent prey cells. P. aeruginosa possesses 3 disti nct T6SSs and a set of more than 20 toxic effectors. T6SS toxins poses a diverse set of functions including disruption of cell wall integrity, degradation of nucleic acids, or metabolic impairment. Methods We generated a collection of mutants with various degrees of T6SS activity and/or sensitivity to individual T6SS toxins. By imaging whole mixed bacterial macrocolonies, we aimed to investigate how these P. aeruginosa strains gain a competitive edge in polymicrobial communities. The experimental work is supported by agent -based theoretical simulations aimed at pinpointing how small mechanistic differences in T6SS attacks affect whole community structure. Results Disruption of Gac/Rsm cascade leads to a gradual elevation in T6SS activity. Using mutant strain s with varied T6SS activity levels we demonstrated that bacterial community structure can be affected by the action of every single T6SS toxin and how toxin synergy maximises impact on prey growth. Additionally, we demonstrate how the establishment of dire ct prey -attacker contact is a key component for successful T6SS -based competition. Conclusions This study of T6SS - dependent competition in whole bacterial colonies addresses how toxin multiplicity and other factors like changes in T6SS firing behaviour or cell-cell contacts lead to population -level competitive advantages. Overall furthering the understanding of how highly local contact -based interactions between individuals shape the structure of whole populations, thus providing conceptual insights applica ble to all types of contact -based competition. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-306-ASM -BIO Real -throughput Biofilm Assay Abstract Body: Biofilms are quantified and observed using a variety of methods, such as crystal violet staining, optical density after detachment, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), depending on the type of experiment, resources available, and a balance of the advantages and drawbacks of the method. CLSM allows researchers to observe the inner workings and development of living cells in 3D over time with limitations such as choosing the best fluorescent tag and working distance, w hich can be problematic for inverted units. The microplate peg - lid-based assay, described in ASTM E2799 -22, is an easy -to-use and high -throughput method for testing biofilms but falls short when using CLSM due to the design of the plastic pegs. Breaking of f the peg risks damage to the sample and limits their number to the pegs that can be easily accessed while viewing the pegs through the well plate is restricted by the shape of the pegs. Simple modifications to the geometry of the peg allow for a more dyna mic visualization in the well plate by preserving delicate structures within a biofilm and allowing more pegs to be viewed. Each alternative peg design examines different changes to the original by altering working distance, surface area, and edges. These modifications also allow for changes in the biofilm's structure to be monitored over longer periods of time and with additional details that could not be measured with the standard assay while maintaining an easy -to-setup, high -throughput design. The alter native pegs are 3D printed allowing for ease of production and modification.

Recent studies indicate that disrupting the biofilm matrix leads to the release of cells from biofilms. Biophysical chara cteristics of dispersed cells such as concentration, cluster size and cluster morphology can greatly impact their survivability, including their susceptibility to antibiotics and tolerance to the host immune response. However, there is limited current know ledge of the properties of cells and clusters released from biofilms during matrix -targeted disruption. Methods Here we characterize the cellular concentration, cluster size, and morphology of cells released from S. epidermidis biofilms during matrix -targe ted disruption. Disruption treatments included pH 10 media to solubilize the biofilm matrix, proteinase K to target matrix proteins, and DNase I to target eDNA. Released cells and clusters collected during treatment were imaged using confocal scanning lase r microscopy, and quantitative image analysis was used to assess dispersed cell concentration, cell cluster size, and morphology across matrix - targeted treatments. Results When biofilm matrix is targeted using a high pH treatment to solubilize the matrix, cells are released at concentrations 40x higher than in untreated biofilms. Additionally, pH 10 treatments contain cell clusters that are 2.6x larger (7.14 cells/cluster) than untreated biofilms (2.73 cells/cluster). When matrix proteins were targeted, rel eased cell concentrations were only 2x higher than untreated biofilms with an average cell cluster size 1.3x larger than cells released from untreated biofilms (3.42 cells/cluster). eDNA disruption released cells at concentrations and sizes similar to untr eated biofilms. Conclusions We report that S. epidermidis biofilm disruption using pH -based matrix solubilization results in the rapid release of high concentrations of cells with large cluster sizes, while disruption targeting proteins or DNA within the m atrix releases lower concentrations of cells with smaller cluster sizes. These results indicate that disrupting different biofilm matrix components enables various release profiles, which is important for understanding biofilm disassembly and dispersion, a nd for developing matrix -targeted biofilm therapeutics that prevent the of infection. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-311-ASM -BIO Topic 1: and Dispersal Publishing Title: COMPARING PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background : Dispersal agents are currently being investigated to improve antibiotic efficacy and host clearance in an attempt to combat persistent, biofilm -related of the biofilm matrix. This has previously resulted in the disassembly of the EPS in 2 day biofilms, followed by bacterial release. In contrast, another dispersal agent, sig naling. In this study, we compared the efficacy and release pattern of -amylase and cis-DA on late stage biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Methods : P. aeruginosa PAO1, was grown for 3, 4, and 5 days in both 24 -well plates and biofilm tube reactors (BTR) . After growth, biofilms were treated with cis-DA (310 nM), -amylase (5%), or saline (control). Viability counts were performed on supernatant liquid and remaining biofilms to calculate percent dispersed. Optical density (600 nm) was also used as a second ary measure of biofilm dispersion. Results : -Amylase significantly released bacteria from the biofilm on days 3, 4, and 5. However, under the conditions of this experiment, cis-DA only significantly dispersed day 4 biofilms. Additionally, time -course disp ersion assays in BTRs showed that cell -release from -amylase treatments appeared to be a gradual release after ~25 minutes of exposure as opposed to the sudden release previously characterized for cis-DA and other signal -based dispersion inducers. Conclus ions : The data suggest that -amylase cell release is not dependent on stage of biofilm development, while cis-DA shows sensitivity to developmental stage. Previous studies on -amylase dispersion efficacy focused on early stage biofilms (2 day), this expe riment expands the understanding of -amylase by showing similar efficacy into later stage biofilm growth (3 -5 day). Differences in observed biofilm release patterns for -amylase and cis-DA could be attributed to the mechanism of action for each dispersal agent; -amylase is an enzyme that gradually degrades the biofilm matrix from the outside -in and cis-DA is a quorum sensing molecule that initiates gene regulation required for the sudden burst - release of cells from the inside -out. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-325-ASM -BIO Title: PROBIOTICS DERMAL MATRIX Abstract Body: Background: Staphylococcus aureus biofilm infections are devastating for an innumerable number of patients, especially those with pernicious implantable material infections. For instance, infection remains the most frequently given reason for surgical read mission following breast implant surgery, and S. aureus has been found to be the most common culprit. Current treatment options, such as antibiotics and surgical revision do not prevent biofilm development. Probiotic bacteria, such as lactobacillus species , provide a new option for inhibiting pathogenic biofilms on implant materials. Although probiotics are considered advantageous and non -toxic, as a live organism they may still pose risks, such as inducing a host immune response. However, the biosurfactant s produced by probiotic bacteria may be equally advantageous. Methods: The ability of probiotics and probiotic biosurfactants to prevent the development of S. aureus was quantified via zone of inhibition assays. Xen40, a methicillin -sensitive S. aureus strain derived from osteomyelitis isolate was used to develop pathogenic biofilms. Probiotic , or L. lactis were developed on 5 mm punch biopsies of Cortiva, an acellular dermal matrix commonly used in breas t reconstruction surgeries. Alternatively, the biosurfactants from each strain were evaluated against Xen 40 at concentrations from 0 -181 mg/mL. The antibiotic ciprofloxacin was used as a positive control, and the results were further quantified using colo ny forming units to enumerate Xen 40 following exposure, and crystal violet assays to measure biomass inhibition. Results: Probiotic biofilms were easily produced on the Cortiva implant material. The zones of inhibition created by the probiotic biofilms L. rhamnosus L. plantarum, and L. paracasei were comparable to, or greater than, that created by 2 \u00b5g/mL of ciprofloxacin. The biosurfactants derived , each demonstrated significant antimicrobial ability, decreasing biofilm biomass by an average of 43% 22.72 mg/mL bacteria, and probiotic biosurfactants can inhibit the of S. aureus biofilms on the implantable acellular dermal matrix, Cortiva, and should be further explored as a potential suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-330-ASM -BIO Topic 1: PHENOTYPES Abstract Body: Background : Biofilm -resident bacteria are highly recalcitrant to antibiotics and host immune effectors. Thus, effective strategies to treat biofilm -related diseases are urgently needed. Our laboratory has focused on the DNABII family of proteins which lend structural support to the extracellular DNA matrix. In biofilms incubated with monoclonal antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide that mimics the DNA -binding 'tips' of a DNABII protein, hereafter referred to as ' - DNABII,' a series of events occur that ultima tely lead to release of biofilm -resident bacteria. These newly released bacteria (' -DNABII NRel') are significantly more susceptible to antibiotic -mediated killing than biofilm -resident bacteria, and importantly are also more susceptible than their isogen ic planktonically grown counterparts. Here, we compare planktonic and -DNABII NTHI NRel to a sub -population that more likely mimics bacteria in fluids that bathe a biofilm in a disease site, the non -biofilm associated (NBfA) sub -population. We conducted targeted transcriptomics and determined the antibiotic sensitive kinetic profile, membrane porosity and sensitivity to killing by human PMNs exhibited by - DNABII NTHI NRel. Methods: To determine the kinetic profile sensitivity, -DNABII NTHI NRel and NBfA were incubated with two antibiotics commonly prescribed for NTHI -induced disease. Bacterial membrane porosity was determined by fluorescence emitted by a nucleic acid intercalating dye (Sytox Green). Sensitivity to PMN -mediated killing was de termined by incubation with PMA PMNs with or Results: High of -DNABII NTHI NRel to killing by a -lactam antibiotic developed within 1 min and lasted ~6 h. The -DNABII NTHI NRel sub - populati on showed upregulation of genes canonically linked to lag phase, exhibited greater membrane porosity and were significantly more susceptible to NADPH -oxidase sensitive intracellular PMN killing Conclusions: our -DNABII monoclonal antibody rapidly releases biofilm -resident bacteria into a state that is unique and now more sensitive to killing by a -lactam antibiotic and human PMNs. The se data support continued development of a therapeutic antibody -based strategy for biofilm disease resolution. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 BY A HUMANIZED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY WERE HIGHLY SENSITIZED TO KILLING BY Body: Background: The \"silent\" pand emic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is responsible for millions of global deaths per year, with a group of 7 biofilm -forming pathogens, known as the ESKAPEE pathogens, responsible for 70% of these fatalities. Several laboratories have demonstrated that bacteria newly released from a biofilm display a transient phenotype of increased susceptibility to antibiotics. One mechanism of biofilm disruption our laboratory has focused on is the use of antibodies directed at an essential biofilm structural componen t, the DNABII family, that stabilize the biofilm matrix. Incubation of biofilms with -DNABII antibodies induces a rapid collapse of the biofilm with concomitant release of bacteria. We previously showed that these newly released bacteria (NRel) also displ ay a phenotype of significantly increased susceptibility to antibiotics, which led us to consider development of a combinatorial therapy of co -delivery of -DNABII antibodies with antibiotics, but now delivered at a reduced dose. Toward this goal, we sough t to use a humanized monoclonal antibody (HuTipMab) directed against the DNABII family of proteins to attempt to potentiate killing of ESKAPEE NRel by traditional antibiotics. Methods: Each ESKAPEE pathogen was allowed to form a biofilm for 16hr. An inocul um of either planktonically HuTipMab -induced NRel of each pathogen was incubated for 2 hr with antibiotics currently used clinically to treat individuals with disease induced by said ESKAPEE pathogen. Relative membrane permeability of each ESKAPEE NRel subpopulation compared to their planktonically grown counterparts was also determined via uptake of the fluorescent nucleic acid stain SYTOX Green. Results: NRel of each ESKAPEE pathogen were significantly more sensitive to killing by antibiotics com pared to their planktonically grown counterparts even when used at a fraction of the MIC (P 0.05 - 0.001). Increased membrane permeability of each NRel population indicated that uptake of antibiotics was likely one mechanism that underlay this heightened sensitivity to killing. Conclusions: These data support continued development and forthcoming clinical assessment of a combinatorial therapy to facilitate HuTipMab -mediated biofilm disruption with killing of induced NRel by a reduced dose of antibiotics to both provide an effective clinical outcome while simultaneously reducing the potential contribution to AMR. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-336-ASM -BIO Tolerance: Antimicrobials Biofilms Publishing Title: THE EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTIC AND PHAGE THERAPIES ON BIOFILMS Abstract Body: THE EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTIC AND PHAGE THERAPIES ON BIOFILMS Background: The growth and persistence of biofilms are a problematic source of chronic infection and contamination for biological hosts as well as medical devices. In clinical treatment, biofilm -asso ciated bacteria are often among the most difficult infections to cure not only because they are protected from antibiotic chemotherapy but also because they act as a refuge for bacteria that can then seed secondary infections. This has led to increased int erest in phage therapies in recent years as antibiotic resistance has become commonplace. Methods: Using a newly developed experimental platform for biofilms in chemostats, we investigated the effects that an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) or a lytic phage hav e on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in both biofilm and planktonic conditions when the bacteria originate from within biofilm communities. We exposed the bacteria to sub -minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin or to high levels of a l ytic phage recently isolated by our team from a soil sample from Queens, NY. Results: Ciprofloxacin and phage treatments produced different results in the sizes of both the planktonic and biofilm communities at 96 hours. Antibiotic chemotherapy significant ly lowered planktonic population size but not biofilm size, reaffirming biofilms as a refuge from chemotherapy. Phage therapy had no effect on planktonic population size, but biofilm size was significantly larger than control (p=0.019). Conclusions: The difficulty of removing biofilm is evident in our results. The antibiotic reduced planktonic population size relative to control (p=0.052) but failed to reduce the size of biofilms. This result suggests that antibiotic therapy is likely a poor choice for clear ing biofilm -associated bacteria but may be effective in limiting the spread of bacteria and subsequent formation of new populations. In contrast, therapy with lytic phages did not impact planktonic populations at 96 hrs but was associated with significantl y larger biofilm population sizes, suggesting that the biofilm bacteria were positively affected by the presence of a lytic phage. This result suggests that phage therapies cannot be simply viewed as a replacement for antibiotics. Whether resistance to the phage evolved over the 96 hours of exposure and the mechanisms underlying the positive effect of the phage on biofilms are currently being investigated. Our results also highlight the versatility of our newly developed experimental platform for studying b iofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-337-ASM -BIO and Asocial Interactions Biofilms Publishing Title: COMMUNITY INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF MULTISPECIES BIOFILMS - THE ROLE OF THE MATRIX Abstract Body: Introduction: Multispecies biofilms are black boxes. While past studies have analyzed bacterial interactions in multispecies biofilms and determined their overa ll effects, there is a knowledge gap in the mechanistic drivers which develop the biofilm's community intrinsic properties. We aim to study the biofilm of a 4 -species community in order to gain insights into the underlying system. Biofilm components and pr operties, such as the biofilm matrix, colony morphology, and swarming patterns, can provide insight into community intrinsic properties. Methods: Previously, four strains co -isolated from the synergistic biofilm in vitro. Matrix stains such as hexidium iodide, SYPRO Ruby, Film Tracer Green Biofilm stain, and Nile Red were utilized to characterize the matrix components of mono - and multispecies biofilms by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Additionally, in combination with the integration of fluorescent markers, we studied spatial organization. Finally, we studied cell morphology from different posit ions of swarms under the microscope to understand the temporospatial dynamics of swarm development and how it differs when species are combined. We are currently in the process of creating a library of mutants, in an attempt to identify pivotal genes of shared swarming. Results: Individually, P. amylolyticus, M. oxydans , S. rhizophila , and X. retroflexus showed no swarming behavior; the phenomena was only present in the 4-mix consortium. Additionally, matrix component staining allowed for the comparison of matrix composition between mono - and multispecies biofilms. Discussion: Using this multispecies model community and fluorescent markers, we attempt to unlock the functions of matrix components when shared among species. As we increase the number of images and generate more data, we will also get more insight into the dynamics of matrix development of multi species communities. Finally, by monitoring the locomotion of the 4 -mix community in swarms, we plan to identify key players of this emergent property. The findings from the in vitro community studies will also be verified in a higher complexity environmen t, more accurately mimicking biofilms found in soil. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Tolerance: Biofilms Publishing Title: IDENTIFYING SIGNALS THAT used to treat multidrug -resistant bacterial infections such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs. CAP resistance is conferred by the arn operon, which is regulated by the two-component systems (TCS) PmrAB typhimurium, PmrAB and PhoPQ work in concert to regulate arn expression, while in P. aeruginosa they function independently, creating a redundancy. Environmental signals inducing these TCS vary between species such as low Mg2+, low Ca2+, high Zn2+, high Fe3+, high Al3+, and low pH. We hypothesized that if the two TCS work independently in P. aeruginosa , then PmrAB and PhoPQ will respond differentially to environmental cues. Methods: We used a luminescence reporter for the arn operon to screen various signals across different modes of growth in wild -type PAO1, pmrA and phoP to determine how each TCS regulates arn expression. Reporter activity was correla ted with colistin susceptibility and transcription of the arn operon as well as PmrA - and PhoP -regulated genes pmrA and PAO1. Results: We exposed planktonic and biofilm cells to high concentrations of magnesium and calcium i ons, which coincided with decreased arn expression in PAO1 and pmrA but not phoP based on luminescence reporter assays. This suggests that high levels of magnesium and calcium repress the arn operon through the PhoPQ system. In contrast, iron had no effect on arn expression while high concentrations of zinc decreased arn expression only in pmrA. Our findings differ from previous reports indicating that zinc induces arn expression. qRT -PCR conf irmed that low magnesium or calcium conditions coincide with repression of arn as well as PmrA - and PhoP -regulated genes in pmrA and planktonic and biofilm cells were more susceptible to colistin treatment under low mag nesium conditions. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, of the environmental signals tested, magnesium and calcium are the major cues involved in regulating CAP resistance through PmrAB and PhoPQ in P. aeruginosa, with PhoPQ potentially being the predom inant regulator. Low concentrations of these ions, which are present in the CF lung, induce CAP resistance, suggesting that colistin is not effective against P. aeruginosa unless the PmrAB and PhoPQ and Asocial Interactions in Biofilms Publishing Title: INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN CHRONIC WOUND INFECTIONS Abstract Body: Background: Chronic wounds are a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Delayed healing results from infections that are polymicrobial and biofilm -associated, and the pathogens most frequently co -isolated are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Competitive interactions between these pathogens contribute to enhanced virulence, persistence, and antimicrobial tolerance. P. aeruginosa uses quorum sensing -regulated proteases LasA, LasB, and AprA to target S. aureus. Consequently, S. aureus can evade this competitive stress through biofilm formation, facilitated by mechanisms of aggregation. S. aureus surface protein G (SasG) facilitates intercellular aggregation via homodimeric interactions upon proteolysis non -native protease, ultimately formin g a biofilm. This work aims to evaluate how S. aureus SasG promotes biofilm formation in response to interactions with P. aeruginosa proteases, and investigate the impact of SasG -dependent biofilms on persistence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and chronic wound outcomes. Methods: This study used S. aureus strain USA400 P. for 1 evaluated by incubating purified SasG with PAO1 supernatant followed by SDS -PAGE. Biofilm formation was observed with the Lubbock Chronic Wound Biofilm Model over 24 hours. Wound - like media was inoculated with 10 \u00b5L/species of bacteria, normalize d to ~106 CFU/mL. Results: demonstrate that and induced by A -domain of data indicate that biofilms formed by SasG -expressing MRSA are more stable upon challenge with PAO1 in a chronic wound environm ent. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that PAO1 proteases cleave SasG, which induces MRSA intercellular aggregation, resulting in formation of a free -floating biofilm that is more tolerant to environmental stress. We propose that SasG -dependent biofilm s may impact MRSA persistence and antimicrobial susceptibility in polymicrobial chronic wounds, contributing to delayed wound healing, treatment failure, and severe patient outcomes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-353-ASM -BIO Biofilms Publishing Title: Lipoxazolidinone Natural Product Derivative Displays Potent in vitro Antibiofilm Activity Abstract Body: Backgroud : Bacterial resistance mechanisms are contributing to an overall lack of antibiotic efficacy among traditional antibiotics, yet many recurring and persistent bacterial infections are tolerant to existing antibiotics through their ability to form biofilms. Current treatments for long -term biofilm -mediated infections, particularly those caused by methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), may include antibiotic combination therapies and/or vancomycin. The existing complications caused by biofilm -medi ated bacterial infections warrant investigation into antimicrobial therapeutics with high degrees of activity against pathogenic biofilms. Previous work has shown that the 4 -oxazolidinone family of natural products displays high degrees of antimicrobial ac tivity with methicillin -susceptible MRSA strain ATCC 33591. Our objective was to further characterize the in vitro antibacterial activity of a leading 4 -oxazolidinone analog (SYNX_0001) against a wider panel of releva nt species and their respective biofilms. Methods : In order to assess the activity, we performed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assays against a panel of biofilm -forming pathogens of ( S. aureus, gallinarum, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae ). The antibacterial activity of the compound was further assessed in a time -dependent manner against MSSA and MRSA strains in both planktonic and pre -formed biofilm states, with accompanying live/dead fluorescent imaging of treated mature MSSA biofilms. Results : SYNX_0001 displayed a high degree of inhibition against gram -positive species in planktonic and biofilm states, evident by MIC ranges of 0.5 to 2 g/ml and MBEC ranges of 1 to 64 g/ml. This activity was not reflected in the gram - negative species tested, as MICs ranged anywhere from 64 to exceeding 256 g/ml and MBECs exceeded 1 mg/ml. Finally, SYNX_0001 displayed concentration - dependent bacteriostatic activity against plan ktonic MSSA and MRSA cells, and activity against pre -formed MSSA biofilms over 24 -hour time periods. Conclusions : These in vitro results indicate that 4 -oxazolidinone derivatives are potent inhibitors of gram -positive bacterial species with an tibiofilm activity that warrants further investigation as a potential treatment of biofilm -mediated infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Mechanisms Publishing Title: RELEASE BIOFILM RESIDENCE BY A HUMANIZED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SIGNFICANTLY AUGMENTED THEIR KILLING BY AMIKACIN Abstract Body: Background: People with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) are subject to and recurrent lung infections. Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium are two NTM species to which PwCF are highly susceptible. The ability of both species to form biofilm aggregates in the lungs of PwCF contributes to the recalcitrance and chronicity of their lung disease. Novel approaches are warranted as the current standard of care involves years of aggressive, broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy and is often unsuc cessful. We, and others, have shown that bacteria newly released from biofilm residence display a unique phenotype of enhanced susceptibility to antibiotic -mediated killing. We therefore sought to determine if a humanized monoclonal antibody (HuTipMab) aga inst an essential biofilm structural element (DNABII protein), which had shown broad ability to disrupt biofilms and generate newly released bacteria (NRel), was also effective against those formed by the two most common pathogenic NTM species in PwCF. Fur ther, we assessed whether M. abscessus NRel were similarly rendered more susceptible to killing than bacteria in the milieu above the biofilm [e.g. non-biofilm associated (NBfA)], specifically by antibiotics used treat NTM infections, amikacin and azithromycin. NTM homolog was confirmed by Western abscessus or 2-week M. avium biofilms were incubated with medium alone, HuIgG (isotype control) or increasing concentrations of HuTipMab for 30 - or 60 -min. Wells were stained with FM1 -43 FX, fixed for 2 -hr, and relative degree of disruption was evaluated by CLSM. Biomass values were ca lculated via COMSTAT2. For antibiotic killing assays, M. abscessus biofilms were incubated with medium or HuTipMab with and without antibiotics for 2hr with killing determined by comparative plate count. Results: We showed that HuTipMab effectively disrupt ed biofilms formed by both NTM species in a dose - and time -dependent manner (P 0.01 - 0.0001). Further, we demonstrated that M. abscessus NRel were significantly more susceptible to amikacin and azithromycin than their isogenic, NBfA counterparts (P 0.001). Conclusion: These data support use of a novel therapeutic strategy for PwCF that releases NTM from biofilm residence into a state that can be more effectively treated with a reduced dose, and perhaps shorter regimen, of existing antibiotics. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-360-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Mechanisms Promoting Biofilm Disassembly and Dispersal Publishing Title: Investigating via including biofilm formation (aggregation) and dispersal, chemotaxis into the symbiotic organ, and growth inside. Of these, biofilm dispersal is the least studied step. Th e sensor kinase (SK) VF_1397 and response regulator (RR) VF_1396 are homologous to the V. cholerae dispersal factor proteins DbfS and DbfR. We thus hypothesized that VF_1396 and VF_1397 are dispersal factors in V. fischeri .We investigated the role of VF_13 97 in dispersal of V. fischeri by evaluating phenotypes of a deletion mutant. Timelapse imaging was used to visualize and track biofilm formation and dispersal over time. Biofilm formation was assessed by using calcium to induce biofilms in shaking liquid cultures. Motility was evaluated via soft agar plates.Timelapse experiments showed the VF_1397 mutant formed larger biofilms than the wild -type (WT) strain and failed to disperse. In shaking cultures, the VF_1397 mutant displayed increased biofilm format ion, indicated by increased rings at the air -liquid interface. The role of polysaccharides and surface adhesins was investigated with double mutants VF_1397 bcsA (cellulose) and VF_1397 lapV (Lap surface adhesin). Neither double mutant had increased biof ilm in shaking conditions, suggesting cellulose and LapV are critical for the increased biofilm. In motility assays, calcium addition severely diminished motility of the VF_1397 mutant. The motility defect of the VF_1397 mutant was not rescued by disrupt ion of bcsA or lapV , indicating the involvement of another factor. A VF_1396 VF_1397 mutant displayed WT phenotypes to VF_1397 . Suppressors of the VF_1397 mutant were isolated by spotting onto a motility agar plate with high calcium and incubating at 24oC for 18 hours. One class of suppressors suppressed motility only while another class suppressed both biofilm and motility phenotypes.Our data suggest, simil ar to the V. Cholerae pathway, VF_1397 appears to be a dispersal factor for V. fischeri that functions upstream of VF_1396. Further, these data reveal a critical role for VF_1397 in promoting bacterial motility, which may contribute to the proces s. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Body: Background: Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that are characterized by uncontrolled pathogeni c inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract leading to the disruption of intestinal homeostasis. The disease pathogenesis is complex and includes genetic, microbial and environmental factors. Studies have shown that there is a significant association of t he pathobiont adherent -invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) with Crohn's Disease. The AIEC produces an amyloid fiber called curli which facilitates robust biofilms that aid in its survival. Gastrokine -1 is an anti -amyloidogenic protein produced and secreted in to the gastrointestinal tract. Mice lacking GKN1 are more susceptible to induced models of colitis. We therefore investigated whether gastrokine -1 inhibits AIEC amyloid and biofilm formation and whether GKN1 -/- mice are more susceptible to AIEC infection a Study Design: Amyloid formation by in vitro was assessed using ThT fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations of recombinant gastrokine -1. Biofilm formation by AIEC in vitro in the presence or abs ence of recombinant gastrokine -1 was assessed by crystal violet staining. To test the role of gastrokine -1 in vivo, WT and gastrokine -1-/- mice were challenged orally with AIEC and colonization and pathology were assessed at up to day 7 of infection. Resul ts: Our in vitro studies show that 1) in the presence of Gkn1, E. Coli CsgA amyloid fiber formation is inhibited, and 2) Gkn1 prevents biofilm formation by AIEC. The in vivo preliminary results show higher CFU/gram in the cecum and colon contents in Gkn1 -/- vs WT mice at 7 days post infection. Discussion: The in vitro results indicate that Gkn1, a host derived protein inhibits AIEC amyloid fiber and AIEC biofilm formation. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that GKN1 is required for protection agains t acute AIEC infection and inflammation in the gut. We are currently investigating the role of GKN1 in chronic AIEC infection. GKN1 inhibition of microbial amyloids and biofilms may be a potential mechanism for GKN1 mediated protection against colitis. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-375-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Disassembly and Dispersal Publishing Title: BDLA DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VIRULENCE IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Abstract Body: Background. Approximately 85% of all bacterial infections are biofilm -associated, impeding antibiotic and host response clearance. To combat these infections, dispersion is a promising avenue for novel therapeutics to improve bacterial clearance. The mechanism of disp ersion has been previously investigated in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) . The phenotype of these dispersed cells is still being investigated as they seem to be a 'third' phenotype exhibiting a mixed behavior of planktonic and biofilm -associated cells. It is known that the chemotaxis protein, BdlA, plays an important role in the dispersion response to environmental cues through interacting with the phosphodiesterase (PDE) DipA to reduce c -di- GMP levels. However, it is unknown whether or not BdlA interacts with a similar PDE, RbdA or if the virulent phenotype associated with some n utrient induced dispersed cells is BdlA or c -di-GMP driven. Methods. In this study, we utilized bacterial constructs to determine if phenotypes associated with dispersion is driven by BdlA or changes in c -di-GMP levels. Bacterial strains were grown overnig ht in Luria -Bertani (LB) broth or sub -cultured 4 -5 hours in LB or 1 x VBMM and OD adjusted to 0.2 for either stationary or exponential phase, respectively. Cells were suspended in either LB (motility, susceptibility, pyocyanin and 1 % arabinose to induce plasmid expression (attachment). Results. Our results suggest that the PDEs DipA and RbdA are required for swimming and swarming motility, however their activity is independent of BdlA activation. DipA pl ayed a role in colistin susceptibility while RbdA was important for tobramycin susceptibility. Both PDEs required BdlA activation to be susceptible to antibiotics. Attachment was negatively regulated by PDE activation. Lastly, pyocyanin production seemed t o require DipA activated by BdlA. Conversely, pyoverdine production was negatively regulated by DipA and RbdA activation. All phenotypes exhibited to be driven by c -di-GMP levels. Conclusion. In conclusion, our results suggest that BdlA might interact with the PDE RbdA as tobramycin susceptibility required RbdA activity in the presence of BdlA. However, BdlA activation is not always required for DipA and RbdA activity as suggested in our motility results. Overall, the phenotypes investigated in this study were driven by c -di-GMP levels. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Tolerance: Antimicrobials Biofilms Publishing Title: Effect of the absence of OprF on the P. aeruginosa susceptibility to complement proteins and engulfment by macrophages Abstract Body: Title: Effect of the absence of OprF on the P. aeruginosa susceptibility to complement proteins and engulfment by macrophages Authors: Shazrah Syed and Claudia sPersister cells, a subpopulation of dormant/low metabolic cells are tolerant to the immune response and difficult to clear, and as such, they are thought to be responsible for the resiliency of chronic and recurring infections. When P. aeruginosa persiste r cells transition from a dormant to a metabolically active state, several proteins present higher abundance, including OprF. In this work, we hypothesized that tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persister cells to the immune response is dependent on OprF . To test this hypothesis, we used P. aeruginosa PA14 oprF knockout ( oprF) as THP -1 macrophages. Macrophage infections were performed at a moi of 50 and serum with complement proteins was used at 90% concentration. Persister ce lls were selected by using ciprofloxacin (20 mg/L) for a period of 24 hours and after removal of dead cells. We found that macrophages engulf WT persister cells 100 - 1000x lower than WT regular cells, while oprF persister cells are engulfed to undetected levels. oprF regular cells are engulfed similarly to WT persister cells. Complement proteins found in human serum -that kill bacteria by forming a membrane attack complex - did not eradicate WT persister cells but eradicated WT regular cells within 24 ho urs of exposure, while oprF persister and regular cells were both eradicated within 3 hours of exposure. These data indicate that that the OprF protein is a necessary component in the susceptibility of persister cells to the immune response and could be a target for treatment of infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-380-ASM -BIO Tolerance: Antimicrobials and Biofilms Publishing Title: Antibiotic tolerance of Staphylococcus aureus aggregates in vitro Abstract Body: Background Numerous groups have reported on the rapid staphylococcal aggregation that occurs in synovial fluid (SF). It has been hypothesized that this aggregation provides the initial protection from antimicrobials prior to the development of a biofilm. Previous wor k from our group derived that large, free - floating S. aureus aggregates formed under fluid flow displayed significant recalcitrance when exposed to gentamicin. In the following work, we continue our investigation into aggregate conferred protection from va rious host fluids and polymers. Methods By exposing S. aureus to SF under flow for varying time points, we were able to stimulate varying sizes of aggregates and determine their recalcitrance to antibiotics. Viability counts were also performed to determine if human serum, a possible contaminate into the joint environment following surgery, or fibrinogen alone provided protection. Finally, antibiotic -mediated killing was evaluated using a bioluminescent strain of S. aureus and an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) .Results Interestingly, 15 minutes of dynamic exposure to SF was enough to generate a significant increase in S. aureus survival (Figure 1c). Conversely, exposure to the proteins and other host molecules in serum did not provide a similar protective effect. Finally, exposure to fibrinogen under the same flow conditions as our previous SF experiments resulted in aggregate mediated protection. Conclusion The aggregation of S. aureus in the post -operative joint is dependent on a variety of host fluids and the po lymers in them. We report that to an extent, longer exposure to SF under flow increases the percent survival of S. aureus in aggregates. Further, aggregation due to serum does not provide comparable protection from antibiotics. Thus, the exposure of S. aur eus to SF and the subsequent aggregation may potentially aid in early bacterial survival from antibiotics. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-384-ASM -BIO Publishing Title: The Antimicrobial Peptide LL -37 Promotes Penetration Antibiotics through Infected Sputum Abstract Body: Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited autosomal recessive genetic disease that results in progressive multisystem disease and mortality. The buildup of thick mucus in the lung airways impairs bacterial clearance and allows for colonization by bacterial pathogens. Inhaled antibiotics are critical for managing chronic pulmonary infections in CF; however, little is known about how environments in CF lung airways impacts antibiotic diffusion. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is one of the most common pathogens cause infections in CF airways. We previously identified a role for Pf bacteriophage as a structural element in Pa biofilms. In particular, Pf phage organizes host and bacterial polymers present in sputum that encases P. aeruginosa and promotes antibiotic tolerance. We also reported that Pf phage are abundant and highly prevalent in the lungs of individuals with CF. This is associated with incre ased bacterial colonization and worsening respiratory function. Methods: Through a Fluorescent Recovery after Photobleaching assay (FRAP), diffusion of various inhaled antibiotics were determined to understand how Pf phages and polymers affect antibiotic d iffusion. Then isothermal calorimetry assay (ITC) was used to determine the interaction between phage, polymers, and antibiotics. Finally, FRAP and ITC were used to understand how to reverse phage and polymers' interactions with antibiotics. Results: We re veal that Pf phage organize sputum in ways that prevent the diffusion of antibiotics as well as reduce their antimicrobial efficacy. Moreover, we demonstrate that while Pf phage can attenuate the antimicrobial effects of LL -37, sputum biofilms, enhances antibiotic penetration into biofilms, and improves antibiotic killing efficiency. Conclusion : Our study suggests that LL -37 and Pf phage have opposing effects on an tibiotic diffusion and efficacy in sputum where LL -37 promotes antibiotic diffusion in biofilm and Pf phage disrupts antibiotic diffusion in biofilm. ---PAGEBREAK I V Abstracts Control Number: 2022 -A-74-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Genomic analyses of biofilm -forming and non -biofilm -forming coli populations from meat processing environments Abstract Body: Biofilms are microbial communities embedded in self -produced extracellular substances (e.g., curli and cellulose) and can cause the recalcitrant contamination of meat with pathogenic and generic Escherichia coli . The objectives of this study were to : 1). To determine the phylogenetic relationship of biofilm forming and non-biofilm forming E. coli from various stages of beef processing; 2). To characterize genetic elements involved in biofilm formation in E. coli . A total of 114 E. coli isolates from beef carcasses before hide -on wash (BHW; n=20) and after hide-on wash (AHW; n=20), and from carcasses before (CH0H; n=20) and after chilling (CH4H; n=20), fabrication equipment before n=20) and genome sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqX platform. The isolates from each source had equal number of extremely strong biofilm formers and non -biofilm formers as determined by the crystal violet staining method except for the EAC populat ion where only three non - biofilm formers were available. The sequences were processed and annotated using an in -house workflow. Each genome was in silico typed for phylogroup. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on core genes. Genome wide association analysis was carried out using Scoary. The 114 isolates belonged to four phylogroups, A (n=33, 50.9% of the biofilm formers and non - formers, respectively, followed by the A phylogroup at 23.0% and 35.9%, respectively. Unlike isolates in all other groups, the EAC isolates were exclusively of phylogroup B1. The core genome tree showed intermingle of though clustering of clo sely related isolates were spread out the entire tree. No genes were overrepresented in the biofilm formers, compared to the non -biofilm formers, based on Scoary analysis, with the criteria of present in >60% of the biofilm former group, but absent in > 60 % of the non -biofilm formers. Interestingly, missing genes in the bcs operon (cellulose synthesis) did not always result in a cellulose negative phenotype, contrary to the csg operon (curli) and curli phenotype, as determined by the commonly used Congo Red method. The findings show redundancy in genes involved in biofilm formation for E. coli . ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-85-ASM -BIO Topic and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: sdfaf Abstract Body: Background In this research, we tested the hypothesis that bacteria producing less extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) can provide more effective biofilm -based treatment processes. The hypothesis was tested with a membrane -aerated biofi lm reactor (MABR) and ultrafiltration membrane reactor (UMR). MABRs are an emerging wastewater treatment technology that has many advantages over the conventional activated sludge plant, including a reduced footprint, less stripping of volatile pollutants, and lower energy costs. UMR is a water treatment system that has a smaller footprint and high -quality effluent than conventional systems. Both systems produce biofilms on the membrane surface. Reduced EPS production can result in higher -density biofilms, providing greater contamination removal rates in an MABR and reduced biofouling in UMR. Methods Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was selected as a model organism. P. aeruginosa produces three main types of EPS: alginate, Pel and PsI. The effect of EPS was studi ed by comparing the wild type with a genetically modified strain with suppressed Pel production (mutant). With reduced EPS production, the biofilm density was expected to increase and the biofilm thickness decrease. This could reduce mass transfer resistan ce and increase permeability. Results For the MABR reactor, the wild type biofilm had a lower steady state biofilm thickness, greater soluble COD removal., and higher effluent suspended solids. For ultrafiltration membrane reactor (UMR), there was no signi ficant difference in sCOD between the wild type and mutant biofilms. However, significant biofouling did not occur until much later for the mutant, compared to the wild type. Discussion Our results show the mutant produced a higher cell density biofilm tha n the wild type. High cell density biofilms can affect the performance and maintenance of biofilm -based systems. The low -EPS culture produced thinner biofilms with higher degradation kinetics than the wild type in an MABR. Finally, tests showed that mutant biofilms were mechanically weaker than the wild type. This could make them more vulnerable to sloughing. This research showed that low EPS production results in improved performance for the MABR and UMR. Further research is needed to determine conditions favoring low EPS production in practice. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-108-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Sensitivity enhancement of ssDNA sensor for detection of E. coli and E. flexnery through ECL Abstract Body: Background Bacteria are widespread all over the world, evolving and acquiring survival tools parallely [1]. Lately, multidrug resistant bacteria have gained fame reaching the top public threats [2]. Some of them are able to form a sophisticated shelter structures cal led biofilms [3] making accurate on -time detection the determinant step. Nowadays, there are a few bacteria under surveillance among ESKAPE group, E. coli and other ubiquitous bacteria such as E. flexneri can be found [2][4][5] . Methods The project introdu ces a ssDNA sensor based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for E. coli and E. flexneri detection using a ssDNA probe linked to a modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) and to a screen printed electrodes (SPEs) with quantum dots (QDs) and Nafion, to which the target hybridises, and a to [Ru(bpy) 2]2+, picH 2, 2 Cl- , as well as the de novo design of the ECL cell. Results The DLS showed a peak mean of 400-500 nm for [Ru(bpy) mMO@Ru. The UV -Vis and fluorometry exhibited discrepancies and similarly the ECL intensity showing an enlargement of the signal afterwards the modification. The STEM and the prior data suggested a high aggregation degree due to hydrogen bonds [6] and metal ion interactions [7], reduced after the coupling. The sensing capacity of the decorated GCEs evaluated at 16 pM was satisfactory as well as the signal enrichment . The SPEs characterization yielded a great signal however the sensing data is still in progre ss. Conclusions To sum up, this is the first time that [Ru(bpy) 2]2+, picH 2, 2Cl- demonstrates its diagnosis potential for spp. Albeit non -relevant proof of QDs as coreactant raised [8], their relevance in signal improvement was remarked. Additi onally, our work represents not only a vast breakthrough in sensor's development but also a testimony of a cooperative response among two luminophores and a posible application of these modified SPEs in diagnostics.

Biofilms once formed are difficult to remove, thus increasing the social -economic burden. Alternative approaches to conventional antibiotic therapy are urgently needed to treat deadly biofilm related infections . The b iofilm matrix is composed of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and protein polymers called amyloid fibrils. Curli are amyloid fibrils produced by Escherichia coli . The major subunit of the curli is CsgA protein that is capable of self -assembling into a myloid fibrils under in vitro conditions. An innovative strategy to prevent biofilms is to inhibit amyloid assembly on the cell surface that contributes to biofilm formation. Methods: To understand relation between biofilm formation and kidney related dialy sis we interrogated cross -talk between -2-microglobulin (2M) and CsgA. We performed CsgA aggregation kinetics in absence and presence of 2M. We tested biofilm inhibitory capacity of 2M by performing pellicle assay in 96 well plates. We confirmed th e antibacterial activity of 2M by disc diffusion assay and growth kinetics. Results: We hypothesized that 2m can prevent bacterial amyloid formation and thus could reduce amyloid -associated biofilm and bacterial colonization inside the human host. Here w e demonstrated that human 2m can prevent amyloid formation by CsgA. The biological significance of the 2m -CsgA interaction was demonstrated by the ability of 2m to inhibit amyloid -dependent biofilm formation by E. coli with no apparent bactericidal or b acteriostatic effects. These findings suggest that 2m may act as chaperone -like protein under normal physiological conditions and may prevent biofilm formation in kidney. However, during dialysis -related amyloidosis, 2m undergoes spontaneous transition t o form amyloids. The non -availability of monomeric 2m could facilitate bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Conclusions: We speculate that insights from this study could shed light on the mechanism of biofilm formation during kidney dialysis. The results will open new avenues to explore 2m like proteins that can act as a broad spectrum anti -amyloid agents and might be utilized to enhance antibiotic efficacy in infections associated with significant biofilm formation. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-111-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: SALMONELLA BIOFILM INHIBITORS: SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN CURING LONG -TERM CARRIERS Abstract Body: Background : Chronic, biofilm -mediated bacterial infections can contribute to repeated re -infections of the patient, community spread, and are a barrier to eradication by antimicrobials. It is essential to develop new pharmacological therapie s that target biofilms. We identified two small molecules, JG -1 and M4, that can inhibit and disperse Salmonella biofilms in vitro and in vivo . In order to better understand their breadth of activity, we examined their anti -biofilm and antibiotic efficacy in pathogens in the ESKAPE group, a leading cause of health -care associated infections. Methods: The species tested included formation in 96 -well polystyrene plates were developed for each species. For biofilm inhibition assays, cultures were incubated with the lead compounds for 24 hrs in 96 -well plates. For biofilm dispersion assays, the lead compounds were added after 24 hrs when biofilms had developed. For both biofilm assays, the biofilm mass was then quantified by crystal violet staining. For the planktonic killing assays, liquid cultures were normalized and incubated with the lead co mpounds. After x hr incubation, an aliquot was plated on agar media for colony enumeration. Results: The biofilm inhibition assays identified that the Enterobacter , P. aeruginosa , and with a JG -1 calculated half maximal inhibitory P. aeruginosa . Treatment with M4 resulted in an IC 50 of 0.81 \u00b5M for Enterobacter and 894 \u00b5M for A. baumannii b disruption assays, compounds biofilms of Enterobacter with JG -1 or M4 resulting in a half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) of 38.8 \u00b5M and 8.59 \u00b5M, respectively. Treatment of S. aureus and E. faecium with 10 \u00b5M of M4 r esults in a bactericidal effect within 4 -8 hours of exposure. Conclusions : We have identified that our lead compounds have significant anti -biofilm activity against Enterobacter spp. , addition, M4 has significant antibio tic activity against S. aureus and E. faecium. Our findings support the claim that our lead compounds have the potential to have a significant impact on treating multiple types of commonly encountered biofilm -mediated infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-131-ASM -BIO Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Serratiopeptidase affects adhesive features of Pseudomonas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen often involved in airway infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. During CF infection, the lung environment is extremely hostile because of the very high concentrations of antibiotics, reduced nutrient availability, elevated osmotic stress and intermicrobial competition: conditions that force P. aeruginosa to adapt for survival. The virulence of P. aerug inosa isolate is strongly related to different factors such as the capability to form a biofilm, different types of cell/colonial motility, production of toxins and the invasion of pulmonary cells. The dynamic process of biofilm formation offers protection to bacterial cells and resistance to drugs and host immune attacks. The self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix (EPS) that can incorporate different bacterial communities ensures their survival and resistance to certain antibiotics, complicating bacterial eradication. Motility also contributes to biofilm formation and bacterial colonization of surfaces. Furthermore, the ability to adhere is the prelude for the internalization into lung cells, a common immune evasion mechanism used by most intracellular bact eria, such as P. aeruginosa . The impairment of bacterial cell adhesion and biofilm formation could represent a major target for the development of new therapeutic treatments for chronic infection control.Previously reports evaluated the anti -infective prop erties as Staphylococci and Listeria monocytogenes . Methods. Clinical bacterial isolated from CF pati ents were classified on the basis of their phenotypic features. The effect of SPEP was assessed during biofilm formation and on mature biofilm. The production of pyocyanin and pyoverdine was also evaluated. The invasion ability of bacteria on eukaryotic ce lls was evaluated by antibiotic protection assay. Results. We demonstrated that SPEP was able to impair the attachment to inert surfaces and adhesion/invasion on eukaryotic cells with a mechanism independent by proteolytic mechanism. Conclusions. This work aims to investigate the effect of SPEP on some virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients, such as biofilm formation and accumulation, pyocyanin and pyoverdine production, motility and invasion to alveolar basal ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-132-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Biomimetic surfaces inspired by cabbage leaves for Escherichia coli biofilm prevention in the food industry Abstract Body: Background Food contact surfaces are usually colonized by microorganisms, even following cleaning and disinfection. They can grow as biofilms, which are contamination sources of finished products, reducing their shelf life and causing foodborne diseases. One way to r educe fouling is to design naturally cleaning surfaces based on biomimetic designs. Methods Four self -cleaning leaves (Tenderheart cabbage, Cauliflower, White cabbage, and Leek) were analysed for their surface properties along with their biomimetic replica tes. The leaves and artificial replicates were subjected to retention assays using Escherichia coli as a model organism. Results All the surfaces were non -wettable (water contact angles higher than 100 \u00b0), with the biomimetic Tenderheart cabbage demonstrat ing the most non -wettable surface. However, when the hydrophobicity of the surfaces was determined, the White cabbage was demonstrated to be the most hydrophobic surface (G - 88 mJ m-2). The natural White cabbage also presented the lowest roughness valu es (S q = 3.5 \u00b5m), although the corresponding replica was the roughest of the fabricated surfaces (S q = 5.3 \u00b5m). The Leek leaves retained more E. coli cells than the other cabbages and it was found that surface hydrophobicity was not a controlling factor in the bacterial retention. The biomimetic surfaces were more efficient at avoiding bacterial retention than natural leaves, indicating that the nano -scale topography associated with the natural leaves is not essential for its antifouling performance in the tested environment. A reduction in bacterial retention of about 1 log was obtained with most of the surfaces produced. Conclusions This work validates the idea that biomimetic surfaces inspired by self -cleaning leaves may have some potential for the develo pment of industrial antifouling surfaces. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-156-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: PRODUCTION AND RELEASE OF AN IRON -CHELATING FACTOR BY PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil bacterium that causes crown gall disease in many plants. Su rface attachment and biofilm formation are essential for the pathogenesis of this bacterium. Identifying compounds that can inhibit biofilm formation may enable the prevention of its pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also exist in the soil and has b een reported in the same environments as A. tumefaciens. P. aeruginosa can inhibit A. tumefaciens biofilm formation through the release of diffusible inhibitors, but the mechanism is unclear. Methods: A. tumefaciens biofilms were detected after 48h using c rystal violet staining. The quantification is measured by the absorbance readings at 590nm. The inhibitor compounds were purified from the culture supernatants using bioassay -guided fractionation and identified by mass spectrometry. Results : We discovered that the P. aeruginosa siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin inhibit A. tumefaciens biofilm formation. However, analysis of a P. aeruginosa mutant specifically deficient for pyochelin and pyoverdine production still inhibited A. tumefaciens biofilm formation through additional factors. Chemical characterization of an inhibitor led to the identification of a pyoverdine biosynthetic precursor, previously unrecognized as an iron chelator. Conclusions: It is well known that iron is an essential nutrient for biofilm formation, and iron limitation has been shown to inhibit A. tumefaciens biofilm formation. Our work reveals how P. aeruginosa uses its siderophores and iron chelators to not only acquire iron for its own growth but also to gain a competitive advantage over other bacteria. To what extent iron chelator production plays a role in wild -type P. aeruginosa remains under active investigation. Di scovering that siderophores and iron chelators inhibit A. tumefaciens biofilm formation could be useful for further applications in plant pathogenesis. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-157-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: SURFACE MODIFICATION OF TITANIUM IMPLANTS TO TITANIUM DISULFIDE FOR ENHANCED ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT Abstract Body: Background: While titanium has long been considered a biocompatible and low toxic material for medical devices such as dental implants, the risk of infections from microbial biofilm introduces complications for patients. Organisms from the oral microbiome, such as Candida albicans , can attach to and colonize on the implant surface, causing periodontal infections. The rapid proliferation of C. albicans results in an uncontrolled biofilm formation and increased tolerance to treatment. Thus, it is critical to investigate a modified surface material to prevent microbial growth. Methods: In this study, titanium surfaces were surface modified by a laser -processing method to form structured surfaces with various coatings including TiO 2 phases (anatase and rutile) and TiS 2 to examine the antimicrobial effect and human gingival fibroblast proliferation. In addition to these titanium samples, smooth as -purchased samples without modifications and laser -structured samples without chemical changes were used as controls. A were to analyze the attachment and colonization of C. albicans treated with and without caspofungin drug. Results: The proliferation order from highest to lowest cell count followed: smooth Ti, structured Ti, rutile TiO 2, anatase TiO 2, and TiS 2 material. While the proliferation of C. albicans was lower in the caspofungin -treated surfaces, the arrangement remained the same. To ensure biocom patibility, the adhesion and viability of human gingival fibroblasts were also tested on modified surfaces. Results from both trypan blue assays and XXT proliferation assay suggest the samples directly interact with the human host cells, with substantial a ttachment and metabolic activity on the TiS 2 surface. Conclusions: Overall, the use of TiS 2 coating showed significant C. albicans biofilm inhibition and human gingival fibroblasts adhesion than other phases of TiO 2 and uncoated samples. The explanation o f biofilm resistance in these samples may be due to the hydrophobicity and surface chemistry of the materials. Because C. albicans have hydrophobic surfaces, the organism prefers to attach to more hydrophobic surfaces, such as the smooth and structured tit anium. These findings point to the utility of TiS 2 material for future dental implants to inhibit infections caused by C. albicans biofilm growth. ---PAGEBREAK --- A MURINE MODEL OF BIOFILM IN THE SINONASAL CAVITY Abstract Body: Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a biofilm -associated inflammatory condition that affects the sinonasal cavity of 10-15% of American adults. Despite the prevalence of biofilm in CRS, little is known about the role biofilm plays in driving disease. Thus, we aim to develop an in vivo model using outbred Swiss - Webster mice that could be used to further examine biofilm in fection in the sinonasal environment. Methods & Results: We hypothesized that two commonly isolated CRS pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), would create localized infection in the sinonasal cavity: forming biofilm and ind ucing inflammation and CRS symptoms. Following nasal inoculation with 1x108 CFU/mL, bacteria were retained for up to 10 days at a stable rate. Furthermore, inoculated strains were retrieved throughout the nasal cavity, including the maxillary sinus. Bacter ia in samples from the sinonasal tissue were susceptible to antibiotic treatment ex vivo , but had viability counts reflective of the bacterial load of CRS patients. We next tested if inflammatory insult could improve bacterial retention. Both allergic sens itization and surfactant treatment prior to inoculation failed to increase the number of bacteria recovered after 5 days of infection. Surfactant treatment prevented nasal colonization by the SA strain, USA300, but did not affect colonization by other SA s trains. Additionally, we investigated the disruption of normal sinonasal microbiota. We hypothesized that by reducing the number of commensals, we would decrease competition and increase niche availability/epithelial attachment sites for SA and PA, thus im proving retention. However, topical pre -treatment with ciprofloxacin did not increase the number of inoculated bacteria retained. Finally, we tested if the addition of matrix components to the inoculation media would increase the protection of bacterial ce lls from host clearance. The addition of glycerol, amino acids, and alginate did not increase retention for SA, but did increase the number of viable bacteria recovered for PA. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the development of biofilm infection in our murine model is multifactorial - influenced by inflammation, host microbiota, inoculated species and strain, and matrix components. Additionally, our data suggests that the inoculation of pathogenic species in the sinonasal cavity is not sufficient a lone to induce CRS symptoms. A disease -relevant model may require disruption of host defenses, which we plan to investigate. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-162-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Potential probiotic, Bacillus subtilis, to counteract Candida albicans and Candida auris virulence and infections Abstract Body: Bacillus subtilis, to counteract Candida albicans and infections Lohith Kunyeit1 and Reeta P Rao11 Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA - 01609 Background: Pathogenic yeasts, Candida albicans, and Candida skin, mucosal, and life -threatening biofilm -associated complications. High mortality and multi -drug resistance, specifically in C. auris, is a major clinical challenge for antifungal therapy. As potential alternatives to treatment and management of these Candida infections, we used a potential probiotic bacterium, Bacillus subtilis , strain NCIB 3610, ameliorates C. albicans and C. auris infections by reducing biofilm and other virulence factors including adhesion and/or filamentation. Methods: First, we assessed the ability of B. subtilis to survive in simulated gastrointestinal juices. Then, we used microplate adhesion and biofilm assays to investigate the effect of B. subtilis on Candida virulence. Finally, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to study the interaction of the B. subtilis and Candida species in a live animal model. Results: The probiotic properties of bacteria, B. subtills , are bette r than or comparable to the commercially available probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. We used L. rhamnosus GG as a reference in our probiotic studies with B. subtilis . Exposure of B. subtilis to Candida pathogens shows that it inhibits the adhesion of C. albicans and several strains of C. auris to abiotic surfaces. Furthermore, probiotic exposure also deters C. albicans filamentation, as result, it blocks the development of the initial stage of biofilm. We found that the treatment also reduces metabolic activity in the intermediate and mature Candida biofilm. In-vivo infection studies using C. elegans exhibit that B. subtilis treatment increase the survival of worms as compared to untreated nematodes. We are investigating the molecular mechanism of the protective effect of B. subtilis . Conclusions: Our results indicate that the ubiquitous bacteria, B. subtilis could serve as an effective alternative to or in combination with conventional antifungal therapy for Candida infections. Funding: This work is 2022 -A-164-ASM -BIO 1: Biofilms Publishing Title: STANDARDIZED NANO -TOPOGRAPHICAL ARRAYS TO STUDY BACTERIAL SURFACE INTERACTION Abstract Body: Background Research to address bacterial biofouling, a significant healthcare and economic burden, can be roughly categorized into chemical and physical methods. Although effective, chemical mechanisms such as antibiotic release layers and metallic coatings can be limited by their reliance on proximity to the bacteria, depletion of chemical stores and potential for resistance. Surface topography is a widely studied physical method to tackle biofouling. However, despite evidence of antifouling, progress is slowed by a lack of consensus in the literature. A major factor in this disagreement is the diversity of shapes, dimensions, and materials tested as well as the lac k of overlapping variables across papers. As these variables impact many surface properties, fair comparison across literature to determine the key variables for bacterial -surface interaction is impossible. To address these limitations and study the combin ed effects of topography and surface chemistry, we have developed a standardized, surface -chemistry tunable, polymeric nanopillar array with multiple spacing -diameter combinations. This high -throughput method allows us to collapse the vast design space usi ng microscopy and in -situ bacterial labeling to observe surface interaction from a birds -eye view guiding us to the most biologically relevant dimensions. Methods Electron beam lithography and Bosch etching are used to nanofabricate silicon master molds. Ser ialnanoimprint lithography with UV -curable polyurethane acrylate is then used to mold the final pillar arrays onto glass coverslips. For the current iteration, the pillar array consists of 25 linearly arranged100umx100um fields of pillars with diameters an d inter -pillar spacings ranging from 300 -1100nm. Physical and chemical vapor deposition will be used to modify surface chemistry. Fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are used to study pillar interaction over time using confocal microscopy. Results Process optimization for nanofabrication and nanoimprint lithography is complete. Preliminary results of bacterial seeding show motile bacteria swimming between and through the pillars of different dimensions as well as varying live/dead ratios dependent on surface coating. Further work will be needed to confirm and extend these results. Conclusions The platform's rapid scanning through multiple dimensions, chemistries, and specie s can eventually be extended to additional variables such as the impact of environmental stressors on bacterial -surface interactions. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: FLUID -INDUCED STAPHYLOCOCCAL AGGREGATES ALTER THE ACTIVITY OF LOCAL AND RECRUITED IMMUNE CELLS Abstract Body: Background The formation of a staphylococcal biofilm in the joint cavity significantly complicates the resolution of infection. Until recently, it was hypothesized that to form a biofilm in the postsurgical joint cavity, infecting cells had to first survive against a ntimicrobials and host immune defenses whilst residing in a planktonic state. This idea has been questioned by numerous groups reporting that synovial fluid induces the rapid formation of bacterial aggregates. We have previously shown that aggregate format ion confers protection from antibiotic challenges. In the following work, we assessed the influence of synovial fluid - aggregates on mechanisms of both local and recruited immune cell clearance. Methods Mature dermal fibroblasts were inoculated with pre -form ed S. aureus synovial fluid aggregates prior to quantification of IL -8 expression by qPCR. Host cell viability was determined by confocal microscopy. Similarly, to assess the effect of synovial fluid -induced aggregation on recruited immune cells, neutrophi ls isolated from healthy donors were challenged with the aggregates prior to the assessment of phagocytic activity by microscopy and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a luminol burst assay. Results When challenged with the aggregates, the f ibroblasts displayed an elevation in IL -8 expression compared to aggregates which were formed with fibrinogen alone, and the planktonic cells ( Fig. 1a ). The synovial fluid aggregates stimulated an initial rapid neutrophil response and were cleared more eff iciently over the course of the infection ( Fig. 1b ). Further, the presence of aggregates yielded an overall decrease in ROS production. Conclusion Through the following work, we have found that the presence of synovial fluid aggregates significantly alters the responses of both fibroblasts and neutrophils. Taken together, aggregate formation potentially aids in early bacterial survival within the postsurgical joint cavity. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-168-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: EVALUATION OF ANTI -BIOBILM EFFICACY OF explants with wound -specific mature biofilm Background: The need to develop new innovative antimicrobial materials is critical and would allow for the discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotic therapies to prevent biofilm formation o r infection in acute wounds and to eradicate mature biofilms in chronic wounds. Due to the differing characteristics of biofilms and the complexity of their structure, a multi -faceted approach to the development of BIAKS Antimicrobial Wound Gel (AWG) was undertaken to address multiple microorga nisms. AWG has been shown to be effective in both in-vitro and ex-vivo testing methods performed to quantitatively measure the antimicrobial activity mimicking acute wound formation. Methods: Due to differences in current models and study design, it is impo ssible to compare results across published anti -biofilm efficacy studies. The pig skin explant model was used to provide consistency in evaluation of commercially available wound gels against the more difficult to treat mature biofilms often found in chron ic wounds. Mature gram -negative and gram -positive bacteria as well as fungi, were grown on pig skin explants over the course of 3 days. The biofilms were then treated once with each of the commercial products and bioburden was enumerated at 24 -hour intervals up to 72 hours (about 3 days). Results: The most effective products against mature biofilms in this study were a polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) -based gel and the benzalkonium chloride (BAC) -based gel. However, the BAC -based product showed a substantial regrowth of P. aeruginosa by the 48 -hour time point, while the PHMB -based gel showed no regrowth. One of the PHMB -based products evaluated displayed high anti -biofilm efficacy against all mature biofilms of clinically relevant pathoge ns examined in the ex vivo porcine dermal explant model, while a second PHMB . Conclusions: Both PHMB and BAC are cationic polymers that disrupt cell membranes, however only BAC and one of the two PHMB -containing gels evaluated show ed anti -biofilm efficacy model. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: Body: Background: It is becoming increasingly apparent that bacterial populations adapt to a chronic infection environment and become genetically diverse. These adaptations and changes in intraspecies population structure regulate population physiology and alter the spatial organization and biogeography of infection. However, the impact of intraspecies heterogeneity and spatial organization on other microbial species remains unclear. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to become genetically and phenotypically diverse during chro nic infection of cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. In an in vitro CF sputum model (SCFM2) containing the polymers eDNA and mucin, the O -antigen of P. aeruginosa is a major factor determining the formation of two distinct aggregate assembly types due to alterat ions in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity. Methods : We constructed isogenic mutants in P. aeruginosa lacking O -antigen and further built synthetic heterogeneous populations with differential frequencies of wild -type and O -antigen mutants. We assessed t he impact of P. aeruginosa population heterogeneity on the fitness and biogeography of Staphylococcus aureus in SCFM2 using confocal microscopy and qPCR. Results: Here we show that an increase in the abundance of O -antigen mutants in a population of P. aeru ginosa alters the biogeography and increases the fitness of S. aureus in SCFM2. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that during chronic infection, the changes in population dynamics of P. aeruginosa influence the biogeography and fitness of other bacterial species in infection and likely can alter microbial pathogenesis. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-176-ASM -BIO Prevention and Elimination Publishing Title: K-AUREIN, A NOTABLE AUREIN 1.2 -DERIVED PEPTIDE PLANKTONIC GROWTH PRODUCTION Candida albicans K-AUREIN, AUREIN PEPTIDE AGAINST PLANKTONIC GROWTH Candida albicans considered one of the most important opportunistic fungi due to the large arsenal of virulence factors that help throughout the progress of the infection. In this sense, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) appear as an alternative , with great antifungal action. Among these, aurein 1.2 has been widely explored, becoming the basis for the discovery of new AMPs, such as K -aurein (K - au). Aim: Thus, the study evaluated the anti -C. albicans potential of K -au against virulence factors, pl anktonic growth, and biofilm formation of clinical isolates. Methodology: Firstly, K -au antifungal activity was determined by microdilution method and time kill curve. The inhibition of hydrolytic enzymes secretion (proteinase, phospholipase, and hemolysin ) and germ tube formation were tested. Then, the antibiofilm potential of K -au was verified through biomass quantification, cell viability, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All testes were compared with classical antifungal drug, amphotericin B (amB ). Results: The outcomes showed fungicidal action of K -au at 62.50 \u00b5g/mL for all isolates, with a time of action around 150 to 180 min, determined by time -kill curve. K -au-treated cells decreased around 40 % of the germinative tube compared to control. Additionally, K -au inhibited the biofilm formation more than 90 % compared to amB and control group. SEM images show apparent cellular disaggregation without formation of filamentous structures. Conclusion: Therefore, the data shows great fungicidal effects o f K-au against clinical isolates, inhibiting polymorphism profile and biofilm formation. Thus, this peptide could be explored as a useful compound against biofilm -related C. albicans 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: SILVER CARBOXYLATE SHOWS PENETRANCE OF Staphylococcus aureus MW2 AND VRS1 BIOFILMS AND HINDERS VIABILITY OF PERSISTER CELLS Abstract Body: Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a main contributor to surgical morbidity and mortality1. This problem is exacerbated by antibiotic -resistant bacteria and biofilms2. Previous studies showed that silver carboxylate (AgCar) released via a titanium dioxide -polydimethyl siloxane (TiO 2-PDMS) matrix is efficacious against antibiotic -resistant bacteria3. While much is known about the antimicrobial properties of silver, little is known about silver carboxylate's ability to combat biofi lms and persister cells4. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of silver carboxylate to penetrate and disperse biofilms and eradicate persister cells in clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus )5. Methods: Biofilms of S. aureus strains VRS1 and MW2, were grown overnight on filter disks in a 24 -well plate at 2x108 CFU/ml. Biofilms 100% AgCar served as a positive control. Matrix -only and non -treate d cells served as the negative controls. Biofilms were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and using A (exopolysaccharides), and SYPRO Biofilm images were obtained via an Olympus F V-1000 MPE Multiphoton Microscope and quantified using ImageJ. Persister cell killing assay: Cultures were grown overnight to log phase. 2\u00d7108 CFU/mL of S. aureus were subject to 20 -fold MIC of gentamicin to generate persister cells and same treatment cond itions as above. Aliquots were removed at specific times, serially diluted and spot -plated on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). Colonies were counted after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. Results : The 30x AgCar solution showed the greatest reduction in biofilm area as measured by reduced signal intensity for both VRS1 and MW2, whereas the non - treated and 1x silver carboxylate showed the greatest signal intensity, indicating high levels of biofilm formation. Additionally, the 10x silver carboxylate solution demonstrated a log6 reduction in concentration of persister cells over the 72 hours. Conclusions: The 30x AgCar demonstrated the highest reduction in biofilm signal intensity, indicating its potential for use as an effective antimicrobial agent. Additionally, the 10x AgCar solution has demonstrated the highest level of persister cell killing, suggesting that there is a potential for alternatives to antibiotics. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-179-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: ENHANCING THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT OF TITANIUM IMPLANTS BY LASER SURFACE MODIFICATIONS Abstract Body: Introduction: highly resistant to several antifungal treatments. Various studies have addressed this concern by developing methods to coat biomaterial surfaces, making them effective in preventing biofilm growth. Titanium and its alloys have recently becom e widely used in biomedical implants due to their biocompatibility and ability to inhibit biofilm growth. However, the effectiveness of their long -term antibiofilm properties is unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the long -term ability of coat ed titanium to decrease the growth of biofilm on implant surfaces. Methods: This study examines the growth of Candida albicans and Candida auris biofilms on a laser modified titanium surface coated with titanium disulfide (TiS 2). Smooth titanium samples ar e processed with a laser to make precise micro/nanostructures on the titanium surface. The samples are then placed in a tube furnace and sulfurized to produce a TiS 2 coating on the samples. Candida albicans and Candida auris are incubated with the TiS 2 coated samples in RPMI media for 6 and 24 hours. The XTT (2, -bis (2 -methoxy are used to evaluate the morphology and biofilm formation on the surface of each material. Results: Fluorescent staining revealed that the cell walls of Candida albicans and Candida auris were damaged after exposure to the surface of TiS 2 materials compared to the uncoated smooth and structured titanium. XTT assay showed eviden ce of biofilm inhibition at 6 hours and at 24 hours of incubation with TiS 2 material without any significant difference. Conclusion: This finding emphasizes that titanium coated with TiS 2 causes significant damage to the cell walls of Candida spp. and has the ability to inhibit biofilm production during long-term exposure. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-182-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination DISRUPTION OF STREPTOCOCCUS highly structured microbial communities embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix that universally contains extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins. While we have previously shown that eubacterial biofilms possess a common eDNA -dependent lattice of permuted Junction (HJ) -like vertices stabilized by the ubiquitous DNABII proteins, a similar structural analysis for fungi has not been conducted. Indeed, despite a similar reliance on eDNA for biofilm stability, fungi do not possess DN ABII proteins. Here we investigate the biofilm structure of the clinically relevant interkingdom biofilm (sHVP) that have shown disrupts the HJ structures of eubacterial biofilms as a probe, we determined the susceptibility of Ca, Sm and interkingdom Ca plus Sm biofilms as a first step to determine whether an eDNA - dependent biofilm structure is conserved across kingdoms. Methods: We used a synthetic saliva medium (BMMSS) that allowed for robust growth of Ca, Sm and the interkingdom Ca+Sm biofilms. To evaluate the ability of sHVP to disrupt single and interkingdom biofilms in vitro , we added sHVP to pre -formed biofilms at 24h and incubated for increasing time points. Biofilms were then stained with LIVE/DEAD\u00ae and analyzed via CSLM and COMSTAT2 software. Results: We demonstrated that mucin -containing BMMSS medium supported robust growth of Ca and Sm in an interkingdom biofilm and further, supported growth of these organisms in morphotypes that mimicked that observed within oral cavity biofilms. Further, we demonstrate d that treatment of single and interkingdom biofilms with sHVP resulted in disruption of Sm and interkingdom biofilms, but not single species Ca biofilms. Conclusion: Collectively these data indicated that the mucin based medium is well -suited to conduct ou r Ca and Sm interkingdom biofilm studies. Further, the demonstrated effectiveness of sHVP on interkingdom and at least one single species eubacterial biofilm indicated a common eDNA structure that was not shared in a single species Ca biofilm. This may ind icate that eubacterial structures dominate biofilms when interacting with Ca. ---PAGEBREAK --- Number: AFFECTS BIOFILM DISPERSAL IN CHRONIC WOUNDS Abstract Body: Background: Chronic wounds have become staggering burdens, with 6 to 7 million diabetics in the US alone expected to have foot ulcers. Biofilm infections are challenging to eradicate from chronic wounds, even with the current gold standard of care - repeated sharp debridement and persistent antibiotic treatment. Biofilms are a survival strategy for microbes, allowing cells to be surrounded by a protective and antibiotic -tolerant extracellular matrix (ECM) of both self -synthesized and host - derived proteins, extracellular DNA (eDNA), and carbohydrates. We investigated whether sharp debridement could be improved by adding ECM -carbohydrate - targeting glycoside hydrolase enzymes (G H) which could degrade the biofilm. We hypothesized that sharp debridement followed by GH enzymatic debridement would more effectively disperse bacteria from a biofilm infection than debridement alone. Methods: We evaluated the efficacy of combination treat ment in our chronic wound murine model by assessing systemic dispersal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which can lead to bacteremia and sepsis in the absence of antibiotic treatment. 1cm full-thickness surgical incisions on the backs of anesthetized mice w ere inoculated with 105 CFU/mL PA -lux and treated 48h -post-infection with one or a combination of the following: sharp debridement with a curette and forceps; enzymatic debridement with GH solutions; or PBS vehicle controls. Up to 24h following treatment, wound tissue and internal organs were collected for imaging and CFU and mice were evaluated for systemic dispersal. Results: Our results suggest that combination treatment of sharp debridement followed by multiple GH enzymatic debridements increases likelih ood of systemic bacterial dispersal compared to sharp debridement alone. This was evident by a greater number of mice experiencing bacteremia and displaying symptoms of sepsis in the combination group, indicating release of dispersed bacteria from their antibiotic -tolerant biofilm state. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insight into the behavior of bacteria dispersed from biofilm -infected chronic wounds. Although this demonstrates a potential clinical risk, systemic spread in our murine model is ind icative of bacteria leaving the protective biofilm and entering a potentially more susceptible dispersed state. Future studies will focus on infection clearance and wound healing with concurrent antibiotic treatment and combination debridement. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-189-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Innovative Approaches and New Technologies in Biofilm Research Publishing Title: Membrane heating enables high nitrogen removal performance of a hollowfiber coated Anammox AOA Biofilm operated at Cold and on Low strength Municipal Wastewater Abstract Body: Background: The combined aerobic and anaerobic ammonia -oxidizing (AOB - Anammox) partnership offers a significant reduction in aeration demand associated with nitrogen removal in wastewater treatments. However, current Anammox treatment systems are typically restricted to be applied to the warm and ammonium - rich side -stream installations, and their application to the mainstream are facing challenges of hampered growth of AOB -Anammox partnership at low ammonia concentration, low temperature, and high C/N. The relative rec ently discovered ammonia -oxidizing archaea (AOA) hold promise to enable nitrogen removal in the dilute mainline attributing to their high affinities for both ammonia and oxygen. Method: A one -stage and continuous -flow membrane reactor was designed and oper ated at a local wastewater treatment plant at Everett (WA, USA) for the nitrogen reduction from primary effluent. A synthetic Anammox -AOA biofilm was coated onto a hollow fiber membrane. Hydrogel beads with sludge from an anaerobic digester were placed in the membrane reactor to remove COD and control heterotrophic growth. The reactor performance was monitored by measuring nitrogen species and COD in the influent and effluent. Activity of functional biomass was investigated by motioning the dynamics of nitr ogen species in batch tests. Changes in functional microorganisms were studied by qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: At the stable stage, the reactor achieved up to 94% removal of total inorganic nitrogen from municipal wastewater at 25 oC and slightly dropped removal efficiency to 83% at 16 oC, both stages were operated at DO of &lt; 0.1 mgO 2/L. A direct heating method for biofilm (but not bulk liquid) was developed to stabilize performance at lower temperature. Microbial kinetics of the reactor showed constant reduction of ammonia with limited accumulation of nitrate/nitrite. Stable COD reduction and no membrane fouling was observed in the membrane reactor. qPCR and sequencing revealed high abundance of AOA and Anammox on the membrane and methanogens i n the reactor. Conclusions : A reactor based on Anammox -AOA biofilm grown on a hollow fiber membrane and methanogens in hydrogel beads was applied to mainstream treatment of municipal wastewater and demonstrated excellent performance at water temperatures o f 16 oC. The methanogen loaded hydrogel beads lessened the heterotrophic growth and therefore lowered membrane fouling issues. The reactor will be operated at a water temperature of 5 oC and direct heating for biofilm will be applied to performan ce. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-191-ASM -BIO Control, Prevention and Publishing Title: EFFECT OF aeruginosa BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background Wound healing is a highly regulated sequence of events i.e., hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling phases. However, infections due to growth of biofilms may result in delayed healing in turn leading to hospitalization, amputation or even death. Therefore, debriding the biofilms is the first line of defense in combatting wound infections. We investigated ultraso und as a mechanical debriding stimulus to clear the biofilm. Our previous studies showed that pure ultrasound was able to remove the biofilm cells from surface and affect the cyclic di -GMP signaling but did not cause any cell death. To achieve cell death, addition of antibiotics is an important factor. However, to avoid multiple dosages of antibiotics, controlled release over a period is an excellent option. Embedding the antibiotics in nano/microparticles allows us to achieve this. Here, the studies of synergistic effects of Tobramycin Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in in vitro wound models are shown. Materials PLGA -Tb were fabricated using doub le emulsion PLGA and dichloromethane (DCM)/5% PVA respectively. The particles were characterized using scanning electron microscope and UV -vis spectrophotometer. Antimicrobial susce ptibility tests agar. Biofilms were grown on 0.5% agar with ABTG or wound stimulating media and the effect of PLGA -Tb and ultrasound was characterized using CFU/ml and confocal imaging. PAO1 WT strain w as used in all the studies. Results The SEM showed formation of multicavity structure, an excellent cavitation agent due to its ability to trap gas bubbles and interact with ultrasound. Approximately 21% of the initially added Tb was encapsulated. The partic les showed a significant zone of inhibition (22mm) i.e., susceptibility to P.aeruginosa bacteria. PLGA -Tb in addition to ultrasound showed significant drop in CFU/ml compared to ultrasound or PLGA -Tb alone in gel - based P.aeruginosa biofilms. Conclusion The r esults show the optimization of PLGA microparticles loaded with tobramycin. The particles have multi -cavity structure with the ability to cavitate and exhibit antimicrobial properties. Ultrasound and PLGA -Tb together showed excellent biocidal -microbiome interactions using dual -species biofilms within in vivo chronic wound environment Abstract Body: Background: Skin and soft tissue infections encompass a spectrum of clinical presentations that are often polymicrobial. Chronic, non -healing wounds are infamous for their association not only with biofilm -associated microbes but a dysbiotic microbiome that may also c ontribute to disease chronicity. With lowering cost and improved sequencing efforts, the identification of microbial taxa and their rich diversity in human chronic wounds is well documented. Although there is strong evidence of delayed healing by dominant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus , less is known about the possible influence of less abundant organisms such as obligate anaerobes. In this study, we aim to explore the potential functional contribution of these low abundance, albeit common bacteria using a polymicrobial in vivo wound model. Methods: To study the contribution of microbiomes to the delay of wound closure, we used a murine full -thickness dermal excision model infected with a pre - established wound microcosm biofilm. Inoculated biofilms constituted microbe pairs to dissect the microbiome and investigate the influence of dual interactions on host prognosis. Clinical outcomes including wound area reduction and general survey assessments were monitored over the course of healing in addition to end - point microbial viability. Results: All inoculated bacteria persisted at high burden in our model. Interestingly, we observed differences in longitudinal wound healing of different microbe - microbe pairs. As expected, we measured significantly delaye d wound closure when wounds were infected with S. aureus and S. aureus paired with another dominant wound pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . However, we observed less severe delay in closure in wounds infected with S. aureus paired with a commensal species a nd obligate anaerobe. Conclusions: There is substantial evidence to support the pathogenic roles of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in chronic wound infections, but much less is known about the functional role of low abundance members of the wound microbiome. Here, we utilized an in vivo model to investigate the interactions between common wound microbes and demonstrated evidence that suggests a functional role for wound closure by commensal bacteria and obligate anaerobes within wound microbiomes. Future studi es will include further investigations into the microbe - microbe and host -microbe mechanisms that govern these outcomes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: -A-194-ASM -BIO Topic 1: THE ROLE OF HISTONE -INDUCED EXTRACELLULAR DNA AGGREGATES IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that is proficient at forming biofilms. The extracellular polymeric subst ance of the biofilm confers resistance to host defenses and antimicrobials allowing S. aureus biofilms to persist and cause chronic infections. S. aureus biofilms also release pore forming toxins to combat recruited neutrophils to the infection site by ind ucing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release. NETs are mainly composed of host DNA decorated with several antimicrobials, including histones. While NETs function as traps for microbes, they are further degraded by nuclease produced by S. aureus . It is unclear how S. aureus persists in a chronic infection, despite the presence of several NET - associated antimicrobials after NET degradation. Methods S. aureus biofilms were treated with purified histones, a major component of NETs. Extracellular DNA (eDN A) and S. aureus were labelled with nucleic acid and lipophilic stains respectively, and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to observe changes in biofilm architecture. Biofilm biomass and eDNA were quantified using COMSTAT2 and Voxel C ounter plugin in ImageJ. The killing activities of histones in combination with other antimicrobials against S. aureus were quantified using standard culture techniques. Results Treatment of S. aureus biofilms with histones changed the biofilm architecture as large aggregates were observed in an otherwise homogenous biofilm, without affecting the viability of S. aureus . These aggregates were primarily composed of eDNA encasing S. aureus cells. The total eDNA in S. aureus biofilm also increased upon treatmen t with histones . Preliminary data suggest that the eDNA aggregates provide additional protection to S. aureus biofilms against other antimicrobials, including daptomycin and vancomycin. Conclusions Overall, our study shows histone -mediated architectural ch anges in S. aureus biofilms. This may provide protection to S. aureus within the biofilm due to eDNA aggregation. We predict that histones mediate aggregation due to their interactions with the eDNA of the biofilm and provides additional protection against antimicrobials. These phenomena shed light on additional therapeutic approaches, such as disrupting eDNA aggregates or targeting S. aureus factors required for forming histone -mediated eDNA aggregates. ---PAGEBREAK Monospecies And Polymicrobial Biofilms By Bovine Respiratory Disease Pathogens And Identification Of Novel Agents That Reduce predominant bacterial agents responsible for bovine respiratory disease (BRD), which is the most economically important disease to the North American bovine indu stry. Each of these bacterial agents is capable of forming a biofilm in vitro and two have been documented to form biofilms in vivo. We have further characterized biofilms formed by M. haemolytica and M. bovis , investigated their polymicrobial interactions , and identified novel agents that remove the biofilm matrix. Methods: Bacterial biofilms were grown in optimized medium individually and together in 96 -well plates or in culture medium on slides. Biofilms were examined by staining with 0.1% crystal violet or were fluorescently -labelled and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with COMSTAT analysis. Biofilm components of M. haemolytica analyzed gas chromatography -mass spec trometry. Compounds from the Virginia Tech Center for Drug Discovery were screened for their capability to reduce or eliminate an established biofilm in comparison to 3% bleach. Results: Strains of M. haemolytica and M. bovis tested formed a loosely adhere nt biofilm. However, a wecB noncapsulated mutant of M. haemolytica formed a biofilm that was significantly thicker, of greater biomass, and less rough than the wildtype strain biofilm. A distinct extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) could not be identified i n the M. haemolytica biofilm, but extracellular DNA was critical for biofilm formation. A polymicrobial biofilm was readily formed between M. H. somni , and P. multocida . Of >2000 compounds tested to remove an established H. somni biofilm (the most prominent biofilm former tested), 34 compounds reduced the biofilm matrix by >50%, and 3 reduced the biofilm matrix by >95%. Conclusions: All of the bacterial agents responsible for BRD were capable of forming a biofilm, though not all formed a tight, adherent biofilm with a distinct EPS. Formation of a polymicrobial biofilm may be advantageous, particularly to encapsulated strains that form a less prominent and adherent biofilm. Identification of biologically compatible compounds that can remove an es tablished biofilm may enhance the activity of antimicrobial agents and host recovery. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-200-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Xylitol activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes biofilms infectious skin lesions Abstract Body: Background . Xylitol (Xy) is a polyalcohol that is used in the food industry to replace sucrose. It has proven antimicrobial activity on various microorganisms of clinical interest. Our aim was to study the activity of Xy on the formation of biofilms (BFs) in infecti ous skin diseases: atopic dermatitis (AD) and severe acne (SA). Methods . For the study of AD lesions, 34 patients aged 3 to 17 years were included. Samples of active lesions were obtained with a swab moistened with sterile physiological solution. Likewise, 10 patients with SA lesions were included. The samples were taken after antisepsis of the lesion area with special strips to extract the hair follicle where the bacteria are housed. The DA and SA samples were preserved for the isolation of bacteria presen t in them and the study of the effect of Xy on the formation of their BFs. The adhesion and dispersion of the BFs in the presence of Xy 7% were analyzed by previous microscopic evaluation of crystal violet staining, assigning a score to each sample. This s core was based on the type of development of BF with a scale: 0 indicator of absence, 5 the maximum value obtained, depending on the degrees of development and number of bacteria in them. We carry out complementary studies with confocal microscopy. Results . BF- forming S. aureus was isolated from the AD lesions analyzed, 26 cases were evaluated for adherence and 27 for dispersion. For adherence, the mean score was significantly higher after the intervention with Xy (3.67 65.4% of the samples showed a significant reduction in the score after the intervention, while the remaining 34.6% remained the same or had a worse score compared to baseline. Dispersion of the BF was verified in 70.4% of the sample s with the addition of Xy (of at least 1 point). In SA, the predominant BF -forming bacterium was Cutibacterium acnes (CA), verifying the reducing activity of Xy in adherence and the facilitation of BF dispersion with respect to the corresponding controls. Conclusions . Xy has reliable antimicrobial activity against SA BFs in AD and in SA cases, against CA. These results support its application for the treatment of these infectious pathologies, contributing to the reduction of the use of antibiotics and corti costeroids. ---PAGEBREAK --- Biofilms Publishing Title: STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS COLLAGEN BINDING ADHESIN ACTS AS AN IMMUNE EVASION FACTOR IN SKIN WOUNDS Abstract Body: Background. Up to 80% of skin and soft tissue infections are associated with Staphylococcus aureus , and it is one of the most common biofilm -forming pathogens isolated from chronic wounds. Bacterial adhesion to biotic surfaces is a prerequisite in the establishment of biofilms in wound infections. Host extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibrin ogen, collagen and laminin are abundant in both tissue and bloodstream environments, with collagen being particularly predominant in skin and soft tissue. ECM proteins often act as a scaffold for the formation of biofilms by bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus. Methods and Results. Here we use a murine model of skin abscess infection and find that in comparison to wild type (WT) methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) , a mutant unable to express the surface associated collage n binding adhesin Cna (cna) showed worse outcomes as early as 12 hours post infection, measured as an increase in lesion sizes, significantly higher bacterial loads and increased inflammation of the surrounding tissue, as observed with histology. Additionally, MRSA cna infected tissue samples had significantly higher levels of 3 common markers of inflammation namely IL -6, CXCL -1 and MPO, in comparison to WT MRSA infected lesions. We hypothesize that the innate immune response generated against WT MRSA is altered during an infection wit h cna bacteria. An in vitro assay measuring bacterial uptake by primary human neutrophils indicates that MRSA cna are taken up in significantly larger numbers (~60%) compared to WT (~10%), when bacteria are incubated with neutrophils for 30 minutes. Additionally, previous reports indicate that Cna can bind collagen rich domains of serum -C1q, thereby inactivating the c omplement cascade. Conclusions. Since we observed an increase in the uptake of cna bacteria, we are also using ELISA and flow cytometry -based assays to test for the role of complement in the innate response to Cna adhesin. Combined with its proficiency at forming biofilms, the ability to bind collagen makes MRSA particularly efficient at establishing recalcitrant chronic wound biofilms. Understanding the innate immune response to these interactions will therefore provide valuable insight into the dynamics of both planktonic and biofilm Biofilms Publishing Title: Ferumoxytol -mediated nanocatalysis for clinical biofilm infections Abstract Body: Background : Ferumoxytol (Fer) is an FDA -approved iron oxide nanoparticle formulation (IONP) for treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Interestingly, I ONPs also exhibit strong catalytic (peroxidase -like) activity that can effectively disrupt and kill biofilms. Biofilms are associated with many human infections, including those in the oral cavity. Among them, endodontic (root canal) infection remains a major cause of persistent apical periodontitis and tooth loss. Standard disinfection procedures are based on caustic solutions (sodium hypochlorite) as current antimicrobials are ineffective against biofilms within the root canal. Here, we show that Fer is a potent antibiofilm agent against endodontic biofilms via nanocatalytic mechanism and an effective clinical disinfection agent in patients with chronic dental infections. Methods: The catalytic and biofilm retention capabilities of Fer were characterized via colorimetric methods and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial effect of Fer against planktonic bacteria, single and mixed species biofilm (formed on in vitro apatitic surfaces and ex vivo extracted teeth) was assessed in a dose and time - dependent manne r. The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity were determined via microbiological and fluorescence -based methods. Cytotoxicity against mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated using LIVE/DEAD and apoptosis assays. Clinical evaluation of Fer to treat endodontic infections was conducted in patients with chronic endodontic infection (Human Subject IRB number 828211), and the clinical efficacy was assessed via culturing of viable cells. Results: Fer displays catalytic (peroxidase -like) activity in a dose -dependent manner at acidic pH to activate H 2O2 to release free radicals that effectively kill endodontic biofilms. Further analyses reveal that Fer binds to biofilm and maintains its catalytic activity in situ. Notably, Fer topical treatment shows enhanced antimicro bial activity compared to a standard of care solution NaOCl against ex vivo mixed species biofilm without cytotoxic effects on apical stem cells. Furthermore, Fer was effective against endodontic infections in patients diagnosed with pulp necrosis and apic al periodontitis with no reported adverse effects. Conclusions: Fer is a potent, biocompatible, and clinically effective antibiofilm agent demonstrating promising therapeutic potential for endodontic infections. Our data show a translatable nanocatalytic p latform that could have immediate clinical applications to combat harmful biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-213-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Effectiveness of a UVC system against Bacillus subtilis spores on ultrasonic probes Abstract Body: Introduction: Bacillus subtilis can form biofilms and within these biofilms spores can develop. The combination of spores and biofilm may make eradication of this bacterium very difficult. Ultraviolet light can be used to disinfect surfaces contaminated by a variety of microbes including Bacillus subtilis . As a preliminary examination of the ability of UVC to kill B. subtilis biofilms containing spores, this study evaluated whether the UVC system could decontaminate surfaces of ultrasonic probes contaminated with Bacillus spores. Methods: Spores of B. subtilis ATCC 19659 were grown by incubating on nutrient agar containing MnSo4 (500 ppm) for 14 days. Aliquots (100 L) of B. subtilis ATCC 19659 spores (1 -5 x 106/ml) were dried onto the surfac e of three probes for 30 -45 minutes then treated in a Lumicare Disinfection (606A743U7Y) device\u00ae that produces UVC at 264nm for 90 seconds. Each probe was exposed to the bacterial spores and treated, or left untreated, five times sequentially with the prob es being treated with 70% ethanol and dried between runs. Following treatment, the spores were recovered in PBS within a sterile container and mixed by vortex for 2 minutes. The spores were germinated on nutrient agar. One side of the probe was used for th e control (without UVC treatment) and the other side for the test (with UVC treatment). Results: The UVC system was highly effective against spores of Bacillus subtilis on all the three ultrasonic probes. Control, untreated ultrasonic probes were contamina ted by 5.05 log 10 \u00b1 0.22 spores. After treatment with 90 seconds in each run for five repeated exposures, UVC exposure for 90 seconds produced >4.5 log 10 (p< 0.001) reduction in viability of the spores on all three ultrasonic probes compared to untreated control. Conclusion: UVC delivered using a Lumicare ONE High Level Disinfection system was able to inactivate bacterial endospores of B. subtilis ATCC 19659, suggesting that UVC may be an effective way of killing B. subtilis cells in biofilms and can be use d to disinfect ultrasonic probes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-217-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Investigation of antifungal and antibiofilm activities of albicans using green synthesized nanoparticles Abstract Body: Antifungal iclesBackground: Candida albicans is a major cause of morbidity and mortality inbloodstream infections. The limited number and moderate or low efficacy of antifungaldrugs, as well as the severe side effects associated with their administration and theemerg ence of resistant strains, Candida forced us to develop highly effective antifungaldrugs with broad -spectrum activity. Candida biofilms are more resistant to azoles thanplanktonic cells up to 1000 times. Nanomedicines are getting attention to formulateanti biofilm agents.

The bio film resultslike cell surface hydrophobicity, yeast to hyphal transition inhibition, eradicatingestablished biofilms and inhibiting biofilm formation revealed that AgNPs coatingon medical devices considered a promising therapeutic tool against clini cal life - threatening candidiasis. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-223-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Clinical outcomes in association with genomic profiles of biofilm - forming staphylococci from periprosthetic joint infections Abstract Body: Background: Genotyping has recently become a tool to characterize staphylococci for their pathogenicity associated with orthopedic device -related infection. Yet only few studies have directly correlated genomic profiles to patient outcomes, biofilm - forming ability, an d antimicrobial resistance in periprosthetic joint infections (PJI). The current study was aimed to describe the genomic carriage of virulence in clinical strains and compare it with the clinical outcome of the patients. Methods: The associations between g enomic variations, patient outcomes and virulence -associated phenotypes were conducted from 111 staphylococcal strains isolated from intraoperative tissues from patients with PJI. Results: Treatment failure of PJI of the hip and knee was associated with a strong -biofilm phenotype in Staphylococcus aureus and an antibiotic -resistant phenotype in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Unresolved infections by S. epidermidis were associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) and resistance to rifampicin. Within this strain collection, sequence type (ST) 45 was the most frequent in the S. aureus while ST2 was the most frequent in S. epidermidis . The S. epidermidis ST2 caused the majority of the relapses found and was correlated with MDR and type characterizations, S. aureus agr II was correlated with resolved infection. S. epidermidis agr I and agr III were associated with strong and non/weak biofilm production. Conclusions: The results highlight that a thorough genomic and phenotypic characterization may help anticipate the probability of strains to cause treatment failure in PJI. The results also suggest that PJI treatment with rifampicin and fluoroquinolone shoul d not be administered without previous knowledge of the resistance profile. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 OF BIOFILM FORMATION DRIVES TOLERANCE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN AIRWAY MUCUS Abstract Body: Background : Muco -obstructive airway diseases (MADs) are a collection of diseases characterized by accumulation of dehydrated airway mucus. People with MADs experience recurrent and chronic infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), a dominant pathogen in adults with MADs. Mucus concentration and antibiotic treatment failure increase with disease severity and clinical exacerbation . Dehydrated mucus, where Pa primarily resides, provides a nutrient -rich scaffold for Pa aggregate formation. Despite biofilm formation being classically associated with antibiotic treatment failure, chronically adapted isolates often exhibit decreased biofilm forming capabilities. Methods : Using an in vitro synthetic sputum medium (SSM) that recapitulates the MADs mucus environment, we investigated the impact of increased airway mucus on aggregate formation and tobramycin antibiotic tolerance. Additionally , we characterized the properties of Pa aggregates and their contribution to antibiotic tolerance. Results : Aggregation and antibiotic tolerance are strongly correlated, and both increase in a mucus concentration -dependent manner. Mutants in genes associat ed with biofilm formation maintained their ability to form aggregates and remained antibiotic tolerant. Conversely, hyper biofilm forming mutants displayed diminished potential to form aggregates as well as decreased antibiotic tolerance. Conclusions : Whil e aggregates represent a complex community structure similar to surface -attached biofilms, their formation and essential composition differ from traditionally defined biofilms. Exopolysaccharide is not essential to the formation of aggregates and is antago nistic to their formation when overexpressed. In our system, tolerance was more strongly correlated with aggregate size than biofilm formation. Additionally, we observed no contribution of surface -attached biofilms to the antibiotic tolerance in our system suggesting that free-floating aggregates within the mucus may be the primary driver of antibiotic tolerance in MADs. These findings challenge how we define bacterial community structures and the contribution of traditionally defined biofilms in the MADs l ung environment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-227-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Specific signal disruption induces distinct changes in microbial biofilm population structure Abstract Body: Background : Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell -density -dependent, bacterial intercellular communication system that involves the production, detection, and response of small signaling molecules called autoinducers. A major class of autoinducers is N-acyl homoserine lacto nes (AHLs). AHLs vary in their chemical structures, particularly with different acyl chain lengths, and these different structures modulate the specificity of the signal. Several bacterial behaviors are controlled by QS, including biofilm formation. Recent ly, disrupting bacterial signaling using enzymes has been shown to effectively inhibit biofilm development and alter microbial community composition and diversity in various environments. However, little has been known about the importance of each signalin g molecule in the context of complex microbial communities. Methods : Here, we monitored the growth of the microbial community and its biofilm in a bioreactor system that contained silica beads encapsulating two enzymes called lactonases. These two lactonas es exhibit distinct substrate preferences, thus allowing us to study the effects of differential signal disruption on the microbiome. Results : Both enzymes reduced the biofilm formation significantly in the recirculating bioreactor system. In addition, our analysis showed that the two lactonases altered the community population structure differentially in the biofilm and suspension communities in terms of composition, diversity, and abundance of the bacteria. Conclusions : This study provides a new and effec tive \"microbiome -edit toolbox\" to investigate the importance of signaling molecules in QS and their roles within the community. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-232-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: IMPROVING THERMAL STABILITY AND ALTERING SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY OF QUORUM QUENCHING ACYLASES Abstract Body: Background Many gram -negative bacteria use L -homoserine lactones (AHLs) in sensing (QS). QS numerous behaviors, including biofilm formation and virulence. Enzymatic quorum quenching (QQ) uses enzymes that degrade the AHL to prevent its accumulation and the subsequent phenotypic shift in bacteria. Acyla ses degrade AHL by hydrolyzing its amide bond. Because different bacteria use varying types of AHLs with different acyl chain lengths, the substrate specificity of these enzymes is important to expand the utility of QQ and target specific signals. Highly s pecific enzymes can be used as molecular tools to probe microbial dynamics in communities or applied in situ to control bacterial behaviors. Methods Acylases PvdQ and MacQ were selected to test QQ effectiveness on P. aeruginosa cultures. The substrate spec ificities of the two tested acylases were determined by modifying a previously established o -phthalaldehyde kinetic assay that reports on the production of homoserine lactone. The mutants of acylases were generated using the Protein Repair One Stop Shop (P ROSS) algorithm, expressed and purified, and their thermal stability and kinetic properties were determined. The QQ activity of the mutants was evaluated and compared to the wild -type enzymes. Specifically, their ability to modulate bacterial growth, biofi lm production, and proteolytic activity were established and compared to other QQ enzymes that degrade AHLs, namely lactonases. Results Our results show that the acylases MacQ and PvdQ are as effective as lactonases at reducing biofilm and virulence factor production in P. aeruginosa . The obtained mutants of MacQ had an altered substrate specificity profile with a 10 -fold increase in specificity for C6 - AHL compared to the wild -type. The generated PvdQ mutants maintained similar catalytic efficiencies agains t AHLs as compared to the WT but had a melting point value (T M) increase of >10 \u00b0C. Conclusions PROSS -generated mutants exhibit higher structural stability and broader substrate specificity than wild -type enzymes. Specifically, the generated mutants of Pvd Q are more resistant to thermal denaturation and may be more resilient when used in natural or industrial environments to combat bacterial biofilm formation. MacQ mutants exhibit a broader substrate specificity range and may more effectively quench a range of cues in microbial communities. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-233-ASM -BIO Topic and Elimination Biofilms Publishing Title: IN-VITRO ANTIBIOFILM ACTIVITY OF ALPHA COLI BIOFILM Although the number of drug -resistant pathogens in both communities and healthcare facilities has been increasing, the number of antibiotics that can combat these infections caused by these pathogens is becoming more limited. The overuse of traditional ant ibiotics and the paucity of antibiofilm drugs are major contributing factors to this crisis since many healthcare -associated infections (HAI) are biofilm -based. Lipoic acid, a commonly used antioxidant supplement and a coenzyme in the conversion of pyruvat e to acetyl co -A, and its amide derivative, lipoamide, were evaluated for their activities for prevention of biofilm formation and biofilm removal against a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli that had caused infections in our healthcare facility. Methods : Wells of 96 -well plates were incubated with either trypticase soy broth (TSB) as control (10 wells), or TSB inoculated with E. coli. Ten wells in each row that had been inoculated with E. coli were then spiked with alpha lipoic acid or lipoamide to asses s the ability of these compounds to prevent biofilm formation. The plate was then incubated at 37\u00baC for 24 hours and evaluated spectrophotometrically for the amount of biofilm formed using a microplate reader. To assess the ability of alpha lipoic acid and lipoamide to eradicate biofilm, we also incubated at 37\u00baC for 24 hours 96 -well plates that were incubated with either TSB as control (10 wells) or TSB inoculated with E. coli. After the 24 hours of incubation period and biofilm formation in wells with E. coli, we spiked ten wells in each row with alpha lipoic acid or lipoamide. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00baC for 24 hours, broth from wells was removed, and the plates were evaluated spectrophotometrically for the amount of biofilm remained. Result s: We observed 30% and 29% reduction (both P < 0.001; 2 -tail t- test) in E. coli biofilm formation with alpha lipoic acid and lipoamide, respectively, compared to the control group. We also detected 53% and 52% reduction (both P < 0.001) in the amount of bi ofilm after the exposure of the preformed biofilms to alpha lipoic acid and lipoamide, respectively, compared to the control group. Conclusion: Alpha lipoic acid and its amide derivative, lipoamide, exhibited significant antibiofilm activities both in prev enting colonization and biofilm formation and also against preformed biofilms of E. coli . These compounds may be promising antibiofilm agents that could potentially be used against HAI. Further exploration of these compounds is well -warranted. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-249-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Sodium salicylate as a quorum sensing inhibitor in Staphylococcus aureus - modulating virulence, biofilm and antimicrobial susceptibility Abstract Body: SODIUM SALICYLATE AS A QUORUM SENSING INHIBITOR IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS - MODULATING VIRULENCE, BIOFILM AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY Background: The increasing threat of an tibiotic resistance requires novel antimicrobial therapeutic approaches. One of the most clinically threatening pathogens associated with AMR is the Gram -positive species Staphylococcus aureus. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition, by blocking communication betw een bacteria, limits bacterial virulence with the potential to prevent infection. This study aimed to determine if sodium salicylate (NaSa) could function as a QS -inhibitor (QSI) of S. aureus agr QS and study how this inhibition would affect production of selected virulence factors, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial susceptibility, in clinically relevant in vitro conditions using clinical isolates from periprosthetic -joint infections (PJI) and wound infections. Methods: S. aureus reporter strains, lab strains and clinical isolates from PJI and wound infections representing the four agr types were evaluated for their agr expression, virulence factor production, biofilm formation on model surfaces, in the presence and absence of NaSa and serum. Analyses incl uded assays, viable colony counting and fluorescence plate reading. Results: Using reporter strains, NaSa (10 mM) significantly reduced the expression of agr and delta -hemolysin ( hld) in S. aureus ATCC 25923 and 8325 as well as decreased secretion and delta -hemolysin 25923.NaSa modulated biofilm formation depending on the agr type strain and surface. In ATCC 25923, NaSa maintain ed or decreased biofilm formation on collagen -coated polystyrene, while increased biofilm biomass on titanium and polystyrene by decreasing biofilm dispersal. Regarding the effect of NaSa on the clinical isolates, the PJI strains did not increase biofilm b iomass on titanium, whereas half of the wound strains increased biofilm biomass on collagen -coated surfaces. Biofilms formed in presence of 10 mM NaSa increased S. aureus biofilm susceptibility to silver and rifampicin. Conclusions: These results demonstrat e the in vitro QS-inhibitory and anti-virulence effects of NaSa against S. aureus . Further studies should confirm whether interfering with bacterial communication is a potential alternative or adjuvant to antimicrobial agents for the infection control of S. aureus biofilm - related infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-256-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: EFFECT OF THE ESSENTIAL OIL FROM LIPPIA ORIGANOIDES CHEMOTYPE THYMOL CARVACROL OF BIOFILM -FORMING MICROORGANISMS FROM EGG -LAYING HEN FARMS Abstract Body: Background: Biofilms are clusters of bacteria attached to a surface and embedded in a self -produced matrix. These are generally formed in response to environmental stress conditions (e.g., conventional antimicrobial agents). In the poultry industry, biofilms are a con stant source of product contamination, leading to serious hygiene problems and significant economic losses. Microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp are found in poultry farming and represent a threat to the food industry, due to their vi rulence factors, capacity for biofilm formation and generation of microbial resistance to conventional disinfectants and antimicrobial agents. For this reason, it is needed to implement effective strategies to the control of microbial biofilm formation in food processing environments. In this work, we evaluated the effect of the essential oil (EO) from Lippia origanoides isolated from egg -laying hen farms in Santander, Colom bia. Methods: Microbial consortium isolated from egg -laying hen farms were used in the present study. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of EO from LTCII was determined using the broth microdilution method in TSB medium (tryptic soy broth). Biofilm fo rmation was tested using polypropylene coupons in 9 mL of TSB medium and additing 1 mL of starting inoculum from the consortium (106 ufc/mL). Each tube was incubated at 27\u00b0C for 24 h with continuous stirring (70 rpm). For the inhibitory activity of biofil m formation, we used sub -inhibitory concentrations of EO, and biofilm formation was assessed by using of the crystal violet assay, enumeration of sessile cells and SEM microscopy. Results and Conclusions: Our results proved that EO from LTC II exhibits ant imicrobial activity against biofilm formation with MIC values of 0.3 mg/mL. In addition, inhibition of biofilm formation was greater than 50% at subinhibitory concentrations (MIC 50). These results could be confirmed with both analyses of viable cell number s and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, where we observed significant reduction (p < 0.05) in viable cell numbers (with more than 3 log reduction). According to these results, we can conclude that EO from LTC II is a promising natural antimicrobia l product to control biofilm - forming microorganisms in food processing environments. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-259-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: ANTI -BIOFILM ACTIVITY OF ESSENTIAL OILS AND PLANT EXTRACTS AGAINST Candida albicans , C. auris AND C. Most Candida species are opportunistic pathogens that represent a major threat to immunosuppressed and susceptible patients. One of its most important virulence attributes is its ability to adhere to mucosal, and synthetic surfaces, forming structures known as biofilms. Biofilms are resistant to conventional antifungal therapeutics, the host immune system, and other environmental factors. In this sense, there has been an increasing interest in the study of plants and its secondary metabolites to identify promising biological properties. Essential oils (EO) and plant extracts (PE) represent great economic and pharmaceut ical interest as a source of new bioactive compounds. In this work we evaluated the antifungal potential of 25 EO and 25 PE from Colombian against 25 EOs and 25 PE were obtained, chemical characterized, and tested for minimum inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations (MIC/MFC) against C. albicans , broth microdilution in RPMI 1640 (37\u00b0C; 48 h). Then we evaluated its effe ct on biofilm formation (MIC -B), cell viability, protease expression, and germ -tube formation of each strain by specific methods. Biofilm formation was determined by Crystal violet assay after 48 h using 96 -well round bottom microplates incubated for 48 h at 35\u00b0C. Results and Conclusions: Results showed that seven EOs and 1 PE were active against the three Candida strains. EOs from Minthostachys mollis and Lippia origanoides had the higher antifungal activity with a MIC of 380 - 280 \u00b5g/mL and antibiofilm ef parapsilosis and auris , indicating a potential use in other Candida species. Additionally, Lippia alba (chemotype carvone) had an increased antifungal activity against C. auris with a MFC of 200 \u00b5g/mL, MI C of 90 \u00b5g/mL and a MIC -B of 50 \u00b5g/mL. In conclusion, EO from M. mollis and Lippia sp could represent a promising alternative for the development of new antifungal products focused on yeast infections, especially those related to biofilm formation, virulen ce factors, and antimicrobial resistance. While L. alba represents a possible source of bioactive molecules to control strains of C. auris . ---PAGEBREAK RECURRENT C. DIFFICILE INFECTION Abstract Body: Background: The prevalence of primary and multiply recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has increased significantly since 2000, but factors contributing to this remain unclear. Biofilm formation decreases C. difficile antibiotic susceptibility and can co ntribute to increased fitness in the gut. The aim of this study was to determine if C. difficile biofilm formation is an independent risk factor for CDI. Methods: We identified 52 patients with primary episode of CDI and a matched group of 84 patients with out CDI for whom archived colonic biopsies (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) collected within the past year (range 7 -363; median 134 days) were available. We assessed the presence or absence of C. difficile biofilm in these biopsies by looking for overla p of universal bacterial 16S rRNA and C. difficile -specific 16S rRNA II (PSII; immunohistochemistry). To identify CDI we used univariate and mul tivariate generalized logistic regression analysis (GLM; R stats V 3.6.2 package). Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease among the CDI and non -CDI groups. 14/52 CDI patients had recurre nce after the initial episode. C. difficile biofilm was identified in 32/52 colonic biopsies collected from patients prior to the primary episode of CDI and 0/84 biopsies from patients without CDI. There was a significant association between C. difficile biofilm formation and both primary and recurrent CDI based on univariate GLM; known risk factors including recent hospitalization, antibiotic, and corticosteroid use were only associated with CDI (Table 1). C. difficile biofilm was also significantly associated with CDI in a multivariate GLM incorporating the above factors (OR=2.86, P=0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest asymptomatic individuals can harbor C. difficile in the colonic mucosa and such colonization may i ncrease risk of future CDI. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of C. difficile biofilm formation in primary and recurrent CDI. Table 1.

It is well established that the biofilm phenotype tolerates far greater antibiotic concentrations versus planktonic counterparts. Despite biofilms being the predominant phenotype in infection caused by traumatic events, most animal models of infection utilize planktonic bacteria as the initial inoculum. We developed a sheep model of open fracture infection using biofilms as initial inocula that more closely models traumatic open fracture. We used this model to test the efficacy of the 'Purgo Pouch' - a device comprising a refillable reservoir with a percutaneous access port designed to deliver and sustain high doses of local antibiotic therapy - versus clinical standards of care. METHODS: Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms were grown on simulated titanium fracture fixation plates (20 mm x 20 mm) in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Two biofilm -containing plates containing 2.11 \u00b1 1.52 x 109 CFU MRSA were surgically placed in sheep on the proximal medial aspect of the right tibia. Each titanium plate contained 2.11 \u00b1 1.52 x 109 CFU MRSA. There were five study groups (n=5/group) comprising a positive control of infection with no treatment, two clinical standards of care (intravenous (IV) vancomycin and gentamicin -loaded Stimulan\u00ae beads), and two study groups using the Purgo Pouch with different antibiotic selection. All sheep had a 21 -day endpoint. The fixation plate, cortical bone screws, tissu e, bone marrow, and bone were collected after necropsy for bioburden analysis. RESULTS: Biofilms were reduced by 0.46 \u00b1 1.61 log 10 units in the positive control sheep, 1.18 \u00b1 1.34 log 10 units by the gentamicin -loaded Stimulan\u00ae beads, 2.48 \u00b1 1.22 log 10 units by IV vancomycin, 4.48 \u00b1 0.29 log 10 units by 10 -day Purgo Pouch containing a triple antibiotic combination, and 3.69 \u00b1 0.32 log 10 units by 10 -day Purgo Pouch containing gentamicin alone. CONCLUSIONS: In both groups, the Purgo Pouch reduced biofilm to a g reater degree than the clinical standards. Overall, data indicate that the Purgo Pouch may maintain high levels of antibiotics in the infection space and manage infection more effectively than current clinical standards, which cannot sustain high levels of antibiotic delivery. The Purgo Pouch addresses a significant gap in healthcare and may provide a solution to the long-standing problem of biofilm implant -related infections that complicate traumatic injuries and other surgical sites. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-276-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Targeting Polymicrobial Infection with Local Release Technology Abstract Body: INTRODUCTION: Infection studies have used historically used animal models inoculated with planktonic bacteria, but it is well established that bacteria in the biofilm phenotype complicate orthopedic -related infections. Williams et al. developed an ovine model for open f racture using biofilms as initial inocula that more accurately mimics clinical scenarios. We used the sheep model to test three commonly used clinical antibiotic treatments compared to a developmental 'Purgo Pouch' technology \u2014a drug delivery device compris ed of a drug reservoir and a percutaneous refilling port designed to sustain local, high doses of antibiotic. METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa polymicrobial biofilms were grown on 17 mm x 17 mm titanium simulated fracture fixation plates. Two titanium plates containing 1.71 \u00b1 6.72 x 108 CFU of P. aeruginosa and 5.34 \u00b1 7.05 x 109 of S. aureus were surgically placed on the proximal medial aspect of the right tibia. The first four study groups included 10 days of systemic antibiotics w ith either no additional treatment, antibiotic powders added to the surgical site, antibiotic -loaded Stimulan\u00ae beads, or the Purgo Pouch loaded daily for 10 days. The final group received 20 days of systemic antibiotics plus the Purgo Pouch loaded daily fo r 20 days. All sheep were sacrificed at 21 days. Surgical samples collected for bioburden analysis include the fixation plate, cortical bone screws, tissue, bone marrow, bone, and the screw tracks surrounding the bone screws. RESULTS SECTION : S. aureus biofilms were reduced by 3.97 \u00b1 0.72 log 10 units and P. aeruginosa biofilms by 0.20 \u00b1 0.88 log 10 units for the oral antibiotics alone, 4.74 \u00b1 1.30 log 10 units and 1.42 \u00b1 0.53 log 10 units for the oral antibiotics and local powders, 4.35 \u00b1 1.14 log 10 units and 1.67 \u00b1 0.76 log 10 units for oral antibiotics and STIMULAN\u00ae beads, 4.80 \u00b1 0.82 log 10 units and 2.09 \u00b1 0.11 log 10 units for 10 -day oral antibiotics and 10 -day pouch, and 10.42 log 10 units and 3.12 log 10 units for 20 -day oral antibiotics and 20 -day pouch. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data with the Purgo Pouch indicates that at 10 days, it may perform slightly better against P. aeruginosa biofilms than current clinical therapies, with far greater bioburden reduc tions of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms with the 20 -day pouch. While the current clinical therapies target the infection space directly, they cannot sustain high levels of antibiotics for a prolonged period. The Purgo Pouch addresses this gap an d may provide a better alternative for managing biofilm implant -related infections. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-282-ASM -BIO Topic Control, Prevention and Elimination Title: Anti-Biofilm Activity Muhammad Yasir,b Mark Willcox,b Naresh Kumar*a a School of Chemistry, The University of New South Wales, NSW 2052 Sydney, Australia. b School of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of New South Wales, NSW 2052 Sydney, Australia. *Correspondence: r.kuppusamy@unsw.edu.au, n.kumar@unsw.edu.au E- mail: formation of biofilm weakens the effect of antimicrobials and makes these infections difficult to eradicate. WHO has estimated that 64% of people are more likely to die due to m ethicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the non -resistant strains. Short peptidomimetics based on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the most effective approaches to new antibiotic discovery due to their unique mode of action. In our study, we demonstrated the importance of having a tryptophan residue for antibacterial activity, as well as having simple amine or guanidine groups to mimic lysine and arginine amino we developed the second -generation of guanidine -embedded anthranilamides and these compounds showed enhanced activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The most effective compound 758 showed antibacterial activity of 2 - 6 \u00b5g/mL against several Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains of microbial keratitis. The compounds were tested against the biofilms of S. aureus and S. epidermidis . The compound 758 showed excellent biofilm inhibition and disruption even at 2x MIC. Our initial mechanistic studies confirm that compound 758 acts by disrupting the bacterial me mbrane. The compound 758 is proteolytically stable when subjected to a trypsin degradation assay. Furthermore, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains did not acquire resistance to compound 758 even after 30 consecutive passages. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 BIOFILM SIGNALING DURING VIBRIO FISCHERI HOST COLONIZATION Abstract Body: Background symbiosis between Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna symbiont, Vibrio fischeri , provides a natural system in which to study host -microbe specificity and gene regulation during the establishment of a mutually beneficial symbiosis. Colonization of the host relies on bacterial biofilm -like aggre gation in the squid mucus field. Symbiotic biofilm formation is controlled by a phosphorelay system consisting of regulators RscS - SypF -SypG, which together direct transcription of the genes that synthesize the symbiosis polysaccharide Syp. Previously, we i dentified another hybrid histidine kinase BinK as a strong negative regulator of syp transcription. Using a sypA' - gfp+ reporter and conducting colonization assays, we demonstrated that BinK functions to inhibit biofilm gene expression at multiple stages of host colonization. In a binK background, the positive regulator RscS was no longer necessary for colonization or the initial aggregation phenotype, suggesting that BinK senses a signal from the host to regulate proper symbiotic development. Methods/Resul ts Here, we sought to determine how BinK interprets such a signal to control biofilm formation and identify possible ligands for BinK. Using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) with the purified BinK periplasmic/Cache domain and compounds from BiologTM plates, we identified ethanolamine as a putative ligand of BinK. Other analogs and derivatives of ethanolamine tested did not provide as strong as an effect, making it likely that ethanolamine is the bona fide ligand. Mutation of BinK Cache domain binding pocket residues renders BinK unable to inhibit syp transcription and biofilm formation both on agar and during colonization, indicating a role for this domain in binding a ligand and controlling BinK activity. Conclusions Overall, this study built on prev ious evidence that BinK interprets a host signal during the colonization process, identified ethanolamine as a likely ligand of BinK, and revealed the Cache domain as critical for BinK function. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: gut microbiota Abstract Body: Introduction: The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in human health and is therefore the focus of significant interest as a target for therapeutic interventions. Although we know that horizontal gene transfer is pervasive in these densely colonized ecosystems, we only have a superficial understanding of the different roles of most exchanged genes and how they affect community dynamics. Similarly, little is known about the mechanisms underlying community resiliency. This question is particularly intri guing for the Bacteroidales, the most abundant Gram - negative gut microbiome members, which can stably colonize for decades. Methods: Using the genome sequences of gut isolates from cohorts of human subjects living an industrialized lifestyle, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mobile genetic elements (MGE) that transfer across multiple species in co -resident Bacteroidales species. Results: Most MGEs are subject to recombination events, such that their architecture and gene repertoire is highly variabl e across communities. We focused on the rare six MGEs with a conserved architecture and global distribution, all of which show indications of recent spread in populations. In addition to MGEs with known functions (antibiotic resistance, interbacterial anta gonism), we identified a biofilm -formation encoding plasmid that frequently spreads across multiple Bacteroidales species in a community. This large conjugative plasmid is exceptional because of its ubiquity and its high frequency of intrapersonal transfer to multiple Bacteroidales species, with conserved architecture, across global human populations. Using a combination of genetics, microscopy, and population -level analyses, we explored the individual and community phenotypes mediated by this plasmid in vi tro and in gnotobiotic mouse models: multi -species biofilm formation in the colon, which promotes survival to antibiotic pulses. Conclusions: Our understanding of biofilms in the human intestinal tract and their impact in human health is in its infancy, in particular for the Bacteroidales. The fact that this plasmid is present in numerous co -resident species suggests that it taps into conserved regulatory mechanisms and that it confers a significant fitness advantage to recipient cells. Our preliminary resu lts indicate that it increases community resiliency, fostering cooperation between strains. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-288-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Can synthetic macromolecules function as antibiofilm agents? Abstract Body: Background: The way bacteria interact with surfaces have widespread implications on industrial processes, human health, and the environment. One of the consequences of such interactions are organized colonies of bacteria called as biofilms, which exhibit emergent prop erties and are recalcitrant, pervasive and pose a huge economic burden on healthcare and industry. While several strategies involving antibiotics, peptides, matrix degrading enzymes etc. have been developed to address biofilms, synthetic macromolecules hav e largely been unexplored as antibiofilm we designed water -soluble polymers with peptide -like pendant groups. For this study, we varied cationic (lysine - and arginine - and alanine -mimetic) pen dant groups, while keeping the charge to hydrophobicity ratio and molar mass constant to establish structure -property relationships. Results: Our data shows that all four polymers can disrupt surface biofilms of clinically relevant pathogens like P. aerugi nosa, S. aureus and E. coli , while different polymer pendant groups variably affect bacteria -surface interactions like surface motility, surface adhesion and zeta - potential of the bacteria. Additionally, we show that these polymers can also inhibit biofilm formation at concentrations as low as 4 -8 ug/mL, without being bactericidal. To explore the mechanism of biofilm inhibition by these polymers, we employ P. aeruginosa with a reporter plasmid pCdrA -gfp to show that the polymers reduce the levels of second messenger c -di-GMP compared to untreated and antibiotic controls. Lastly, to show clinical significance and potential of these polymers as antibiofilm agents, we show that our lead polymer can synergize with ciprofloxacin to manage bioburden in an infected wound model. Conclusion: Synthetic polymers can be designed to tune bacteria -surface interactions and have potential as antibiofilm agents. ---PAGEBREAK --- Number: Host Biofilms Publishing Title: IN DEPTH CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIAL BIOFILMS IN CHRONIC WOUNDS Abstract Body: Background Chronic wounds have a negative impact on patients' quality -of-life and constitute an increasing healthcare issue worldwide due to a rise in the elderly population. Although the chronic wound microbiome has been well investigated, knowledge regarding factor s underlying microbial colonization affecting wound progression and healing are underreported. The objective of our study is to investigate the role of bacterial biofilms in chronic wounds to address changes in the local microenvironment that have the pote ntial to affect treatment and healing processes. Methods This longitudinal study investigates two groups of patients with chronic low extremity wounds. Group 1 consists of 110 ambulatory patients from whom we collected swabs for bacterial identification, an d debridement for dual RNA -sequencing for computational modelling of host and pathogen markers of infection. Group 2 consists of 12 patients undergoing split -thickness skin graft (STSG). During surgery, we collected swabs and biopsies from the wound before and after debridement, the surrounding skin, and the donor site. The biopsies are used for visualization and omics studies to investigate host -pathogen interaction and to link phenotypic traits to genomic sequences. A biobank has been established with collected clinical isolates for in vitro characterization studies and for whole genome sequencing to study adaptation. Results In average Group 1 contain 2,5 bacterial species ranging from 1 to 10 with Stapylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae being the m ost prevalent. Almost 50% of the identified species are gut microbiota. Studies of Group 2 show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis are not removed by STSG surgery. Some P. aeruginosa and S. aureus clinical isolates show decreased virulen ce and increased tolerance to antibiotics. Presently, we are analyzing RNAseq and WGS data. Conclusion To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study of clinical chronic wound samples to date. The study will provide empirical evidence and analytical d iscussions of the role of biofilms in chronic wounds. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: Biofilms Publishing RNA SEQ ANALYSIS OF DUAL AND TRIPLE SPECIES BIOFILMS GIVE INSIGHT INTO INTERACTION AND COMPETITION AMONG LUNG PATHOGENS IN THEIR NICHE Abstract Body: Background :Lung infections are associated with microbial biofilms containing multiple major pathogens liv ing in close relationship. Amongst others the bacteria , Staphylococcus aureus , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Candida are well known for their significant role in pathogenicity in infected lungs. Here we provide first evid ence that cocultivation of these bacteria in mixed species biofilms affects the overall gene expression and metabolism of the species involved. Methods :For this study chromosomally labeled fluorescent strains of the pathogens aeruginosa PA01, S. aureus SH1000 and S. maltophilia K279a were used. Furthermore C. albicans SC5314 was incorporated into these multispecies consortia and mixed species biofilms were successfully established under flow and static conditions. RNA seq analyses of the different multispecies biofilms was performed and promotor fusion constructs were generated. Results :By LSM imaging, a particular dissemination and arrangement of every species in these biofilms was noticed. The structural pattern of multispecies biofilms depends on the species involved. Often layer formation was observed. PA01 was domina nt in these mixed species biofilms, while S. aureus was often reduced and outcompeted. Mainly K279a was the first to colonize the bottom layer. Dual species biofilm of K279a and C. albicans showed attachement of K279a on the hyphaes of C. albicans .In prese nce of S. aureus lactate metabolism in S. maltohphila was upregulated, whereas in coculture with P. aeruginosa propionate degradation was upregulated. P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia metabolism in mixed species biofilms was mostly fermentative with differ ent cytochromes used for anaerobic respiration in mixed vs. single species biofilms. We observed that many common virulence factors like lasA and lasB were attenuated in cocultivation but expression of cyclic diGMP and motility enhanced in mixed specie Conclusions :RNA seq analysis of these multispecies biofilms and the use of promotor fusion constructs has shown different expression patterns for every species as compared to single species biofilms. This implies that the species respond and rea ct to the presence of one another in these complex communities. In general respiration, metabolism and virulence factors were affected in these multispecies biofilms as compared to single biofilms. In our multispecies biofilm, the dynamics of interspecies interactions such as competition for nutritions and resources could be observed. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-301-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Anti-biofilm activity of microalgae cultivated in industrial biofilm -based reactor Abstract Body: Background : In the last decades, an increased resistance to antibiotics has been largely reported. There is therefore an urgent need to identify and produce alternative agents, especially of natural origin, to face this huge health challenge. Microalgae are now clea rly recognized as a valuable source of bioactive compounds, some of those with promising anti -biofilm activity. Nevertheless, no information is available regarding the effect of bioactive molecules extracted from microalgae biofilms though new valuable com pounds can be certainly discovered within this self -organized community. In this study, the anti -adhesion potential of extracts from industrial biofilms of two microalgae strains (i.e. Tetraselmis suecica and Cylindrotheca closterium ) was tested on eight h uman pathogenic bacteria including several strains of Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Listeria sp. and Salmonella sp. Methods : Microalgae biofilms were developed in an industrial rotating biofilm -based system. After biofilm harvesting, extracts we re obtained through centrifugation and ultrafiltration steps. Sugar composition were performed by HPLC. Adhesion of pathogenic bacteria was carried out in a 96 -well plates, previously coated with three microalgae extracts (FA_Tetraselmis, FB_Tetraselmis, _Cylindrotheca ). After 1h, surfaces were imaged by CLSM. Results : Extracts are largely composed by polysaccharides (up to 40% in dry weight). Differences in terms of sugars composition among microalgae species biofilms were detected. Our results show an ad hesion inhibition ranging from 35 to 60% for S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and E.coli strains for supports coated with FA_Tetraselmis . Interestingly, although no inhibition was observed for supports coated with F_Cylindrotheca and FB_Tetraselmis, S. aureus biofilms were more rough under the latter condition. Conclusions : 1) extracts of T. suecica biofilm is effective in inhibiting the adhesion of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria; 2) the anti -biofilm activity seems to be bacteria -dependent; 3) the chemical composition of the coated surfaces may explain differences in bacterial adhesion to th e support. In future work, physical -chemical properties of the coated surfaces will be assessed in order to get a better insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our work suggests that promising anti -biofilm drugs can be produced by microalgae biofilms. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-304-ASM -BIO (\"phage\") are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria and are thus promising alternatives to antibiotics in combatting biofilms. However, the interaction of phage with biofilm structure is underexplored. We have shown that, in Pseudomonas a eruginosa biofilms, lytic phage can induce a dramatic rearrangement of the rod -shaped cells into ordered, laterally aligned \"stacked\" aggregates. This is due to the entropic depletion force, which stems from the exclusion of polymers from the vicinity of n eighboring cells. Critically, as phage infect and lyse cells, host -derived polymers accumulate in the extracellular space, eventually attaining the concentrations required for the depletion force to push remaining cells together. Methods We used both physi cal theory and an in vitro model system to study the effects of phage on P. aeruginosa (PAO1) aggregation. This system comprised static liquid culture inoculated with varying initial concentrations of wild -type PAO1, lytic phage, and exogenous polymer. Dat a were collected via confocal microscopy and the resultant images analyzed in Fiji and MATLAB. Results We demonstrated that phage induces P. aeruginosa stacking aggregation given a wide range of initial conditions. Moreover, we determined that these aggreg ates form via depletion forces generated by lysis -derived DNA and protein. Finally, we observed stacked aggregates to withstand phage more effectively than both planktonic cells and a typical, relatively unstructured biofilm. Conclusions Phage -induced stac king aggregation constitutes a novel form of spatial structuring in biofilms and exemplifies how physics can have significant downstream biological consequences. Indeed, this phenomenon presents a potential hurdle for phage -based therapies, as the very age nt used to thwart bacterial infections may instead restructure surviving cells into aggregates more tolerant to further phage attack, as well as to other antimicrobials. ---PAGEBREAK --- Number: -associated Biofilms VITRO EVALUATION OF E. coli -GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN TRANSLOCATION IN THE 3D PRINTED VASCULAR GRAFT MATERIAL Abstract Body: Background: Vascular graft infection occurs in 0.6 - 6% of vascular surgeries depending on the surgical site and time required to conduct surgery. Since this infection occurs in a later stage usually 30 days post -surgery, the mortality rate is as high as 20%. The annua l cost burden associated with vascular graft infection is $640 million in the US. Adherence, invasion, and translocation of bacteria on vascular grafts are factors leading to infection. Internal infection plays a critical role in graft rejection, which may increase the mortality rate. The objective of this study was to investigate bacterial translocation to understand the nature of bacterial infection in synthetically produced vascular grafts. 3D printed grafts have been widely used for vascular surgeries a nd treatments. Methods: In this study, we leveraged a unique method to determine bacterial growth and its translocation on 3D printed vascular graft, vascular graft material, and a hydrogel scaffold. For this purpose, we enumerated E. coli , which is a comm only isolated bacteria in the vascular graft. Three different biological replicates of the 3D printed cylindrical construct with 5 m thickness and nano cellulose hydrogel were used for this study. The construct was injected with E. coli green fluorescent protein in a Difco ampicillin solution and immersed in 1% glycerol. Results: Bacterial growth was quantified using log CFU count and confocal microscopy images to better understand the bacterial attachment to, growth, and translocation through the 3D print ed surface using alginate bio ink and nano cellulose hydrogel. The bacterial growth was evaluated every 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours post -inoculation. The preliminary data shows that there was higher growth in alginate as compared to nano cellulose. Conclusions: Based on these data, the next step will be to create a test platform for vascular graft constructs and further elucidate mechanisms of bacteria translocation through data. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-308-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: EFFECT OF HYDROGEN DISULFIDE RELEASING COMPOUNDS AGAINST Staphyloccocus aureus AND Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract Body: Background are natural, and fast -acting antimic robials, with efficient transport through cell membranes and tissue.[1 -4] Our team has previously demonstrated the effectiveness of H 2S- releasing peptides against S. aureus biofilms.[5] Given this success, the current study evaluates the impact of an alternate sulfur compound that offers controllable release rates against both Staphylococcus aureus disulfide (Na 2S) compounds were separately diluted in PBS, and used immediately at concentrations from 0 -60mM. The compounds were used against planktonic culture (30 min exposure), or developing or mature biofilms composed of Staphylococcus aureus (Xen 40) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Xen 5 or PA01). Followi ng treatment, samples were serially diluted, plated onto agar, and the following day the number of colony forming units (CFUs/ mL) counted. Samples of developing or mature biofilms treated with either NDP -NAC or Na 2S for 24 hr were stained with crystal vio let (CV) to evaluate biomass. Results Planktonic Xen 40 treated with 5mM Na 2S had a 2.8 log reduction following 30 min, and 3.2 log reduction following 24hr exposure. PA01 had a 2.4 log reduction, but at 25 mM of Na 2S. Na 2S at 20 mM resulted in a 3.9 and 2 .9 log reduction against developing and mature biofilms, respectively, with a 57.8% reduction in the biomass of mature biofilms. Exposure to 20mM Na2S resulted in a 2.3 and 4.3 log reduction in PA01 CFUs from developing and mature biofilms, respectively, w ith a 66.3% reduction in the biomass of mature biofilms. NDP -NAC against planktonic Xen40 resulted in a 3.37 log reduction at 25 mM, with complete bacterial eradication at 50mM. NDP -NAC against planktonic Xen 5 exhibited a 5.11 log reduction at 25 mM, and complete eradication at 50mM. Conclusions H2S releasing compounds have properties that make them potentially valuable as a treatment for infected burn wounds. Our data demonstrates that both Na 2S and NDP -NAC poses the capacity to significantly reduce CFUs and biomass in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Kinematic assays with Na2S as treatment showed that H 2S starts making an effect as soon as 30 min after treatment. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-312-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: FIBRIN BASED NANOPARTICLE INFILTRATION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background: S. aureus is a gram -positive bacteria implicated in diseases such as endocarditis and chronic dermal wound infection. S. aureus generates fibrin -based biofilms by hijacking host wound healing machinery via Clumping factor A (ClfA) and coagulase, enhancing immune eva sion and antimicrobial recalcitrance. The Brown Lab has developed Fibrin Based Nanoparticles (FBNs) that can be loaded with therapeutics and delivered to the infection site for S. aureus biofilm incorporation and targeted drug release. Methods: FBNs were s ynthesized via fibrinogen enzymatic conversion into fibrin and sonication into nanoparticles. Particles were characterized using an Asylum atomic force microscope (AFM) and Malvern NanoSight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (vFBN) or vancomycin+tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (dFBN), and release characterized via plate reader and ELISA (1B). FBN interaction with S. aureus and incorporation into fibrin biofilms was identified via confocal microscopy (1C). Loaded FBN kill potential was analyzed CFU assay in vitro (1D) vivo (1E). Results: dry diameter of 213 17 nm, hydrodynamic diameter of 295 \u00b1 57 nm, and dry height of 15 \u00b1 5 nm. Results show vancomycin lo ading of 0.29 pg for vFBN (38% efficiency) and 0.24 pg for dFBN (35% efficiency) per FBN particle, and 0.007 pg tPA per FBN particle (30% efficiency). S. aureus interacts with FBNs as it does native fibrin and incorporates FBNs throughout the biofilm full thickness. vFBNs reached clinically significant 3 log(CFU/ml) killing efficiency in vitro , and trends suggest a decrease in Xen36 radiance and burden in vivo . Conclusions: FBNs provide a novel, biocompatible approach for of antimicrobial therapeutics to 2022 -A-315-ASM -BIO Topic Prevention and Biofilms Publishing Title: Anti-biofilm activity of Lippia origanoides essential Methicillin a high - priority multidrug -resistant bacterium with a wide variety of virulence factors such as the production of coagulases, hemolysins, DNAses and biofilm. In addition, MRSA biofilm can colonize biotic and abiotic surfaces, contributing to bacterial persistence and the effectiveness of conventional d rugs. Therefore, focusing on the biofilm and the different virulence factors becomes an alternative to decrease MRSA pathogenicity. This work aimed to evaluate the anti -biofilm activity of Lippia its effect on coagulase and hemolysin production. In this work, the effect of L. origanoides on MRSA growth, biofilm formation, and virulence factors expression were evaluated. Minimal inhibitory concentration. Methods: Minimum Inhibitory and Bactericidal Concentration (MIC 90 and MBC) were carried out through microdilution test of planktonic cells cultured in Mueller Hinton broth (37 \u00b0C; 8 h). Biofilm inhibition (BIC) was evaluated through the crystal violet staining method of sessile cells adhered in 96 -well microplates cultured with TSB (24 h; 37 \u00b0C) concentrations L. origanoides . sub -MIC concentration effect in hemolysin and exopolysaccharide production were tested. Finally, an analysis of biofilm in glass co upons was conducted via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results and Conclusions: L. origanoides EO presented a MIC 90 of and MBC of 0.75 mg/mL. Inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved at 121 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5g/mL without affecting planktonic grow th, suggesting an effect on the expression of adherence and biofilm -forming factors at sub -MIC concentrations. Additionally, expression of virulence factors as coagulases, and hemolysins were obtained at <100 \u00b5g/mL, probably due to the presence of thymol compounds. In conclusion, the present work reveals the potential antibiofilm of L. origanoides EO and presents it as a promising therapeutic alternative to control infections caused by MRSA biofilm. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-317-ASM -BIO Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: BACTERIOPHAGE TO TREAT MULTIDRUG RESISTANT Staphylococcus aureus OSTEOMYELITIS INFECTIONS WITH BIODEGRADEABLE MICROSPHERE TECHNOLOGY Abstract Body: The rise in antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections is a serious concern within the healthcare and scientific communities. Bacteriophage (phage) provide a unique biological approach to the AMR problem. A major issue in the delivery of active bacteriophage s, using poly(lactic -co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres as a degradable drug delivery system, is possible phage inactivation when they contact the organic solvent dichloromethane during manufacture. Here we investigated two protocols for microsphere man ufacture, utilizing our previously developed microsphere technology for antibiotic delivery, focusing on phage exposure to dichloromethane. Two bacteriophage, phage K and SA4, were tested and found to lyse the clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolate UAMS -1, obtained from an osteomyelitis infection, when grown on agar plates, in liquid culture, and in biofilms. The PLGA microspheres were manufactured according to a water -oil- water protocol that yields 250 mg of microspheres. Method 1 included adding a 2.5 x 1010 phage/ml solution directly to a PLGA -dichloromethane mixture. Contact time between the phage and solvent was reduced by using 2 -propanol to precipitate the microspheres. For method 2, the 2.5 x 1010 phage/ml solution was added to a polyvinyl alcohol (P VA) solution before adding this mixture to the PLGA - dichloromethane solution. Both methods were evaluated using an elution assay, and the eluent was collected after 24 hr, 72 hr, and 7 days. Each eluent was spotted onto a lawn of UAMS -1 S. aureus , and the resulting plaque forming units (PFUs) were counted. The total phage eluted over the 7 -day period was calculated, as was the average entrapment efficiency, for the 250 mg batches. The data were analyzed with SPSS software and a t -test compared the results o f 4 trials per method. For Method 1, a total of 2.0 x 107 phage eluted after 7 days, yielding a 0.6% entrapment efficiency. For Method 2, a total of 5.1 x 105 phage eluted after 7 days, yielding a 0.02% entrapment efficiency. There was a statistically sign ificant difference between the two methods (p= 0.012). In this in vitro study, we found surprisingly that the first method eluted a statistically greater number of active phage and had a greater entrapment efficiency. We are currently studying the effectiv eness of phage -containing PLGA microspheres against S. aureus in in vitro biofilms and plan in the future to examine in vivo animal models. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: is an anti -amyloidogenic protein made exclusively in the stomach and secreted into th e gut lumen. Biofilm -forming bacteria are known to make amyloids to facilitate the development of biofilms. Therefore, we investigated whether GKN1 impacts amyloid fiber formation and biofilm development in known biofilm formers. We used recombinant GKN1 protein to test its ability to inhibit amyloid fiber formation by Citrobacter CsgA and biofilm aggregation of biofilms were grown in 96 -well plates and quantified crystal violet staining. Results: GKN1 decreased Citrobacter CsgA aggregation, indicating formation. GKN1 also inhibited C. rodentium biofil m growth in a dose -dependent manner. Conclusions: GKN1 inhibits amyloid fiber formation by Citrobacter CsgA and biofilm formation by C. rodentium . These results demonstrate that a host gut - derived protein inhibits microbial amyloid and biofilm formation.

Nanotextured surfaces regulate cell morphologies, cellular metaboli c activity, and, thus, biofilm formation. In this study, we aim to quantitatively describe the dominant cues that affect Staphylococcus aureus's initial adhesion, biofilm maturation, and propagation on a nanotextured surface compared to a smooth substrate in the absence and presence of physiologically relevant shear stress. Methods: We develop polystyrene nanofiber -coated surfaces of controlled diameter and spacing integrated within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based microfluidic flow cell to investigate S. aureus's biofilm development under shear stress systematically. Results: spacing: 750 nm) and uncoated control was evaluated over 48 h. In the absence of shear stress on nanofiber s urfaces, only 22% bacterial surface coverage was observed, which is significantly (p<0.0001) lower than that of 60 % on the uncoated surface (Fig 1a). In the presence of 0.002 mPa shear stress, 50 -60% less coverage is observed on both surfaces. Nonetheless , uncoated surfaces had significantly higher (p<0.0001) surface coverage, consistent with our observations in the static case (Fig 1b). Interestingly, besides the less surface coverage, the nanofibers -coated surfaces have small, scattered biofilm patches c ompared to large patches on the uncoated surface (Fig 1a -b). Conclusions: Nanotopography under shear stress can slow down biofilm growth and affect their architecture; thus, it might be a superior approach to increase the efficacy of antibiotics and other eradication strategies. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-320-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: ANTIMICROBIAL COATING BASED ON QUORUM SENSING INHIBITORS FOR THE PREVENTION OF MICROBIAL INDUCED CORROSION OF ROCK AND CABLE BOLTS Abstract Body: Background: One of the main causes of corr osion failure of anchoring materials like rockbolts and cable bolts has been identified as Microbially Induced Corrosion (MIC). Compared to other types of corrosion, MIC can be difficult to observe and determine, but it has been observed in most environmen ts, including underground mines. A study believed that up to 20% of corrosion failures are related to MIC. And in Australia alone, the MIC -related industrial loss was estimated to be $US4.2 billion. The rockbolts and cable bolts normally penetrate through multiple layers of different coal, clay, and rock strata in underground mines. Many studies have identified the relationship between bacteria and corrosion in underground coal mines [1, 4, 5]. To prevent MIC activity, biofilm formation on or around the met al surface needs to be prevented. Antimicrobial coatings have emerged as a desirable method to prevent bacterial colonisation on surfaces due to their potential for persistent antimicrobial activity, as well as their ability to deliver high local concentra tions. In this study, antimicrobial coatings that utilize dihydropyrrolones (DHP), derivatives of natural quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors, are described to prevent MIC failure in rockbolts and cable bolts. Methods : DHPs were either covalently or admixed int o polymeric coatings on glass and steel coupons. These coupons were challenged against S. aureus (control) and Sulphate -Reducing Bacteria (SRBs) cultures containing Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum , enriched from groundwater samples. Both genera are well -known known to produce MIC in steel. Viable bacteria counts and microscopy were used to determine bacterial adhesion and colonisation after 1, 7 and 14 days. Results: Antimicrobial coatings containing DHP demonstrated desirable properties. DHP -releasing c oating were able to completely prevent bacteria growth on the surfaces after 24 hours and maintain its activity over the period tested. DHP that were covalently bound to the surfaces were able to prevent biofilm formation compared to the uncoated controls. Conclusions: This study is a proof of concept for DHP coatings to be used to prevent the occurrence of MIC. This represents a promising strategy to prevent biofilm -mediated corrosion. Further work is ongoing to study the longevity of DHP coatings in full scale testing. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-321-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: PLASMA FUNCTIONALIZED LIQUID A NOVEL APPROACH TO CONTROL PATHOGENIC BIOFILMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POULTRY PROCESSING CHAIN Abstract Body: Background: The poultry meat industry raises significant public health concerns and economic losses. They are chiefly related to Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp. Residues like chicken juice promote microbial growth, surface attachment, and biofilm persistence, enabling resistance to current cleaning approaches. This highlights the risks of cross -contamination, food spoilage, and quality deterioration. Novel no n-thermal technologies like cold plasma are primarily diagnosed to control microbial risks of heat -sensitive products with extended applications in major fields such as foods, agriculture, and biotechnology. Liquid and gas are the two forms of cold plasma applications. Methods: The fundamental purpose of the present work is to assess the antimicrobial effect of plasma functionalized liquid pathogens ge nerated on most food contact surfaces used in the processing facilities. Three plasma system discharges, namely spark, glow, and microwaved induce plasma used to generate PFL. The plasma process parameters were optimized using a chicken juice model mimicki ng the natural poultry environmental conditions. Using a bioreactor, biofilms were generated on abiotic surfaces (stainless and polished stainless steel, borosilicate glass, silicone, polyethylene terephthalate, and polycarbonate). PFL treatment was applie d by washing approach for different periods (1, 5, and 10 min). The antimicrobial efficacy was assessed in terms of microbial recovery, metabolic activity (XTT), and viability (fluorescence live/dead). The biofilm structure was identified by atomic force m icroscopy. Results: Results illustrate that the growth conditions (temperature, incubation time, and media) with the abiotic surface type affected the biofilm attachments. PFL induced severe biofilms eradication, resulting in 4 to 7 log CFU/mL reduction. A dropdown of 95% of the total cell metabolic activity was reported following 60 -sec washing. The biofilm structure topography was affected in addition to membrane damage and intracellular fluids release. Conclusion: These works suggest PFL is a promising and scalable approach allowing the control of microbial risk associated with the poultry meat sector. It can be applied at individual or sequential process stages to rapidly control poultry -related pathogens that may be present in suspension, attached in biofilms to abiotic surfaces, or on the surface of poultry meat. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-323-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: USING NANOSECOND PULSED ELECTRIC FIELDS TO SENSITIZE METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS TO VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT Abstract Body: Background The public health impact of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ) has been increased by the emergence of Methicil lin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA infections are treated with vancomycin. However, MRSA intermediate resistance to vancomycin has been observed, which is concerning due to the potential for developing multi -drug resistance. Staphylococcus au reus can form biofilms, which include extracellular matrices that serve as a physical barrier and decreases the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Methods In this study we use a combinatorial treatment involving pre -treatment with nsPEF and post -treatment wi th vancomycin. Treatment with nsPEF treatment will create transient pores in the MRSA cell membrane, which will sensitize them to vancomycin treatment. Results This combinatorial treatment has already shown potential in in vitro experiments when working wit h MRSA log phase, planktonic stationary phase, and biofilm cells. We have shown that MRSA log phase cells have the highest susceptibility to vancomycin after being treated with nanosecond pulses. Surprisingly, MRSA biofilm cells were shown to be more susce ptible to vancomycin, after nsPEF treatment, compared to MRSA planktonic stationary phase cells. We expected that the biofilms would provide the most protection against nsPEF treatment and therefore be the least susceptible to vancomycin. Conclusion Treatme nt with nsPEF could increase the efficacy of antibiotic treatment against other pathogens by removing the pathogen's protective barrier that is caused by biofilms. This would have a major impact on increasing the efficacy of current antibiotic treatments a gainst other pathogens and decreasing the rate of multi -drug resistance. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: Body: Background Salmonella biofilm -associated amyloid protein, curli, is a dominant instigator of systemic inflammation and autoimmune responses following Salmonella infection. Intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of curli induce the major features of Reactive Arthritis (ReA), an autoim mune disorder associated with Salmonella infection in humans. Infecting mice with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, but not with an isogenic curli mutant or a non -invasive mutant, recapitulates these phenotypes. These observations strongly suggest t hat curli instigate inflammation once it crosses the epithelial barrier, resulting in ReA. Interleukin (IL) -17 is an important pro -inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in Salmonella induced arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Methods In this study , we investigated curli -induced inflammation and changes in the gut microbiota and immune response in C57BL/6 mice from Taconic Farms and Jackson Labs that have different basal levels of IL -17 due to differences in their microbiota. Results We saw no difference in the production of anti -double stranded DNA autoantibodies in mice from either facility. However, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, generally used to characterize microbiota dysbiosis was increased in Jackson mice injected with cur li, whereas in Taconic mice, the injection made no difference. We saw an increase in the gut microbiota diversity in Jackson mice, but not in Taconic mice. Furthermore, there were increases in percent abundance of the family Akkermansiaceae and decrease in families Clostridiaceae 1 and Muricbaculaceae in Jackson mice. Despite the lack of microbiota changes in the Taconic mice, systemic and gut mucosal immune response were higher in the Taconic mice i.p injected with curli compared to the Jackson counterpart s. While there was an increase in immune response of Jackson mice i.p injected with curli, we identified a significant increase in expression of Il -1, activators of IL -17 producing cells, in the spleen and gut mucosa of Taconic mice. Similarly, expression of tumor necrosis factor , also an activator of IL -17 producing cells, was increased in the gut mucosa of Taconic mice. Conclusions Our results show that the injection of curli through non -mucosal route leads to immune activation in the gut mucosa leadin g to changes in the gut microbiota, in a host microbiota dependent manner. This is an exciting finding that can have implications in population with chronic infection and the indirect effect it can have on the gut microbiota. ---PAGEBREAK --- Contr ol Number: 2022 -A-328-ASM -BIO Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: DESIGNING ENZYMES TO DISRUPT PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA MUCOID BIOFILM Abstract Body: Background: Availability of new antibiotics is not keeping pace with antibiotic resistance. A mechanism of antibiotic resistance is biofilm formation which guards cells from antibiotics, avoids immune recognition, and promotes virulence. Polysaccharide lyase, Smlt1473 , Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm aiding drug resistance. Combating microbial infection with enzymes is favorable due to high substrate specificity/affinity for biofilm polysaccharides and tunability through genetic manipulation. This project aims to characterize and optimize the effect of Smlt1473 on biofilm from 3 distinct P. aeruginosa clinical isolates alginate overproducing strain PDO300. Methods: Smlt1473 into pet28a(+) was transformed into BL21 E. coli . Protein production was induced with IPTG, purified via IMAC, and activity verified by a thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. Biofilm inhibition was assessed by pretreating plates with and quantified by a carbazole assay to determine uronic acid concentration. Mature P. aeruginosa biofilm was used in a TBA assay to show degradation by Smlt1473. Growth curves in the presence and absence of enzyme explored effect on growth. Prior work found mutations enhancing activity against alginate. These are used against P. aeruginosa strains to show enzyme specificity and improve biofilm removal. Results: Smlt1473 inhibits biofilm of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and can degrade the mature biofilm as well. Smlt1473 demonstrated inhibition and degradation capability for biofilm on agar plates, but no inhibition of growth in liquid culture. Early work combining Smlt1473 with common antipseudomonal antibiotic, piperacillin, has shown growth inhibition on agar plates, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two. Conclusions: Inhibition and degradation assays have shown that Smlt1473 is effective against P. aeruginosa biofilm from clinical isolates. However, depending on the isolate, varying concentrations of enzyme are required for effective inhibition and degradation. Future studies will explore the polysaccharide makeup of each biofilm to explain variability in the amount of Smlt1473 required. Whil e Smlt1473 alone does not affect P. aeruginosa growth in liquid culture, combining Smlt1473 with piperacillin shows promise for growth inhibition ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-331-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: CHARACTERIZATION OF A MODIFIED DOMAIN WITHIN THE EUKARYOTIC HIGH MOBILITY GROUP BOX 1 (HMGB1) PROTEIN THAT PREVENTS BACTERIAL BIOFILM FORMATION Abstract Body: Background: The host -derived High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) DNA bending protein functions intracellularly to mediate DNA metabolic processes, and extracellularly to elicit a damage -associated pro -inflammatory response. The non - homologous bacterial DNABII proteins m aintain the integrity of the biofilm by stabilizing DNA bends from their concave surfaces. In contrast, HMGB1 bends DNA via the convex surface, which we discovered destabilizes the eDNA scaffold to disrupt a bacterial biofilm and thereby render biofilm -resident bacteria vulnerable to host immune effectors and antimicrobials. However, excessive HMGB1 can cause sepsis owing to its strong proinflammatory effects. Thus, we engineered a synthetic HMGB1 variant peptide (sHVP) that retains anti -biofilm activity functions (Devaraj et al., 2021 J Clin Invest 131:16). Here, we wanted to determine the ability of sHVP to potentially prevent biofilm formation by the high were allowed to adhere in 8 -well chamber coverglass slides for 1 hr prior to incubation with either sHVP or anti -DNABII for an additional 18 hrs to assay prevention of biofilm formation compared to incubation with media alone. CSLM images of treate d biofilms were obtained and analyzed with COMSTAT to determine relative biofilm architecture. Results: Both sHVP and anti-DNABII prevented biofilm formation by all tested pathogens when these biologicals were added very early during biofilm formation. To date, we have also seen a dose -dependent ability of both anti -DNABII and sHVP to prevent biofilm formation by NTHI when assayed as described above. Incubation with the highest dose of sHVP (1.8 g/200 L; 900 nM) allowed only a bacterial monolayer to form. Conclusions: sHVP, that was engineered to retain its antibiofilm properties while eliminating its pro -inflammatory function, prevented biofilm formation in vitro by each of cenocepacia , and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae .

These functionalities can be extended to treatment and removal of pathogenic biofilms. Methods We developed magnetically actuated, catalytically active microrobots for the treatment of endodontic biofilm s. Based on the dual magnetic and catalytic functionalities of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs), we investigate two physically distinct microrobotic platforms for use in the root canal: aggregated NPs and 3D -molded robots. In the first system, aggregates of NPs are magnetically controlled and directed through the root canal while mechanically scrubbing interior surfaces and chemically degrading the biofilm. In the second system, NPs are mixed with a hydrogel and molded into miniature helices that are driven a long the length of the canal. By incorporating opacifiers into these 3D -molded microrobots, we also enable radiographic contrast for tracking position within the tooth. Results Both forms of microrobots are effective in mechanically removing biofilms and catalytically killing pathogens. Further, the microrobots are shown to retrieve biofilm samples from canal mimics for diagnostic analysis. Conclusions Small - scale microrobots show significant promise for improving treatment and diagnosis of biofilm -related disease in confined spaces. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-333-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: NUTRIENT REMOVAL AS A BIOFILM FOULING CONTROL STRATEGY IN AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WATER RECOVERY SYSTEM Abstract Body: Background Water recycling systems are critical components of crewed space exploration. To date, the longest operational water recovery system in space is the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) on the International Space Station (ISS). While the WPA has successfully reco vered potable water from wastewater streams for over a decade, intermittent biofilm fouling events have decreased system performance requiring component replacement to return the system to operation. One strategy to reduce growth potential in existing and future water systems is selective nutrient removal or reduction of target nutrients entering the water system. Biofilm growth in the ISS WPA wastewater tank was experimentally simulated to identify nutrients that could be targets for this approach. Methods A consortium of four bacteria ( B. contaminans, C. metallidurans, M. organophilum, and ( L. mutabilis ) from the WPA were grown in a defined, 34 -component synthetic wastewater recipe called Microbial Ersatz developed to m odel the urine distillate and humidity condensate inputs to the ISS WPA tank. A nutrient screen was performed by monitoring growth of the consortium in flask -based assays with individual nutrients in the media (N, P, S, K, Ca and trace nutrients as well as growth inhibitory Zn and Ni) absent or provided in excess. Nutrient targets with growth effects were validated in CDC biofilm reactors. Results The model system was phosphate -limited and phosphate removal in CDC reactors reduced microbial growth of total cells by 1.7 log 10(CFU total cells/mL) in the bulk fluid and 1.5 log 10(CFU total cells/cm2) in biofilms at 7 days. The addition of 47.5 \u00b5g/L magnesium increased initial growth of all organisms however no difference in total cells was observed at 7 days. The greater impact of magnesium was visible increases in biomass production in the bulk flui d as flocs and as biofilm on surfaces due to increased growth and hyphal production by the fungus, a nutrient trigger that could increase clogging. Conclusions This study identified phosphate and magnesium as targets for selective removal to reduce biofilm in the WPA and has increased our knowledge of how the known fluctuations of nutrients and inhibitory metals in water recovery systems may contribute to intermittent growth -permissive conditions in which biofouling potential increases. Nutrient removal is an attractive strategy alone or in combination with strategies like biocide treatment as reduced biofilm would likely reduce biocide needs to maintain system performance. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-335-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: BREAKING BIOFILMS: TRUE ANTI Body: Background Streptococcus mutans a dental that is a major causative agent of dental caries. It forms biofilms on teeth where anaerobic conditions result in fermentation, acid build up, and decay of the tooth enamel. Dental caries affects 3.9 billion people and costs 290 billion per year, which is a tremendous burden on world health. True anti -biofilm compounds (TABC) are substances that inhibit or disperse biofilms without killing bacteria, limiting selective pressure for resistance. Here we develop a high throughput assay to discover TABCs using existing chemical libraries and execute a small -scale screen. Methods We developed a screen for TABCs by first optimizing the media and surface materials, then validated it and calculated a z score of 0.76, which indicates a robust assay. In this screen, S. mutans Clarke was grown for 24 hours in Todd Hewit t, yeast extract media with supplemented glucose and sucrose in 96 well tissue culture treated microtiter plates. We treated samples with 10 \u00b5M of compounds from a library of >1200 compounds. The optical density was measured and then the plate was subjecte d to a crystal violet biofilm assay and quantified. Results Ten candidates that reduced biofilms while retaining normal growth were selected for verification and further study. Of the candidates two compounds, TABC3 and TABC4, were verified to have strong biofilm inhibition. At 100 \u00b5M TABC3 inhibited biofilms by 93% increased the OD planktonic bacteria by 4.2 -fold, while TABC4 inhibited biofilms by 91% and increased the planktonic OD by 2.7 -fold. Neither compound had the ability to disperse preformed b iofilms significantly. Conclusions In summary, we have successfully developed a screen for the identification of TABCs in S. mutans . This data suggests that the use of this screen to investigate larger compound libraries would likely identify more novel com pounds. We have also identified 2 compounds from this screen that warrant further investigation into their mechanism of action and effects on biofilm inhibition. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-338-ASM -BIO Prevention and Biofilms Publishing Title: Monoclonals that target extracellular DNABII of Haemophilus influenzae is a common causative agent of respiratory tract disease, often in partnership with other airway pathogens as part of a polymicrobial biofilm. In the absence of highly effective, biofilm -targete d therapeutics, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. This practice however is largely ineffective and also contributes significantly to the global threat of rising antimicrobial resistance. Here, we aimed to determine whether either of two monoclonal antib odies we developed, anti -rsPilA [directed subunit of the T4P of NTHI (PilA) and specific for NTHI] or anti -DNABII (directed at the binding tips of IHF and able to act in a species agnostic manner on all biofilms tested to date), were a ble to disrupt 2 -genera biofilms wherein NTHI was co-partnered with another respiratory tract pathogen. Methods : Single species or mixed genera biofilms were allowed to form for 24 h, then treated for 2 h with either antibody alone or admixed 1:1 in a cock tail. Disruption was measured as the number of newly released bacteria collected from the media after 2 h compared to those recovered from wells incubated with media alone. Co Results : As expected, anti-rsPilA was only effective on single species biofilms formed by NTHI. However, within 2 -genera biofilms, anti -rsPilA now mediated release of both species from these biofilms. Also as expected, anti -DNABII, significantly disrupted all single species and 2 -genera biofilms, which reflected the universal presence of this monoclonal's target in all tested biofilm matrices. The greatest release of both pathogens from a 2 -genera biofilm however was uniformly achieved by incubation with a 1:1 cocktail of both monoclonal antibodies, which had an additive disruption effect. Conclusions : These data support the use of an approach wherein patients with respiratory tract disease co uld be treated with a therapeutic monoclonal antibody cocktail to release NTHI and its co -pathogen from their protective biofilm to be killed by either traditional antibiotics and/or host immune effectors. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-340-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: MULTIFUNCTIONAL NANOMATERIALS FOR LIGHT CONTROLLED ACTION P. AERUGINOSA BIOFILMS Abstract Body: Background Biofilms account for up to 80% of all human bacterial infections contributing to the high mortality rates. Biofilms are the leading cause of delayed wound healing, exacerbating the chronic wound state and infection. P. aeruginosa is one of the most implica ted bacteria in chronic wound biofilms and accounts for very high death rate, especially in immunocompromised patients. The presence of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) contributes to the failure of most antibiotics in mature/ preformed biofilms. EP S composition and its acidic environment results in poor penetration and rapid clearance of most antimicrobials. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) has been recently studied as a non -invasive antibiotic free alternative due their antibacterial action. PDI rel ies on the elimination of bacteria via light excitation of photosensitizer (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). PDI can cause oxidative damage to the EPS and significant PS accumulation can cause its disruption. Recent reports have indicated tha t PS accumulation within EPS can be improved by using nanomaterials. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are ideal for this purpose as they can function as a delivery vehicle as well as an antimicrobial agent. AgNPs antimicrobial property is associated with the l eaching of silver ion (Ag+), that can be enhanced via conjugation of PS. Methods We have designed PS (Protoporphyrin IX) conjugated on AgNP that allows for light controlled accumulation as well as antimicrobial action within biofilms. We hypothesize that t he synergistic effect of PS and AgNPs can be strategically controlled via light to induce enhanced EPS disruption and elimination of biofilm associated bacteria. Results The PS was modified via EDC/ NHS chemistry to render thiol group to functionalize on t he AgNP surface. ICP -OES analysis indicate that nanomaterials show almost 3 times higher Ag+ release than AgNP in the presence of light. The light treatment of planktonic and sessile P. aeruginosa bacteria will be performed in-vitro using LED light source. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity will be evaluated using crystal violet assay, confocal microscopy, carbohydrate assay and colony count method. Conclusion This work provides preliminary proof of concept to elaborate light controlled antibiofilm action of these multifunctional nanomaterials. ---PAGEBREAK --- DNA is present within biofilms adherent to mucosa recovered during endoscopic surgery from children with chronic rhinosinusitis Abstract Body: Background : Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses commonly associated with bacterial biofilms. Bacteria within a biofilm can avoid clearance by host immune effectors, including the ability of PMNs to kill these bacteria via the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Bacteria produce DNABII proteins which stabilize prokaryotic eDNA within the biofilm matrix, and we've shown that these DNA -binding proteins can bind to and convert eDNA from the native B -form to the r are Z -form. DNABII proteins can also migrate to PMN NETs whereby conversion of eukaryotic B -form DNA to the Z -form inactivates NET -mediated killing. Antibiotics are often ineffectively prescribed to patients with CRS and those who do not respond frequently undergo Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). FESS does not however cure the underlying cause of CRS and as such, most patients will endure multiple procedures. Here, we examined eDNA associated with pediatric sinus tissue samples to determine if Z -form DNA was present and thereby might be playing a role in disease recalcitrance. Methods : Sinus mucosal samples were recovered from 20 pediatric patients during FESS and immediately snap frozen in OCT. Ten -micron sections were cut, then labelled with mou se anti -dsDNA (specific for B -DNA) and rabbit anti -Z-DNA, followed by detection via fluorochrome -conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti -rabbit IgG, respectively. Images were captured by CSLM. Results : 18 of 20 sinus mucosal samples had detectable ass ociated eDNA. All 18 of these samples (100%) were positive for both B - and Z -form eDNA, however the majority was in the Z -form. Any B -form DNA was predominantly found in association with PMNs that had either sparsely infiltrated the eukaryotic eDNA lattice or were located at the distal periphery. Conclusions : Conversion of host-derived eDNA in PMN NETs from the B -form to the Z -form likely contributes to the chronicity and recurrence of CRS in pediatric patients due to inactivation of NET functions. Therapeu tic agents that could flip Z -form eDNA back to its native B-form, or prevent this conversion, would both disarm a bacterial offensive mechanism and promote NET -mediated bacterial killing, thereby promoting more effective biofilm clearance and decreasing th e requirement for repetitive medical and surgical interventions for patients with CRS or other biofilm -mediated diseases. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-342-ASM -BIO 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Using SMART magnetic fluids and gels for prevention and destruction of bacterial biofilms Abstract Body: ---PAGEBREAK --- Bacterial protein acetylation is a common posttranslational modification that influences many key physiological processes. While significant progress has been made towards understanding the impact of protein acetylation on bacterial physiology, much is yet to be discovered. For example, the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii , thought to play an important role in oral biofilm development, is predicted to encode twenty -two protein acetyltransferases. This number exceeds the predicted number of two -componen t systems and corresponds to approximately 1% of the total number of S. gordonii genes; however, little information exists on the role of protein acetylation in S. gordonii physiology. We previously reported that upon binding to the major human salivary mu cin, MUC5B, S. gordonii down -regulates at least genes that encode putative acetyltransferases (SGO_2030 and SGO_2031). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SGO_2031 is the most conserved and prevalent of the two putative acetyltransferases among str eptococci. Supporting the role that as an acetyltransferase in vivo , mass spectrometry analysis of proteins collected from S. gordonii biofilms showed that the acetylation status of 24 proteins depended on SGO_2031. Furthermore, deletion of SGO_2031 reduced biofilm formation on saliva -coated 96 -well plates. The decrease appeared to reflect the amount of extracellular polysaccharide produced by S. gordonii , as determined by confocal microscopy and phenol -sulfuric acid analysis. Since S. go rdonii is a pioneer colonizer of the tooth surface and thought to be a key player in the development and maturation of the microbial community that makes up dental plaque, we investigated the ability of an SGO_2031 deletion mutant to colonize and alter the microbial composition of the murine oral cavity. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis shows that in vivo colonization and composition of the murine oral cavity is affected by deletion of SGO_2031. Collectively, these results support the role of SGO_2031 as a p rotein acetyltransferase, functioning in S. gordonii biofilm formation and oral colonization and influencing the composition of the oral biofilms in vivo . ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BIOFILMS FORMED IN MILK DISPLAY RESISTANCE TO THE PHAGE LYTIC PROTEIN LYSRODIAMI Abstract Body: Background: Milk is a highly nutritious medium that allows growth of m any microorganisms including pathogenic and spoilage -causing bacteria. Due to its ability to form biofilms and produce heat -resistant enterotoxins, Staphylococcus aureus represents a threat for dairy animals and consumers health, and often leads to serious economic losses in milk production. In this context, phage endolysins are considered a promising alternative to biocidal agents and antibiotics to control contamination with this pathogen in a dairy setting. This study evaluates the ability of S. aureus to form biofilms in milk, and subsequently assesses the potential of endolysins to reduce them. Methods: Overnight cultures of each S. aureus strain were diluted 1:1000 (v/v) in fresh UHT milk or TSB supplemented with 0.25% glucose. Then, 2 ml of each bacte rial suspension were inoculated into each well of a 12 -well polystyrene microtiter plate with or without stainless steel coupons inside and the plates were incubated for 3h, 5h, 7h or 24h at 37\u00baC. After removal of the planktonic phase, biofilms were washed twice with PBS. When required, the remaining adhered cells were then treated with 1ml of PBS alone or containing different concentrations of endolysin LysRODIAmi. To assess biofilm formation and the efficacy of the different treatments, the number of vi able attached cells was determined. Results: S. aureus strains of different origins successfully formed biofilms in milk on both polystyrene and stainless steel, with a total number of viable attached cells similar to biofilms grown in TSBg. Although the fi nal number of attached cells was similar in both media after 24h of incubation, cell counts in milk biofilms were slightly lower at earlier timepoints. In TSBg, treatment of preformed biofilms with 4 \u00b5M LysRODIAmi was effective at reducing the number of a ttached cells, whereas treatment of preformed biofilms in milk was not successful even at 12 \u00b5M. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that milk is an ideal medium for S. aureus , forming robust biofilms that offer more resistance to endolysin treatmen t than biofilms grown in culture medium. Bearing in mind that the number of attached cells was similar in both media, these results suggest that this resistance might be related to the structure of the biofilm or the physiological state of the bacteria. Further studies should examine this phenomenon in more detail and assess the efficacy of combination treatments of this endolysin with other antimicrobials SALMONELLA BIOFILM -ASSOCIATED AND GENETIC FACTOR HLA gastroenteritis, in 5 -10% of cases, progress to reactive arthritis (ReA), an autoimmune disease. STm forms biofilms in the gut with an extracellular matrix containing extracellular DNA and the bacterial amyloid c urli. We previously showed that curli/DNA complexes trigger an autoimmune response in wild -type mice including anti -dsDNA autoantibodies and mild knee inflammation. HLA -B27 is a genetic risk factor present in 60 -90% of patients with ReA. HLA -B27 is thought to misfold into homodimers which induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) and activate a CD4+ Th17 response, associated with autoimmunity. We sought to determine whether HLA -B27 exacerbated curli -induced autoimmunity; to characterize the immune response , namely UPR activation and Th17 response; and to examine the synergistic effects of a pro -inflammatory microbiome. Methods: In vivo experiments utilized HLA -B27tg mice on a C57BL/6 background. Mice were chronically infected with spiB mutant STm, deficient in type -3 secretion system -2 and capable of nonfatally infecting STm -susceptible mice. To establish the role of curli, we performed chronic injections with curli/DNA purified from STm biofilms, or acute infection with wild STm csgBA mutant, def icient in curli. Inflammatory microbiomes were established by fecal transfer from mice colonized with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB+). In vitro, BMDMs isolated from C57BL/6 or HLA -B27tg mice were treated with curli, or infected with STm, to examine U PR activation and cytokine production. Results: Chronic infection of HLA -B27tg mice provoked similar autoantibody levels and knee inflammation to wild-type mice. SFB+ HLA -B27tg mice, after acute infection, produced elevated IL - 23 and GM -CSF in the serum an d UPR in the cecum compared to SFB+ wild -type mice. from HLA mice secreted pro -inflammatory cytokines vs. wild -type cells and UPR was exclusively triggered in HLA -B27tg cells that were stimulated with curli or LPS. Conclusions: Curli s timulation appears to interact with HLA -B27-induced UPR activation to provoke a stronger pro - inflammatory response. Further characterization of the autoimmune response and assessment of the role of an inflammatory microbiome in vivo are required to provide a mechanistic link between STm biofilm infection, dysbiosis, and genetics in the ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-352-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: EVALUATING THE ANTIBIOFILM FIBROSIS -RELATED PATHOGENS Abstract Body: Background Infection of airways is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in peopl e with cystic fibrosis (CF). We evaluated the ability of a novel compound, pravibismane, to inhibit the growth of drug -resistant, biofilm -forming bacterial strains associated with chronic infections in CF or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease. Pravibismane is the first in a new class of therapeutics with a novel mechanism of action that demonstrates broad -spectrum anti -infective and antibiofilm activity. Methods The antibiofilm activity of pravibismane and comparator antibiotics was evaluated us ing the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay. Bacteria were grown at 37\u00b0C until mid -log phase after which they were diluted and aliquoted in a 96 -well MBEC plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for appropriate time for each species. During incubati on, biofilm formed on the pegs of the MBEC plate lids were placed on 96 -well plates containing 200l of antibiotic dilutions and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18h. Lastly, the peg lids were washed with PBS and placed on a third 96 -well plate with 200l growth medi um in each well to allow growth of any resistant bacteria to antibiotics. The recovery of resistant biofilm bacteria was assessed by measuring the optical density at 600nm. Results Several clinical isolates of eight microbial species were tested using the MBEC assay. Against 7 MDR clinical isolates of the Gram -negative pathogen P. aeruginosa , pravibismane consistently demonstrated the values were consistently the most potent when compared to a range of relevant antibiotic comparators against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including M.

Antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa is frequently encountered and leads to the decline of a clinical curative effect, recurrent infections, disease progression, and difficult treatment. The drug re sistance mechanism of P. aeruginosa is complex, and biofilms play an important role in its drug -resistance mechanisms. Therefore, in - depth study of biofilms is of great significance to understand and improve clinical treatment. Daphnetin (DAP), a coumarin derivative, is a safe, non -toxic, natural compound with many functions. However, to our knowledge, the effect of DAP on bacterial motility, biofilm inhibition and eradication have not been studied. Herein, the effects of DAP on biofilm formation, bacterial motility, and pyocyanin production of P. aeruginosa were studied and a theoretical basis for its development as an antibacterial enhancer is suggested. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of DAP using a P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Results: we demonstrated DAP can effectively inhibit biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in addition to eradicating its biofilm. We showed that DAP can reduce pyocyanin production and inhibit bacterial motility (swimming, swarming, and twitching). Finally, we examined the impact of DAP on P. aeruginosa growth by using the micro broth dilution method and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of DAP on P. aeruginosa was 0.890 mg/mL. Conclusions: Taken together, our results support the conclusion that DAP can effectiv ely eradicate the formed biofilm, inhibit biofilm formation, bacterial motility and pyocyanin production of P. aeruginosa and may represent a potential anti-biofilm natural product for therapeutic intervention. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: EPIDERMIDIS , ACNES IN RESPONSE TO INFLAMMATION Abstract Body: Background: Inflammatory response, facilitated by cytokine production and immune cell response, is an essential characteristic in cases of in vivo bacterial biofilm development. Often, bacterial biofilm infections continue to proliferate despite immune activity, depen ding on a host of factors involving genus, species, and strain of bacteria which often results in varying virulence factors and capacity for defense mechanisms from environmental insult. Methods: Correlations between varying biofilm growth of commensal , as well as Cutibacterium acnes , and Staphylococcus aureus , which is often also associated with pathogenic activity, are analyzed in three growth conditions. These growth condition models include an in-house bio -printed kera tinocyte model, as well as an agar plate model, and a commercially available keratinocyte and fibroblast model. Results: The capacity for immune response from keratinocytes, lack of immune intervention, and complex immune response possible through the addi tion of fibroblasts, respectively, indicate varying degrees of insult on bacterial biofilms as they grow. These models, as our research has previously proven, demonstrate varying growth outcomes for bacteria in separate stress conditions. Furthermore, transcriptomic activity of bacteria in response to commercially available models for cell-culture with physiologically relevant morphology versus more rudimentary bioprinted models, or even agar models, provides insight into the defense mechanisms of monocultu re bacterial biofilm models in response to insult from immune activity. Conclusions: Coupled with already observed variations in bacterial growth models, as well as inflammatory signaling molecule variation, this research paints a clearer picture on the me chanisms involved in biofilm growth under inflammatory stress. S. Aureus , for example, which elicits sustained increased production of interleukin 1 - alpha cytokine production, according to previous research. Statistically significant variations in genetic transcription activity then elucidates a potential response to a primary insult upon biofilm cultures characterized by immune activity, then quantifies aspects of that immune activity in select cytokine concentration, and also highlights defense mechanisms via demonstrating essential transcriptome changes. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-359-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and RESTRICTION challenges including drug resistance. Eukaryotic 26S proteasome complexes have been implicated in numerous cellular processes. We sought to investigate the role of the C. albicans proteasome in biofilm growth. Methods Candida albicans cultures were grown in yeast extract -peptone -dextrose medium. Biofilms of C. albicans were grown in 96 well plates containing RPMI 1640 buffered with 4 - morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and assessed using measurement of crystal violet st aining at OD 595nm. Microtiter plates were incubated for either 24 or 48 hours at 35oC. To address inhibition of biofilm growth, C. albicans were incubated with between 50 -300 g Streptococcus sanguinis whole cell extract (WCE) per well, varying concentr ations of the proteasome inhibitor MG -132 (Thermo Scientific). At each timepoint, biofilm cells from individual wells were harvested and used to generate whole cell extracts. WCE from each biofilm sample were then detergent lysed (Y -PER; Pierce) and total cell protein was quantitated by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Pierce). 26S proteasome activity was assessed in Candida extracts from treated and untreated biofilm cultures by measuring the cleavage of the substrate (Succ Results Incubation with 200 g S. sanguinis WCE resulted in a 55% decrease in biofilm formation by C. albicans when compared to untreated cells. C. albicans biofilms incubated with a titration of MG132 demonstrated a gradual decrease in biofilm formation, exhibiting a maximum of 60% inhibition of biofilm formation. Coincubation of bacterial whole cell extract and M G132 had an additive effect, inhibiting 70% of biofilm formation compared to no treatment. Bacterial extract -treated Candida showed a 45% decrease in proteasome activity compared to 87% inhibition by MG132. Coincubation of the bacterial extract with MG132 resulted in a 93% inhibition of proteasome activity by C. albicans biofilm cells. Conclusion Biofilm formation in C. albicans is inhibited by blocking 26S proteasome activity. The additive effect of MG132 and Streptococcal extract demonstrate that bacterial components may not only serve to inhibit C. albicans proteasome activity, but also slow biofilm growth. These results further suggest a role for the 26S proteasome in most \"expensive\" foodborne pathogens in the USA. Major listeriosis outbreaks in the past decades have been caused by listerial contamination of fresh produce, including cantaloupes, celery, mixed salads, bean sprouts and caramelized apples. W hile L. monocytogenes is expected to form biofilms on produce, our understanding of the listeria -plant biofilms remains rudimentary. This contrasts much better understanding of listerial biofilms formed on the manmade materials of food -processing equipment . The gap in knowledge about the listeria -plant biofilms may hamper our ability to prevent listerial contamination of fresh produce. Methods. Biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes on plant surfaces was investigated by using the wild -type strain, EGDe, and its derivatives that overproduce the recently discovered Pss exopolysaccharide (EPS) or are impaired in EPS synthesis. We developed a new model that involves wooden coupons and sliced produce, instead of manmade materials, and minimal, as opposed to rich, media used in previous studies. The Pss EPS role was assessed by quantifying and characterizing bacteria attached to plant surfaces, and by investigating extracellular matrix components of the Listeria -plant biofilms via electron microscopy and chemical in terventions. Results. The EPS - overproducing L. monocytogenes strain (due to elevated intracellular c -di-GMP levels) displayed strong preference for plant surfaces, as opposed to the surfaces of glass, plastics, stainless steel or aluminum. The numbers of E PS-overproducing listeria attached to wooden coupons or to cantaloupe rinds was >10 -fold higher, compared to the EPS -negative strains, after the 48 -h incubation. Several -fold higher colonization was recorded for cantaloupe flesh, celery and lettuce. Lister ia in the EPS-biofilms on plant surfaces survived desiccation significantly better than the EPS-negative strains. Electron microscopy revealed that, in addition to the Pss EPS fibers, L. monocytogenes synthesizes membranous nanotubes involved in molecular trafficking between cells. Conclusions. This study uncovered the potential of the Pss EPS to significantly enhance L. monocytogenes colonization and survival on plant surfaces. It also revealed abundant nanotubes facilitating genetic exchange on plant surf aces. These results emphasize the need for better understanding of the conditions promoting listerial EPS -based biofilms and for the development of antibiofilm strategies to increase fresh produce safety. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-366-ASM MAPPING ON EXPLANTED ORTHOPEDIC HARDWARE: A CONTINUED ANALYSIS AND FURTHER STATISTICAL REVIEW OF 31 CONSECUTIVE CASES Abstract Body: Background : Periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) are an ever -growing concern for patients receiving total joint arthroplasty's (TJA). These patients are at significant risk of developing bacterial biofilm infections at and around the surgical site. Bacter ial biofilms are specifically concerning due to their high antibiotic and immune tolerance. The location of biofilm proliferation on implant surfaces is still not well understood and this information can help to improve the manufacturing, debridement, and sterilization processes. This study attempted to map the location of these biofilms on the explant surface. Methods : To determine the location of microbial growth, an implant culturing method (ICM) known as the agar \"candle dip\" was implemented on thirty -one explants with one hundred eighteen components in total. This ICM consists of rinsing the explants and subsequently pipetting a thin layer of agar over them, followed by incubation for nine days. The explants were inspected daily for culture outgrowth an d if positive, were plated and sent for 16s rRNA sequencing. This sequencing data, along with clinical culturing, and PJI diagnosis using Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria (MSIS status) was utilized to statistically compare disparate surfaces, top ography, and materials of the explants. Results : Positive ICM results corresponded with clinical culturing at a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 57.1%. Whereas in comparison to MSIS criteria, sensitivity remained at 100% while specificity was 80%. The formation of bacterial biofilms varied from e xplant to explant; however, amongst the individual components, areas of uneven topography (ridges, edges, holes, etc.) repeatedly displayed biofilm formation. Observations of the non -articulating surface between the tibial tray and polymer insert also show ed consistent growth. Conclusions : This study successfully supplied important information about the materials and topography favorable for bacterial biofilm proliferation on orthopedic explants. This information will be useful to both TJA surgeons and impl ant hardware designers in the future, and further explorations can help to optimize these designs. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-367-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Control, Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: Altering the community composition of dental plaque biofilms using quorum quenching lactonases Abstract Body: Background: Oral pathogenic bacteria have been reported to produce and utilize small diffusible signaling molecules known as autoinducers (AI) to communicate and coordinate their behaviors in microbial biofilms associated with periodontal diseases such as dental plaque. This communication system, known as quorum sensing (QS), in den tal plaque biofilms have been previously reported to mostly rely on AI -2 molecules to regulate gene expression and modulate bacterial behaviors critical for their pathogenicity and biofilm formation capabilities. However, recent studies have discovered the presence of AI -1 molecules ( N-acyl homoserine lactones or AHLs) and investigated their roles in oral biofilm formation. We have previously isolated, characterized and bio -engineered highly stable and active AHL hydrolyzing enzymes known as lactonases that can attenuate QS, a process termed as quorum quenching (QQ), in many Gram -negative pathogenic bacteria in both mono -species cultures as well as in microbial communities. Objective: Reports of AHL mediated QS in oral biofilms are in its early stages. Most periodontal pathogens seem to rely on AI -2 based QS. The role of AHLs in the formation of dental plaque biofilms remains poorly characterized. Thus, we wished to investigate this by studying the effects of (i) QQ lactonases with varying substrate preferenc es and (ii) exogenous AHLs of varying acyl chain lengths on the formation and composition of dental plaque biofilms. Methods and Results: In this study, using microbial biosensors, we show that AHLs were detected in aerobically cultured human derived denta l plaque communities. Treatment with QQ lactonases hydrolyzed these AHLs. Subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis of the dental plaque biofilms revealed significant changes in the community composition. Addition of exogenous C6 and C12 AHLs to anaerobi cally grown dental plaque cultures altered the composition of the biofilm in a way that may explain the role of AHLs in communication among species of significance during the initiation phase of dental plaque biofilm formation. Future Directions: These exp eriments and findings are expected to further our understanding of the role of AHL mediated QS in periodontal diseases, how it is distinguishable from AI -2 mediated QS, and potential application of QQ lactonases for prevention and treatment of periodontal infections and diseases. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-372-ASM -BIO PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA MODEL Abstract Body: Background: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that has left 70,000 people worldwide susceptible to lethal bacterial infections. The most common bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , utilizes its ability to create a biofilm, making it a difficult target to eradicate wit h antibiotics. It is critical to understand the differences in gene expression between P. aeruginosa strains to better tailor eradication methods to the infecting strain in a disease specific manner. Our ex -vivo tissue model assessed the difference in gene expression from two clinical strains of P. aeruginosa , one isolated from a cystic fibrosis lung, and one from a wound. Methods: Bronchiole tissue from a healthy, freshly slaughtered pig was cut from intact lungs, and 5 mm diameter explants were created, four explants per treatment group. Half of the explants were pre -conditioned with an artificial sputum medium (ASM), and half did not receive ASM.1 Explants were inoculated with 2 L of P. aeruginosa NCTC 13618 or a P. aeruginosa clinical wound isolate (PA C3) at a 10 CFU/mL concentration and incubated for 1, 24, or 48 -hours. ASM was reapplied to 24 and 48 -hour explants during incubation. Two replicates of each group were placed in PBS or RNAlater, vortexed, and sonicated. PBS replicates were plated, incuba ted overnight, and counted at their respective time points. RNA was extracted at all timepoints from samples collected into RNAlater and RT -qPCR for target and housekeeping genes was run. Results: Both strains grew very similarly, reaching a maximum densi ty of around 8.5 log 10 CFU/explant. The pcrV gene was detected in both clinical strains, while the lasR gene was detected only in PAC3. The magnitude of gene expression change was increased when in the presence of ASM for both genes. The pcrV gene was up - regulated in NCTC 13618 and down -regulated in PAC3. The lasR gene was downregulated in PAC3. Conclusions : Our goal was to identify virulence genes expressed by NCTC 13618 and compare the expression of the same genes to the PAC3 strain. It is speculated that a mutation in the lasR gene in CF isolates accounts for the lack of lasR expression seen in NCTC 1361 8. The pcrV gene was down -regulated in PAC3 and up -regulated in NCTC 13618. This study determined that the gene expression varies greatly between clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa regardless of how similar their growth patterns are. It is critical to be prudent when choosing the strain of P. aeruginosa to make the most representative model. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-373-ASM -BIO Topic 1: Host -associated Biofilms Publishing S. aureus with mimicking Atopic Dermatitis conditions Abstract Body: Atopic dermatitis (AD), which is also referred to as eczema is a chronic disease affecting the skin of about 20% of the world's population, mostly children. Two main bacterial speci es are involved in the establishment of AD: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Usually, S. aureus is the predominant bacteria in AD while S. epidermidis is typically found on the skin of healthier individuals as part of the natural micro biota. The pathology of AD usually involves dysbiosis which involves switching of bacterial population from a predominant S. epidermidis to predominantly S. aureus . In addition, AD involves skin ceramide deficiency which aids the establishment of the condi tion in patients, being sphingosine one important component. In this work, we have been mimicking AD conditions in vitro, by growing biofilms with different inocula ratios of S. aureus and S. epidermidis both on plastic and on keratinocytes. We quantified the bacterial adhesion, biofilm development using COMSTAT and quantified gene expression relating to virulence factors. We found that S. aureus disrupts the keratinocyte barrier 24 hours earlier than S. epidermidis and that once a balance between the 2 bac terial species is reached, the gene expression relating to virulence is decreased. We also found that S. aureus is loses its susceptibility to sphingosine when in the presence of S. epidermidis , comparing to growth of S. aureus alone. Results from this stu dy are expected to lead a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and aid in the development of novel therapies to prevent or cure the disease. ---PAGEBREAK --- Control Number: 2022 -A-377-ASM -BIO Topic Biofilms of Engineered Nanoparticles on Human Gut Microbiota Abstract Body: On average, a person in the US consumes 1012 to 1014 engineered nanoparticles (NP) per day, mostly in the form of metal oxides used in food processing and packaging. These nanoparticles are widely used in packaged and processed foods their preservative, anticaking, and colorizing properties, but little is kn own about the effects of these particles on microbial populations in the human gut microbiome. The human gut microbiome plays vital and wide -ranging roles in human health, immunity, and metabolic regulation. Perturbation or dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with pathogenic states such as Crohn's disease and Irritable Bowel Disorder, as well as being implicated in colorectal cancer. In our laboratory we have developed a \"mock\" microbial community composed of four This community has been previously defined and the resident species quantified, with the four bacterial populations having been found to be both p hysiologically relevant and reproducible in this in vitro model. In this work, we evaluated the effects of four engineered nanoparticles (titanium dioxide, iron oxide, zinc oxide, and silicon dioxide), used in food processing, on human gut microbiota. Four -species biofilms were cultured to a population steady state over the course of 6 days before nanoparticle exposures. Additionally, we quantified the viability of this community when grown to population stability, harvested, and allowed to re -establish in a new well. Nanoparticles were suspended in nanopure water and sonicated to ensure even dispersal and prevent NP aggregate formation. NP media suspensions were prepared at physiologically relevant concentrations, and were applied to the microbial communiti es, and viability assayed over a 24 -hour period. Bacterial viability was quantified by qPCR, with species -specific primers used in parallel reactions. We have found that the biofilms can be re -established within 24 hours, once removed from a well, to viabi lity numbers similar to the ones found before removal. We also found that the nanoparticles used did not have an effect on the viability of the resident gut bacteria over a period of 24 hours. Despite not having an effect of bacterial viability, further st udies are ongoing to further establish whether these nanoparticles influence the biofilm microcolonies and influence the nutrient absorption of the gut, when using an invitro gut -on-a-chip model. ---PAGEBREAK --- A Static Biofilm Assay for the Assessment of Strain Variation and Complement - Antibiotic Synergism Against Non common colonising opportunistic human pathogen. It resides in the human nasopharynx causing a range of mucosal infections including chronic and acute otitis media (OM) and is frequently implicated with exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In rare cases, NTHi has also been found to cause invasive disease in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.NTHi has been shown to form biofilms which can contribute to a bacterial population's survival from both antibiotic treatment and removal fr om the body by the host's immune system. Development of a method for the establishment of NTHi biofilms will be crucial when characterising phenotypic differences and bacterial -host immune interactions. Method Early log phase broths of NTHi, isolated from different disease sites, and P. aeruginosa (positive control) were used to inoculate wells of an MBEC 96 -well micro -titre plate base and 96 -peg lid. Plates were incubated on a plate shaker at 100rpm at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. Liquid culture medium for each organism was included in each plate as negative controls and medium blanks for reading OD. The 96 -peg lid was removed and washed twice by placing the lid on 96 -well micro -titre plates with sterile water in each well. The 96 - peg lid was air dried at RT for 20 min and then placed on a 96 -well flat -bottomed micro -titre plate with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in each well and incubated at RT for 15 mins. The 96 -peg lid was washed twice and air dried as previously described and then placed on 96 -well micro -titre pl ates with 95% ethanol for 5 mins with gentle agitation before reading absorbance at A 595nm. Results 214 strains of NTHi were screened using the MBEC CV assay, with a single strain included on each plate to control for assay to assay variation. Data was anal ysed using Kruskal -Wallis and showed no significant difference between biofilm forming capacity and site of isolation. Reverse cumulative distribution highlighted a trend for an increase in biofilm formation in carriage isolates. Antibiotic sensitivity of NTHi biofilms is lower when compared to planktonic cells. Conclusions Although not significant, the data showed a great deal of variation for biofilm forming capacity within each of the isolation sites. In addition, preliminary data suggests the formation o f biofilms results in decreased sensitivity of NTHi to antimicrobial activity. Further investigation with this assay will look at complement -antibiotic synergistic -BIO Prevention and Elimination of Biofilms Publishing Title: MUCIN COATINGS ON POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE INHIBIT THE ATTACHMENT OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA Abstract Body: Background In the innate immune system of mammalians, mucins cover the epithelial tissues and prevent the colonization of microbial pathogens. Abiotic biomaterials for biomedical implants lack such protection and thus are susceptible to microbial colonization, which leads to biofilm formation and chronic infections with high-level tolerance to antibiotics. Previous studies demonstrated that mucin coatings affect bacterial colonization and the primary mucin component glycan can repress virulence gene expression in Pseu domonas aeruginosa . However, the studies to date focused on native mucins, which have limited availability and require specific storage conditions. In this study, we investigated if modification of a biomaterial with denatured mucin can also affect microbi al We coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with denatured porcine mucin (Sigma). Briefly plasma was used to activate PDMS surfaces, which were then precoated with silane to convert methyl group to porcine mucin was covalently conjugated Four and 6 h P. aeruginosa biofilms were grown on coated surfaces under static condition or with gentle shaking. Biofilms were stained with LIVE/DEAD staining and quantified using COMSTAT2 after gentl e wash to remove planktonic cells. Result Coating with mucin reduced the contact angle of PDMS from 110\u00b0 to 59\u00b0, rendering the surface more hydrophilic. Mucin coatings exhibited strong inhibition of attachment of both the wildtype P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its mucoid mutant, PDO300; e.g., by 95\u00b12% an d 64\u00b11%, respectively, compared to the uncoated control surfaces. Similar results were obtained with gentle shaking (50 rpm) that mimics attachment under flow. Discussion Besides limited availability, differences in the source of native mucin and isolation process can also cause variations in experimental results. Here, we demonstrate that coating with denatured mucin from a commercial source can also inhibit the attachment of P. aeruginosa . This coating may be applied with other biofilm control methods (e. g., active topography) to create synergies in preventing biomaterial -associated infections. ---PAGEBREAK Biofilms LYSOGENIZATION OF PATIENT DERIVED S. AUREUS BY HLB - CONVERTING BACTERIOPHAGE (SA3INT) EQUIPS BACTERIA WITH IMMUNE MODULATORY TOXINS AND FORMATION Abstract Body: Introduction: Staphylococcus aureus colonizes 30% of the human population, but only a few causes severe infection. S. aureus' virulence varies and partly depends on the presence of prophages, viral DNA embedded in S. aureus core genome, such as hlb-converting prophage (Sa3int). Exotoxins and immune modulatory molecules encoded by th is prophage can further inhibit human innate immunity increasing S. aureus pathogenicity. Aim: Investigate genomic plasticity of S. aureus and changes extracellular proteome after the acquisition of Sa3int prophage. Methods: S. aureus isol ated from the sinus cavities of a patient with severe chronic rhinosinusitis using long -read Nanopore technology. In sillico analysis showed the presence of a Sa3int prophage. Using mitomycin C, we induced the prophage, transduced it into a Sa3int -free iso late and confirmed by sequencing. We compared growth kinetics, biofilm biomass and metabolic activity between parent and lysogen by establishing growth curves, crystal violet and resazurin assays. Exoproteins were identified and quantified using mass spect rophotometry. GraphPad was used to analyse the results and was deemed significant. Results: Integration of Sa3int prophage transiently down -regulated the beta -hemolysin expression but not alter the growth kinetics, adhesion and metabolic activit y of biofilm. However, increased biofilm biomass (p=0.05, t-test). Further, Sa3int prophage acquisition significantly changed the expression of secreted proteins with a significant upregulation of 45 protein s and downregulation of 23 proteins, mainly involved in immunomodulation. Conclusion: S. aureus carrying Sa3int prophage release immune modulatory toxins that help them escape innate immunity and cause chronic infection. These findings contribute to the development of novel mechanisms that render S. aureus susceptible to the immune response by blocking prophage -associated defence mechanisms. ---PAGEBREAK --- CYSTIC FIBROSIS AIRWAY Abstract Body: Background: Chronic airway infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), despite considerable efforts to develop antibiotic treatments targeting microbes found in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway. Current literatu re shows that these chronic, persistent infections are caused by polymicrobial, biofilm -like communities. Inter -species interactions in a polymicrobial community can alter microbe behavior, such as the response to antibiotics. Furthermore, polymicrobial in teractions in the CF airway are poorly understood but are known to negatively impact outcomes observed in chronic CF lung infections. Our lab has developed an in vitro model of a common polymicrobial community found in CF sputum in order to investigate pol ymicrobial interactions in the CF lung. Methods: Our model polymicrobial system contains pathogens that have high abundance and prevalence in the CF airway: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and Prevotella spp. Using this m odel, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms that contribute to community structure in CF polymicrobial communities by conducting a genetic screen of a Streptococcus sanguinis nonredundant ordered deletion library. This screen identified mutants that show a growth defect specifically in the context of the mixed community. Results: The results of this screen indicate multiple genes involved in the phosphotransferase system (PTS), a pathway of carbon acquisition in Streptococcus spp. We have observed that PTS plays a role in protecting Streptococcus spp. from molecules secreted by other microbes in the model system. Ongoing experiments are being used to identify specific components of microbial secretions that are harmful to Streptococcus . Conclusions: We are using a newly developed polymicrobial biofilm model to expand our understanding of inter -species interactions relevant to chronic CF lung infections. Further studies will characterize the role of Streptococcus PTS in overall community structure and potentially identify new antimicrobial targets. ---PAGEBREAK --- "}
