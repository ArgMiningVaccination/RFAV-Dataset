In fact, a study by Johns Hopkins University also found the autism rate has increased over a two-year period. ASD is a complex developmental disorder that usually manifests in early childhood with no exact known cause (although a combination of genetic, environmental, and biological factors is thought to be responsible). Looking at autism from a spiritual perspective with the work of Guy Needler can shed [greater insight on the condition](/holistic-healing/love-yourself-healthy/health-yourself). Identifying and diagnosing autism Autism doesn't affect people in exactly the same ways, so it tends to be difficult to recognize the signs and symptoms. The [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Fact-Sheet) lists the [four main symptoms of autism](https://pigtailpals.com/kids/disabilities/autism/early-signs-symptoms-autism-children/) to look out for in children, including: poor communication skills, limited or no verbal skills, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. Parents who suspect their children may have autism should take them for either an autism screening, test, or evaluation as soon as possible. An early diagnosis means treatment can begin earlier. Early diagnosis and intervention have been proven essential for improving development, learning, and skills in children with autism. Autism: the soul's life plan The work of Guy Needler, an engineer, healer, and author, looks at autism from a spiritual perspective and identifies it as part of the soul's life plan. Needler puts forward that autism is the condition into which the soul chooses to incarnate in this lifetime in order to have a different experience on Earth. Additionally, people with autism typically have half a specific hybrid energy set (either rainbow, indigo, or crystal). Indigo, crystal, and rainbow children are special souls that have been incarnating on Earth since the 1940's to raise the planetary vibration after the world wars. Throughout their lives, people with autism remain partially connected to one-half of these high-frequency energy sets. Building a better world Although Needler states the condition of autism is a valuable part of the soul's life plan, in some instances, a soul may expect their body to incarnate into a different timeline \u2014 one where there's a total higher prevalence of people with autism. Since this isn't currently the case, people with autism, who are higher-frequency beings, may struggle to live, work, and fit in during their time here. For example, Needler explains people with autism don't tend to lie, steal, plot, or coerce, and are above these lower base qualities. They prefer to spend time with similar people and can also help us build a world [without these negative attributes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/202003/do-manipulators-become-less-manipulative-age). Looking at autism from a spiritual perspective can help us glean a wider understanding of the condition. It's important to realize that these are spiritually advanced children incarnating to teach us better ways of living in harmony with the planet. It's our job to make them feel loved and accepted, so they can thrive on their mission. Sally Benson is a professional freelance writer with many years experience across many different areas.
