Meet Dr. Ericka \"The Summer before Sophomore year in high school, my family was in a car accident that left me with rib pain, low back pain and severe migraines. I was only 15 years old and all the medical system had to offer me for my DAILY migraines was high-dose pain killers. As a result, after three months of suffering, our family practitioner (doctor of osteopathy) referred us to a chiropractor! This is where my life changed forever! My migraines had me bedridden, nauseated, and closed off to the world. After just ONE adjustment, my migraines went from daily to every other day, and soon were almost non-existent! As a result, just one month into care, I got my first \"job\" as a Chiropractic Assistant. By junior year I was hooked and made the world know that I was going to chiropractic school. Once I was in undergrad at University of Wisconsin-Parkside, I continued my work as a Chiropractic Assistant at a office in town. This is where I truly discovered my passion and true calling in life to serve my community through wellness care for mamas and their kiddos. Fast forward to 2014, I made the move from Wisconsin to Texas to attend chiropractic school where I graduated from Parker University in 2018 and attained post graduate certification in Webster's Technique. I have advanced training from the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association and EPIC Pediatrics, along with Logan Technique and Mastering Chiropractic with Certainty (MC2) and Tonal Pediatrics\" Marissa L. - Chiropractic Assistant Courtney, Massage Therapist Courtney has been a massage therapist for over ten years.

After a series of personal losses and persistent career demands, she gained nearly 25 pounds in less than two months. She saw specialists, hired personal trainers, went on numerous calorie restricted diets and read all the expert opinions about weight loss - but nothing worked. In fact, no matter what she tried over the next 10 years, she continued to steadily gain weight, lose energy, experience brain fog and lose interest in social connection. It was her research into effective strategies for optimizing health that led her to functional medicine & nutrition, and they transformed her life! Now, her mission is to help others find the same success. Ellen's approach is highly individualized and recognizes that all the body's systems work together, that imbalances cause disorder, and that restoring balance promotes wellness.
