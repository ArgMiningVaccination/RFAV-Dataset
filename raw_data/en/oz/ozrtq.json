I heard about it off someone who had seen this blog post [The Biggest Health Secret...](http://www.giveittomeraw.com/profiles/blogs/the-biggest-health-secret-that) Bear with the sciencey bit... Or just bypass to the end. MSM (methyl-sulphony-methane, or dimethyl sulphone) is a pure organic sulphur, a naturally occurring compound in the human body. It is a biologically available form of sulphur that's naturally found in wild, untended food. In its purified form, it's an odorless white crystal with a slightly bitter taste. In nature, MSM originates with plankton, which release dimethylsulphonium salts (sulphur compounds that are transformed into DMS in ocean water). DMS rises as a gas into the upper atmosphere where it is oxidized into DMSO and MSM in the presence of ozone and ultraviolet light. These two compounds dissolve in atmosphere moisture and return to the earth in rain or snow. DMSO and MSM then enter the roots of plants through the soil. In the plant, sulphur and other minerals are bound to carbon and further covered into an absorbable form for humans. MSM is present in meat, fish, eggs, poultry and milk, and in lesser amounts in grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables - especially onions, garlic, asparagus and cruciferous vegetables. When plants take up DMSO and MSM from the soil, they convert them into the amino acids methionine and cysteine. The two other sulphur-containing amino acids, taurine and cysteine are further synthesised in the body, MSM gives up its sulphur to form methionine and cysteine. The sulphur-containing amino acids are known to protect against the effects of radiation and chelate heavy metals for removal from the body. In his book Eating for Beauty, David Wolfe discusses the beautifying effects of MSM. He describes it as \"Producing a flame like tint in the skin and creating a subtle lustre as delicate as the halo around the full moon on a clear desert evening.\" In the body, sulphur: - Maintains cell membrane flexibility and permeability, promoting an efficient exchange of nutrients and waste products. Ensures connective tissue health and the formation of collagen. - Provides the body with raw materials needed to create new cells, to repair and replace damaged tissues and organs. - Is involved in energy production, as a component of insulin and prerequisite for normal carbohydrate metabolism. It is the vital component in the formation of keratin, collagen and elastin, giving flexibility, tone and strength to our muscles, bones, joints, internal membranes, skin, hair and nails. It is also a free radical scavenger. MSM can give a relief of swelling, inflammation and pain and symptoms of arthritis and research has shown that sufferers improved their symptoms. An adult should be able to ingest adequate MSM. In practice, it's unlikely due to mineral depletion and food processing and storage techniques. It has been speculated that the body needs higher amounts of MSM than it may get in a modern diet. The concentration of MSM in the body begins to decrease over time, so deficiency may occur as part of the aging process. - Brittle nails and hair - Scar tissue - Slow healing wounds - Arthritis - Acne or other skin disorders - Depression - Memory loss - Gastrointestinal problems - Immune disorders A number of clinical trials on MSM demonstrate its usefulness in a broad variety of applications. There is little current scientific evidence to show that MSM is effective for the range of treatments that manufacturers state. Particular benefit is to be had if a high dose of vitamin C (2000mg) is also taken alongside. I've been taking MSM for around 6 months in a dosage of one teaspoon in my morning lemon water. Within just a couple of months I noticed a distinct improvement with the length of my hair and nails and also the thickness of my nails. The skin on my face became clearer than usual and the pores smaller, I also had an additional glow to my already raw glow. MSM enhances detoxification due to making cell walls more permeable therefore allowing nutrients into the cell and most importantly, waste out. During the MSM megadose cleanse, one is to take up to 10 tablespoons of the stuff a day for two to three months! MSM is a very bitter tasting substance and I found that the easiest way to take it was to dump a tablespoon of it in my mouth and glug down some water. Not pleasant, but it's only for a short while. I managed to get up to 5 tablespoons a day. For the first week I had heaps of energy and slept for around 3 hours a night. My dreams were startlingly vivid and my creativity increased. I experienced detox symptoms such as very itchy rash on my hands (I also experienced this when I first went raw), very itchy scalp, itchy all over my body (but not as severe as my hands and scalp), four days of excessive sleepiness and my motivation levels were super low during the sleepy period. Before the cleanse I had a dark red scar on my right knee and I've noticed that it's now much paler. I stopped the cleanse as I couldn't bear the itching any more! I will take it up again in a couple of weeks and increase my intake of MSM, according to how fast my body is detoxing. I've seen positive effects from taking it and so far on my raw journey it's the most cleansing substance I've put into my body. "}
