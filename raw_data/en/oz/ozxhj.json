Mission IUPUC is a leading resource in South Central Indiana for the university-based education of its citizens through excellence in teaching, scholarship, creative activity, and service which together yield competent and motivated graduates. Reflecting the hopes and dreams of the community it serves, IUPUC aspires to be Distinguished as a destination university of choice for students seeking professional degrees or education in liberal arts and science, known for graduating students who are uniquely well-prepared for successful careers in the regional and global economies Recognized as an institution of focused academic inquiry guided by an outstanding faculty and staff who create a world class intellectual, creative, and scholastic experience in a small campus environment, and Known internationally as a uniquely creative, cost effective and nimble collaborator in the delivery of high-quality education solutions aligned with the needs of the learners and employers, and communities in South Central Indiana and beyond. Overview Established in 1970, Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC) is located one hour south of Indianapolis. While Columbus has a population of only 39,000, it is ranked sixth in the nation for architectural innovation and design by the American Institute of Architects. Visitors will find more than 60 buildings and pieces of public art by internationally noted architects and artists, including I.M. Pei, Eliel Saarinen, Eero Saarinen, Richard Meier, Harry Weese, Dale Chihuly, and Henry Moore. Columbus is also home to the Indiana University Center for Art and Design, which opened in 2011. Students and faculty IUPUC primarily serves students who live in Bartholomew, Brown, Decatur, Jackson, Jefferson, Jennings, Johnson, Ripley, Shelby, and other counties in southern Indiana, although it has begun to attract a growing number students from outside the state of Indiana. In 2011-12, IUPUC served more than 1,700 undergraduate and graduate students. Many students complete their entire degree programs on the IUPUC campus. Other students complete their first year or two at IUPUC and then transfer to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) or Indiana University's Bloomington campus to complete degree programs that are not currently offered on the Columbus campus. About 60 percent of IUPUC undergraduate students carry a full-time academic load. In comparison, 75 percent of its graduate students carry part-time academic loads. At 61 percent, the majority of itsstudents are 24 years of age or younger, although nearly 40 percent are 25 years of age or older. Nearly 70 percent of the undergraduate students are female, while males comprise nearly 60 percent of its graduate student population. IUPUC has 53 full-time faculty members, seven of whom are tenured and 19 of whom are tenure-track, as well as 125 part-time adjunct faculty. On average, they teach more than 90 online and 475 on-campus courses in Columbus each fall and spring. A small number of courses are also taught off-campus at learning centers in Seymour and Greensburg. IUPUC works closely with its educational partner, Ivy Tech Community College of Columbus, to develop articulation agreements so that students who hold associate degrees can apply those credits toward a bachelor's degree. The advantages IUPUC offers include: (1) a campus that is close to where its southern Indiana students live and work, making it geographically convenient; (2) the ability to earn prestigious IU and PU degrees in Columbus, and (3) an affordable, cost-effective alternative to relocating and/ or commuting to campuses in Bloomington, Indianapolis, or elsewhere. Degree programs Currently, IUPUC offers undergraduate degree programs in business, education, mechanical engineering, general studies, liberal arts, nursing, and psychology and two graduate degree programs (Master of Business Administration and Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling). Closely affiliated with IUPUI, IUPUC affords students the opportunity to complete general education, elective, and some major courses at IUPUC and then transfer to IUPUI to complete degrees in areas that are not available on the Columbus campus, like informatics, physical education, health sciences, tourism management, public and environmental affairs, and other academic disciplines. IUPUC graduates also enroll in graduate programs in law, medicine, and other fields at IUPUI or other institutions. In 2011, the Indiana Commission on Higher Education granted IUPUC approval to launch its second graduate program: The Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling. Students are expected to begin this program in Fall 2012. Regional focus In addition, IUPUC has a long-standing tradition of partnering with key business and civic leaders to develop educational solutions aligned with regional needs. The university received a substantial grant from Duke Energy in 2011 for a regional outreach initiative to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) teaching and learning in K-6 school districts throughout southern Indiana. Because the region IUPUC serves has a strong and growing niche in advanced automotive manufacturing, there is a growing need for professional engineers in the local workforce. To help meet that need, IUPUC launched a Purdue University Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) in 2011, making it the only university in the southern half of the state to offer a four-year degree in engineering. The new program will be fully developed2 April 16, 2012 in collaboration with faculty and staff at Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and Purdue University. With support from two private funding sources, IUPUC was also able to establish an endowed scholarship for women engineers in 2011. Although many IUPUC students begin their studies in Columbus and transfer to IUPUI or other campuses to complete their degrees, data indicates that most IUPUC graduates have deep roots in the region. The majority of its graduates have lived, worked, and raised families in southern Indiana for generations. IUPUC Programs Undergraduate Certificate Programs Certificate programs resemble minors but generally require more credit hours. Some certificate programs are stand-alone programs, which means that a student does not have to be working toward a two- or four-year degree to complete a certificate program. Specific requirements can be found in the section for the division offering the certificate. Bachelor's Degree (Baccalaureate) Programs The typical undergraduate degree program is either a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts degree. The degree takes four years for full-time students and substantially longer for part-time students. IUPUC's baccalaureate degrees are awarded in the professional divisions and within the arts and sciences. Master's Degree Programs Outstanding students wishing who wish to continue their education may begin graduate work after the completion of their bachelor's degrees. Most master's degree programs require applicants to take standardized national examinations. To be considered for admission, a four-year baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution is required. Division of Education The mission of the Indiana University School of Education at Columbus is to improve teaching, learning, and human development in a diverse, rapidly changing, and increasingly technological society. We prepare reflective, caring, and highly skilled educational practitioners and scholars who lead in their chosen professions; participate in dialogue and inquiry into school change; and work in partnership with a range of constituents to improve teaching and learning at the local, national and international levels. To serve the region in which it is situated, the IUPUC Education Programs focus on Learner Centered Education within the context of a professional community and facilitate post-secondary investigations into the teaching profession. Students will recognize the interdependency of professionals within the educational community and will come to regard teaching as a complex, multidimensional act that requires many different types of knowledge, interactions, behaviors and decision-making abilities. Degree Programs Initial Licensure: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education K-6 (REPA) K-6 Dual Licensure Options: Computer Technology English as a New LanguageReading Special Education Middle School Content Coursework Options for Additional Licensure: English/Language Arts Mathematics Science Social Studies Undergraduate Degree Programs Division of Business Division of Continuing Studies Division of Education Division of Liberal Arts Division of Mechanical Engineering Division of Nursing Division of Science University College Center for Teaching and Learning Other Areas of Study Division of Business The Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus Undergraduate Program in Business provides opportunities for breadth of education as well as for a reasonable amount of specialization. Consistent with the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) perspective, the school subscribes to the principle that a significant portion of a student's academic program should be in general education subjects, complemented by study in the basic areas of business administration. This assures the planning of balanced study programs while enabling a student with an interest in one or more of the professional areas of business to specialize in those fields. Courses and assignments expose students to ethical decision making, diversity, corporate social responsibility, and international business. Bachelor of Science Degree Programs Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Concentration in Accounting The accounting curriculum prepares students for careers in corporate accounting, auditing, management consulting, taxation, and accounting for governmental and nonprofit organizations. In addition, it equips the future business executive with tools for intelligent analysis, planning, control, and decision making. The accounting curriculum helps students prepare to pass the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam and Certified Management Accountant (CMA) exam, and provides an excellent foundation for students who want to pursue graduate work in business, public administration, or law. Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Concentration in Finance As the most common professional background among the CEO's of the Fortune 500 (Stuart Scott, 2011), Finance as a body of knowledge allows students and practitioners to understand the value of business activities, and how to decide which activities to pursue. Finance as an academic concentration explains the connections between business activity, societal utility, money, and the capitalApril 16, 2012 3 markets. Every day, business managers, investment managers, bankers, and individual investors around the globe make choices about buying, selling, or holding assets and liabilities, and the field of Finance comprises the study of how these resources are best allocated and managed. Knowledge learned in the area of Finance allows a business manager to understand how to measure the value of their resources, providing a basis for the manager to invest in business projects, to manage debt, or to reward shareholders with a dividend. Concepts learned in finance will apply to business management, investment management, and personal financial acumen. Financial analysis and study will involve other areas such as marketing, forecasting, risk assessment, and psychology. Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Concentration in Management Society recognizes the importance of understanding both management itself and the complex nature of the organizations\u2014in business, government, hospitals, and universities\u2014in which managers operate. The faculty is concerned with improving this understanding through the study of strategic management, organizational theory, and human resource development. The undergraduate courses offered in this major are concerned not only with the broad aspects of management and organization, but also with developing skills for dealing with problems of a global business environment and the increasingly complex problems of human resource allocations. Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Concentration in Marketing The study of marketing concerns all activities related to the marketing and distribution of goods and services from producers to consumers. Areas of study include customer behavior, the development of product offerings to meet consumer needs, pricing policies, institutions and channels of distribution (including retailers and wholesalers), advertising, selling, sales promotion, research, and the management of marketing to provide for profitable and expanding businesses. The marketing curriculum endeavors to provide the business community with broadly trained men and women who can approach problems with a clear understanding both of marketing and of the interrelationships between marketing and other functions of the firm. Students planning careers in marketing management, advertising, sales, sales management, retailing, wholesaling, marketing research, or distribution normally major in marketing. Minors Business A minor in business can be a valuable addition to any major. The study of business will help you in your roles as a citizen, consumer, and employee. It will accentuate your decision-making skills, help you understand and improve processes, give you the tools to manage people, and broaden your perspective in the workplace beyond your role as an individual. A business minor can be particularlyworthwhile for students who may someday hope to run their own business. Division of Liberal Arts A liberal arts education begins with the premise that one's world and one's self are at the core of the pursuit of knowledge. It leads to viewing the world from more than one perspective and learning something about its social, cultural, intellectual, and spiritual dimensions. Those different perspectives within the liberal arts encompass two major groups of academic disciplines: the humanities, which explore the history and experience of human culture; and the social sciences, which examine the social and material foundations of human life. Regardless of the perspective, the focus in the liberal arts is on knowledge itself, on both its substance and the tools for pursuing it, on what is known and what is worth knowing. Skills for acquiring and generating knowledge, as well as the preservation of knowledge, are contained within the School of Liberal Arts curriculum. The following liberal arts programs are jointly offered by IUPUC and IUPUI. Successful IUPUC students automatically have access to specialized courses on the Indianapolis campus required for graduation. Anthropology Anthropology is the study of human culture, biology, and social interaction across time and place. It includes the archaeological investigation of past and present human material culture; ethnographic study of contemporary cultures around the work and in the United States; research into human evolution and the origins of human physical diversity; and analysis concerning the origins, structure, and social use of language. Communication Studies Communication studies is an integral part of the liberal arts. The curriculum focuses on communication theories, methods, and competencies from a variety of contexts: rhetorical symbolism, public address, organizations, family, health, media, and theatre. The department offers a diverse curriculum for majors, minors, and service courses for other departments and units within the university. Students learn about the communication process inherent in the areas of interpersonal, group, organizational, public, and media studies. Communication course work assists students in enhancing their critical inquiry, oral performance, media and message design, problem-solving, and relational conversation skills. A foundation is provided for graduate work in various areas of communication studies, humanities, and/or social science and in professional programs such as law, business, health, and social work. Course work also assists those students pursuing career fields that apply communication principles: public relations, marketing, video or film production, corporate media production, training and development, human resources, public affairs, and special events planning. English The English major is an exciting journey into the study of language, literature, and our culture. The major is divided into six different concentrations: Creative Writing, Film Studies, Linguistics, Literature, Writing and Literacy, and Individualized Studies. Many of the courses required for4 April 16, 2012 a major in English with a concentration in Literature or Creative Writing are available at IUPUC. See the listing of degree programs (majors and minors), and the list of degree requirements and course descriptions for a more detailed view of the options in English. Geography Geographers study the connections between the landscapes they see and the forces that shape them. No matter what they're studying - a deceptively fragile rainforest, the silent diffusion of a disease, or the creeping sprawl of a suburb - geographers ask three basic questions: (a) Where are things located? (b) Why are they there? and (c) How do they interact with the world around them? Where, why, and how: three commonplace interrogatives that help chart a path through the maze of places and processes, change, and continuity that give our world its hues, tastes, and sounds. Where the historian sees order in the past, the geographer seeks a rationale for the location of things in their place. History A history major makes a fine foundation for a career in politics, activism, law, or journalism. Many students find the stories of the past\u2014whether they involve ancient Greece or modern Africa\u2014to be an exciting field of study. If that's you, be prepared for lots of critical thinking and a great deal of research\u2014because historians are good at digging up information, remembering it, and finding patterns. Philosophy Philosophic inquiry aims, ultimately, at a general understanding of the whole of reality. It draws on the insights of the great historical philosophers, on what has been learned in all other major fields of study, and on the rich perspective embodied within our ordinary ways of thinking. Philosophers address a diverse array of deep, challenging, and profoundly important questions. Examples include the nature of the self and of personal identity; the existence or nonexistence of God; and the nature of such phenomena as time, mind, language, and science. Political Science Politics is about power: who has it and how it is used. The study of political science provides students with an understanding of the many different and intriguing ways in which power is given, taken, distributed, limited, manipulated, and used, and helps them better appreciate and understand the many different forms taken by systems of government around the world. Religious Studies The discipline of religious studies offers students opportunities to explore the patterns and dimensions of the many different religious traditions of the world from the perspectives of the academic study of religion. The courses are designed to help students develop basic understandings of the many ways in which religions shape personal views of the world, create and sustain the communities in which we live, and interact with politics, economics, literature and the arts, and other structures of society. Sociology Human beings are social animals. We live in groups and do most things with other people. Much of what we think,say, and do is influenced by what others expect of us and by how others treat us. Sociologists study the patterns of interaction between people in all sorts of settings: at work, at play, at home, etc. They try to clarify what is going on, what lies behind it, what is likely to come from it, and what might be done differently. Their theories and research findings can provide insights into processes and events that affect us in our everyday lives. Perhaps you have wondered why some families get along fine while others seem mired in problems, why some people get involved in criminal careers while others resist temptations, why some companies are much more productive than others, why some government programs succeed while others backfire. These are the kinds of issues sociologists look into in systematic ways. Visit the IUPUC website to view degree requirements for the Division of Liberal Arts. Division of Nursing The IUPUC Division of Nursing is a part of Indiana University School of Nursing, the largest school of its kind in the nation and one of the most respected multi-program nursing schools in the world. Our Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is designed for students who wish to enter nursing for the first time. The RN to BSN option is designed especially for Registered nurses (RNs) who hold an associate degree (ASN) or a nursing diploma. Degree Programs Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) RN to BSN Hybrid Option Division of Science Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science in Psychology Psychology is a science that studies behavior and mental processes, including perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Understanding human behavior is essential for improving the quality of life of individuals and improving relationships within and between societies. There are many areas within psychology and many types of psychologists. Although about half of all psychologists work to help people with psychological problems, others seek new knowledge or apply their understanding of psychology to solve problems and improve the way things work. Research psychologists seek new knowledge using the scientific method to describe, predict, and understand behavior and mental processes. For example, developmental psychologists study how infants acquire language skills, psychobiologists investigate how brain function influences drug addiction, and social psychologists study how peer pressure influences decisions. Research psychologists often teach in colleges and universities. Applied psychologists use psychological principles to help change behavior and solve real-world problems. For example, school psychologists help children adjust academically and socially, industrial/organizational psychologists suggest how companies can improve employee morale, human factors psychologists determine the best place to put gauges in an airplane cockpit, and clinical psychologists help people change their thoughts and behaviors to relieve anxiety or depression.April 16, 2012 5 Some applied psychologists also teach in colleges and universities and some engage in research. Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science Degree Requirements Certificates IUPUC offers a certificate in Case Management and a Certificate in Substance Abuse Counseling and Prevention. These certificates, which can help students prepare for positions as Case Managers and Substance Abuse Counselors, are available to students whether or not they are majoring in psychology. Case Management Certificate Requirements Substance Abuse Counseling Certificate Requirements Division of Continuing Studies The Bachelor of General Studies Degree (BGS) reflects the commitment of Indiana University and the state of Indiana to meet the educational needs of adult citizens.

For students who have completed Core 40 with a C average or higher in all Core 40 courses, SAT combined math and verbal (critical reading) combined scores should be 900 or higher; ACT composite should be 19 or higher. Applicants who have earned Academic Honors diplomas will be considered fully qualified regardless of test scores; however, scores must be provided. We recommend that all high school students complete the following: four years of English; three years of mathematics (including second year algebra), three years of social sciences; three years of laboratory science; four years of additional college preparatory courses selectedfrom English, mathematics, social sciences, laboratory sciences, or foreign language. Returning adult students should note that SAT or ACT scores are not required and, although a high school transcript is required, the admissions committee also considers such things as military experience, life experiences, and job responsibilities when reviewing applications. Conditional Admission If you do not meet the above criteria, you will be considered for conditional acceptance based on other factors that will indicate your potential for success at IUPUC: overall quality of your high school course work, work experience, maturity, and military service. If you have significant deficiencies in either academic preparation or performance, we will defer your acceptance until you complete designated courses at Ivy Tech or another two-year college. A deferral contract outlining the courses to complete will be sent to you. GED Admission Requirements Students enrolling at IUPUC who have not attended college after earning a GED are considered beginning freshmen students. The following are the admission requirements: Earned the GED with a score of 53 (530 on new scale) or higher. If your GED score is below 53 (530), you may be deferred to the Community College of Indiana. (See above section on conditional admission.) If you are under 19 years of age, you must provide the results of an ACT or SAT I test. Visiting Students during Summer after Graduation Students graduating from high school may enroll at IUPUC as a visiting student for the June summer session. As a student applying under this status, you must do the following: Verify with the Admissions Office of the institution you will attend in the fall that they will accept the course credits. Submit an IUPUC application as a visiting student. Submit a copy of your high school transcript and test scores. Submit a copy of your letter of acceptance. Submit the application fee. Note: 1.Visiting students are not eligible for financial aid, according to federal regulations. 2.If admitted, you must complete IUPUC placement tests in mathematics and/or writing. These must be done before you can register for classes. 3.You may apply only for the June semester and you are encouraged to do this no later than the end of May. Qualifications 1.If you will attend IU Bloomington, IUPUI, or Purdue West Lafayette in the fall, provide a photocopy of your letter of acceptance. A high school transcript is not necessary. You will be offered acceptance based upon proof of your acceptance to either campus.April 16, 2012 9 2.If you are attending any other college in the fall, provide a high school transcript and SAT/ ACT scores. Beginning in March 2005, students taking the SAT I or the ACT must take the essay component and have all scores reported to IUPUC. You must meet our admission requirements for entering freshman. To apply under either of these please complete the application through admissions . Transfer Admission and Qualifications Transfers from Other IU Campuses Students who are eligible to transfer to IUPUC as degree candidates from another campus of Indiana University must meet the degree requirements of the IUPUC division from which they expect to graduate. Students who plan to obtain a degree from another campus should contact and remain in contact with the dean of their prospective school for specific information on course, degree, and residency requirements. A student at another Indiana University campus, whether coming to IUPUC on a temporary or permanent basis, should contact the IUPUC Office of Admissions for help in beginning the intercampus transfer process . If a student has earned college credits after leaving the IU campus, the student must provide an official transcript and contact the IUPUC Admissions Office, requesting that the new courses be evaluated for transfer credit. If a student at another Indiana University campus is not in good standing and wishes to attend IUPUC, he or she should contact the IUPUC Office of Admissions for an explanation of the procedures. Transfers from Other Purdue Campuses A Purdue University student from another campus must complete an official undergraduate application through the IUPUC Office of Admissions. If credits have been earned outside of Purdue, an official transcript from the non-Purdue schools must be provided. An application fee does not need to be paid. Note: Courses with grades from C- to D from other Purdue campuses will appear on the IUPUC transcript. The grades are not calculated in a student's IUPUC GPA; however, individual divisions and programs may choose to use the courses to satisfy degree requirements. Transfers from Other Universities A student from any other college or university must complete an official undergraduate application through the IUPUC Office of Admissions. Applicants are required to provide official transcripts from all post-secondary institutions they have attended. Transfers from Universities with Articulation Agreements IUPUC has increasing numbers of articulation agreements with Ivy Tech Columbus and other Ivy Tech campuses that permit courses taken at Ivy Tech to transfer to IUPUC with a grade of C or higher. Effective dates for each course are listed, but no courses completed prior to the fall 1990 semester will transfer.Passport to IUPUC Passport to IUPUC is a program created by Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC) to facilitate the transfer of Ivy Tech State College Columbus courses and associate degree credits toward several IUPUC baccalaureate bachelor's degree programs. The Passport program makes it easy to continue your education and become an IUPUC student. IUPUC offers transfer students two categories of undergraduate admission (degree-seeking and visitor). Degree-Seeking Students If you wish to enter an undergraduate certificate, associate, or bachelor bachelor's degree program, you will apply as a degree-seeking student (even if you are unsure of which degree program). Admission Standards General Policy For regular admission you must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and be eligible to return to your previous college. If you do not have a 2.0 or you are not eligible to return to your former school, you must sit out for one regular semester*. Summer sessions do not count. If you have been dismissed twice, you must be out of school for two full semesters. Please mail a statement with your application explaining what caused the low grades and how you will approach your studies at IUPUC. Admission on Probation If your grade point average is below 2.0, you will be considered for admission on probation provided you have met or are meeting the required time out of school. In some cases students with a GPA below 2.0 will be required to file a petition and/or complete an interview. After reviewing your application, the Undergraduate Admissions Office will advise you if you must take these steps. We encourage you to apply at least three months in advance of your proposed starting date. Credentials needed: Official college transcript from every college attended. An official copy is one that has the embossed or raised seal of the school. Fax copies, photocopies, and grade reports are not considered official. High school transcript or GED if you have fewer than 26 hours of transferable work. (We will accept a faxed high school transcript provided it is sent directly from the high school with the school fax number on the faxed pages.) Please note that you are responsible for mailing the request to your former colleges and paying whatever fee is charged. Purdue students and Ivy Tech Indianapolis students do not have to order transcripts; however, if you have attended other colleges, you must request those transcripts. Transfer Credit The grades from all course work previously completed are considered in the admission process. Most divisions require a minimum GPA of 2.0 to be considered for admission; some divisions have a higher GPA requirement. Other factors may also be considered, including space available in the program, the specific10 April 16, 2012 course work completed, recent grades, and disciplinary standing. Course work done outside of the IU system with grades of C (2.0) or better are transferred for possible use toward an IUPUC degree. No courses with grades of C- or lower will transfer to IUPUC. None of the grades transferred from other colleges or universities count in the IUPUC grade point average. Some divisions, however, may consider such grades for admission purposes and other academic matters. How accepted credit is applied to program requirements is determined by the division and/or department that offer the course(s). Courses that were completed 10 years ago or even more recently may not be accepted in some programs and must be approved by the individual division awarding the degree. Course work taken at another institution for which there is an equivalent Indiana or Purdue University course (in terms of course description, level, and prerequisites) will generally be transferred as credit in the equivalent courses. Other course work will be transferred as undistributed and reviewed by the appropriate division to determine how it will be counted toward degree requirements. In addition, the university does not accept the transference of special credit by examination awarded by another college or university. Courses taken at another institution on a quarter system rather than a semester system will be evaluated as carrying fewer credit hours (e.g., a 3 credit hour course taken on a quarter system will transfer as 2 credit hours). Visiting Students If you are working on a degree from another institution and wish to take courses at IUPUC, apply as a visiting student. You are responsible for verifying that your home institution will accept the course credits. Your permission to enroll is for one term; however, an admissions counselor can authorize enrollment for additional terms if you are completing your final courses for a degree or if you are in the area on an internship or co-op program. You are not eligible for financial aid as a visiting student. If you wish to enroll in mathematics or English courses, you must either have completed a transferable (non- remedial) college course in that academic area or you must complete the IUPUC placement tests. Students at Other IU Campuses Students working on degrees at other IU campuses who wish to register for courses at IUPUC one semester should complete the VISITING intercampus transfer online through admissions . Required Credentials and Qualifications Must be a current college student (enrolled within the last 12 months). If you have not enrolled within the past 12 months, provide a letter from either the dean or your academic advisor at your home institution stating that you have permission to transfer credits from IUPUC to the degree program. Provide a photocopy of your most recent grade report or transcript. Have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. (Purdue students are eligibleregardless of grade point average provided they are not on drop status.) International Students The best guide to international admission standards and procedures is the \"International Undergraduate Application for Admission.\" This pamphlet is revised annually and contains an application form, financial support agreement form, estimated tuition and living expenses, English language proficiency requirements, detailed instructions, numbers to call, and relevant deadlines. The Office of International Affairs Web site ( www.international.iupui.edu ) provides information on admissions for international undergraduates and graduates, links to the online applications, downloadable and printable application and financial support agreement forms, and links to Web sites of other offices. Admission Requirements The admission requirements for students hoping to enter an associate, bachelor bachelor's, or certificate program as either a beginning or transfer student are described below. Depending upon the admission requirements of their desired programs, students will be considered either for admission to University College or for dual admission to University College and the division of their intended program. Regardless of the admission category, beginning undergraduate students and most undergraduate transfer students will have the benefit of the University College Orientation program. Primary and Secondary Education Beginning undergraduate applicants should have completed the primary and secondary education system of their own country. The U.S. primary and secondary education system consists of 12 years of study. IUPUC expects that applicants from other countries will have studied for a similar number of years in primary and secondary school to be eligible for university admission. Pre-primary education is not included in this total number of years. However, applicants from countries with at least 11 standard years in the primary and secondary system may be considered if they have achieved a strong academic record and can submit the final, official school- leaving certificate. Applicants applying from abroad are expected to have reached their 18th birthdays no later than the end of their first semester of study here. Applicants from countries with more than 12 years of primary and secondary study may qualify for advanced standing. Secondary school programs should have included study of a student's native language, English or other foreign languages, mathematics, natural and/or physical science, humanities, and social sciences. General Certificate of Secondary Education Applicants from British-style systems must have earned at least six GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education)\u2014or their equivalents\u20140-level passes, including passes in English and mathematics. GCE (General Certificate of Education) Advanced A-level results may be considered to yield credit for advanced standing where the grade earned is D or higher.April 16, 2012 11 Students with 0-level certificates who do not meet the minimum age requirements are encouraged to continue their studies to earn A-level certificates prior to applying to IUPUC. When to Apply You may apply as early as one year in advance of your proposed enrollment. If you file an application with all required credentials and the application fee by the priority date, you will receive full consideration for the semester requested. If admitted, you will be invited to an early orientation program during which you will register for classes. Priority date Term June 1 Fall November 1 Spring March 15 Summer I May 1 Summer II Academic Advising New and transfer students with less than 12 transferable credit hours receive their initial academic advising during orientation. Students with 12 or more transferable credit hours, returning students, and students from other IU campuses receive academic advising from their academic division. University College advisors provide advising services to undergraduate students who have not yet been admitted to their degree program as well as to students who are undecided about their program. For contact information visit http://www.iupuc.edu/universitycollege/ contacts/. Preparing for Advising Sessions Elements of an Undergraduate Degree Scheduling Tools and Information Developmental or Refresher Course Work First-Year Seminars or Learning Communities General Education Requirements/Introduction to Majors Undecided and Exploratory Options Preparing for Advising Sessions Students are ultimately responsible for their own success. Students need to prepare themselves by understanding their degree requirements. University College and division advisors can provide tools and advising that aid students in making wise choices in the types and numbers of classes to take. Visit University College or your division advisor for helpful hints on preparing for an advising appointment. Elements of an Undergraduate Degree Basic to planning a college education, rather than just semester-by-semester picking of classes, is an understanding of what components make up a college degree. Most four-year college degrees are made up of about 40 courses. These courses generally are 3 credit hour courses, though some are 1, 2, 4, 5, and even 6 credit hour courses. Each hour of credit generally means four hours of academic work (i.e., one hour per week in class plus three hours of study time outside of class), though in some programs, especially in the sciences,there are additional credit hours for laboratory or recitation work. Courses fall into three categories: general-education requirements, major or concentration requirements, and electives. The exact courses that may be used in each of these areas vary according to the program of study. First-year students generally begin with a learning community, general-education courses, and introductory courses in their majors. Courses required for college degrees are often sequential (that is, they build on the content, concepts, and skills learned in lower-level courses). As a result, most schools number their courses 100, 200, 300, and 400 to indicate the order in which students should take the courses. First-year students should generally take courses in which the first number in the course number is either a 0 or 1; occasionally, first- year students might take a 200-level course. Some courses require students to take prerequisites or lower-level courses before enrolling in the higher-level courses. Prerequisites are listed in the course descriptions in this bulletin. General-education requirements and the specific major requirements are listed in school sections of this bulletin. University College advisors also have checksheets of requirements for the different degree programs. Electives, generally five to ten courses depending on a student's program, are usually taken during junior or senior year. Scheduling Tools and Information IUPUC provides a number of resources for students to conduct their work with the university. OneStart (onestart.iu.edu ) allows students to review information about themselves, including the status of an admission application, the status of a financial aid application (and any award), their latest course schedule, book list, bursar account (fees owed or refund due), unofficial transcript, as well as information about a federal tax law that may result in an income tax credit tied to tuition paid in a calendar year. Students may also update address information through OneStart. In addition, students and the public may review course offerings for current and upcoming semesters via OneStart. The OneStart system is not intended to replace regular meetings with an academic advisor. Students planning their schedules should also consult the degree requirements in this bulletin, the IUPUC Web site or the appropriate checklists provided by their advisors. The Registration Guide is available every March for summer and fall classes and in October for spring classes. Developmental or Refresher Course Work If placement test results indicate that a student needs more work or a refresher in reading, writing, or mathematics, the student will be required to take these classes first. The basic skills of reading, writing, and calculating are building blocks to most other college classes. Advisors will assist students in selecting a balanced schedule with refresher courses as well as regular college classes when appropriate. In general, students will not be certified to move into their schools until they have successfully addressed any skill deficiencies they may12 April 16, 2012 have. Students who have been conditionally admitted to IUPUC may be required to participate in an academic support program prior to enrolling in courses. First-Year Seminars or Learning Communities National studies have shown that successful first-year students need five elements: an introduction to campus resources and support services, the creation of a support network (which is especially important on a commuter campus), ongoing personal interaction with faculty and staff, the development of skills and habits basic to academic achievement, and a realization of the high expectation that the campus has for each of its learners. IUPUC has developed learning communities, including First-Year Seminar courses, and is dedicated to achieving the objectives spelled out above. Often these First-Year Seminars are linked with another course so that the students in the seminar can work together across classes to learn the material and otherwise support one another. The team approach of faculty members, librarians, advisors, and student mentors provides students with in- depth knowledge and contacts for key elements of the campus. General-Education Requirements/ Introduction to Majors Beginning students will also be advised to start on the general-education requirements for the program(s) in which they are interested. These classes may include communication skills, natural and mathematical sciences, social and behavioral sciences, or arts and humanities, depending on the division or program. Particularly if students are attending full time, they will be encouraged to enroll in the introductory course or courses in their program of study during the first or second semester of enrollment. These are usually 100-level courses. Undecided and Exploratory Options Some students come to IUPUC uncertain of what they want to study, in part because they do not know all their options, and because they are unsure of their own strengths. They want to remain undecided until they explore all their options and feel more certain of their interests. \"Undecided\" and \"exploratory\" students receive special counseling to allow them to explore possible programs of study. Taking introductory courses in different fields often helps students make up their minds or determine their aptitude or interest. The advisors may urge students to go to the College and Career Exploration Center to investigate career options or take tests that will reflect the students' areas of interest. There also are courses specifically focused on helping students make career choices. This is a healthy process. Exploring possible options early in a college career is common and far better than changing direction in the junior or senior year. Financial Aid & Scholarships The IUPUI Office of Student Financial Aid Services coordinates the financial aid program on behalf of IUPUC. All policies, procedures and guidelines enforced atIUPUI are also applicable for IUPUC students and can be viewed via the following links. Questions regarding financial aid policies and procedures can be emailed to financialaid@iupuc.edu or by calling the Enrollment Center at (812) 348.7231 to schedule an appointment with a Financial Aid Advisor. The FAFSA code for IUPUC is E01033. Types of Financial Aid Eligibility Aid for Graduate/Professional Students Satisfactory Academic Programs Scholarship Information Types of Financial Aid Federal Pell Grant IUPUC 21st Century Scholars Grant Loans Work Study Scholarships Child of Disabled Veteran Summer How to Apply for Financial Aid What is the FAFSA? The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is used to apply for grants, loans, and work-study. In addition, it is used by SSACI for consideration of their grants and awards. The student may file the FAFSA electronically at www.fafsa.ed.gov , or he or she may submit a paper copy to the processor. To award financial aid to students, IUPUC must receive the student's FAFSA data. IUPUC's school code is E01033. Please note that the information is received by IUPUC quicker if the student applies electronically (online). This method also decreases the number of errors that might occur. Once the FAFSA is processed, the information is electronically sent to the school(s) listed on the FAFSA. In addition to the information being sent to the school(s), a paper copy of this information is sent to the student. The form the student will receive is called a Student Aid Report (SAR). The student should receive his or her SAR within 4 weeks from the time the FAFSA was submitted. When the student receives the SAR he or she should review the information to make sure it is correct. If the student needs to make corrections he or she should submit the changes to the federal processor. Completing the FAFSA and applying for student financial aid is FREE. Students should be wary of mailings or web sites that offer to submit their application or to find money for school if the student pays them a fee. Generally, any information or service paid for can be obtained for free from IUPUC or from the U.S. Department of Education. When should a student submit the FAFSA? The FAFSA must be submitted EACH year the student is applying for financial aid. The form is available January 1st of each year. For priority consideration, the student must file the form by March 1st of each year. If a student files after the priority deadline, he or she will still be considered for federal aid, which may include grants, loans, and work- study employment.April 16, 2012 13 What is the Renewal FAFSA? If the student applied for federal student aid last year, he or she may qualify to use a Renewal FAFSA. The Renewal FAFSA is usually mailed in November or December. The Renewal FAFSA has fewer questions to answer. Most of the information on the form will be filled in already and will be the same as the information the student gave the previous year. Additional resources regarding financial aid application are available through the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships online. Satisfactory Academic Progress A students academic progress is carefully monitored throughout each semester. Please remember a student may be required to pay back all or a portion of any financial aid received should a student adjust his/her enrollment status during a semester. Please visit Student Services for financial aid counseling or call 812-348-7231. Students may also email financialaid@iupuc.edu for assistance.

Aid for Graduate/Professional Students Graduate Students The types of financial aid available to graduate students include loans and federal work study from Federal Title IV programs and scholarships. A small number of graduate students qualify for fee credits from SSACI. Please visit our office at CC156 for aid counseling or call 812-348-7231. Students may also email financialaid@iupuc.edu Eligibility The federal government determines a students financial aid eligibility by evaluating the information submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Financial aid is available in the form of grants, loans, and work-study employment. The FAFSA priority deadline to qualify for State financial aid is March 10. The federal school code for IUPUC is E01033. It is important for students to list the IUPUC school code on their FAFSA to ensure processing for financial aid at IUPUC. It is recommended that all students file their FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov . To qualify for financial aid a student must enroll in a degree program and be in good academic standing. While there is no minimum enrollment to receive a Pell Grant, the federal government requires a student to enroll as a half time student (six credit hours as an undergraduate student or four as a graduate student each fall and spring semester to be eligible for student loans or work-study employment. (The State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana (SSACI) requires eligible students to be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours each fall and spring semester and to review their FAFSA each year by March 10 to receive these funds.) A student's academic progress is carefully monitored throughout each semester. Please remember, a student may be required to pay back all or a portion of any financial aid received should the student adjust his/her enrollment status during a semester. Please visit Student Services for financial aid counseling or call 812-348-7231.Students may also email financialaid@iupuc.edu or visit the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships online. for assistance. Graduation Requirements Applying for Graduation Candidates for graduation initiate the certification process by filing an Intent to Graduate form with the advisor of their division at least one year prior to their expected graduation date. Purdue degree candidates must register for CAND 991 as noted in the Registration Guide. Details concerning the application deadlines of specific divisions and any additional requirements related to graduation are available from the advisor or the division sections of this bulletin. Completion of Degree Requirements When students contact the advisor about graduation, they should double-check that they in fact will have completed graduation requirements. The \"My Degree Progress\" option in the self-service area in OneStart shows which courses students still need to take and whether all transfer work has been entered. Some divisions perform degree audits either when students file for graduation or at the beginning of their senior year. Students should go over audits with their advisors to make sure they are accurate, and contact the division advisor with questions. Common mistakes that result in a student's failure to graduate are unacceptable grades and not registering for necessary courses, dropping courses during the last semester, or otherwise failing to complete required courses. Students may graduate with incompletes on their record, provided they are not for required courses. Residency requirements also affect graduation eligibility. Required Grade Point Average In addition to completing all the required course work, students must have a specific overall grade point average and a specific GPA in their program to graduate. Most divisions also require grades of C or higher in program courses. Students should familiarize themselves with the policies of their program. Orientation University College, in conjunction with the divisions, requires all beginning and transfer students with less than 12 transferable credits to attend an orientation program. At orientation, students receive an overview of campus resources, receive information about the divisions/program in which they are interested, receive success tips from current IUPUC students, meet with an academic advisor, register for classes, and have their photo taken for their student I.D. card. Students must obtain their technology account before attending orientation. Technology will be covered during one portion of the orientation program. Students are required to pay a New Student Enrollment Fee that is assessed to all students who are beginning their first semester in a degree-seeking program. The fee is not contingent on participation in the orientation program. Placement Testing A student's academic career begins with placement testing, followed by attending orientation. The placement test results indicate the student's level of preparedness16 April 16, 2012 and the proper or recommended course placement in writing and mathematics. Mathematics Placement Testing All beginning students must complete the COMPASS Mathematics test. Transfer students who have received credit for IUPUC math courses, including MATH 001, 11000, 11100, M118, M119 or any calculus course do not need to take the mathematics placement test, if the course was completed within 5 years. The mathematics placement scores are valid for two years from the test date. Click here for detailed mathematics test information including sample questions: Compass Mathematics Test English Placement Essay The English placement test requires students to write a short essay that takes, and supports, a stand on a social issue. The essay determines which of the two writing courses is the best place for students to begin their college writing career. Students who plan to enroll in ENG-W 130, the lower-level of the two beginning English courses, are not required to write the placement essay, but are welcome to write it to help determine whether ENG-W 130 is the best placement. ENG-W 130 does not count for most degree programs but is required of students who place into it. On the other hand, ENG-W 131 is a required class for graduation. Students are eligible to register for ENG-W 131 if at least one of the following criteria is met: student has an SAT critical reading score of 500 or higher, or student received a grade of D- or better in ENG-W 130 or student's placement test result recommends placement into ENG-W 131. Transfer students who have received credit for ENG-W 130 or ENG-W131 do not need to complete the English placement essay. For more information on placement testing, see the Placement Testing Web site at www.iupuc.edu/ students/ placement_testing.asp . Continuing students obtain their placement test results through their academic advisors. Placement test results are given to new students at orientation. If students have not taken the placement tests or their results are not available, they are limited to a restricted list of courses that do not require placement tests. Placement tests in math and English are administered at no cost to the student. Additional resources Testing for Students Whose Native Language is Not English/English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement Testing Accommodations for Placement Testing Testing for Students Whose Native Language is Not English/English forAcademic Purposes (EAP) Placement Testing All new students\u2014graduate and undergraduate\u2014whose native language is not English are required to take the ESL placement test prior to registration. This test is administered by the IUPUI Testing Center on behalf of the English as a Second Language Program. All international students from non-English speaking countries as well as U.S. permanent residents and others referred by the Office of Admissions take the ESL placement test in lieu of the English Placement Test that native speakers of English are required to take. Accomodations for Placement Testing Students who need accommodation because of disabilities or need special equipment, extended time, or tests taken in separate rooms\u2014whether for placement testing, orientation, or for actual classes\u2014must contact the Adaptive Educational Services (AES) Coordinator before or at the same time they schedule placement tests. Since registering with AES and providing them with documentation takes time, as does the arrangement of services, students must contact AES (812)314-8539 as soon as possible before classes start. External and National Testing For more information regarding External and National Testing, please visit IUPUI's online site. Registration Registration Waitlisting Enrollment Permissions and Holds Dropping or Adding Classes (Schedule Adjustments) Partner Locations Fees Waitlisting Occasionally, students will be turned away from a class section because it is filled to capacity. Seats may open up, however, if registered students drop the class during the registration period. Through an automated waitlisting system, the first person to make a waitlist request for a class is placed at the top of the waitlist. When a seat opens up, that person is registered automatically for the course. For more information, check the Registration Guide or visit the Web site registrar.iupuc.edu . Enrollment Permissions and Holds An advisor's approval for a student to register does not guarantee enrollment in a particular class; it only authorizes that the student is eligible for enrollment that term. Divisions may restrict enrollment in particular courses, so students should review the course descriptions in this bulletin or view course listings online through OneStart to see if they fit the requirements. For instance, some courses, such as upper-division courses in business, are open only to students officially enrolled in certain divisions. Other courses may be restricted to students with sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate student status. Finally, some courses require aApril 16, 2012 17 student to have completed one or more courses prior to enrollment (known as \"prerequisites\"). Otherwise ineligible students who believe their personal preparation overrides the restrictions may seek the division's or instructor's permission to enter the class. On occasion, students have a hold placed on their enrollment. When this occurs, they cannot register for courses because they have failed to meet some requirement of the university or division and cannot proceed until the problem is resolved. Problems that result in a hold include having a grade point average below the required level or failure to pay tuition or other fees. Students with unpaid library fines, outstanding parking tickets, or with a disciplinary problem also may be placed on hold. Students can review their status on OneStart, and if they find they have such a hold, they should contact the office(s) listed to resolve the problem. For more information about holds, students may contact the department or division involved or the Office of the Registrar at 812.347.7287. Dropping and Adding Classes Students can make changes in their schedule, commonly known as add and drop. Students may add courses from the time of their initial registration up through the end of the first week of classes via Onestart. After the first week of classes, students may add courses only with a paper Schedule Adjustment form and the instructor signature. Students may drop courses from the time of their initial registration through the last day of the automatic W period using Onestart. After the automatic W period, the student may drop a course with a Schedule Adjustment form with instructor signature and instructor designation of W or F; this option ends on the last day for withdrawal for the semester. After the last day for withdrawal, students may only make adjustments to their schedule using a schedule adjustment form and obtaining signatures from the heads of the division offering the course; this option may only occur in rare situations with documentation from clergy, legal representation, or the equivalent. Students receiving financial aid should be aware that dropping a course may change the amount of aid for which a student is eligible and may require that the student repay some of the money already received. Students must drop classes officially; to stop attending a class or even to never attend the class does not cause the student to be dropped from the class. Failing to attend class does not mean a student has dropped a class but rather will result in an F in the course. Failing to pay for the course once registered and not attending will result in both an F and a bill for the course. After the middle of the semester, students need the instructor's signature in order to drop a class. Dropping classes is done online through OneStart or by using the Schedule Adjustment forms, which are available at the Office of the Registrar. If using a form it must be filled out, signed, and returned to the Office of the Registrar, Room 156M. While withdrawals do not change a student's GPA, withdrawals may trigger the federal government's definition of \"not making academic progress\" and may result in the loss of eligibility for certain types of aid. Contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships formore information about Satisfactory Academic Progress at http://www.iupuc.edu/financialaid/contacts/ . Check the Academic Calendar page , found on the Office of the Registrar web site, each semester for exact drop/ withdraw and refund dates. You may also contact the Office of the Registrar at 812.348.7287 or online. Registration Process Registration for first-time students takes place in conjunction with orientation. In subsequent semesters, students may register themselves using Onestart. Information about registration is available in the Registration Guide, online at the Office of the Registrar . The Schedule of Classes is also available online at the Office of the Registrar . Students may contact their academic advisor for assistance with registration or questions regarding degree requirements. It is vital that students keep both local and home addresses and phone numbers up to date with the university. In some cases, local and home addresses are identical, though some use their parents address as their home address. Students can change their addresses online through onestart.iu.edu. Addresses may also be changed by completing an address change form, available in the Office of the Registrar. All students are issued university e-mail addresses. It is the responsibility of the student to learn how to access their university e-mail and to check it frequently. Many university offices correspond with students and share announcements only through university e-mail accounts. IUPUC Courses- Partner Locations IUPUC offers courses in surrounding communities through the Jackson County Learning Center and the Greensburg Community Learning Center . Courses are provided to assist students in furthering their education while staying in their community. We offer courses that apply toward degree programs and certificates. For more information, contact the Office of the Registrar at (812)348-7287. Fees IUPUC tuition is set annually by the Trustees of Indiana University. Current fee information appears in the Registration Guide, available online, and the rules that determine whether students are residents or nonresidents for fee-paying purposes are available online as well. Undergraduate programs and most graduate/professional programs charge by the credit hour. In addition to tuition, there are some special course fees for equipment or supplies; all undergraduates are assessed technology and student activities fees. New students are charged a New Student Enrollment Fee. The semester parking fee is optional, and books and supplies are additional. Various payment options are described in the Registration Guide. See bursar.iupuc.edu for more information, including current fees. Students whose financial aid or loans have not yet arrived may qualify for automatic aid deferments through the Financial Aid Office. As long as students have anticipated aid listed on their OneStart account, they only need to pay tuition and fees in excess of the amount of anticipated aid listed. If the anticipated aid has not been credited by the second due date of the semester, it is the student's18 April 16, 2012 responsibility to resolve his or her issue with the financial aid office or personally pay the balance. Students are not removed from classes for failing to pay their bills. If a bill remains unpaid and the student does not withdraw during the refund period, he or she is still responsible for the unpaid tuition and fees regardless of attendance or grade received. If the student withdraws, the bills will be adjusted accordingly, only if the withdraw occurs during a refund period. It is, therefore, critical that students check with the Bursar or monitor their accounts via OneStart to determine whether they received financial aid.

Bachelor of Science in Business Program Philosophy The undergraduate program for the Division of Business is focused on doing two things especially well: 1.Providing students with personal attention to their academic careers that is uncommon at the university level. This includes attention to the quality and effectiveness of students' learning environments. 2.Pushing the pedagogical envelop for integration of basic business knowledge and skills. Driving these is an underlying proposition that we serve our students best by helping them develop as business managers (rather than as business specialists). Concentrations complement business management studies and help students develop their individual interests and target specific careers. Requiring one half of our program's credits in general education creates a much- needed balanced academic experience and connects business to the broader issues at work in a global society and business environment. This philosophy is reflected in the structure of the B.S. in Business: Basic Skills General Education Business Fundamentals Integrative Core (I-Core) International Dimension Upper Level Courses Functional Concentrations Student Learning Outcomes and Performance Criteria The Division of Business has adopted as its program learning outcomes the Principles of Undergraduate Learning (PULs) in place for all undergraduate programs at IUPUC and IUPUI.

Boot Camp We've transformed the traditional prerequisites into an intensive, smart Boot Camp. The advantage for you is, once admitted, direct entry into the M.B.A. program after a two-week workshop that targets the content and skills needed to be successful as a graduate business student. Based on the overall weight of their academic background, some students may be asked to delay application to the program until further work at the undergraduate level is completed. M.B.A. Admissions To be considered for the IU M.B.A. Columbus program, you need to have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution (or an equivalent international institution). An undergraduate business degree is helpful, but not required. In fact, our current students and alumni have brought with them a wide range of quality undergraduate degrees outside of business. Your application to the program will consists of several items: A completed application form, available below for download. Submission of scores from the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) taken within the past five years. Submission of official transcripts from any institution of higher education at which you have studied. Submission of a 500-word essay (about two pages, double-spaced) based on one of three topics we provide (See \"Application Instructions and Explanations\" below). NOTE: Some international students may also be required to submit scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . Application Documents Visit the IUPUC M.B.A. website for current application instructions and deadlines. Application Deadlines Application Deadlines The M.B.A. Program at IUPUC starts new student cohorts every fall semester. Application deadlines are usually March 1 for international students and May 1 for all M.B.A. applicants. Please visit the program web site for current details: IUPUC M.B.A. website What We Look For Our admissions decisions rest on three pillars of evaluation: 1.Academic Performance: Your GMAT, GPA, and quality of undergraduate institution and program are combined into a metric to rate academic potential. There is no minimum GMAT or GPA; the combination is what matters. We weigh GPA slightly more strongly, however. 2.The Whole Person: Your resume and essay are significant considerations for admission. TheseApril 16, 2012 33 items help us evaluate the experiences you might bring to the cohort, and the communication and critical thinking skills necessary to both succeed in graduate business studies and manage well in an organization. Professional work experience is not required, though many of our students have at least a few years of such experience. 3.Dynamics and Diversity of the Cohort: Finally, because we target small cohorts, it is important to us to consciously consider each student as a contributor to cohort dynamics and diversity. For example, IU MBA Columbus has always had a strong international element to it, in large part because we have students from several countries. And while most of our students have several years of professional experiences, often in technical fields such as engineering, we also value the fresh perspectives of quality students with little professional experience but who often bring an entrepreneurial flair to the cohort.

To accomplish this, graduate business faculty and staff rely heavily on these three activities: 1.Designing and delivering a curriculum that integrates graduate level content and skills into learning experiences that more closely resemble how real business is practiced by the general manager. 2.Creating operational processes and policies that are student-centered. 3.Actively engaging business and community leaders. Student Learning Outcomes and Assessments The Division of Business has adopted five program learning outcomes for the IU M.B.A. Columbus program. These five connect directly to the four Principles of Graduate Learning, in draft form, expected to be adopted soon by IUPUI/IUPUC. Upon completion of graduate business studies at IUPUC students should be able to demonstrate: 1.General Management Knowledge, Skills and LeadershipDemonstrate an ability to use cross-functional knowledge and skills to effectively manage projects and operations. Participate productively in groups and teams, and demonstrate contributions to team goals. Demonstrate a capacity both to lead others to achieve organizational goals and to support effective leadership. IUPUI/IUPUC PGL addressed: Demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to meet disciplinary standards of performance, as stated for each individual degree. 2Effective Communication Communicate complex analyses, recommendations, strategies, and visions in ways that lead to clarity of purpose and effective decision-making. IUPUI/IUPUC PGL addressed: Communicate effectively with their peers, their clientele, and the general public. 3Critical Thinking Demonstrate an ability to apply cross- functional knowledge and skills to analyze problems, prioritize issues, and develop effective responses. Demonstrate an ability to apply cross- functional knowledge and skills in unfamiliar, or unexpected, situations in order to adapt to change and develop innovative responses. IUPUI/IUPUC PGL addressed: Think critically and creatively to improve practice in their field. 4Ethical Thinking and Decision-Making Establish a set of ethically valid professional values and demonstrate how those values apply to situations and trade-offs business managers may confront. IUPUI/IUPUC PGL addressed: Meet all ethical standards established for the discipline. 5Management in a Social Context Identify strategic stakeholder issues and frame decision-making within the social, political and cultural contexts of local and global communities. M.B.A. Curriculum The modular format allows us to more easily integrate knowledge, skills, exercises, cases, and your overall learning experience. It is the themes of the modules that guide content and instruction, as we increasingly break down the walls of the traditional course structure. Module 1: Organizational and Strategic Development Two issues critical to your work in the program and development of your management savvy. Understanding your managerial profile and its role in the strategic nature of organizations. Module 2: Enterprise Structures Business enterprises are governed in part by the economic realities of the competitive markets in which34 April 16, 2012 they act and the information those markets feed back to managers. As a result, good managers understand the accounting structures that help track business performance, the information systems needed to keep decision-makers intelligent, and the economic drivers of their business. Module 3: Global Perspectives and Human Resources Business managers have always needed to be people who understand, and can organize and motivate, other people. They've also always needed to be aware of the wider world around them. Today, both of these issues have become acutely important and fused. The really effective business managers today embrace human resources from across-cultural, global perspective. Module 4: Analysis and Decision Making Finance, marketing and operations taught as managers actually experience these disciplines in the firm as interrelated, problem-solving functions. Module 5: Innovation and Application Module 5 immerses students in the facets and culture of entrepreneurship, while confronting them with a team- based consulting project in the service of a regional non- profit organization. Module 6: Managing and Leading Last summer and last semester in the program is a time for reflection from the vantage point of genuine business leaders and synthes is in the capstone competitive strategy game.

They are not \"disruptive conduct\" as long as they do not impinge upon the rights of others or interfere with the teaching/learning process in an academic setting. As a community which values the uniqueness of people, behavior which is thought of as \"different\" or \"unusual\" is not \"disruptive behavior\" unless it infringes upon the rights of others or seriously interferes with the teaching/learning process in an academic setting. The IUPUC instructional program is based on the premise that students enrolled at IUPUC are entitled to receive instruction free from interference by other students. When students are admitted to IUPUC, they accept the responsibility to conform to all IUPUC rules and regulations. Students are expected to comply by conducting themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner.Academic Level Information about credit hours applies to several areas: the quantity and other factors that determine Class Standing, how many credit hours are required for Full-time vs. Part-time , and credit hour Load Limits for a term. Academic Probation Academic Probation Policy for Continuing Students Students are placed on probation any time their cumulative GPA falls below their division or program GPA of good standing. Individual divisions and programs vary in their policies. Contact individual programs for further information on probation. At IUPUC, a 2.0 cumulative GPA is the minimum necessary to be considered in good academic standing. Students below this GPA are not making progress toward degree completion and are subject to dismissal from the university. Students whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 will be placed on probation. Students will be informed by letter of their probationary status. Students may be continued on probation when their semester GPA is above a 2.0 but their cumulative GPA is below a 2.0. Students will be removed from their probationary status once their cumulative GPA is above 2.0. Academic Probation/Dismissal Policy for Beginning Students This policy applies to all beginning students who enroll in 12 or more credit hours their first semester at IUPUC. Beginning students (those admitted with less than 12 credit hours of transfer credit) who attempted 12 or more credit hours (including Ws) must have obtained at least a 1.0 GPA at the end of their first semester or they will be dismissed. This includes students whose first semester is summer. Students who withdraw from all courses are exempt from this policy. Beginning students that receive between a 1.0 and a 2.0 GPA the first summer will be placed on probation in accordance with the policy for continuing students discussed above. Students who are dismissed for the first time must sit out for a minimum of one fall or one spring semester before being eligible to petition for reinstatement. Students dismissed two or more times must remain out of school for at least two consecutive (fall and spring or spring and fall) semesters before being eligible to petition for reinstatement. Students must petition by the established deadlines to be considered for reinstatement. Reinstatement is not automatic. This policy was ratified by IUPUC Faculty Senate on February 8, 2011 Dismissal Students may be dismissed from their division or program if they fail to meet academic or professional standards. The student will be informed of the dismissal in writing by the division head or the division head's campus representative.April 16, 2012 39 Academic Dismissal Policy for Beginning Students This policy applies to all beginning students who enroll in 12 or more credit hours their first semester at IUPUC. Beginning students (those admitted with less than 12 credit hours of transfer credit) who attempted 12 or more credit hours (including Ws) must have obtained at least a 1.0 GPA at the end of their first semester or they will be dismissed. This includes students whose first semester is summer. Students who withdraw from all courses are exempt from this policy. Students who are dismissed for the first time must sit out for a minimum of one fall or one spring semester before being eligible to petition for reinstatement. Students dismissed two or more times must remain out of school for at least two consecutive (fall and spring or spring and fall) semesters before being eligible to petition for reinstatement. Students must petition by the established deadlines to be considered for reinstatement. Reinstatement is not automatic. This policy was ratified by IUPUC Faculty Senate on February 8, 2011 Academic Dismissal Policy for Continuing or Returning Students Some factors considered when continuing or returning students are dismissed are failure to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 (IUPUC's GPA of good standing) or the division's GPA of good standing after being placed on probation, a lack of progress toward the degree requirements in the judgment of the faculty, or a lack of acceptable ethical or professional behavior. Students who have completed a minimum of 12 IUPUC/IUPUI grade point average (GPA) hours are subject to dismissal if they fail to attain an overall GPA of at least 2.0. Continuing and returning students should check with their academic division for specific information about the dismissal policy of that division. Reinstatement Students who are dismissed for the first time must sit out for a minimum of one semester and petition by the established deadlines to be reinstated. Reinstatement is not automatic. Students' chances of reinstatement will be enhanced by the student removing grades of incomplete, undertaking assessment of their academic problems, participating in career workshops, and providing evidence of their ability to do successful academic work upon their reinstatement to IUPUC. Students dismissed more than once must remain out of school for at least one full year and petition by the established deadlines to be reinstated. Readmission after a second dismissal is extremely rare. Students' chances of reinstatement will be enhanced by the length of time the student has been away from the university, successful academic course work completed at other accredited institutions, military service, participation in career workshops, and providing evidence of their ability to do successful academic work upon their reinstatement to IUPUC. Individual divisions may refuse to readmit students on the basis of their academic records.Students already enrolled in and even attending classes will be administratively dropped from those classes and their money returned if they are dismissed. Full-Time, Half-Time, Part-Time Student Status Information about credit hours applies to several areas: the quantity and other factors that determine Class Standing, how many credit hours are required for Full-time vs. Part-time , and credit hour Load Limits for a term. Grade Appeals Grade Changes On occasion, students inquire about the possibility of changing a grade. This may be because the student believes there was an error in the calculation or assigning of the grade or the student failed to officially withdraw in a timely fashion. Policy on Consideration of Requests for Change of Grade after Conclusion of the Course These policies apply to undergraduate students only. Any requests by graduate students for change of grade after the conclusion of a course are subject to the policies of the academic unit. This policy refers to requests for change of grade, grade discrepancies or grade disputes following the conclusion of the course and not requests for withdrawals after the conclusion of the course. Undergraduate units will not consider petitions for change of grade from concluded courses older than 5 years. Academic units may choose to use a shorter time period than the campus limit. Academic units may make an exception only if an extremely serious and documented circumstance (e.g., coma, unmanageable schizophrenia, etc.) literally prevents the student from filing the petition within the 5-year period. Other options, such as grade forgiveness, grade replacement and probationary readmission are possible alternate methods that students can use to continue their education. For the situation where a student believes there was an error in the calculation or assigning of a course grade it is the responsibility of the student to contact the course instructor to discuss the grade and make his or her case to have the grade changed. If the course instructor declines to support the student's request for a change of grade or in situations where the instructor cannot be contacted, the student may appeal the course grade following the procedures established by awarding academic unit. Requests for change of grade after the conclusion of a course will be honored only to correct a mistake or error in calculating or assigning the course grade. To facilitate this process, the Office of the Registrar shall maintain a Change of Grade Petition document. The Change of Grade Petition shall require course information, a provision for the student to make a personal statement explaining why she or he believes the grade should be changed and a provision to include supporting documentation. Decisions on grade changes are made within the schools. If the request is supported, the school will notify the Office40 April 16, 2012 of the Registrar of the new grade and the student will be mailed a notification of the grade change, including a new cumulative GPA. For this reason it is important that students keep their addresses current. If the request is denied, students will be so notified by the school. Approved by IUPUI Faculty Council December 5, 2002 Process The student may appeal the grade following the process established by each school. This usually includes completion of a Change of Grade Petition . The form should be completed online, printed, and returned to the Office of the Registrar. The Change of Grade Petition requires course information (course title, semester taken) as well as provides the student the chance to make a personal statement explaining why she or he believes the grade should be changed. Please note that individual schools may impose a deadline beyond which they will not consider requests for changes of grade for a particular semester. If the student's performance or withdrawal was medically related, the student should provide appropriate supporting documentation. Only persons with a need to know will see any confidential materials you may submit. Decisions on grade changes are made within the schools.

Grade Replacement Policy The IUPUC Grade Replacement Policy (formerly known as the FX policy) was revised effective fall 1996. This policy allows approved undergraduate students seeking their first degree to repeat courses\u2014a maximum of 15 credit hours subject to division approval\u2014in order to improve poor grades, including grades of F. If a student earns the same or a higher grade after repeating the course, only the second grade will be counted in the cumulative GPA. Replacement does not happen automatically, so students must notify the division advisor that the course has been taken a second time and that they wish to exercise this option. Certain restrictions apply, and the grade replacement policy may not be honored by some divisions when considering admission to the division or in computing graduation honors. For more information, students should contact their division. The 15-credit-hour limit includes any course(s) previously replaced using the FX policy. A student may exercise the Grade Replacement Policy no more than two times for a single course, and once invoked, a student may not reverse the grade replacement granted in a particular course. The replaced grade will be excluded from the cumulative GPA, but the course and the replaced grade will remain on the student's academic record with a notation indicating that the grade exists but is excluded from the cumulative GPA. The use of the forgiveness policy does not preclude a student from using grade replacement for course work taken subsequent to re- enrollment as defined by the forgiveness policy.If the original course was taken on another IU campus, that campus must be willing to place the replacement flag on the course at IUPUC's request. Not all IUPUC units accept the general policy as stated above. If a student changes programs, divisions, or campuses to a program that does not recognize the Grade Replacement Policy, the original grades will once again be averaged into the student's GPA. Graduation Associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees are conferred in December, May, and August each year. Commencement Day Ceremonies, held in Indianapolis and Columbus, occur in May each year. Present on the stage in Columbus are the Vice Chancellor and Dean of IUPUC and the Division Heads of IUPUC. The IUPUC, IU, and Purdue Alumni Associations induct their graduates into their respective associations and provide them with an introductory membership. Additional information regarding the ceremony, including date and time, is available at commencement at IUPUC . Reinstatement On occasion, students are dismissed from IUPUC or another IU campus due to poor academic performance. After sitting out for some time, students can apply to be reinstated. Read below to find out more about submitting a reinstatement petition. Please note that this is the reinstatement petition to University College at IUPUC. If you were dismissed from another division (e.g., Education, Business, etc.) you will need to contact that division to inquire about their reinstatement procedures. Do not use this petition. 1.Reinstatement will be the decision of the UCOL Probation/Reinstatement Committee. 2.Students who are reinstated will be classified as probationary students until their cumulative GPA is 2.0. During the first semester after being reinstated, the student must achieve a semester GPA of at least 2.3. In each subsequent semester on probation, the student must achieve a semester GPA of 2.0. Failure to meet the semester GPA requirement will result in dismissal. IUPUC University College policy is that students whose cumulative GPA is below 2.0 and they have been dismissed from any IU campus, must sit out for a minimum of one semester (fall or spring) and petition by the established deadlines to be reinstated. Students who have been dismissed two or more times, must sit out for a minimum of one full year before petitioning for reinstatement. University College does not reinstate for the summer sessions. Reinstatement Deadlines Fall semester: June 1st Spring semester: October 1st No exceptions will be made for these deadlines. Academic Dismissal Reinstatement Fee IUPUC will assess a $55.00 fee to students who have been dismissed for academic reasons and who wish toApril 16, 2012 41 return to University study. The fee will be assessed at IUPUC at the time an appeal is submitted. Students may pay by money order or check payable to \"IUPUC\". IUPUI Policy on Returned Checks: www.bursar.iupui.edu/ returnedchecks.htm Reinstatement Petition Petition Repeating Courses If a student repeats a course, it will only be counted once toward graduation or electives in the program, though the grades will be calculated in the overall GPA. Exceptions are variable topics courses, internships, or some other courses that can be taken more than once for credit. Courses repeated under the grade replacement policy may be excluded from the overall GPA. See the individual division's section of this bulletin to determine any restrictions on use of grade replacement. Transfer Credits IUPUC's Transfer Credit Policy As part of your application review, the Office of Undergraduate Admission will review courses taken at other colleges and university and determine where transfer credits can be awarded. In order to have your transcripts formally reviewed, you must first apply for undergraduate degree-seeking admission, and submit official transcripts from each school you have attended after high school. If you have received college credit while still attending high school, you still need to submit a transcript from the college awarding the credits. Most often, IUPUC will transfer credits into the university from another college or university if there is an equivalency course offered on our campus. When an equal course is not available,the course may either be transferred in as a undistributed elective, or a decision may be made that there is no transferable credit. IUPUC and IUPUI is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA-HLC), and in order to transfer credits from another institution, IUPUC requires that the student received at least a grade of \"C\" or better and that the school to be regionally accredited. When a school is not regionally accredited, we may transfer up to 15 hours of general education coursework only; however, this is not automatic, there are several other criteria those courses have to meet in order for them to transfer as undistributed credits. Transfer, Test, and Special Credit Courses accepted in transfer from other institutions are listed under the appropriate headings. No grades are awarded and the course numbers and titles reflect Indiana University equivalents. Transfer hours and quality points are not reflected in the cumulative grade average, nor do they appear in the \"Hrs Earned\" field. The total number of transfer hours on the record does appear in a separate transfer hour category in the grade point average summary. A course suitable for credit which does not parallel an Indiana University course at the campus of evaluation may be designated by a course subject followed by \"UN\" and a number indicating an equivalent Indiana University course (class) level. Forexample, HIST-UN 200 represents a 200 (sophomore) level History course. Applicability of accepted transfer credit toward a particular degree is determined by the Indiana University school or division offering the degree program. Credit awarded as a result of placement tests, credit by examination, or successful completion of a higher level course may be reflected as Special Credit with a transcript note or may appear as separately designated \"Test Credits.\" See the appropriate division for more detailed information. Transfer Credit Limits Generally, no more than 64 credit hours earned in accredited junior or community colleges can be applied toward a degree. See the appropriate division for more information regarding transfer credit limits. Undergraduate Policies Academic Level Academic Probation Appeals Dismissal GPA Grade Replacement Graduation Reinstatement Repeating a Course Student Status Transfer Academic Policies & Procedures Required Grade Point Average In addition to completing all the required course work, students must have a specific overall grade point average and a specific GPA in their program to graduate.
