GENERIC NAME: FENTANYL [WARNING: ] [Fentanyl](https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl_transdermal_system/article.htm) has a high risk for abuse and severe, possibly fatal, [breathing](https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm) problems. Do not use transdermal patches unless you have been regularly taking moderate to large amounts of narcotic [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) medication. Otherwise, it may cause overdose (even death). The risk for harm is higher if you use the wrong dose/strength, or if you use it along with other [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) that might also affect breathing. The risk for breathing problems might also be higher when you start this medication and after a dose increase. Get medical help right away if you notice unusual slow/shallow breathing. Do not use this medication to relieve mild, short-term, or sudden [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm) (such as due to [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm)/ [migraine](https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm), dental/medical procedures), or pain after surgery (including same-day surgery when you do not need to stay in the hospital overnight). This medication is not for occasional (\"as needed\") use. Since they are not used the same way, different forms of [fentanyl](https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl-injection/article.htm) (including lozenges, buccal tablets, patches) do not have the same effects at equal strengths and should not be substituted for each other. Tell your doctor or pharmacist of all medications that you use, especially of drugs that can affect how [fentanyl](https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl-oral_lozenge_cancer_pain_only/article.htm) works (see also [Drug Interactions](https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_interactions/article.htm) section). Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines you are using without your doctor's approval. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for using [fentanyl](https://www.medicinenet.com/fentanyl_tablet_-_buccal/article.htm) transdermal patches. The patches are for use on the skin only. Raising your skin/body temperature, using cut or damaged fentanyl patches, or using the patch improperly (such as by chewing it) may cause fatal overdose. Avoid increasing your skin temperature at/near the application site by using products such as heating pads, electric blankets, hot tubs, heat lamps, or tanning lamps. Avoid taking hot baths and sunbathing. However, you may bathe, shower, or swim while wearing the patch as long as you avoid hot water. Keep this medicine in a safe place to prevent theft, misuse, or abuse. This medication is not recommended for use in children younger than 2 years. Some manufacturers recommend that this product should not be used in children younger than 18 years. If a child accidentally swallows this drug, get medical help right away. [USES: This medication is used to help relieve moderate to severe ongoing pain (such as due to ] [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm)). Fentanyl belongs to a class of drugs known as narcotic (opiate) analgesics. It works in the brain to change how your body feels and responds to pain. [HOW TO USE: See also Warning section.Read the Medication Guide and, if available, the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start using this medication and each time you get a refill. Learn how to properly use, store, and discard the patches. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Before you start using this medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should stop or change the dose of your other narcotic medication(s). It may take up to 24 hours before you have pain relief from fentanyl patches. For added pain relief, your doctor may direct you to also take quick-acting narcotic or non-narcotic pain medications (such as ] [acetaminophen](https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm), [ibuprofen](https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm)). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about using fentanyl safely with other drugs.Apply this medication to the skin as directed by your doctor. Do not apply on [burns](https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm), [cuts](https://www.medicinenet.com/cuts_scrapes_and_puncture_wounds/article.htm), irritated skin, or skin that has been exposed to [radiation](https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm) (x-ray treatment). Select a dry, non-hairy area on a flat part of your body, such as the chest, sides, back, or upper arms. In young children or in people unable to think clearly (such as due to [dementia](https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm)), apply the patch on the upper back to lessen the chance it might be removed or placed in the mouth. If there is hair on the skin, use scissors to clip the hair as close as possible to the skin. Do not shave hair since this might cause skin irritation. If needed, use water to clean the area. Do not use soap, oils, lotions, or [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm) on the application site. Dry the skin well before applying the patch.The patch is usually changed every 72 hours. To avoid irritation, apply to a different area each time. Be sure to remove the old patch before applying a new patch. The used patch still contains enough fentanyl to cause serious harm, even kill a child or pet, so fold it in half with the sticky sides together and discard properly. Do not let children see you apply a patch, and do not apply the patch where children can see it. Children have found patches that have fallen off or removed patches on sleeping adults and put them in their mouths or on their bodies with fatal results. (See also Warning section).Do not use the patch if it appears to be broken, cut, or damaged. Remove from the sealed pouch, peel off the protective liner, and apply immediately to the skin. Press firmly in place with the palm of the hand for 30 seconds, making sure the contact is complete (especially around the edges). If your prescribed dose is for more than one patch, make sure the edges of the patches do not touch or overlap. After applying the patch, wash your hands with water only.If you have problems with the patch not sticking at the application site, you may tape the edges in place with [first aid](https://www.medicinenet.com/first_aid/article.htm) tape. If this problem persists, ask your doctor for advice. If the patch falls off before 72 hours, a new patch may be applied to a different skin site. Be sure to let your doctor know if this happens.If you accidentally touch the sticky layer to your skin or handle a cut or damaged patch, wash the area well with clear water. If the patch comes off and accidentally sticks to the skin of another person, immediately remove the patch, wash the area with water, and get medical help for them right away. Do not use soap, alcohol, or other products to wash the area.The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Do not apply more patches than directed, change them more frequently, or use them for a longer time than prescribed.This medication may cause withdrawal reactions, especially if it has been used regularly for a long time or in high doses. In such cases, withdrawal symptoms (such as restlessness, watering eyes, [runny nose](https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm), [nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm), [sweating](https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), muscle aches) may occur if you suddenly stop using this medication.

Primary bone cancer that arises in bone cells is different than metastatic bone cancer, which is cancer that arises in another part of the body and then spreads to the bones. Hereditary and environmental factors likely contribute to the risk of bone cancer. Signs and symptoms of bone cancer may include pain, the presence of a mass or lump, and bone fractures. There are different types of bone cancer (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, fibrosarcoma). Treatment for bone cancer may include surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, radiation, and/or a stem cell transplant. The prognosis for bone cancer depends on the type of cancer and the extent of spread. CancerCancer is a disease caused by an abnormal growth of cells, also called malignancy. It is a group of 100 different diseases, and is not contagious. Cancer can be treated through chemotherapy, a treatment of drugs that destroy cancer cells.

As a consequence, food and secretions do not empty normally from the stomach. Gastroparesis symptoms are nausea and vomiting; abdominal bloating, and pain can result. Labor and DeliveryEarly and later symptoms and signs of labor and delivery are unique to each woman. Early signs of labor are \"lightning\" and passing the mucus plug. Later symptoms and signs that labor that labor is are the woman's water breaking, and when contractions begin. There are three stages of labor, stage 1 is the longest and occurs when the cervix begins to thin and dilate. During stage 2 of labor the baby passes through the birth canal and remains there until delivery, and stage 3, is when the baby is delivered. Liver CancerLiver cancer is cancer of the liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma) or of the ducts in the liver (cholangiocarcinoma). Liver cancer often arises due to liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring) caused by alcohol use/abuse, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Liver cancer may not cause any symptoms. Liver cancer is diagnosed with blood tests, imaging tests, and a liver biopsy. Treatment for liver cancer may include surgery, ablation, embolization, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Lung CancerLung cancer kills more men and women than any other form of cancer. Eight out of 10 lung cancers are due to tobacco smoke. Lung cancers are classified as either small-cell or non-small-cell lung cancers. Pain ManagementPain management and treatment can be simple or complex, according to its cause.

Pancreatic cancer has been called a \"silent\" disease because early pancreatic cancer usually does not cause early symptoms. Typically, pancreatic cancer has metastasized (spread to adjacent organs, such as the liver) by the time most people receive a dignosis of pancreatic cancer. Symptoms and signs usually appear later in the course of the disease and include jaundice, back pain, nausea, weight loss, itching, and loss of appetite. Treatment depends upon the type of pancreatic cancer but may include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. 15 Ways to Reduce PainChronic pain can be a symptom of many conditions, including arthritis, headaches, and others.
