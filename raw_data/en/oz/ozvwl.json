Let me give you an example, I will use hay fever as its something most of us can relate to. Your sensitivity to pollen is the reason your cells react by releasing histamine when they come into contact with it. It is the release of histamine which results in your symptoms. So if you weren't sensitive to pollen then you wouldn't suffer from hay fever. Let's admit it we all know people who are fine in a field of flowers and those who seem to sneeze from looking at a photo of a dandelion! The pollen doesn't change, its the persons sensitivity that does, by using the pollen as a homeopathic remedy then the persons sensitivity reduces. The same principle can be used to desensitise you to food, environmental and industrial chemicals. Often clients come to me saying they haven't felt the same after an illness or after taking medication. Homeopathic detox can be used to help the body regain its full health after exposure to such substances. The key to homeopathy really is the individuality of the therapy ensuring that you get the treatment you require rather than a \"one-size "}
