Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation b. Results in persistent disability or incapacity c. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect d. Is another important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalisation, but is considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardise the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Clarifications of the SAE definition: 1) An event is life-threatening if its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 2) An event is serious if it is not appropriate to administer treatment in a physician's office or an outpatient setting, and it requires hospitalisation. An event is also serious if it prolongs hospitalisation. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalisation\" occurred or was necessary, the event is considered serious. 3) Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not an AE. 4) Disability is a substantial or significant disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. 5) The investigator may deem as an SAE any other important medical event that did not result in any of the outcomes listed in this section due to medical or surgical intervention Business rules Value Allowed: n/a Relationship: n/a Concept: n/a Duplicate field in other sections 614 Page 329 of 344 12.3 Severity 615 Term (Variable) Severity Data Type Text Topic, Value or Header H Definition Section heading User Guidance Conformance Required Cardinality Relationship content from ToC representing the protocol hierarchy Appendix / Appendix 12 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events- Definitions, Severity, and Causality/Severity Relationship (reference to high level conceptual model) Value Severity Business rules Value Allowed: Yes Relationship: n/a Concept: n/a Duplicate field in other sections 616 Term (Variable) Severity Data Type Text Topic, Value or Header D Definition User Guidance Specify the rating categories/scale to be used in the trial to assess severity.

Considerations for assessing causality are discussed in ICH E2A. Evaluation of relatedness must consider temporality and biologic plausibility as well as etiologies such as natural history of the underlying disease, concurrent illness, concomitant therapy, trial-related procedures, accidents, and other external factors. In a clinical trial, the trial intervention must always be suspect. The Investigator's assessment of an AE's relationship to trial intervention is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the trial. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.
