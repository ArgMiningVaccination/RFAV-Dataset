Now, to add further opportunities for guests to soothe their bodies and minds, the Resort is introducing a new Visiting Masters Program at the Spa, which will see a host of some of the world's most renowned and sought-after wellness specialists provide guest consultations over two-week periods. Comprising inspirational body workers, energy healers and movement instructors, the four visiting Masters will be in Seychelles across set dates in 2018, during which time group and private consultations will be offered to guests, alongside complimentary \"Meet the Specialist\" sessions that will be held at the [Spa](https://www.fourseasons.com/seychelles/spa/). Senior Spa Director [Sandie Johannessen](https://press.fourseasons.com/seychelles/hotel-team/sandie-johannessen.html%20) says: \"It's a privilege to be able to welcome these wellness practitioners to our Resort. Each is such a specialist in their own right and as such, it is not easy to secure an appointment with them, due to their high demand and waiting lists. By welcoming these Masters to the Resort, guests will be able to embrace access to consultations and treatment that is tailored to them and their restoration needs.\" Julian Eymann, Massage Therapist: August 16-31, 2018 Certified by the California Massage Therapy Council (CAMTC) since 1998, Julian has spent the last 22 years bringing his unique style of deep tissue massage and trigger point therapy to an esteemed international clientele, including private work for many Hollywood and Bollywood celebrities such as Clint Eastwood and Shah Rukh Khan. His unique and soothing rocking technique combines chiropractic, deep tissue, trigger point and sports massage therapies to relieve sore and injured muscles, tensions, ligaments and joints. This has been known to completely cure severe existing problems. Julian's highly effective technique and combination approach allows the muscles to release, giving free range of movement in the joints, unlocking chronic tension patterns to increase oxygenation and nutrients, and loosening inflammations and toxins in the muscle tissues. Holly Siddall, Osteopath and Medical Acupuncturist: October 15-30, 2018 Do you suffer from postural-related pain? A sore back or knees when standing for too long, or musculoskeletal pain that just won't go away? Holly combines the two modalities of osteopathy and acupuncture into pioneering treatments designed to maximise the combined functionality of the bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissues, reduce pain and tension, and promote localised healing. A Masters graduate of the British School of Osteopathy, she treats patients with a wide range of medical conditions in Kensington and Chelsea, London. An expert in postural-related pain and the effects of prolonged stress on the body, she also specialises in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain during pregnancy. Her holistic approach combines osteopathic, medical acupuncture and sports massage techniques to create a bespoke management plan for each individual. Tim Stoneman, Hypnotherapist: November 14-29, 2018 Having used self-hypnosis for many years and experienced the enormous benefits first-hand, Tim's mission is now to share this life-transforming technique with the world. Hypnosis cycles the human brain down to healthy levels of activity, allowing harmful, negative beliefs and behaviour patterns to be released and new, positive, beneficial ones to be implanted. Tim's treatments focus on healing the whole person, so that every aspect of their life improves. Applicable to everything from stress reduction to sleep issues, happiness and well-being, relationships, phobias, weight-loss and smoking cessation, hypnotherapy is the most powerful and gentle way known to humankind to make deliberate, positive life changes. Angelika Alexander, Specialist Healer: December 2-16, 2018 Every moment is an opportunity to relax, relieve and reconnect, when one knows how. Journey with Angelika Alexander into the powerful and profound world of transformational breath and myofascial release to discover how to energise and awaken energy centres, transform emotional blocks and connect to deep relaxation. Angelika has dedicated her life to the mastery of transformative body-mind-healing modalities including kinesiology, myofascial release therapy with John F. Barnes and transformational breath: a gentle, simple technique that paves the way for improved physical and emotional well-being including increased energy, better immune response, and an enhanced ability to deal with stress in a healthy way. Join one of her group workshops or embark on a private journey to learn how to remove inner resistance to living a fully expressed life. Each of the practitioners will be available for private consultations for the duration of their time at the Resort, with prices starting from EUR 180 per hour, per person.
