Prickly heat is a skin rash that usually shows up in summers. While children and adolescents are often the victims, anyone of any age can get prickly heat. Also called miliaria, prickly heat rashes appear as red, raised spots on the skin. Prickly heat rash can affect any part of the body. It mostly appears in places where the person sweats heavily. This includes the back, underarms, groin, stomach, shoulders, or neck. The rash can become extremely itchy and even look embarrassing. Let's understand what causes prickly heat and explore ways to keep your skin cool this summer. What causes prickly heat? Excessive sweat, especially in summers,blocks your skin pores. This leads to dead skin cells and bacteria getting trapped and clogging your pores. This build-up appears as red bumps on the skin. When more sweat builds up, these tiny bumps burst, causing a prickly sensation that gives this condition its name. Prickly heat is not contagious, so you don't need to worry about maintaining distance from someone who has got it. Prickly heat develops from prolonged exposure to the sun, wearing tight and uncomfortable clothing in summers and having a natural disposition to oily skin. What are the physical symptoms of prickly heat? Prickly heat appears as tiny red-coloured bumps on the skin surface. Often these bumps cause excessive itching. You need to seek medical advice if the bumps do not go away on their own within a few days. Any tips to avoid prickly heat? - Avoid the sun at peak hours The sun's rays emit the strongest UV radiation between noon and 4 p.m. Plan outdoor activities - especially for kids - early morning or towards the evening. The harsh rays can cause sunburn and ugly skin rashes. - Wear cool cotton clothing Skip those denim and synthetic fibres in favour of cotton innerwear and clothes. Cotton absorbs sweat and helps keep the body cool by allowing air to circulate freely. Tight and uncomfortable fibres cause a build-up of bacteria, on the skin, that leads to conditions such as prickly heat. - Keep accessories o the bare minimum Tight belts, chains, stockings, and synthetic headbands all act as sweat magnets. They trap the moisture within your skin, leading to prickly heat and itchy spots. If you must travel on a bike and therefore need a helmet, tie a cotton bandana around your head before slipping it on. - Stay hydrated through the day You must replenish the water your body loses through sweat. Drink lots of water and fresh fruit juice. Keep electrolyte powder handy at all times, in case of dehydration. Stay away from packaged juices and energy drinks as these give you a sudden rush of energy but leave you feeling tired on the long run. - Seek medical advice for minor rash Any red spots on your skin that refuse to go away, need to be shown to a doctor. Normal prickly heat spots go away within a few days. If your rash persists, or if you feel generally unwell, you might have developed a sunstroke. Seek medical advice immediately. Homeopathy and skin care Any skin rash or discolouration that does not go away on its own, needs professional care. If you have red bumps on your face or body that refuse to go away, they could be something more than prickly heat. Red skin rash can also be acne, psoriasis, rosacea, or lichen planus.
