MOTION: To approve the coding and guideline note changes a s presented . CARRIES 5-0. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 4 Topic: Diagnosis of sleep apnea Discussion: Livingston reviewed the prior discussion about home sleep apnea testing. She clarified that concerns raised at the last meeting about cost- effectiveness of needing an additional night of home sleep testing were resolved, given additional information about the availability of auto - titrating CPAP. Livingston raised the question about the need for follow up of a negative home sleep test when clinical suspicion remained. Members discussed that there may not be that much difference in outcomes when treating this population, but if clinical suspicion is high enough, it was reasonable to do a follow up test. There were questions raised about being able to effectively define clinical suspicion. The group decided that by having most individuals do a ho me sleep study first, this would improve costs, and that following up negative home sleep study tests with in lab polysomnography when clinical suspicion remained was reasonable. Members suggested that home testing may increase access for some who otherwise may not be willing or able to have in -lab polysomnography. Overall, they agreed that there is value in ruling in a large population with a cheaper effective test. Recommended Actions: 1) Modify the guideline note on the diagnosis of sleep apnea as show n in Appendix A. MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Tobacco cessation and elective surgery guideline clarification Discussion: Livingston reviewed the summary document. This guideline creates an administrative barrier to encourage optimization prior to elective surgery , and would be desirable by plastic surgeons and other surgeons trying to minimize harms . When the surgery would have no impact on the outcome of the cancer, it is appropriate to re quire tobacco cessation. Subcommittee members further wordsmithed the proposal to clarify intent. Similarly, further minor modifications were made to remove the reference to \"reproductive procedures \" and instead explicitly identify an exception for contr aceptive procedures. Recommended Actions: 1) Modify the guideline note further to clarify intent regarding contraceptive procedure s and cancer -related procedures as shown in Appendix A. MOTION: To recommend the gui deline note changes as amended. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Fractional ex haled nitric oxide ( FeNO ) for management of asthma Discussion: Smits introduced the summary document. Olson noted that critical outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations, unplanned outpatient visits) did not have evidence of being affected with use of FeNO, but non -critical outcomes (e.g. oral steroid use) were. Irwin asked clarifying questions about how this test was coded in practice. Livingston raised questions about how this test was incorporated i nto existing asthma treatment algorithms. Olson noted that FeNO is a low cost test, but still could be costly if used by many patient at many visits. Wentz replied to that concern by Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 5 indicating that FFS or CCOs could limit use by putting in edits in the bi lling system to only allow a certain number of claims per year. Smits indicated that staff could look at claims and payments in the future to see if the test was a large cost- driver. Public testimony was heard from Dan Bues and Dr. Debby Hamm from Circas sia. Bues gave a market update, indicating that Regence BCBS has reviewed FeNO and now cover s the test for diagnosis and management. Washington Medicaid removed PA for FeNO and now covers the test for diagnosis and management, as did Oklahoma Medicaid. Hamm testified that the strength of evidence (SOE) in AHRQ was high for reducing exacerbation, defined in some cases as reduced ED visit or hospitalization. The AHRQ report showed reduced use of oral steroids with FeNO included in the management algorithm w hen data was pooled for adults and kids. The Cochrane review of pediatric data showed reduced use of oral steroids. Secondary outcomes had severe imprecision and low SOE in the AHRQ report. She noted that there is a clinical significant reduction in exacer bations - they are an important independent risk factor of having worse asthma outcomes. Hospitalization outcome had imprecise SOE, mainly because hospitalization is a rare event for asthma. The HERC quality of evidence statement takes into account harms, health equity and outcomes in specific subgroups. NICE and Cochrane both say that FeNO can be helpful in the management of specific groups of patients, such as patients still symptomatic with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The underling pathology of asthma is inflammation, which is what FeNO measures. The type of inflammation measured by FeNO occurs i n only half of asthma patients. FeNO can help distinguish if the patient has the type of inflammation that ICS can help. Hodges asked how the FeNO test would be used in the office for a known asthma patient. Hamm replied that the test is mostly used in a specialty setting. Certain patients won't need additional FeNO testing, but for other patients it might be helpful. ATS has an algorithm for FeNO use . If a patient has a high FeNO, and the FeNO score comes down with ICS, then you know the lower level is a reflection of good control and a higher level would indicate that a change in management is needed. Hodges asked how FeNO is different from peak flo w. Hamm replied that peak flow measures another part of asthma and is used for different patients/indications. There are patients with normal peak flow but high FeNO scores ; these patients do better on ICS that not on ICS even though the pea k flow wouldn't indicate that. FeNO measures a b iomarker to be used to monitor inflammation. Olson asked a philosophic question as to whether the HERC should go against NICE and Cochrane, which i s generally not our habit, but noted that the Circassia representatives had helped to explain why NICE and Cochrane made their decisions/conclusions. Gibson noted that the HERC has disagreed with NICE in the past. He felt that there was a strong enough signal in the evidence presented that it supported use of the FeNO test for management . Olson wondered if the FeNO test is prone to misuse. Smits noted that OHA can monitor for misuse and re -examine if found to be highly used/ a high cost driver in the future . Bues reported that FeNO use in Oregon is mainly in allergist and pulmonary offices, as well as a few pediatricians with a high number of asthmatics. 11 -14 total devices are in use in Oregon currently. States that had PA s on FeNO have removed them due to low utilization. Providers are using it 3-4 times a year in the office s he works with. Utilization does not appear to be an issue on the commercial or Medicaid sides in his opinion . Wentz noted that when she practiced in an office with a FeNO machine and high numbers Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 6 of asthma kids , overuse was not an issue. The m ain issue in her office with kids with asthma wa s trying to get kids to come in a nd to take their medications. The c linical utility of FeNO was to find patients who were not compliant with medications. Bues noted that currently 40 state Medicaid programs have appro ved FeNO testing for diagnosis and management ; 2 other states are reviewing the test. Hamm noted that asthmatics are a vulnerable patient population, and FeNO helps give concrete data on their disease process which is helpful in uncovering lack of adherenc e with medications. AHRQ defined utilization as a high priority issue to determine how to use FeNO clinically. This AHRQ report should be out in the next year. All large asthma networks doing research on management are using FeNO to define disease subpopul ations. Biologics are increasingly coming on the market for the treatment of asthma, and FeNO should be helpful in determining who should get these. Recommended Actions: 1) Add fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO; CPT 95012) to line 9 ASTHMA 2) Delete the diagnostic guideline approved at January meeting regarding FeNO MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Guideline note o n immune modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document explaining the need to correct a technical error on the list . Guideline note 95 is outdated as it was create before a new treatment for progressive MS became available. David Barhume, Genentech, testified that he was there to give any needed information and answer questions, and that Genentech agreed with the staff recommendation to delete the guideline note . Gibson wanted to put into the record that he hopes there will be a time to review the evidence for these therap ies in the fut ure; Hodges agreed. Staff noted that the ability of the HERC to review evidence in prioritizing medications is a broader question and is scheduled to be brought back for discussion to HERC at their May meeting . Recommended Actions: 1) Delete guideline note 95, effective April 1, 2018 MOTION: To recommend the guideline note change as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Auricular acupuncture clarification Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was no discussion. Recommended Actions: 1) Place S8930 (Electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points; each 15 minutes of personal one-on-one contact with the patient) on line 660 and add an entry to Guideline Note 173 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 7 Topic: Special consult only lines Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was no discussion. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove all inpatient and skilled nursing facility (SNF) CPT codes from line 436 STEREOTYPED MOVEMENT DISORDER WITH SELF -INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR DUE TO NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER , but leave ER visit codes a. 99217 inpatient services) 2) Remove any inpatient, SNF and ER codes from line 549 SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND RELATED DISORDERS a. 99224 ( Subsequent observation care, per day, for the evaluati on and management of a patient... Typically, 15 minutes are spent at the bedside and on the patient's hospital floor or unit. ) and 99324 -99337 (domiciliary or rest home care) 3) Change the treatment des cription for line 202 CHRONIC ORGANIC MENTAL DISORDERS INCLUDING DEMENTIAS to \"CONSULTATION/MEDICATION MANAGEMENT/BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT MEDICAL THERAPY \" MOTION: To recommend the code and treatment description changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Surgical treatment of deforming foot lesions in high risk diabetic patients for prevention of ulcer Discussion: Smit s reviewed the summary document as well as recent phone meetings with local and national podiatry experts. Wentz expressed concern for the cost of treating foot ulcers; Smits noted that the expenditure for treatment of foot ulcer was high. However, the evidence does not give a number needed to treat for the prophylactic foot surgeries to prevent one foot ulcer. If the NNT is high, then the su rgeries may not be cost effective; if the NNT is low, then it would be cost effective. Hodges noted that her CCO ha s lots of requests for these types of procedures. Wentz expressed concern that adding coverage of these procedures for a limited group of pat ients would result in a high PA review burden. Hodges replied that her CCO already PAs these procedures. Hodge's CCO approves these procedures in select cases in which there is a good argument that the procedure would be cost effective in that particular c linical situation and approves those by exception. There was concern for possible infection or other complications in use of these procedures to prevent ulcers, resulting in a possible cause of complications without definite ben efit. The group was most i nterested in coverage of Achilles tendon lengthening, due to a higher level of evidence; however, Smits noted that the interest in covering this procedure by the podiatry experts was less than for other procedures. The decision was to not add coverage for prophylactic procedures to prevent foot ulcers but make other housekeeping changes to related lines . If this topic is brought back in the future, the group felt an orthopedic foot expert should be invited to give input. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 8 Recommended Actions: 1) Add corn/callus treatment codes CPT codes 11055 -11057 to line 165 PREVENTIVE FOOT CARE IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS 2) Add CPT 28124 ( osteomyelitis or bossing); phalanx of to e) to line 397 CHRONIC ULCER OF SKIN 3) Remove elective foot surgeries currently appearing on line 165 PREVENTIVE FOOT CARE IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS a. CPT bone cyst r, bones of foot bones) 4) Remove inpatient and ER CPT codes from line inpatient) MOTION: To recommend the code changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: PET scan for staging of breast cancer Discussion: Smits re viewed the summary document. Olson reviewed PET imaging and its use in oncology. He is not aware of widespread use of PET in breast cancer patients. In his experience PET is used most in stage IV, where treatment is done with intent to prolong life. Bone scans can still be positive after c ancer is treated because it reflects bone injury. PET will tell you if the bone metastases are active. The meta -analysis referenced convinces him to not cover in stage IV disease. He noted that PET scans involve a big dose of IV radiation and then the radi ation of a CT scan. He feels coverage should be through exceptions. He also noted that lack of coverage for PET for breast cancer goes against standard of care for women with bone metastases and goes against a CMS NCD. He noted that the Commission may get provider and advocacy pushback. Recommended Actions: 1) Add HCPCS G0252 (Pet imaging, full and partial- ring pet scanners only, for initial diagnosis of breast cancer and/or surgical planning for breast cancer (e.g., initial staging of axillary lymph nodes) ) to line 660/GN173 with a new GN173 entry as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note change as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Topic: Vaccination issues Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Mimi Luther from the Oregon Immunization Program spoke to the immunization table, and its role as a standing order for pharmacies and public health programs. Olson noted that the HERC generally refers to national guidelines, but noted that the Oregon speci fic table has more information and allows OHA to be congruent between programs. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 3/8/2018 Page 9 Wentz raised the question about whether OHA can cover Shingrix if it is not covered currently by CMS. It was noted that some of the CCOs are already covering it. The group fe lt that coverage of Shingrix should be done as soon as feasible, and recommended that it be added to the April 1, 2018 Prioritized List if approved by HERC. Luther brought up that there is another new vaccine, this one for hepatitis B in adults, which wa s just FDA approved and added to the ACIP vaccine schedule at their February meeting. The new vaccine is much more effective that the current vaccine, and is able to be administered in 2 doses over 28 days rather than 3 doses over 6 months. It was determin ed that the CPT code for this vaccine (CPT 90739) is already on Line 3 and no action is needed by HERC. Recommended Actions: 1) Add CPT 90750 ( Zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted ) to line 3 PREVENTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS , effective Ap ril 1, 2018 2) Modify GN106 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 5 -0. Public Comment: No additional public comment was received. Issues for next meeting: There are no carry -over issues Next meeting: May 17, 2018 at Clackamas Community College Wilsonville Training Center, Wilsonville , Oregon, Rooms 111 -112.

DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D8, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA) IN ADULTS Type I PSG is covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed attended in a sleep lab facility. OHP clients should have access to least one of the alternatives listed below: 1) Type II or Type III sleep testing devices when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 2) Type IV sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels, one of which is airflow, when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 3) Sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels that include actigraphy, ox imetry, and peripheral arterial tone, when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. CPAP titration should be pe rformed as part of the diagnostic study, if possible. Appendix A In adults with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a home sleep study is the first -line diagnostic test for most patients, when available. Polysomnography in a s leep lab is indicated as a first -line test for patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to a neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. If a patient has had an inconclusive (or negative) home sleep apnea test and a clinical suspicion for OSA remains, then attended polysomnography is included on this line. Split night diagnostic protocol s are required when a diagnosis of OSA is confirmed in the first portion of the night. For portable devices, Type II -III are included on this line. Type IV sleep testing devices must measure three or more channels, one of which is airflow, to be included on this line. Sleep testing devices that are not Type1 -IV and measure three or more channels that include actigraphy, oximetry, and peripheral arterial tone, are included on this line. The development of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance . See http://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/CSI -HERC/Pages/Evidence -based -Reports.aspx. DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE DX, FRACTIONAL EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is covered only for the initial diagnosis of asthma in patients 7 years of age and older. It is not included for the monitoring of asthma, selection of medications, or diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbations. ANCILLARY GUIDELINE A4, SMOKING CESSATION AND ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES Smoking cessation is required prior to elec tive surgical procedures for active tobacco users. Cessation is required for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure and requires objective evidence of abstinence from smoking prior to the procedure. Elective surgical procedures in this guideline are defined as surgical procedures which are flexible in their scheduling because they do not pose an imminent threat nor require immediate attention within 1 month. Reproductive (i.e. for contraceptive purposes), cancer -related and diagnostic procedures are excluded from this guideline. Procedures for contraceptive/sterilization purposes, procedures targeted to active cancers (i.e. when a delay in the procedure could lead to cancer progression) and diagnostic procedures are not subject to the limitations in this guideline note. The well -studied tests for confirmation of smoking cessation include cotinine levels and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. However, cotinine levels may be positive in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) users, smokeless tobacco and e -cigarette users (which are not contraindications to elective surgery coverage). In patients using nicotine products aside from combustible cigarettes the following alternatives to urine cotinine to demonstrate smoking cessation may be considered: Exhaled ca rbon monoxide testing Anabasine or anatabine testing (NRT or vaping) Appendix A Certain procedures, such as lung volume reduction surgery, bariatric surgery, erectile dysfunction surgery, and spinal fusion have 6 month tobacco abstinence requirements. See Guideline Notes 8, 100, 112 and 159.

As a first step, the CPTF is requesting consideration of the addition of a statement of intent to the Prioritized List, effective October 1, 2018 if possible. The Taskforce is continuing to work on the creation of a new line with a guideline for chronic pain conditions. This new line and guideline work is ongoing, and the Taskforce expects to present this work to the HERC in the fall of 2017, for possible adoption as part of the biennial review process for implementation in January, 2020. The statement of intent below has been reviewed by the CPTF at several meetings, and was approved at their April, 2018 meeting. The Taskforce feels that this SOI is a good step towards their goal of standardizing and improving treatment of chronic pain patients. The SOI w ill also raise awareness in the provider community about what is good care of patients with chronic pain. This SOI was circulated among the CCO medical directors, who requested that wording about \"covered\" conditions be added to clarify that this SOI does not guarantee any new coverage or services. Several CPTF members objected to this addition. HERC staff are including this possible stakeholder edit in blue in the SOI shown below as a point of discussion for the VBBS meeting. CPTF recommendation: 1)Adopt the following new statement of intent, effective October 1, 2018 STATEMENT OF INTENT XXX TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN It is the intent of the Commission that covered [stakeholder proposed edit] chronic pain conditions be treated in a multidisciplinary fashion, with a focus on active therapies, improving function, and demedicalizing the condition. Care should include education on sleep, nutrition, stress reduction, mood, exercise, and knowledge of pain. All providers seeing chronic pain patients should be trained in pain science (e.g. a contemporary understanding of the central and peripheral nervous system in chronic pain), motivational interviewing, culturally sensitive care, and trauma-informed care. Care should be provided as outlined in the Oregon Pain Management Commission pain management module: http://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/CSI-PMC/Pages/module.aspx . Issue 2 The Chronic Pain Taskforce also gave interim recommendations for changes to the opioid guideline, to correct out- of-date portions, specifically the taper portion. These changes were approved via an email discussion. The Taskforce does not agree with the tapering off of opioids for all patients, but voted non- unanimously to include the proposed edits as an interim solution to the dating problem in the guideline. The Taskforce plans further revisions to this guideline as part of their continuing deliberations. In the meantime, the Taskforce desires that the change outlined below be adopted for October 1, 2018. The opioid taper paragraph was written with the intent that all opioid patients with back and neck conditions would be tapered off opioids by January 1, 2018. Due to step-wise implementation of tapers and other barriers encountered, all OHP back and neck pain patients have not been tapered off opioids to date. Additionally, new OHP patients who are receiving long-term opioids for back and neck Chronic Pain Taskforce Interim Report to the Health Evidenc e Review Commission 2 conditions have come on the plan. These groups of patients need to have guidance on their tapers off these medications. CPTF recommendation : 1) Adopt the following revisions to GN60, effective October 1, 2018 GUIDELINE NOTE 60, OPIOIDS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE Lines 346, 361, 401, 527 Opioid medications are only included on these lines under the following criteria: For acute injury, acute flare of chronic pain, or after surgery: 1) During the first 6 weeks opioid treatment is included on these lines ONLY: a) When each prescription is limi ted to 7 days of treatment, AND b) For short acting opioids only, AND c) When one or more alternative first line pharmacologic therapies such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxers have been tried and found not effective or are contraindicated, AND d) When p rescribed with a plan to keep active (home or prescribed exercise regime) and with consideration of additional therapies such as spinal manipulation, physical therapy, yoga, or acupuncture, AND e) There is documented verification that the patient is not high risk for opioid misuse or abuse. 2) Treatment with opioids after 6 weeks, up to 90 days after the initial injury/flare/surgery is included on these lines ONLY: a) With documented evidence of improvement of function of at least thirty percent as compared to basel ine based on a validated tools (e.g. Oswestry, Neck Disability Index, SF -MPQ, and MSPQ). b) When prescribed in conjunction with therapies such as spinal manipulation, physical therapy, yoga, or acupuncture. c) With verification that the patient is not high risk for opioid misuse or abuse. Such verification may involve i) Documented verification from the state's prescription monitoring program database that the controlled substance history is consistent with the prescribing record ii) Use of a validated screening instru ment to verify the absence of a current substance use disorder (excluding nicotine) or a history of prior opioid misuse or abuse iii) Administration of a baseline urine drug test to verify the absence of illicit drugs and non - prescribed opioids. d) Each prescripti on must be limited to 7 days of treatment and for short acting opioids only 3) Chronic opioid treatment (>90 days) after the initial injury/flare/surgery is not included on these lines except for the taper process described below. Transitional coverage for patients on long -term opioid therapy as of July 1, 2016 : For patients on covered chronic receiving long -term opioid therapy as of July 1, 2016 , opioid medication is included on these lines only from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. During the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 , continued coverage of opioid medications requires an individual treatment plan developed by January 1, 2017 which includes a taper with an end to opioid therapy no later than January 1, 2018 one year after the start of the taper . Taper plans must include nonpharmacological treatment strategies for managing the patient's pain based on Guideline Note 56 NON -INTERVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE . If a patient has Chronic Pain Taskforce Interim Report to the Health Evidenc e Review Commission 3 developed dependence and/or addiction related to their opioids, treatment is available included on Line 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER . Section 5.0 New Codes HCPCS \"C\" Code Review 1 Issue : In the past, HERC staff was under the impression that \"C\" codes did not require review due to the fact that these codes are bundled into outpatient DRG-type payments. However, it has come to our attention that these codes do require review. While some of these codes are indeed bundled into outpatient DRG payments, others pay individually. On review, many of these codes appear to be for DME materials such as catheters or for drugs. Some code for devices, like vascular stents, that can be used for a wide variety of diagnoses. These codes should continue to be ancillary. Other codes are used for materials only utilized on a few lines, such as cardiac pacemakers. These codes could easily be placed on lines, and appropriate lines are recommended by staff. There are also codes that are used for procedures. Such codes need evidence reviews. Some reviews had previously been done, and codes were recommended for placement where indicated in those reviews. Three reviews were conducted as part of the current review and are presented separately.

Question source : 2018 HCPCS \" C\" code review Issue: Traditionally, white light (or standard) cystoscopy, typically performed by urologists, has been the gold standard for diagnosing bladder cancer. Enhanced bladder cancer diagnostics, such as narrow band imaging or blue light cystoscopy, increase tumor detection in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer over white light cystoscopy alone, thus enabling more precise tumor removal by the urologist. Flat lesions such as CIS or low-graded tumors are often missed under standard white light cystoscopy. A new techniqu e termed \"blue light\" cystoscopy has been introduced to improve the visibility of tumors by using a photosensitizing agent and fluorescent light in the as (5-ALA) or hexaminolevulinate (HAL), a derivative of 5-ALA, are first instilled into the bladder. The drug then incorporates into the urothelial cytoplasm where abnormal cells appear red and normal cells appear blue green upon illumination wi th fluorescent light. Thus, \"blue light\" or fluorescent cystoscopy may help the detection of tumors more accurately and may reduce the risk of recurrence and progression compared to white light cystoscopy.

The strength of evidence was low due to risk of performance or publication bias. b.A pooled analysis of all trials using 5-ALA or HAL showed no difference between fluorescent cystoscopy compared with white light cystoscopy in the risk of progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer. Subgroup analysis showed that the risk of progression was statistically significantly lower in trials using HAL, but not in trials using 5-ALA. The strength of the evidence was moderate. The other SR also found that HAL- guided TURBT was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of progression compared to white light guided TURBT.2018 HCPCS \"C\" Code Review Blue Light Cystoscopy 2 c. There was no difference in mortality between fluorescent cystoscopy and white light cystoscopy in trials using 5 -ALA or HAL. The strength of the evidence was low due to imprecision and sparse data. d. Data on harms were sparse. 3) Conclusions and Implications for Decision or Policy Making a. Low to moderate quality evidence from recent SRs has suggested that TURBT guided by fluorescent or \"blue light\" cystoscopy using HAL photosensitizing agent in the detection and resection of NMIBC was associated with a dec reased risk of bladder cancer recurrence and a decreased risk of progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light cystoscopy. The effects of fluorescent cystoscopy on mortality were inconclusive due to sparse data.

Question source: Primary Health CCO Issue: A new HCPCS code for transnasal balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube (C9745) was introduced with the 2018 new codes, but not reviewed as part of the HERC code review in fall 2017. In the past, HERC staff was under the impression that \"C\" codes did not require review; however, it has come to our attention that these codes do require review. Primary Health CCO received a request for pairing this procedure with Eustachain tube dysfunction (ICD-10 HERC review of the procedure . Eustachian tubes are small tubes that run between the middle ear and the pharynx. They are responsible for equalizing ear pressure and draining fluid from the middle ear. Blocked eustachian tubes can cause pain, hearing difficulties, and a feeling of fullness in the ears. Such a phenomenon is referred to as eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Conventional medical treatment includes nasal steroids, decongestants, or antihistamines. Balloon dilation involves the inflation of a balloon in the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube to cause local dilation and was first described in 2010.

Recently, eustachian tube balloon dilation has been proposed as a potential solution. Method : A systematic literature review was performed. Abstracts were selected for relevance, and pooled data analysis and qualitative analysis was conducted. Results : Nine prospective studies, describing 713 eustachian tube balloon dilations in 474 patients (aged 18-86 years), were identified. Follow-up duration ranged from 1.5 to 18 months. Ability to perform a Valsalva manoeuvre improved from 20 to 177 out of 245 ears following eustachian tube balloon dilation and, where datawere reported in terms of patient numbers, from 15 to 189 out of 210 patients. Tympanograms were classifiedas type A in 7 out of 141 ears pre-operatively and in 86 out of 141 ears post-operatively. Conclusion : Prospective case series can confirm the safety of eustachian tube balloon dilation. As a potential solution for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, further investigations are warranted to establish a higher levelof evidence of efficacy. Key words: Auditory Tube; Balloon; Tube Introduction is a physiological disorder of the eustachian tube that results in inadequate middle- ear ventilation, causing aural fullness and tinnitus. In addition, complications such as serous otitis media,tympanic membrane retraction and cholesteatoma can occur. 1Eustachian tube dysfunction affects around 1 per cent of adults.2,3 Current treatment modalities for eustachian tube dysfunction, which include pharmacological agents, mechanical devices and nasal surgery, can beineffective. 1,2Treatment may entail multiple insertions of ventilation tubes in patients with chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, leading to complicationssuch as tympanosclerosis, chronic perforation and cholesteatoma. 4 Recently, eustachian tube balloon dilation has been researched in prospective cohort studies and is currently used 'off-label 'as a potential treatment for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction.5,6It aims to improve eustachian tube compliance and middle-ear ventilation. Its proposed mechanisms include mechan- ical dilation of the cartilaginous eustachian tube andinitiation of histopathological changes to the mucosa that can alter the inflammatory process. 7However, eustachian tube balloon dilation is a new procedure, and the operative technique needs to be veri-fied for its efficacy and complications. This paper sys- tematically reviews the available evidence on eustachian tube balloon dilation for treating chroniceustachian tube dysfunction. Materials and methods Criteria for study eligibility Studies were eligible for inclusion in data analysis if they were prospective (cohort or randomised), aimed to assess the effectiveness of eustachian tube balloon dilation in adults, and included outcomes of ability toperform Valsalva or Toynbee 's manoeuvre and /or tympanometry results. Retrospective studies, studies that did not include one of the two aforementioned out-comes, cadaveric studies and technical studies were excluded from data analysis but included in the discus- sion. Published conference abstracts and case reportswere excluded from this review.

Data extraction and statistical analysis Data extraction was performed independently by two authors (SH and JW). Pooled data analysis wasperformed. Results Nine prospective studies,4,6,8-14describing 713 eusta- chian tube balloon dilations in 474 patients (aged18-86 years), were identified. Follow-up duration ranged from 1.5 to 18 months. The included studies are summarised in Tables I andII. Indications The indication for eustachian tube balloon dilation in all studies was chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. The method of diagnosis varied between the studies, but all included clinical history and otoscopy, withsix studies using tympanometry and two studies using tubomanometry. Techniques Two main balloon dilation techniques were described in the literature, with five studies 6,8,11,13,14reporting the use of the Bielefeld technique (developed in Germany) and four studies4,9,10,12using the Acclarent balloon technique (developed in North America). Both techniques were performed under general anaes- thetic, with pre-operative a Storz micro-endoscope is used to visualise the insertion of a purpose-built FIG. 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( 'PRISMA ') flow diagram of search DYSFUNCTION S3 https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://www.cambridge.org/core .

The balloon is inflated to a pressure of 10 bars for 2minutes, with the aim of inflating the balloon to a size of 3 \u00d720 mm. In the Acclarent balloon technique, a 30- or a 45-degree, 4 mm Hopkins rod is used to visualise the insertion of an angled 70-degree catheter into the eus- tachian tube. Balloon sizes, pressures and duration ofinflation vary between the papers that use this tech- nique. These include a 5 \u00d716 mm balloon inflated to 8 atm for 30 seconds, 4a5\u00d724 mm or 7 \u00d724 mm balloon (adjusted for individual patients) inflated to 10 atm for 2 minutes,9or a 7 \u00d716 mm balloon inflated to 12 atm for 1 minute.10,12 Valsalva The ability to perform a Valsalva or Toynbee 's man- oeuvre pre- and post-eustachian tube balloon dilationwas reported in seven studies. This improved from 20 (8 per cent) to 177 (72 per cent) out of 245 ears follow- ing eustachian tube balloon dilation, 6,8,10-12,14and, where data were reported in terms of patient numbers, from 15 (7 per cent) to 189 (90 per cent) out of 210 patients.13Tympanometry Tympanometry results were reported in six studies.8-12,14Tympanograms were classified as type A in 7 out of 141 ears (5 per cent) pre-operatively, and this improved to 86 out of 141 ears (61 per cent)post-operatively. Twelve of these classifications (9 per cent) were because of grommets being removed and/or tympanic membrane perforations healing. Tubomanometry Tubomanometry was performed pre-operatively in two studies, 6,11but no post-operative data were provided. Tubomanometry was mainly used as an adjunct to aid in the diagnosis of eustachian tube dysfunction. Quality of life One study9used the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire and the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) to evaluate improvement in symptoms and quality of life pre- and post-eustachian tube balloondilation. There were statistically significant improvements in both measures: the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunc-tion Questionnaire pre-operative mean score of 4.5 decreased to 2.8 at 6 months ( p<0.001), and the SNOT-22 pre-operative mean score decreased from51.4 to 30 at 6 months ( p=0.001). Complications All studies documented complications. Four studies 6,8,9,12reported no eustachian tube balloon dilation related complications and one study11reported only minor epistaxis. More serious complications included two cases of self-resolving subcutaneousemphysema in two separate studies. 4,13 Complications associated with a learning curve were described by Wanscher and Svane-Knudsen,14who reported 3 cases of acute otitis media in the first 20 eus- tachian tube balloon dilations, which decreased to 1 out of 30 after 5 days of post-operative prophylactic oralantibiotics.

There were no reported cases of carotid artery injury or patulous eustachian tube in any of the papersreviewed. Discussion The eustachian tube in adults is approximately 37.5 mm long, and consists of bony and cartilaginous portions, extending from the middle-ear cleft to thenasopharynx. 15It has several physiological functions, which include pressure equalisation, drainage of the middle ear and protection from the nasopharyngealenvironment. 15 Poor or inadequate eustachian tube function causes eustachian tube dysfunction, which is a physiologicaldisorder that may be temporary and spontaneously re- solving. 1Chronic eustachian tube dysfunction occurs when the dysfunction lasts for over three months; it isa poorly defined clinical entity, with variable diagnostic criteria based on clinical history, otoscopy and tympano- gram results. 2It can be a difficult pathology to manage, with debilitating symptoms affecting quality of life; current conventional treatments may not be effective. A recent health technology assessment found that there was minimal evidence of effectiveness for current medical and surgical interventions, including nasal decongestants, topical and systematic corticoster-oids, antihistamines, mechanical devices, and nasal surgery. 2It identified only one study with a low risk of bias, a randomised, controlled trial, which foundno improvement in eustachian tube dysfunction symp- toms after six weeks of nasal steroids. 16 In cases of chronic eustachian tube dysfunction re- fractory to conventional treatment, multiple insertions of ventilation tubes may be required. This can cause persistent perforation requiring dry ear precautionsand/or myringoplasty. As a potential solution for this, eustachian tube balloon dilation (proposed as a treatment for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction)aims to ventilate and drain the middle ear by improving the physiological function of the eustachian tube. 6,10 The initial papers by Ockermann et al. in 20105,6and Poe et al . in 201110,17focused on establishing the safety of eustachian tube balloon dilation by perform- ing both cadaveric and clinical studies. The cadavericstudies revealed no evidence of fractures to the cartil- aginous or bony lumen, and no damage to the internal carotid artery. Only minor mucosal lacerations at theeustachian tube orifice were noted. 5,17 Since then, numerous prospective cohort studies have examined the role of eustachian tube balloon dila-tion. Pooled data analysis in this review revealed that the ability to perform a Valsalva improved from 8 per cent pre-eustachian tube balloon dilation to 72 percent post-eustachian tube balloon dilation, while the rate of type A tympanograms increased from 5 to 61 per cent. Further statistical analysis is inappropriatebecause of the heterogeneity of the inclusion criteria, techniques and outcome measures in the papersincluded in this review. The mechanisms by which eustachian tube balloon dilation improves eustachian tube function is an areaof ongoing research, but appear to include both ana- tomical dilation of the cartilaginous eustachian tube and the initiation of histopathological changes. 7A recent study examining the histopathological changes associated with eustachian tube balloon dilation found that the balloon had a crushing effect on inflam-matory cells within the eustachian tube mucosa while sparing the basal layer, rapidly replacing the inflamed mucosa with a fibrous scar. 7 One major concern of eustachian tube balloon dila- tion is the theoretical risk of injury to a dehiscent carotid artery running adjacent to tomography (CT) of the petrous temporal bones was routinely performed as a part of the pre-operative investigations. Abdel-Azizet al. 18conducted a retrospective analysis of petrous temporal bone CT scans of 285 patients who underwent eustachian tube balloon dilation. The authors foundthat 24 eustachian tube balloon dilations were per- formed in 17 patients with carotid canal dehiscence, with no complications or technical difficulties. Thissuggests that routine petrous temporal bone CT is not indicated before eustachian tube balloon dilation. Another area of concern for eustachian tube balloon dilation is its use in the paediatric population, where middle-ear disease is more prevalent 19because of a shorter, more horizontal eustachian tube, with alumen that is less than half the size of an adult eusta- chian tube. 15Currently, there are 2 retrospective case series that describe eustachian tube balloon dilationsin 33 children aged 5 -14 years (mean, 9 years), 19 and in 66 children aged 4 -14 years (mean, 8 years),20with no reported complications and an im- provement in middle-ear symptoms. Despite the aforementioned results of this review, Bluestone21suggested, in 2014, that the efficacy of eusta- chian tube balloon dilation remains unverified. This is because the majority of studies have small numbers of patients, limited follow up, a weak definition of 'cure ' and do not evaluate the direct effect of eustachian tube balloon dilation on eustachian tube function. This suggests that a more rigorous clinical trial is required. Any future clinical trial on eustachian tube balloon dila- tion would require strict inclusion criteria and should use commonly accepted outcome measurements. The authorsof this paper believe that the appropriate outcome mea- sures should include: clinical measures of otoscopy and the ability to perform a Valsalva manoeuvre; tympanometry, audiometry and /or tuboma- nometry; and patient-reported measures acquired using a verified questionnaire such as the seven-itemEustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire. 22 Our evaluation of the evidence for eustachian tube balloon dilation is limited by the quality of the papersBALLOON DILATION . Oregon Health & University , on 13 Feb 2018 at 18:01:13 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atincluded, as the highest level of evidence available is prospective case series. Three papers6,8,10had less than 20 patients, and only 2 papers11,12had an average follow-up period longer than 12 months. Also, there were significant variations in terms of theassessment of patients, indications for eustachian tube balloon dilation and assessment of outcomes. The diagnosis, investigations and indications for eustachian tube balloon dilation were not standard across the papers. This standardisation is in part limited by the subjective clinical nature by whichchronic eustachian tube dysfunction is diagnosed. Although all studies reviewed used clinical history, oto- scopy and tympanometry to diagnose chronic eusta-chian tube dysfunction, the indications for eustachian tube balloon dilation differed. In some papers, eusta- chian tube dysfunction refractory to conventional treat-ment was required, while in others a diagnosis of chronic eustachian tube dysfunction was sufficient. In future evaluations of eustachian tube balloon dilation,diagnostic criteria that include objective measurements of tympanometry and the seven-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire should be used. In addition, the technique of eustachian tube balloon dilation differed across the nine papers, with the two main techniques being those described in the Resultssection. In both techniques, the target for balloon dila- tion is the 8 -12 mm segment that acts as a valve within the cartilaginous eustachian tube, as this is where thephysiological deficiency in chronic eustachian tube dysfunction is thought to originate. 17Hence, care is taken to not push the balloon catheter past the cartil-aginous and bony isthmus, or to use a balloon size that is too large for the patient. However, this has meant that a variety of balloon sizes and pressures have been employed, especially among those who use the Acclarent balloon catheters. No'best 'way to perform eustachian tube balloon dila- tion has yet been established; at the current early stages of evaluating its efficacy, the heterogeneity of techni- ques confounds the ability to draw conclusions. Overall, this review found that eustachian tube balloon dilation is a procedure with a low rate of com- plications and may be considered for refractory chroniceustachian tube dysfunction in adults. More rigorous studies with standardised indications, techniques and outcomes are required to provide a higher level of evi-dence before its mainstream use. Nevertheless, the current data suggest a potential benefit of this proced- ure for a condition that can be difficult to manage. References 1 Adil E, Poe D.

These devices are designed to help with urinary stress incontinence. This devices is available commercially as the ProACT Therapy System. The procedure (per NICE 2017): With the patient under local, regional or general ana esthesia, an incision is made in the perineum. Specially designed introducers are used to insert 2 small silicone balloons. Under radiological guidance the balloons are positioned on either side of the urethra, close to the bladder neck. The balloons are f illed with a mixture of water and radiocontrast medium to enable the positioning to be confirmed. Each balloon is then attached to a subcutaneous port sited in the labia major. These ports can be used to add or remove fluid to the balloon postoperatively, thereby achieving the best balance between voiding and leakage. Evidence 1) NICE 2017 a.

In women, it is most commonly associated with pre vious pregnancy , with or without recognised obstetric tr auma. Pre vious urogynaecological surgery ma y also result in stress urinary incontinence. 2.2 A NICE clinical guideline describes recommendations for the management of urinary incontinence in women . Con ventional treatment is conservativ e, and includes lifestyle changes such as weight loss and pelvic floor muscle tr aining. Surgery is considered if these conservativ e measures do not help.

Specially designed introducers are used to insert 2 small silicone balloons. Under r adiological guidance the balloons are positioned on either side of the urethr a, close to the bladder neck. The balloons are filled with a mixture of water and r adiocontr ast medium to enable the positioning to be confirmed. Each balloon is then attached to a subcutaneous port sited in the labia major . These ports can be used to add or remo ve fluid to the balloon postoper ativ ely, thereb y achie ving the best balance between v oiding and leakage. 44 EfficacyEfficacy This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published liter ature that the committee considered as part of the e vidence about this procedure.

Question source : OHA, school -based health systems Issue : Since a change in the DMAP file types and transitions to ICD -10, there are a number of code pairings that previously were used by the schools to get medical services for children paid for by OHP that are being denied. From Linda Williams, Policy Analyst at OHA Please note below coding that School districts and ESDs are puzzled they no longer are able to receive reimbursement for therapy services provided as part of Early Intervention and Early Childhood Special Education (EI/ECSE) for over a decade prior to changes made effective during the 2015 -2016 school year (spec ifically since October 1, 2015, ICD -10 implementation) This has been and continues to be an issue for EI/ECSE leveraging Medicaid as of October 1, 2015 forward. I brought this forward and continue to struggle to get an explanation for this to ESDs and s chool districts mandated to provide health related services/therapies to Medicaid eligible children eligible under the IDEA for developmental delay. Districts and ESDs have been asking why the change that only allows only reimbursement for assessment/e valuation and not therapy to correct or ameliorate developmental delays in childhood or delayed milestones to help a child get on track with age appropriate growth and development and note that whe n OT, PT, Speech therapy is contraindicated confer with parent and refer the child to a physician for further evaluation and testing for diagnosis. This change has negatively impacted EI/ECSE Medicaid reimbursement as part of Federal Financial Participation/ cost sharing. In the IDEA program, schools are obligated to start providing services even if a diagnosis has not been established. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) program serves as the overseeing body and provides the prescription for the refe rrals. Schools are not able to discontinue these services or charge parents for the services. The most common codes that are being denied are : R62.0 Delayed milestone in childhood R62.50 Unspecified lack of expected normal physiological development in childhood R62.59 Other lack of expected normal physiological development in childhood Other examples of denied codes include: a.

She explained the process that had been followed and how consensus had been reached. The Task Force's recommendation was that 315.4X be added to the Posture and Movement line with crit eria specifying that for age 3 and under it is an appropriate diagnosis and for ages greater than 3, the use is diagnostic and should be time limited. The Task Force also recommended a prior authorization protocol be adopted requiring documentation of expe cted outcomes after a specific period of treatment for 3 and under and for those over three, that authorization be for no more than 120 days. These recommendations were adopted by the Subcommittee. September 23, 2004 HOSC Minutes VII. Coordination Disorde r Guideline - Alison Little Dr. Little explained that the guideline for Line 336 (in packet), had been attached to that line for many years, and that she queried Dr. Kitchen about its origin, who did not recall. The diagnosis, 315.4, is also known as devel opmental coordination disorder, clumsiness syndrome, dyspraxia syndrome and specific motor development disorder. The current guideline for physical therapy is in conflict with this guideline. Delete the Coordination Disorder guideline from Line 336. HOSC Minutes August 12, 2010 Dyspraxia Smits introduced a summary document regarding dyspraxia. The discussion centered around whether there was effective treatments for dyspraxia syndrome (315.4), and the decision was there were not, and that the diagnosis wa s hard to define. However, the group felt that dyspraxia (781.3) should be kept on the Signs and Symptoms list to allow work up for a cause. There are no treatments included for diagnoses on the signs and symptoms list. 1) Advise DMAP to keep dyspraxia (781.3) on the Signs and Symptoms List. 2) Remove dyspraxia syndrome (315.4) from line 317 Neurological Dysfunction In Posture And Movement Caused By Chronic Conditions. Advise DMAP to place dyspraxia syndrome (315.4) on the Never Covered List.

Some of this can be ameliorated by education around using more appropriate codes. Several reading disorder diagnoses are not curre ntly funded, but there is evidence to support specific phonic instructions and these can be added to the funded region. Often, early intervention is indicated when the only diagnosis may be failing to meet developmental milestones. Currently, these are diagnostic codes just on the diagnostic file and ongoing treatment with these codes is not being permitted.

Dermatochalasis and Blepharoplasty 1 Question : Should dermatochalasis be moved to a covered line for surgical repair in cases where it impairs vision? Should other \"clean up\" changes be made to the Prioritized List concerning blepharoplasty? Question source : Dr. Tracy Muday, medical director of Advanced Health ; ICD -10 Ophthalmology reviewers Issue : Dermatochalasis is an excess of skin in the upper or lower eyelid, also known as \" baggy eyes .\" It may be either an acquired or a congenital condition. The excess tissue can sometimes obstruct the visual field, especially the superior visual field. In severe cases, it may obstruct as much as 50 percent of the superio r visual field. When it impairs vision, it can be treated with blepharoplasty in which excess skin, muscle and fat are removed. While the improvement of vision is an indication for blepharoplasty on the superior eyelid, if the visual fields are not obstru cted, it may be performed for cosmetic reasons. In general, blepharoplasty of the inferior eyelid is considered cosmetic, as dermatochalasis in the lower eyelid does not interfere with vision. Blepharoplasty may also be done for certain ptosis conditions. Currently, dermatochalasis (ICD -10 H02.83) is on the upper eyelid (CPT 15822 -15823) is only found on lines 351 STRABISMUS DUE TO NE UROLOGIC DISORDER and 469 ACQUIRED PTOSIS AND OTHER EYELID DIS ORDERS WITH VISION I Blepharoplasty of the lower eyelid (CPT 15820 -15821) the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage List . GN130 applies only to line 469 and restricts blepharoplasty to situations i n which visual fields are impaired. Dr. Muday was asking about when dermatochalasis was a covered condition given that GN130 outlines when its treatment is covered . Blepharoplasty was discussed as part of the 2010 ICD -10 Ophthalmology review. At that time, the ophthalmologists recommended moving dermatochalasis from the blepharitis line, where it had been for a very long time, to the line for acquired ptosis. There was a staff error in translating this recommendation, and the ICD -10 materials approved by HERC moved dermatochalasis from the ptosis line to the blepharitis line (the opposite of the reviewer's intent; this mistakenly resulted in no change from previous Lists).

Question source: OHA Hearings Division Issue: Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is a new procedure for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for patients for whom CPAP is contraindicated or not effective/tolerated. The Hearings Division recently was involved in a case in which this procedure was requested. It is not currently included on the OSA line, and was not part of the extensive OSA treatment review and coverage guidance development done a couple of years ago. Several devices have received FDA approval and are currently commercially available. The CPT code used for insertion of the hypoglossal nerve stimulator is CPT 64568 (Incision implantation of cranial nerve (eg, vagus nerve) neurostimulator electrode array and pulse generator). This code is currently only on lines 174 GENERALIZED CONVULSIVE OR PARTIAL EPILEPSY WITHOUT MENTION OF IMPAIRMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS and 440 TRIGEMINAL AND OTHER NERVE DISORDERS. OSA is on line 203 SLEEP APNEA, NARCOLEPSY AND REM BEHAVIORAL DISORDER. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation aims to treat obstructive sleep apnea by preventing the tongue prolapsing backwards and causing upper airway obstruction during sleep. It works by delivering an electrical current to the hypoglossal nerve. This contracts the genioglossus muscle, the major muscle responsible for tongue protrusion, and all other intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Using general anesthesia, a neurostimulator is implanted in an infraclavicular subcutaneous pocket and a stimulating lead is placed on the main trunk of the hypoglossal nerve. The neurostimulator delivers electrical pulses to the hypoglossal nerve. With some devices, stimulation can be synchronized with respiration using sensing leads that measure changes in breathing. The respiratory-sensing leads are positioned between the external and internal intercostal muscle. The stimulator is programmed and controlled wirelessly to adapt to specific patient needs. Evidence 1)NICE 2017 , review of hypoglossal nerve stimulation for treatment of moderate to severe OSA a.Conclusion: Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of hypoglossal nerve stimulation for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. b.Evidence review i.Systematic review and meta-analysis of 200 patients in 6 prospective studies [Certal 2015 ] 1.There was a statistically significant decrease in the apnea -hypopnea index (AHI; a normal AHI is less than 5 events per hour). At 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up the mean differences from baseline were 23.94 (95% [CI] 31.45 to patients) and (95% CI 20.69 to 14.34, 170 patients) respectively (p<0.001 for all time points). 2.There was a statistically significant decrease in the oxygen desaturation index (defined as the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by 4 or more percentage points from baseline). At 3-,Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea 2 6-, and 12 -month follow -up the mean differences from baseline were 10.04 (CI 16.31 to 3.78, 34 patients), 11.68 and CI 16.87 to 10.58, 170 patients) respectively (p<0.01 at 3 months and p<0.001 at 6 and 12 months). 3. There was a statistically significant decrease in the Epworth sleepiness scale (scores range from 0 to 24 with higher scores ind icating more daytime sleepiness). At 3 -, 6-, and 12 -month follow -up the mean differences from baseline were 4.17 (CI 6.45 to 1.90, 34 patients), 3.82 (95% CI 5.37 to 2.27, 60 patients) and 4.42 (95% CI 5.39 to 3.44, 170 patients) respectively (p<0 .001 for all time points). In a follow -up study of 95 patients from the prospective case series of 126 patients, there was a statistically significant increase in the mean functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire score (FOSQ, ranging from 5 to 20 with hi gher scores indicating better subjective sleep quality) from 14.6\u00b13.0 at baseline to 17.5\u00b12.9 at 4 -year follow -up (p<0.05). ii. In a randomised controlled therapy -withdrawal trial of 46 'responders' from a prospective case series of 126 patients (23 therapy -maintenance responders compared with 23 therapy -withdrawal responders), there was a statistically significant increase in the mean AHI from 7.6 at 1 -year follow -up (before randomisation into the trial) to 25.8 at 1 week after randomisation, in the group in which the device was turned off for 1 week (p<0.001). There was no statistical difference in mean AHI within the therapy -maintenance group, who continued to use the device (7.2 compared with 8.9). At 18 -month follow -up, the mean AHI scores were 9.6 in the therapy -maintenance group and 10.7 in the group who had the device turned off for 1 week (p<0.05 for the differences compared with baseline within groups). There was a statisticall y significant difference between the therapy -withdrawal group and the therap y-maintenance group for change in mean AHI, from assessment at 1 year to assessment at the end of the therapy withdrawal study (p<0.001). iii. In the follow -up study of 95 patients from the prospective case series of 126 patients, the rates of bed -partner repor ted 'no snoring' at baseline and 85% at 4 -year follow -up. iv. In a prospective case series of 46 patients [Friedman 2016 ], there was a statistically significant improvement in the mean sleep apn ea quality of life index from 4.3\u00b11.0 at baseline to 4.7\u00b11.2 at 6 -month follow -up (p=0.019). c. Safety: i. ipsilateral hemi -tongue paresis was reported in 15% (2/13) of patients in a prospective case series of 13 patients from a systematic review and meta - analysis of 200 patients. ii. Tongue abrasion was reported in 26% (33/126) of patients in a follow -up study of 95 patients from a prospective case series of 126 patients within 4 years of the procedure. iii. Bleeding was reported in 1 patient within 30 days of implantation in a prospective case series of 46 patients. In the same study, haematoma was reported in 7% (3/46) of patients. 2 were classified as non -series and one as serious Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea 3 iv. Rupture of a vein was reported in 6% (2/31) of patients during cervical tunnelling in a prospective case series of 31 patients; 1 of the patients needed 1 further cervical incision. v. Seroma at an incision site was reported in 10% (2/20) of patients after the procedure in a retrospective case series of 20 patients. One seroma occurred at the sensing -lead incision 1 week after surgery and the other occurred at the implantable pulse -generator incision 4 weeks after surgery. Both resolved uneventfully with percutaneous needle drainage. vi. Headache was reported in 6% (8/126) of patients in the pr ospective case series of 126 patients within 1 year of the procedure. Infection was reported in 1 patient in a prospective case series of 22 patients from the systematic review and meta -analysis of 200 patients; the device was removed. vii. Dry mouth was report ed in 13% (16/126) of patients in the prospective case series of 126 patients within 3 years of the procedure. viii. Discomfort due to electrical stimulation was reported in 58% (73/126) of patients in the prospective case series of 126 patients within 4 years o f the procedure. In the same study, discomfort related to incisions was reported in 29% (37/126) of patients and discomfort not related to incisions was reported in 27% (34/126) of patients within 4 years of the procedure. ix. Paraesthesia was reported in 13% (6/46) of patients (within 30 days of implantation in 5 patients, and more than 30 days after implantation in 1 patient) in the prospective case series of 46 patients. Device migration more than 30 days after implantation was reported in 1 patient in the p rospective case series of 46 patients. Cuff dislodgement was reported in 2 patients in a prospective case series of 31 patients, and in 1 patient in a prospective case series of 21 patients, from the systematic review and meta -analysis of 200 patients; all 3 patients needed a new procedure to replace it. x. Device removal was reported in 4 patients in the prospective case series of 31 patients, and in 2 patients in the prospective case series of 21 patients, from the systematic review and meta -analysis of 200 patients. Device removal was also reported in 3 patients, 1 to 4 years after the procedure, in the prospective case series of 126 patients. The reasons for removal were insomnia, septic sternoclavicular joint adjacent to the device and non -response to ther apy. Device removal for cosmetic reasons was reported in 1 patient in a case series of 60 patients. xi. Leads breaking was reported in 15% (2/13) of patients in the prospective case series of 13 patients from the systematic review and meta -analysis of 200 patients. Defective implanted pulse -generator connector was reported in 1 patient in the prospective case series of 13 patients from the systematic review and metaanalysis of 200 patients. xii. Other complications reported in the systematic review and meta -analysis of 200 patients included postoperative pain and stiffness, sore throat, stitch abscess, local swelling, fever and lack of tongue response to stimulation.

Multicenter, prospective, single -group, cohort study of hypoglossal nerve stimulation in patients with difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy (N=126) Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea 4 i. Mean BMI 28.4 b. The median AHI score at 12 months decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P<0.001); the ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour (P<0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12 -month sco re in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy -maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy -withdrawal group (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. The rate of procedure - related serious adverse events was less than 2%. c. CONCLUSIONS In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper -airway stimulation led to significant imp rovements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. d. Note: funded by manufacturer of a hypoglossal nerve stimulator device Additional study not included in NICE review 1) Heiser 2017 a. A multicenter prospective single -arm study at three German centers (N=60) b. Every subject reported improvement in sleep and daytime symptoms.

Systematic Review Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis adherence to continuous positive airway pressure treatment in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adversely affects the effectiveness of this therapy. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of hypoglossal nerve stimulation as an alternative therapy in the treatment of OSA. Data Sources: Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searched (updated through September 5, 2014). Methods: Studies were included that evaluated the efficacy of hypoglossal nerve stimulation to treat OSA in adults with outcomes for apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and effect on daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]). Tests for heterogeneity and subgroup analysis were performed. Results: Six prospective studies with 200 patients were included in this review. At 12 months, the pooled fixed effects analysis demonstrated statistically significant reductions in AHI, ODI, and ESS mean difference of Similar significant reduc- tions were observed at 3 and 6 months. Overall, the AHI was reduced between 50% and 57%, and the ODI was reduced between 48% and 52%. Despite using different hypoglossal nerve stimulators in each subgroup analysis, no significant heter- ogeneity was found in any of the comparisons, suggesting equivalent efficacy regardless of the system in use. Conclusions: This review reveals that hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy may be considered in selected patients with OSA who fail medical treatment. Further studies comparing hypoglossal nerve stimulation with conventional therapies are needed to definitively evaluate outcomes. Key Words: Hypoglossal nerve stimulation, sleep apnea. Level of Evidence: NA Laryngoscope , 125:1254-1264, 2015 INTRODUCTION sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious, poten- tially life-threatening disorder characterized by recur- rent episodes of upper-airway collapse during sleep that often lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.1Common symptoms include loud snoring, breathing interruptions,excessive daytime sleepiness, and cognitive impairment. Its association with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications is well described.2 The primary course of treatment for OSA is therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devi- ces. Despite efforts to improve adherence, only 40% to 60% of patients continue to use CPAP long term or as prescribed, and many others do not seek medical atten- tion. In cases where the effectiveness is not optimal, alternative therapies are often utilized after medical management has failed.3 In 1978, Remmers et al.4were the first to report the direct relationship between loss of genioglossus mus- cle activation during sleep and upper airway closure in patients with OSA. This finding led to early attempts to treat the disorder by electrical stimulation of the pha- ryngeal muscles with transcutaneous, intraoral, and intramuscular electrodes.5-7 Several subsequent projects since then have attempted to prove the usefulness of chronic hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) as a novel therapeutic approach to sleep apnea. Selective HNS is less likely to produce arousal than direct intramuscular stimulation, which is associated with sensory stimulation, because the nerve is purely motor.

Although con - tinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment. We evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we surgically im - planted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apnea or h ypopnea events per hour, with a score of 15 indicating moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by 4 percentage points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal trial. RESULTS The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The median AHI score at 12 months decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P<0.001); the ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour (P<0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%. CONCLUSIONS In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper-airway stimulation led to significant im - provements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 370;2 nejm.org january 9, 2014140Obstructive sleep apnea is a com - mon disorder, characterized by recurrent narrowing and closure of the upper air - way accompanied by intermittent oxyhemoglobin desaturation and sympathetic activation. 1 Sequelae include excessive sleepiness and impaired quality of life. Moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score of 15 or more apnea or hypopnea events per hour, is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, vascular disease, and death. 2-7 Treatment with continuous positive airway pres - sure (CPAP) with the use of a mask favorably modifies these adverse health consequences. 8 However, the general effectiveness of CPAP ther - apy is dependent on patient acceptance of and adherence to the treatment. 9,10 Alternative treatments to CPAP include cus - tom-made oral-appliance therapy and a variety of upper-airway surgeries. 11,12 Since evidence-based reviews do not uniformly support the efficacy of these treatments for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, new therapy is desirable. 13,14 The onset of apnea is accompanied by a re - duction in drive to the upper-airway muscles,15,16 and upper-airway patency is strongly correlated with the activation of the genioglossus muscle. 17 Upper-airway stimulation with the use of uni - lateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve has been developed as a possible treatment option and has shown promise in feasibility trials. 18-23 Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group trial design followed by a randomized, therapy-withdrawal trial that included only participants who had had a response to therapy, we ad - dressed the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months after implantation. This technology permits stimula - tion to be synchronized with ventilatory effort during sleep. METHODS PARTICIPANTS Participants with moderate-to-severe obstruc - tive sleep apnea were eligible for enrollment if they had difficulty accepting or adhering to CPAP treatment. Exclusion criteria were a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms di - vided by the square of the height in meters) of more than 32.0, neuromuscular disease, hypo -glossal-nerve palsy, severe restrictive or tive pulmonary disease, moderate-to-severe pul - monary arterial hypertension, severe valvular heart disease, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarc - tion or severe cardiac arrhythmias (within the past 6 months), persistent uncontrolled hyper - tension despite medication use, active psychiat - ric disease, and coexisting nonrespiratory sleep disorders that would confound functional sleep assessment. STUDY design and OVERSIGHT The study was designed by the sponsor (Inspire Medical Systems), the investigators, and the Food and Drug Administration as a multicenter, prospec - tive, single-group trial with participants serving as their own controls. There was no concurrent control group. The primary outcome evaluation was followed by a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal study that included a subgroup of con - secutive participants selected from the population that had a response to therapy. The trial protocol was approved by the insti - tutional review board (in the United States) or medical ethics committee (in Europe) at each participating center. All the participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. An independent clinical-events committee and a data and safety monitoring board provided review and adjudication of safety data. Verification of source data was performed by independent monitors. The study investigators had full access to the data and had the right to submit the manuscript for publication without input from the sponsor. The writing committee (the first, second, and last authors), an independent statis - tician (Teri Yurik, NAMSA), and the sponsor vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The primary outcome measures were assessed by means of overnight polysomnography and scored by an independent core laboratory with the use of standard criteria. 24 The data analysis was performed by the independent statistician, with the results reviewed by the first and last authors. The first author wrote the manuscript with assistance from the writing committee; no one who is not listed as an author contributed substantially to the study report.

Upper-Airway Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea n engl j med 370;2 nejm.org january 9, 2014141SCREENING AND IMPLANTATION In order for investigators to verify eligibility for the implantation, enrolled participants under - went screening that included polysomnography, medical and surgical consultation, and endoscopy during drug-induced sleep. 25 Participants were excluded if the AHI score from the screening polysomnography was less than 20 or more than 50 events per hour, if central or mixed sleep-disordered breathing events accounted for more than 25% of all apnea and hypopnea episodes, or if the AHI score while the person was not in a supine position was less than 10 events per hour. Participants were also excluded if pronounced anatomical abnormalities preventing the effec-tive use or assessment of upper-airway stimula - tion were identified during the surgical consulta - tion (e.g., tonsil size of 3 or 4 [tonsils visible beyond the pillars or extending to midline]) or if complete concentric collapse at the retropalatal airway was observed on endoscopy performed during drug-induced sleep. 25 Qualified participants underwent a surgical procedure to implant the upper-airway stimula - tion system (Inspire Medical Systems)20 (Fig. 1). The stimulation electrode was placed on the hypo glossal nerve to recruit tongue-protrusion function; the sensing lead was placed between the internal and external intercostal muscles to detect ventilatory effort; the neurostimulator was implanted in the right ipsilateral mid-infra - clavicular region. Approximately 1 month after implantation, all the participants underwent a second baseline diagnostic polysomnographic examination be - fore activation of the device. Immediately after this polysomnography, all the participants had their device activated and were instructed re - garding the use of a controller to initiate and terminate therapy on a nightly basis. After acti - vation, participants had scheduled outpatient visits at months 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12; at each of these visits data on adverse events were obtained and device interrogation was performed. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the change in the se - verity of obstructive sleep apnea in the study population, as assessed by means of the AHI and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by 4 percentage points from baseline). The coprimary outcome was the proportion of participants with a response from baseline to 12 months with respect to the primary outcome measures of the AHI and ODI scores. A response as measured by means of the AHI was defined as a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in the AHI score and an AHI score on the 12-month poly - somnography of less than 20 events per hour. 26 The ODI was chosen as a stable integrative out - come value of all forms of sleep-disordered breathing. A response as measured by means of the ODI was defined as a reduction of at least 25% from baseline in the ODI score. The pre - specified primary efficacy objectives were re - sponse rates of at least 50%, as assessed by means of the AHI and ODI. All participants who received an implant were included in the primary outcome analysis; participants who did not com - plete the 12-month visit were considered not to have had a response. Secondary outcome measures included self- reported sleepiness and disease-specific quality of life as assessed with the use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (scores range from 0.0 to 24.0, with higher scores indicating more daytime sleep - iness), disease-specific quality of life, as assessed with the use of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ; scores range from 5.0 to 20.0, with higher scores indicating greater func - tioning), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. FOLLOW-UP The follow-up visits at months 2, 6, and 12 in - cluded a polysomnographic study and evaluation of daytime sleepiness by means of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. An Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of less than 10.0 is considered to be the threshold for normal subjective sleepiness. 27 Participants also completed the FOSQ, on which a score of more than 17.9 is considered to be the threshold for persons with normal sleep-related quality of life. A change of 2.0 or more points in the FOSQ score is considered to indicate a clinically mean - ingful improvement in daily functioning. 28 During the polysomnographic studies at 2 months and 6 months, device variables were adjusted with the use of a programmer unit that communicates with the device by means of telemetry.

Upper-Airway Stimulation. The neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulating pulses to the hypoglossal nerve through the stimulation lead; the stimu - lating pulses are synchronized with ventilation detected by the sensing lead. For implantation of the device, the main trunk of the hypoglossal nerve (XII) was exposed by means of a horizontal incision in the upper neck at the inferior border of the submandibular gland. The nerve was followed anteromedially until it branched into a lateral and a medial (m-XII) division. The stimulation lead was placed on the m-XII branch. The cuff section of the stimulation lead includes three electrodes that can be arranged in a variety of unipolar or bipolar configurations for stimulation of the upper airway. Appropriate place - ment of the stimulation lead was confirmed by observing tongue protrusion during stimulation and by electromyographic monitoring during surgery. A second incision was made horizontally at the fourth intercostal region. The dissection was aimed at the upper border of the underlying rib. A tunnel was created posteroanteriorly between the external and internal intercostal muscles. The ventilatory sensor was placed in the tunnel, with the sensing side facing the pleura. A third incision was made horizontally, 2 to 4 cm inferior to the right clavicle. A pocket was created inferior to the incision and superficial to the pectoralis major muscle to accommodate the neurostimulator (implanted pulse generator). With a subcutaneous tunneling device, the leads of the stimulation electrode and the pressure sensor were led into the infraclavicular pocket and connected to the implanted pulse generator. Adequate functioning of the system was confirmed before closure. The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at Oregon Health & Science University Library on April 26, 2018.

Upper-Airway Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea n engl j med 370;2 nejm.org january 9, 2014143therapy-withdrawal group.29 This design filtered out persons who had not had a response to therapy. The therapy-withdrawal group had the device turned off for 7 days, whereas the therapy-maintenance group continued with the device turned on. Polysomnography was performed after the randomization period to measure the effects of therapy withdrawal, as compared with contin - ued use of the therapy. For the 12-month non - randomized phase of the study, participant en - rollment commenced on November 10, 2010, and ended on March 23, 2013. ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse events were reported and then reviewed and coded by the clinical-events committee. Seri - ous adverse events were defined as any events that led to death, life-threatening illness, perma - nent impairment, or new or prolonged hospital - ization with serious health impairment. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For the coprimary outcomes, the AHI and ODI scores at the 12-month follow-up were com - pared with the baseline measurements, which were the averages of the measurements ob - tained before implantation and at the 1-month preactivation visit, to determine a binary out - come of status with respect to response to the therapy. We estimated that 108 participants would need to be enrolled for the study to have 80% power to evaluate the primary outcome, with the exact one-sided binomial test set at a significance level of 2.5%. The changes in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and FOSQ scores from the preimplantation screening to the 12-month visit were calculated for each participant. P values from a paired t-test were calculated for the sec - ondary outcome measures. In the randomized controlled therapy- withdrawal trial, the difference in mean AHI scores (i.e., the difference between scores obtained at the 12-month visit in the nonrandomized phase and those obtained at the end of the randomized phase) was compared between the therapy-maintenance group and the therapy-withdrawal group. We esti - mated that 40 participants would need to undergo randomization in a 1:1 ratio in order for the study to have 80% power to detect a significant differ - ence between groups, at the 5% significance level, with the use of a two-sided t-test.RESULTS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS The study population consisted of 126 partici - pants (83% of whom were men), with a mean age of 54.5 years (range, 31 to 80) and mean BMI of 28.4 (range, 18.4 to 32.5). Per protocol, all the participants had a history of nonadherence to CPAP therapy; 17% of the participants had under - gone a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (surgery to re - move excess upper-airway tissue) for the treat - ment of obstructive sleep apnea. The mean time from the diagnosis of obstruc - tive sleep apnea to study enrollment was 5.6 years. The mean AHI score on preimplantation screen - ing polysomnography was 32.0 events per hour, and the mean ODI score was 28.9 events per hour. At the baseline visit before implantation, the mean FOSQ score was 14.3, and the mean Ep - worth Sleepiness Scale score was 11.6. The mean AHI score on the second baseline polysomnog-raphy was 31.9 events per hour. There was no significant difference between the two baseline AHI assessments (P = 0.83). A total of 124 of 126 participants (98%) com - pleted the follow-up at 12 months. The mean BMI at 12 months was 28.5, which did not differ significantly from the mean BMI at baseline. The characteristics of the study cohort at base - line are presented in Table 1 . Information on study enrollment, randomization, and follow-up are shown in Figure 2. SURGICAL IMPLANTATION The upper-airway stimulation device was success - fully implanted in all 126 participants. The medi - an time for surgical implantation was 140 minutes (range, 65 to 360). Participants were discharged after surgery on the same day (16% of partici - pants), the next day (79%), or the second day af - ter surgery (5%). PRIMARY OUTCOMES The scores on the AHI and ODI (primary out - come measures) were lower (indicating fewer episodes of sleep apnea) at 12 months than at baseline. The median AHI score decreased 68%, from the baseline value of 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour. The median ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour.

The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 370;2 nejm.org january 9, 2014144criteria for the coprimary outcome of a reduc- tion of at least 50% in the AHI score from base - line and an AHI score of less than 20 events per hour were met by 66% of the participants (83 of 126 participants; lower boundary of the 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 57). The criterion for the coprimary outcome of a reduction of at least 25% in the ODI score from baseline was met by 75% of participants (94 of 126; lower boundary of the 97.5% CI, 66). Both primary efficacy out - comes exceeded the predefined study objectives (Table 2). SECONDARY OUTCOMES Scores on the FOSQ and Epworth Sleepiness Scale indicated significant improvement at 12 months, as compared with baseline. The increase in the FOSQ score (mean change, 2.9 points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 3.5) exceeded the 2.0-point increase that is typically considered to be a clinically mean - ingful improvement. Similarly, the Epworth Sleep - iness Scale score at 12 months was consistent with normalization of the measure (i.e., score <10.0). The median percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90% de - creased from a baseline value of 5.4% to 0.9% at 12 months (Table 2).THERAPY-WITHDRAWAL STUDY Among the 46 consecutive participants with a re - sponse to therapy who underwent randomiza - tion, the demographic and clinical characteris - tics at baseline were similar with regard to age, BMI, neck size, and AHI and ODI scores. By de - sign, participants who had not had a response were not included in this part of the study. The AHI and ODI scores were similar in the two groups at 12 months (baseline of the randomized portion of the trial). There was a significant difference between the therapy- withdrawal group and the therapy-maintenance group with respect to the change in AHI scores from the beginning of the randomization pe - riod at 12 months to the assessment 1 week later. Among the 23 participants in the therapy- withdrawal group, the AHI score was sig - nificantly higher at the 1-week assessment than it was at the start of the randomized phase (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The average increase in the AHI score in the therapy- withdrawal group was 18.2 events per hour, whereas the av - erage increase in the therapy-maintenance group was 1.7 events per hour (difference in changes in mean scores, 16.4\u00b112.0 events per hour; P<0.001). A similar effect was observed with respect to the mean ODI scores (Fig. 3). ADVERSE EVENTS Two participants had a serious device-related ad - verse event requiring repositioning and fixation of the neurostimulator to resolve discomfort. A total of 33 serious adverse events not consid - ered to be related to the implantation procedure or implanted devices were reported. Most of non - serious adverse events related to the procedure (88%) occurred within 30 days after implantation and were expected postsurgical events, including sore throat from intubation, pain at the incision site, and muscle soreness. A total of 18% of the participants had tempo - rary tongue weakness after surgery, which re - solved over a period of days to weeks. No perma - nent tongue weakness was reported during the study. Among device-related events that were not considered to be serious, 40% of the participants reported some discomfort associated with stim - ulation, and 21% reported tongue soreness, in - cluding abrasion on the lower side of the tongue. These events were related to the functional Table 1. Characteristics of the Study Population at Baseline.* CharacteristicParticipants (N = 126) Age \u2014 yr 54.5\u00b110.2 Male sex \u2014 no.

Most of these events resolved after the participants acclimated to the upper-airway stimulation ther - apy or after the device was reprogrammed to adjust the stimulation variables. In nine partici - pants, a tooth guard was used to resolve tongue soreness or abrasion related to the device. The overall rate of serious adverse events was less than 2%.

DISCUSSION Patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea may not have consistent clinical ben - efit from CPAP therapy owing to poor adherence to treatment. 30 These patients, if left untreated, remain at considerable risk for cardiovascular complications and death. In the current study, unilateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve, synchronous with ventilation, resulted in sig-nificant and clinically meaningful reductions in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and self- reported sleepiness and improvements in quality-of-life measures at 1 year. The observed response rates, which were based on the primary outcome measures of AHI and ODI, consistently exceeded the previously defined threshold for surgical suc-cess. 12 The reduction in sleepiness and improve - ment in quality-of-life measures at 12 months were similar to previously reported effects of CPAP on moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. 28 The effect of stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve with respect to obstructive events was first described by Schwartz et al. in 1993 in a feline model. 31 Subsequent studies showed that stimu - lation of the genioglossal muscle or the hypo - glossal nerve could reverse inspiratory flow limitation during sleep. 17 The current study ex - tended the observations that were reported by Eastwood et al. over a period of 6 months in a single-group interventional trial. 18 The feasibility studies conducted by our team identified a BMI of 32 or lower or an AHI score of 50 events per hour or less as phenotypic risk factors that fa - vorably affect the success of upper-airway stimu - lation. 22,25 This approach may not be appropriate for persons with excessive airway collapsibility.32 Screening potential participants by means of 724 Underwent screening929 Patients were enrolled 205 Were excluded at enrollment 108 Did not meet inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria 60 Withdrew consent 21 Were withdrawn because study implantation limit wasreached 13 Were lost to follow-up before implantation 3 Had other reason for with- drawal before implantation 1 Died from a cardiac event thought to be unrelated to the device1 Elected to remove device598 Were excluded at screening Polysomnography 347 Had AHI score <20 87 Had AHI score >5050 Had central sleep apnea 45 Had positional obstructive sleep apnea Surgeon consultation 4 Had tonsil size 3 or 49 Had other unfavorable anatomical feature Sleep endoscopy 54 Had complete concentric palatal collapse 2 Had other reason 126 Underwent implantation 126 Were included in 1-mo follow-up 126 Were included in 2-, 3-, 6-, and 9-mo follow-up 124 Were included in 12-mo follow-up Figure 2.

A total of 126 participants underwent implan - tation. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) measures the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour. A tonsil size of 3 indicates that the tonsils are visible beyond the pillars, and a tonsil size of 4 that they extend to the midline.

None of the implantation procedures resulted in serious complications, participant rehospitaliza - tions, or explantations because of infection. The serious adverse events in the two participants who required repositioning and fixation of the neurostimulator occurred 30 days after implan - tation and were related primarily to discomfort at the device location. The electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve evokes a functional re - sponse of the tongue muscles and an anterior displacement of the tongue. The patient can feel the anterior displacement of the tongue during wakefulness when the stimulation is turned on. Similar to CPAP, therapeutic stimulation variables were determined during attended in-laboratory sleep studies. The implanted upper-airway stimulation de - Table 2.

Two participants did not complete follow-up at 12 months: one participant died unexpectedly 10 months after implantation owing to a cardiac event that was not thought to be related to the implant, and one requested explantation of the device because of personal choice. In the primary-outcome analysis, both partici-pants were considered not to have had a response to therapy. Means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges are presented because some variables (e.g., the 12-month scores on the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] and oxygen desaturation index [ODI]) show evidence of nonnormality. The AHI score indicates the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour; a score of 15 or more events per hour indi-cates moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. The ODI score indicates the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by 4 percentage points or more from baseline. \u00a7 Scores on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) range from 5.0 to 20.0, with higher scores indicat-ing better functioning. A score of more than 17.9 is considered to be the threshold for persons with normal sleep-relat-ed quality of life. A change of 2.0 or more points in the score is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improve-ment of daily functioning. 28 Data at 12 months were missing for one participant in addition to the two who did not complete the 12-month follow-up. \u00b6 Scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale range from 0.0 to 24.0, with lower scores indicating less daytime sleepiness. Data at 12 months were missing for one participant in addition to the two who did not complete the 12-month follow-up.

Upper-Airway Stimulation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea n engl j med 370;2 nejm.org january 9, 2014147vice eliminated adherence issues associated with wearing a CPAP mask. The daily use of upper-airway stimulation was 86%, as assessed on the basis of self-report (see the Supplementary Ap - pendix). Objective use of the device, quantified as the time spent using the device each night, could not be directly reported with the current generation of the device. The average stimula - tion time per night was measured. This value accounts for the time predominately associated with the inspiratory phase of the breathing cycle. Assuming a normal duty cycle of 1:2.0 or 1:1.5, the average objective use would be in excess of 5 hours per night (see the Supplementary Ap - pendix). Additional objective data on adherence will be required to confirm the findings of the current study. The current study was designed to assess the severity and symptoms of obstructive sleep ap - nea before the implantation of the upper-airway stimulation device as compared with 12 months after implantation, with the use of a prospec - tive single-group trial design in which the par - ticipants served as their own controls. Only par ticipants who could not use CPAP, or who declined to do so, were recruited for the study. A control group of therapeutic CPAP users (i.e., a comparative-effectiveness design) would be im - practical, given the current study design. Some participants had a significant increase in the AHI score at month 12 (see the Supple - mentary Appendix). An additional analysis of the association between the baseline character - istics and outcome measures did not identify predictors that differentiated between participants who had a response and those who did not. The randomized, controlled therapy- withdrawal study in which some participants had the therapy turned off for 1 week provided evidence that the therapeutic effect established at 12 months was attributable to the upper-airway stimulation therapy, rather than variability in the AHI score. The randomized phase included only consecu - tive participants who had had a response to therapy and, as a result, does not provide infor - mation on participants who did not have a re - sponse to therapy. By design, this trial enrolled participants with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep ap - nea who had various difficulties adhering to CPAP and who did not have clinically signifi - cant central or mixed sleep apnea or complete Figure 3. Primary Outcomes at 12 Months after Implanta - tion and during the Randomized, Therapy-Withdrawal Trial. After 12 months, 46 consecutive participants who had a re - sponse to therapy were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to the therapy-maintenance group or the therapy-withdrawal group. The therapy-withdrawal group had the device turned off for at least 5 days during this phase, and it remained off until polysomnography was performed. The therapy-maintenance group continued nightly use of the device. There was a significant difference between the therapy-withdrawal group and the therapy-maintenance group with respect to the change in the apnea-hypopnea index score from the assessment at 12 months of the cohort study to the assessment at the end of the therapy-withdrawal study (difference in changes in mean scores, 16.4 events per hour; P<0.001) (Panel A). A similar effect was observed for the mean oxygen desaturation index scores (the num - ber of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by 4 percentage points from baseline) (Panel B).

Abstract Objective. Selective stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve is a new surgical therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, withproven efficacy in well-designed clinical trials. The aim of thestudy is to obtain additional safety and efficacy data on theuse of selective upper airway stimulation during daily clinicalroutine. Study Design. Prospective single-arm study. Setting. Three tertiary hospitals in Germany (Munich, Mannheim, Lu \u00a8beck). Subjects and Methods. A multicenter prospective single-arm study under a common implant and follow-up protocol took p l a c ei n3G e r m a nc e n t e r s( M a n n h e i m ,M u n i c h ,L u \u00a8beck). Every patient who received an implant of selective upper airway sti-mulation was included in this trial (apnea-hypopnea index /C2115/ ha n d/C2065/h and body mass index \\35 kg/m 2). Before and 6 months after surgery, a 2-night home sleep test was per-formed. Data regarding the safety and efficacy were collected. Results. From July 2014 through October 2015, 60 patients were included. Every subject reported improvement in sleepand daytime symptoms. The aver a g eu s a g et i m eo ft h es y s t e m was 42.9 611.9 h/wk. The median apnea-hypopnea index was significantly reduced at 6 mon ths from 28.6/h to 8.3/h. No patient required surgical revision of the implanted system. Conclusion. Selective upper airway stimulation is a safe and effective therapy for patients with obstructive sleep apneaand represents a powerful option for its surgical treatment. Keywords obstructive sleep apnea, surgical treatment, hypoglossal nerve, selective upper airway stimulation, German postmar-ket study Received June 30, 2016; revised September 23, 2016; accepted November 18, 2016.Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has an increased preva- lence over the prior decades, present in 6% of womenand 13% of men in the United States. 1Continuous posi- tive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard therapy; how- ever, it is limited by adherence and acceptance issues. Alternative treatment options have been deve loped, including upper airway stimulation (UAS) per respiration-synchronized sti- mulation of the hypoglossal nerve.2,3This approach to electrical stimulation based on implante d neuromodulation technology was demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment for OSA in arecent large clinical trial. 3For selected patients with moderate to severe OSA who were CPAP intole rant, the UAS system reduced OSA severity both objectively, as measured by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and subjec-tively, through improved quality -of-life measures\u2014namely, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Functional Outcomes ofSleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)\u2014al l evaluated at 12 months postim- plantation. 3Randomized withdrawal of therapy for 1 week at 13 months resulted in return of AHI, ODI, ESS, and FOSQ to base-line levels, and reactivation reestablished therapeutic efficacy as measured at 18 months. 4More recently, long-term follow-up of the study cohort reported sustained treatment effects and therapyadherence after 24 and 36 months of implantation. 5,6In addition, 2 single-center studies in a clini cal practice setting demonstrated that UAS was associated with hi gh adherence, low morbidity, and significantly decreased AHI.7,8 Previous studies have identifie d specific selection criteria for patients who are likely to respond to UAS.9-13Individuals with body mass index \\32 or\\35 kg/m2had a lower AHI at 6 1Department of of and Surgery, University- Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany 3Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Lu \u00a8beck, Lu \u00a8beck, Germany This article was presented at the 2016 AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO; September 18-21, 2016; San Diego, California. Corresponding Author: with treatment.3,9,12-14A specific pattern of collapse\u2014 namely, complete concentric collapse at the retropalatalairway\u2014during a screening drug-induced sedated endoscopyprior to implantation was asso ciated with reduced level of response. 10The complete concentric collapse pattern can be found in .20% of otherwise suitable candidates and is associ- ated with higher body mass index and AHI.15These success/ failure predictors me rit additional supporting evidence from the clinical practice setting for their utility in ongoing patient selection. This multicenter prospective study focuses on objective and patient-reported outcomes and therapy adherence ofUAS for treatment of OSA in a clinical practice setting at 3 academic centers. The study intends to determine if treat- ment outcome reported in a previous controlled clinical trialsetting can be achieved in a routine clinical setting. Methods This multicenter prospective clinical trial included OSApatients who received an implanted UAS system (InspireMedical Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). The study was approved by the ethics committee at all 3 institutions and was registered as NCT02293746 on clinicaltrials.gov. Patient Selection Key study selection criteria w ere based on those established from the STAR trial.3Patients with a history of moderate to severe OSA and nonadherence to CPAP underwent screeningfor qualification of implantatio n as part of routine clinical prac- tice. Patients with body mass index .35 kg/m 2were excluded. Additional screening included a 2-night home sleep test anddrug-induced sedated endoscopy. P atients were excluded if they presented with AHI \\15 or.65, central sleep apnea .25% of total AHI, or complete concent ric collapse at the velopharynx during drug-induced sedated endoscopy. Implantation The surgical implantation proce was in accor- dance with previously estab lished operative techniques.16,17The standardized operative pro cedure included (1) placing a cuff electrode on the distal bra nches of the hypoglossal nerve to stimulate the tongue protrusors, (2) inserting an implanted pulsegenerator in the right upper chest , and (3) placing a respiratory sensing lead between external and internal intercostal muscles of the ribs. The targeted stimulation site on the hypoglossal nerve aimed to recruit genioglossu s and transversal/vertical mus- while excluding styloglossu s and hyoglossus muscle Furthermore, a branch of the first cranial nerve\u2014which isresponsible for the geniohyoid mus cle activation and which runs parallel to the hypoglossal nerve \u2014was also included when fea- sible. Both intraoperative nerve monitoring and visualization oftongue motion were used to conf irm proper electrode place- ment, 17,18as shown in Figure 1 . All patients were discharged on their regular diets and were advised to avoid strenuous physical activities involv-ing the right arm\u2014ipsilateral side of implant\u2014for 2 weekspostoperatively. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis The device was activated 1 month after implantation, fol-lowed by a month of therapy acclimatization, with patientsgradually increasing the stimulation amplitude to optimizeboth comfort and subjective effectiveness. Between months2 and 6, in-laboratory titration studies were conducted to optimize therapy during polysomnography (ie, full polysom- nography titration). While the majority of patients requiredonly 1 titration night, some warranted a second titration tofurther optimize and individualize therapy. Fifteen patientshad a second titration night after 3 months of implantation.This was conducted if the first titration night was not accep-table, and the decision was made at each implant center.During the second overnight polysomnography, advanced testing of specific electrode configurations, stimulation timing, and impulse settings was performed, all of whichwere not routinely tested during the first polysomnography.Two-night home sleep test studies were recorded with levelIII polygraphy systems to determine objective outcomes at 6 Figure 1. Schematic and intraoperative figure of the terminating hypoglossal nerve branches. Green ellipse indicates branches targeted for et al 379months without device adjustment. The objective outcomes of AHI and ODI were scored with standard 2007 scoringcriteria, 19with hypopnea scored according to 30% airflow reduction and 4% oxygen desaturation. Patient-reported out- comes included ESS and the FOSQ at baseline (preimplant) and months 2 and 6 (postimplant). The treatment andfollow-up pathway, as applied, is shown in Figure 2 . SPSS 23.0 software (IBM, Chicago, Illinois) was used. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic vari-ables. Paired ttest was used to compare baseline and post- implantation values. Data are given as median and mean 6 SD.Pvalues/C20.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Characteristics of the Participants Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1 .T h em a j o r i t y of participants presented wit h moderate to severe OSA during the screening sleep studies and moderate symptoms of daytime sleepiness and diminished OS A-relevant qu ality of life. All patients had failed CPAP as a first-line treatment. Among them, 14 patients had also attempted oral appliance therapy but could not maintain adherence, primarily due to insufficient efficacy. A total of 15 patients had prior upperairway OSA operations, which included uvulopalatopharyn-goplasty (UPPP), uvulopalatal flap, genioglossus tongue base reduction, advancement/stabilization ofthe tongue base, and epiglottoplasty.Surgical Implantation The average implantation procedures were 160.0 635.9 minutes in duration, ranging from 113 to 329 minutes.Right tongue base or bilateral protrusion was confirmedwith perioperative stimulation testing among all patients.Only 1 patient did not show a clear protrusion during the implant procedure but subsequently demonstrated right tongue base protrusion at postoperative visits. Polygraphic Outcomes The objective outcome from the po lygraphic study consisted of 2-night at-home sleep studies at baseline for screening prior to implant and again at 6 months postoperatively for therapy efficacy validation (see Table 2 andFigure 3 ). The average values of the 2 home sleep studies were used for comparisonanalysis. Out of 60 participants, 56 completed the 6-monthpolygraphy studies. Of the 4 pa tients who did not complete the 6-month visit, 4 underwent a UPPP surgery after the 2-monthtitration studies and missed the 6-month visit. Among the 56 patients who completed the 6-month visit, an average AHI reduction of 61% 624% compared with baseline was achieved. At the 6-month visit, 25% of patientspresented with an AHI /C205 events hour; 59% patients, AHI/C2010/h; and 70% /C2015/h. Per the Sher cri- teria (AHI \\20 with at least 50% reduction), 68% patients were classified as responders. 20With the 4 patients who underwent a UPPP and missed the 6-month visit, a successrate of 63% was found. There was a statistically significant reduction in ODI, apnea index, hypopnea index, and mini- mal SpO 2nadir from baseline to 6 months. Total and per- centage sleep time with SpO 2\\90% decreased, though neither achieved statistical significance. Patient-Reported Outcomes At the 2-month visit, there was significant reduction in day- time sleepiness as measured by the ESS and significant improvement in daytime functioning as measured by theFOSQ compared with baseline. Both ESS and FOSQ scoresfurther improved at the 6-month visit from the baseline aswell as the 2-month visit (see Table 3 ). Adverse Events Two procedure-related adverse events were recorded. In both cases, bleeding occurred during tunneling of the Figure 2. Treatment and follow-up pathway of selective upper airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea.

Five patients reported postoperative pain related tothe incisions. There was 1 instance of acute tongue numb-ness and 1 incidence of dysarthria, and both resolved within 2 months without further incident. Three device-related adverse events were reported, all 3 relating to painful stimulation sensation in the period aftertherapy activation. One of these was a complaint of mildpain at all 3 device locations, and this patient continues tobe monitored. The other instances of postactivation painresolved without intervention or issue, resolving as patientsacclimated to therapy use. One patient complained of speech difficulties after the therapy was activated, but this was resolved through reprogramming the stimulation energyfield parameters, thereby improving the patient's subjectiveexperience while maintaining suitable objective tonguemotion as assessed by the managing physician. Therapy Use Device interrogation at the 6-month visit indicated 42.9 6 11.9 h/wk (range, 9-64 h/wk) of therapy use among all patients, based on recording by the implanted device. The average stimulation amplitude was 1.9 60.6 V (range, 1.0-3.5) and 1.9 60.6 V (range, 1.0-3.9) at the 2- and 6-month visits, respectively. Discussion In this multicenter prospective study, UAS reduced OSA severity and improved patient-reported outcomes. Seventy percent of the study cohort reached AHI \\15 at 6 months' postimplant. This result was consistent with the STAR trialoutcomes reported at 12, 18, and 36 months of follow-up. 3,5 Patient-reported outcomes measured by ESS and FOSQdemonstrated a similar degree of improvement as in theSTAR trial. No serious adverse events were observed, andminor complaints and side effects were either managed in the outpatient clinic setting or resolved spontaneously via therapy acclimatization. Therapy acceptance and adherencewere high, as shown by objective device usage data. The study followed the current routine clinical practice for patient selection, operative techniques, and therapy titra-tion. The key patient selection criteria included body massindex\\35, AHI between 15 and 65, and absence of com- plete concentric collapse at the soft palate during drug- induced sedated endoscopy. The implant techniques were standardized in this study as well as in clinical practice toTable 2.

P\\.05 vs baseline.Heiser et al 381include (1) the protrusor branches of the hypoglossal nerve, which innervate the genioglossus muscle, and (2) the stif- fener branches of the transverse/vertical muscles, whileexcluding all that innervate the styloglos-sus and hyoglossus muscles. 17All patients enrolled in this study displayed either contralateral extension or bilateralprotrusion of the tongue upon stimulation. Heiser et alshowed a clear association of selective stimulation of pro-trusor muscles for better therapy outcomes, when excluding all branches of the retractor muscles. 18The current study reflected a consistent implementation of the standardizedoperative techniques. 17There is a considerable proportion of genioglossus muscle fibers that receive innervation fromthe hypoglossal nerve in the contralateral side, which mayexplain the bilateral protrusion observed, despite the overtlyunilateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve (ie, crosstalkfrom right to left) seen in an extensive proportion of patients. 21 Adverse events were rare. The surgical procedure was safe, and the few adverse events were solved without seque-lae. Regarding the bleeding during tunneling, evidence withknowledge of patient anatomy would suggest that these minor bleeds are attributable to either an anterior branch ofthe external jugular vein or a prominent vein of the sterno-cleidomastoid muscle. Conservative management of suchtunneling bleeds by external compression was the mostappropriate approach to manage this complication. If neces- sary, a small fourth incision for direct visualization of the lacerated vein and accompanying closure with suture orequivalent may be performed. Neurapraxia of the hypoglos-sal and/or marginal mandibular nerves, potentially associ-ated with this procedure, were infrequent and transientwithin this patient population, consistent with the STARtrial. This multicenter study and an earlier single-center study reported objective therapy use of UAS of approximately 6 to 7 hours per night based on information retrieved from theimplanted device after 6 months. 7,8Although additional adherence data are needed for longer follow-up duration,the adherence of UAS at 6 months is considerably higherthan the average 4.7 hours per night for CPAP use asreported in the APPLES study after 6 months 22and 3.7 to 4.7 hours per night reported in the HomePAP study after 3 months.23This current study cohort included patients who previously could not adhere to CPAP. The improved adher-ence with UAS is suggestive of its clinical utility for longi-tudinal patient management for OSA symptoms and risksfrom OSA-related comorbidities, meriting further prospec-tive study. In addition, patients qualifying for this UAS therapy, a priori, skewed toward failure by virtue of being demonstra- bly refractory to successful treatment with CPAP, as a pre- condition to qualify for UAS. One plausible explanationmay be that patients choosing to undergo significant surgeryfor such a device are probably better educated in terms ofOSA and its sequelae with the necessity of treatment. It iswidely accepted and reasonably well validated that patientswho are recipients of concomitant educational, supportive,and behavioral interventions are improving their CPAP usage over time, and that is likely the case with UAS as well for this patient phenotype. 24Finally, patients who are profound sufferers of untreated OSA would be more likelyto select UAS versus patients with minimal symptoms and Table 3.

Our data sup-port the already-published UAS study results showing thatpatients nonadherent to CPAP can be adherent to UAS ifproperly selected. Of further interest as it pertains to hypothesis generation, a recent systematic review found that a 1-hour-per-nightincrease in CPAP use was associated with an additionalreduction of systolic blood pressure of 1.5 mm Hg. 25The improved UAS therapy use may have clinical implicationsfor reducing cardiovascular risks associated with untreatedOSA. This area, of course, needs to be studied through fur-ther clinical trials. In comparing the surgical treatment of UAS and its safety profile with other OSA operations, the procedureseems to be safe and without long-lasting side effects fortypical patients. Two cases (3%) were reported with bleed-ing during tunneling, both of which were resolved withoutany sequelae. Another instance occurred during previousphases of UAS study and was similarly resolved. Numbnessof tongue and dysarthria for a few days after surgery were reported in 2 other cases. As compared with similar types of nerve dissection/surgery, the incidence numbers are accepta-bly low. In parotid surgery, the temporary facial palsy rateis around 40.2% on the first postoperative day and 1.6% at12 months. 26If the subjective dysarthria is a result of a palsy of the hypoglossal nerve, then the equivalent risk is \\2% for the first postoperative days and 0% for the long term, representing a suitably low morbidity for essential hypoglossal nerve functioning in the postsurgical and chronic settings. The small numbers of reported numbnessof the tongue cannot readily be explained by the UAS sur-gery, due to its widely accepted functions for efferent-onlymotor innervation; yet, perhaps the lingual nerve) and traumatized through retraction elements of accessing, visualizing, and placing the sti- mulation cuff around the hypoglossal nerve. Furthermore, this clinical trial shows that even the self- reported outcomes of the patients significantly improved (asmeasured by the ESS and FOSQ). Polysomnography mea-sures alone do not capture important aspects of OSA. Thequality of life depending on daytime sleepiness could beenhanced. This effect has clinical and economic relevance. Overall, surgical treatment with a fully implanted electro- therapeutic device system for selective UAS appears to be a safe procedure in the clinical setting. Additionally, in theevent that the therapy is ultimately unsuitable for a particularpatient, there is no overt anatomy-altering element to thisprocedure, and it is essentially reversible for such patientswho may choose to have an underperforming system com-pletely explanted (ie, reversible vs a failed UPPP). Conclusion Selective UAS reduced OSA severity and improved patient-reported quality-of-life outcom e measures. Therapy adherencewas high after 6 months of follo w-up. Surgical and stimulation- related morbidity were low. Th is multicenter study further strengthened the evidence that th et r e a t m e n tc a nb es u c c e s s f u l l y translated from the previous cont rolled trial setting into routine clinical practice.

Robotic Assist Surgery 1 Question : Should robotic assist surgery be placed on the non -cost effective services line? Question source : Holly Jo Hodges, MD, CCO medical director Issue : HCPCS S2900 (Surgical techniques requiring use of robotic surgical system) is currently Ancillary, but closed to payment. CCOs have been routinely denying these claims due to lack of a fee schedule entry. However, Dr. Hodges is concerned that if the codes remains on the Ancillary List, it will be open to claims and hard to deny payment. Sh e is requesting a review of this technology. In robotic -assisted surgery, the same instruments used in laparoscopic surgery are connected to a robotic device that allows for 3 -dimensional visualization, greater range of motion of the instruments, and impr oved ergonomics for the surgeon. Extensive marketing and competition among hospitals have led to widespread use of robotic surgery for a broad range of procedures, but it remains controversial because of its increased costs and lack of evidence of improved outcomes compared with non -robotic minimally invasive approaches. Evidence : Note: systematic reviews and meta -analyses are included for various types of surgeries 1) Liu 2016 , Cochrane review of robotic assisted gynecologic surgery : http://cochranelibrary - wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011422/epdf a. N=6 RCTs (517 i. N=4 for hysterectomy (317 patients) ii. N=2 sacrocopopexy (146 women) iii. Compared robotic assist to conven tional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) or vaginal hysterectomy b. Moderate -quality evidence was found for the effects of RAS on intraoperative injury when compared with CLS (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.46; participants = 415; studies = 5; I2 = 0%), along with low -quality evidence for bleeding and infection complications. c. Mean total operating time was consistent across procedures and on average was about 42 minutes longer in the RAS arm compared with the CLS arm (95%CI 17 to 66 minutes; participants = 294; studies = 4 ; I2 = 82%; moderate -quality evidence). d. Mean hospital stay for hysterectomy procedures was on average about seven hours shorter in the RAS arm than in the CLS arm (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% CI - 0.54 to -0.06; participants = 217; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; low -quality evidence). e. Limited data from two studies suggest that RAS for sacrocolpopexy may be associated with increased postoperative pain compared with CLS; this needs further investigation. f. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain as to whether RAS or CLS has lower intraoperative and postoperative complication rates because of the imprecision of the effect and inconsistency among studies when they are used for hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy. Moderate -quality evidence suggests that these procedures take longer with RAS but may be associated with a shorter hospital stay following hysterectomy. We found limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of RAS compared with CLS or open surgery for surgical procedures perfo rmed for gynaecological cancer; therefore its use should be limited to clinical trials. Robotic Assist Surgery 2 2) Ilic 2017 , Cochrane review of laparoscopic (LRP) and robotic prostatectomy (RARP) surgery vs open surgery a. N=2 RCTs (446 patients) b. Based on data from on e trial, RARP likely results in little to no difference in urinary quality of life (MD -1.30, 95% CI -4.65 to 2.05) and sexual quality of life (MD 3.90, 95% CI - 1.84 to 9.64). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for both quality of life outcomes, downgrading for study limitations. c. Based on one trial, RARP may result in little to no difference in overall surgical complications (RR 0.41, 95%CI 0.16 to 1.04) or serious postoperative complications (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.32). We rated the quality o f evidence as low for both surgical complications, downgrading for study limitations and imprecision. d. Based on two studies, LRP or RARP may result in a small, possibly unimportant improvement in postoperative pain at one day (MD - 1.05, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.68 ) and up to one week (MD -0.78, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.17).We rated the quality of evidence for both time points as low, downgrading for study limitations and imprecision. e. Based on one study, RARP likely results in little to no difference in postoperative pain at 12 weeks (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.34). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations. f. Based on one study, RARP likely reduces the length of hospital stay (MD -1.72, 95% CI - 2.19 to -1.25). We rated the quality o f evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations. g. Based on two stud ies, LRP or RARP may reduce the frequency of blood transfusions (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.46). Assuming a baseline risk for a blood transfusion to be 8.9%, LRP or RARP would resul t in 68 fewer blood transfusions per 1000 men (95% CI 78 fewer to 48 fewer). We rated the quality of evidence as low, downgrading for study limitations and indirectness. h. Authors' conclusions There is no high -quality evidence to inform the comparative effectiveness of LRP or RARP compared to ORP for oncological outcomes. Urinary and sexual quality of life -related outcomes appear similar. Overall and serious postoperative complication rates appear similar. The difference in postoperative pain may be minimal. Men undergoing LRP or RARP may have a shorter hospital stay and receive fewer blood transfusions. All available outcome data were short -term, and this study was unable to account for surgeon volume or experience. 3) Lang 2014 , Systematic Review and Meta -anal ysis Comparing Robotic -Assisted Thyroidectomy (RT) and Thyroidectomy (COT) a. N=11 studies (no RCTs), 2,375 patients b. RT was significantly associated with longer operating time ( p<0.001), hospital stay ( p = 0.023) and higher temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury ( p = 0.016) c. Blood loss ( p = 0.485), temporary (p = 0.333) and permanent p = 0.599) hypocalcemia, hematoma ( = 0.602), and overall morbidity ( p = 0.880) appeared comparable. Two (0.2 %) brachial plexus injuries in R T were reported in one study. d. Conclusions. Relative to OT, RT was associated with significantly longer operating time, longer hospital stay, and higher temporary RLN injury rate but comparable permanent complications and overall morbidity. Given some of th e limitations with the literature and the potential added surgical risks and morbidity in RT, application of the robot in thyroid surgery should be carefully and thoroughly discussed before one decides on the procedure. Robotic Assist Surgery 3 4) Hyun 2013 , Systematic review and met a-analysis of robotic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic and open resections for gastric carcinoma a. N=9 non -randomized observational studies (7200 patients) b. Robotic assisted gastrectomy (RAG) was associated with longer operating times than laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) and open gastrectomy (OG; weighted mean difference 61 .99 and 65 .73 min respectively; P 0.001). c. The number of retrieved lymph nodes and the resection margin length in RAG were comparable with those of LAG and OG. d. Estimated blood loss was significantly less in RAG than in OG ( P =0.002), but not LAG. Mean hospital stay for RAG was similar to that for LAG ( P =0.14). In contrast, hospital stay was significantly shorter, by a mean of 2 .18 days, for RAG compared with OG ( P <0.001). Postoperative complications were similar for all three operative approaches. e. Conclusion: Short -term oncological outcomes of RA G were comparable with those of the other approaches. LAG was a shorter procedure and less expensive than RAG. Future studies involving RAG should focus on minimizing duration of operation and reducing cost. 5) Marcus 2014 , systematic review of fluoroscopy gu ided vs robotic assist pedicle screw placement a.

The findings of these studies are mixed, with limited higher level of evidence data favoring fluoroscopy -guided procedu res, and remaining comparative studies supporting robot -assisted pedicle screw placement. c. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to unequivocally recommend one surgical technique over the other. Given the high cost of robotic systems, and the high risk of spinal surgery, further high quality studies are required to address unresolved clinical equipoise in this field.

N=23,753 use of robotic -assisted nephrectomy increased substantially over the course of the study, from 1.5% (39 of 2676 cases) in 20 03 to 27% (862 of 3194 cases) by 2015. c. In the weighted -adjusted analysis, there were no significant differences between robotic -assisted and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the incidence of any (Clavien grades 1 -5) postoperative complications (adjuste d 5.4 to 3.0%) or major (Clavien grades 3 (adjusted vs 3.8%, difference, 0.3%; 95%CI, 1.0% to 0.5%). d. The rate of prolonged operating time (>4 hours) for patients undergoing t he robotic - assisted procedure was higher than for patients receiving the laparoscopic procedure in the adjusted analysis (46.3%vs 25.8%; risk 95%CI, 14.2%to 26.8%). e. Robotic -assisted radical nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90 -day direct hospital costs ($19 530 vs $16 851; difference, $2678; 95%CI, $838 to $4519), $5378; difference, $1839; 95%CI, $1050 95%CI, $473 to $1498 ). f. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of robotic -assistance was not associated with increased risk of any or major complications but was associated with prolonged operating time and higher hospital costs compared with laparoscopic surgery. Robotic Assist Surgery 4 Other coverage policies : CMS does not have a NCD for robotic assisted surgery, but does not pay for this service. Private insurers are mixed on payment for robotic assist surgery. Most hospitals are absorbing the additional cost of this surgery. Currently, CCOs and HS D are not paying for robotic assisted surgery.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2017, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009625.pub2. by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Prostate cancer is commonly diagnosed in men worldwide. Surger y, in the form of radical prostatectomy, is one of the main forms of treatment for men with localised prostate cancer. Prostatect omy has traditionally been performed as open surgery, typica lly via a retropubic approach. The advent of laparoscopic approaches, i ncluding robotic-assisted, provides a minimally invasive alt ernative to open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Objectives T o assess the effects of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or r obotic-assisted radical prostatectomy compared to open radical p rostate- ctomy in men with localised prostate cancer. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) and abstract proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication s tatus, up until 9 June 2017. We also searched bibliographies o f included studies and conference proceedings. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a dire ct comparison of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and rob otic- radical prostatectomy (RARP) to ORP , including pseudo -RCTs. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently classied studies and abst racted data. The primary outcomes were prostate cancer-specic su rvival, urinary quality of life and sexual quality of life. Secondary outcomes were biochemical recurrence-free survival, overall sur vival, overall surgical complications, serious postoperative surgical compli cations, postoperative pain, hospital stay and blood transf usions. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model a nd assessed the quality of the evidence according to GRADE. 1 Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical pro statectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Main results We included two unique studies with 446 randomised participan ts with clinically localised prostate cancer. The mean age, prost ate volume, and prostate-specic antigen (PSA) of the participants were 61.3 years, 49.78 mL, and 7.09 ng/mL, respectively. Primary outcomes We found no study that addressed the outcome of prostate cancer-s pecic survival. Based on data from one trial, RARP likely res ults in little to no difference in urinary quality of life (MD -1.30, 9 5% CI -4.65 to 2.05) and sexual quality of life (MD 3.90, 95% CI - 1.84 to 9.64). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for b oth quality of life outcomes, downgrading for study limitati ons. Secondary outcomes We found no study that addressed the outcomes of biochemical recu rrence-free survival or overall survival. Based on one trial, RARP may result in little to no difference i n overall surgical complications (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.04) or serious postoperative complications (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.32). We ra ted the quality of evidence as low for both surgical complication s, downgrading for study limitations and imprecision. Based on two studies, LRP or RARP may result in a small, possib ly unimportant improvement in postoperative pain at one day (MD - 1.05, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.68 ) and up to one week (MD -0.78, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.17). We rated the quality of evidence for both time- points as low, downgrading for study limitations and impreci sion. Based on one study, RARP likely results in little to no d ifference in postoperative pain at 12 weeks (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.34). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations. Based on one study, RARP likely reduces the length of hospital stay (MD -1.72, 95% CI -2.19 to -1.25). We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, downgrading for study limitations. Based on two study, LRP or RARP may reduce the frequency of blood transfusions (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.46). Assuming a baseline risk for a blood transfusion to be 8.9%, LRP or RARP w ould result in 68 fewer blood transfusions per 1000 men (95% CI 78 fewer to 48 fewer). We rated the quality of evidence as low, down grading for study limitations and indirectness. We were unable to perform any of the prespecied secondary anal yses based on the available evidence. All available outcome da ta were short-term and we were unable to account for surgeon volume or ex perience. Authors' conclusions There is no high-quality evidence to inform the comparative eff ectiveness of LRP or RARP compared to ORP for oncological outcomes . Urinary and sexual quality of life-related outcomes appear si milar. Overall and serious postoperative complication rates appear similar. The difference in postoperative pain may be minimal . Men undergoing LRP or RARP may have a shorter hospital stay and re ceive fewer blood transfusions. All available outcome data we re short- term, and this study was unable to account for surgeon volume or experience.

Background Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men, often treated by surgical removal. T raditionally, surgeons used to make an incision on the lower abdomen to take the prostate. This procedure is calle d open radical prostatectomy (ORP). More recently, surgeons have started to use other ways to perform the same operation. Lapa roscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) allows surgeons to work in side the patient with long instruments and a tiny camera through small incisions. Laparoscopic surgery can be done with the use of a rob otic device, which allows the surgeon to have a magnied, three-dime nsional view and operate from a console, away from the patient . This procedure is called robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP ). It is unclear whether the newer LRP and RARP approaches are bet ter for patients. 2 Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical pro statectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Study characteristics This review identied two randomised controlled trials of 44 6 men with prostate cancer, with an average age of approximatel y 60 years, that compared LRP or RARP to ORP . Key results We found no evidence as to how LRP or RARP compared to ORP in terms of reducing the risk of dying from prostate cancer, preventing the cancer from coming back or dying of any cause. Mens' quality of l ife was likely similar related to their urinary and sexual fu nction. There appears to be no differences in postoperative surgical co mplications. LRP or RARP may have a small possibly unimportan t effect on postoperative pain at one day and up to one week. Howe ver, no difference between RARP and ORP was found at 12 weeks postoperatively. Men having LRP or RARP likely have a shorte r hospital stay and may need fewer blood transfusions. Quality of evidence We found no trial evidence for any cancer outcome. The evidence for quality of life were moderate; that for overall and serious s urgical complications were low quality. Postoperative pain were low (u p to one week) and moderate (at 12 weeks) quality of evidence. Th e quality of evidence for hospital stay and blood transfusions were moderate and low, respectively. Collectively, the most o utcomes were low to moderate quality of evidence. This means that our estim ates are likely to be close to the truth but that there is a possi bility that they may be different. 3 Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical pro statectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer ( Review) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Despite gaining popularity, robotic-assisted thyroidectomy (RT) remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at comparing surgically- related complications between RT and conventional openthyroidectomy (OT). Methods. A systematic review of the literature was per- formed to identify studies comparing surgically-relatedoutcomes between RT and OT. Studies that compared C1 surgically-related outcomes between RT and OT were included. Outcomes included operating time, blood loss,complications, and hospital stay. Meta-analysis was per- formed using a xed-effects model. Results. Eleven studies were eligible but none were ran- domized controlled trials. Of the 2,375 patients, 839 (35.3 %) underwent RT, while 1,536 (64.7 %) underwent OT. RT was signicantly associated with longer operatingtime ( p\\0.001), hospital stay ( and higher temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury (p=0.016). Although there was no correlation between the number of RTs reported in the study and the rate of temporary RLN 11 studies. Blood Two (0.2 %) brachial plexus injuries in RT were reported in one study. Conclusions. Relative to OT, RT was associated with signicantly longer operating time, longer hospital stay, and higher temporary RLN injury rate but comparablepermanent complications and overall morbidity. Given some of the limitations with the literature and the potential added surgical risks and morbidity in RT, application of therobot in thyroid surgery should be carefully and thoroughly discussed before one decides on the procedure. Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure, and the standard cervical open thyroidectomy (OT) is a safe and effective procedure. 1However, to improve cosmesis and patient satisfaction, various endoscopic approaches have been developed.2Unlike OT, these endoscopic approaches often require making incisions away from the neck so as toleave no visible neck scar. 2,3In experienced hands, similar outcomes to OT have been reported.3However, these endoscopic techniques are generally technically challeng-ing because of the small working space and limitations with current endoscopic instruments. 3To overcome these problems, a South Korean group pioneered the use of theda Vinci robot (i.e. 'robotic-assisted thyroidectomy', or RT). Despite higher cost, it offers better manipulations and stereoscopic visual eld. 4Since 20095there has been much interest both in the US and other parts of the world, with several groups publishing their initial successful experi- ence.6-9However, despite the initial enthusiasm, RT remains controversial. In October 2011, the US FDA revoked the approval on the use of the robot for thyroid- ectomy.10This has led some to abandoning RT and/C211Society of Surgical Oncology 2013 First Received: 8 August 2013; Published Online: 23 Surg 10.1245/s10434-013-3406-7Systematic review Systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic and gastric carcinoma Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, Department of Surgery, and2Korean Branch of the Australian Cochrane Centre, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, and3Gastrointestinal Surgery Centre, Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China Correspondence to: Dr S.-S. Park, Division of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Inchon-ro 136-705, Korea (e-mail: kugspss@korea.ac.kr) Background: Robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) has been developed in the hope of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) and open gastrectomy (OG) for gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of evidence in support of these ideals. Methods: A systematic review of the three operation types (RAG, LAG and OG) was carried out to evaluate short-term outcomes including duration of operation, retrieved lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, resection margin status, technical postoperative complications and hospital stay. Results: Nine non-randomized observational clinical studies involving 7200 patients satised the eligibility criteria. RAG was associated with longer operating times than LAG and OG (weighted mean difference 61 \u00b799 and 65 \u00b773 min respectively; P0\u00b7001). The number of retrieved lymph nodes and the resection margin length in RAG were comparable with those of LAG and OG. Estimated blood loss was signicantly less in RAG than in OG ( P=0\u00b7002), but not LAG. Mean hospital stay for RAG was similar to that for LAG ( P=0\u00b714). In contrast, hospital stay was signicantly shorter, by a mean of 2\u00b718 days, for RAG compared with OG ( P<0\u00b7001). Postoperative complications were similar for all three operative approaches. Conclusion: Short-term oncological outcomes of RAG were comparable with those of the other approaches. LAG was a shorter procedure and less expensive than RAG. Future studies involving RAG should focus on minimizing duration of operation and reducing cost. Paper accepted 26 June 2013 Published online in Wiley Online Library (www.bjs.co.uk). DOI: 10.1002/bjs.9242 Introduction Since the was reported in 19941, laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) has become widely used for the treatment of gastric cancer because of shorter hospital stays and lower postoperative complication rates compared withopen gastrectomy (OG) 2,3. A considerable proportion of patients with advanced gastric cancers are still treatedwith OG, however, especially in Western countries,because of concerns regarding the potential for inadequatelymphadenectomy during LAG 4-6. To overcome the technical limitations of laparoscopic surgery, robotic sur-gical systems that allow motion scaling, three-dimensionalvisualization and a high degree of freedom have beenintroduced 7,8. Since robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG)was rst reported in 20039, a number of studies have examined the feasibility of this new technology for gastrectomy10-19. Despite the higher costs of robotic surgery, it has generally been expected that the initial cost of robotictechnology would be offset by surgery of better quality andthe ability to overcome some of the limitations of LAG 20. No randomized clinical trials involving RAG with long-term follow-up data have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of RAG in comparison with LAG and OG by evaluating the available short-termresults. In the present three-arm comparisons (RAG versus LAG, RAG versus OG), meta-analysis of the available data was performed using sophisticated subgroup analyses toincrease statistical power and resolve inconsistencies. 2013 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd British Journal of Surgery 2013; 100: 1566-1578 Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdRobotic surgery compared with laparoscopic and open resections for gastric carcinoma 1567 Potentially relevant records identified and screened for retrieval n = 311 Additional records identified through other sources n = 2 Articles retrieved for more detailed evaluation n = 234Excluded n = 79 Duplication n = 79 Potentially appropriate articles to be included in meta-analysis n = 42 Articles included in meta-analysis n = 9 Articles with usable information, by outcome n = 9 RAG versus LAG n = 8 RAG versus OG n = 5Excluded n = 192 Not relevant n = 192 Articles withdrawn, by outcome n = 0Articles excluded from meta-analysis n = 33 No comparative study n = 26 Same study population n = 4 Only abstract form n = 3 Fig. 1 PRISMA diagram showing selection of articles for review. Of nine included studies, four reported three-arm comparisons of robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG), laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) and open gastrectomy (OG). Methods Search strategy Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN- TRAL) were performed to identify articles published up to October 2012 that compared outcomes with and with- out the use of robotic technology for the treatment of gastric cancer. The search Both free-text and medical subject heading (MeSH) searches were used for keywords. The links of every search result and all references in the original articles identied were reviewed to identify additional literature that was not indexed. Only studies written in English were considered for inclusion. Eligibility criteria Studies meeting the following criteria were included: comparative, peer-reviewed studies of RAG versus LAG or OG for patients with gastric cancer for which the full text of the article was available and that included objective evaluations of at least one of the perioperative outcome measures mentioned below. If two studies from the samegroup were identied, the most recent study or that including more subjects was selected unless the reports were from different time periods. Methodological quality appraisal The methodological quality of the selected studies wasassessed using a checklist based on a modied version ofthe Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) 3,21. This validated quality assessment system for non-randomized controlled trials is based on eight items: consecutive patients, prospective data collection, reported primary endpoints, unbiased postoperative eval-uation, appropriate control intervention, contemporary groups, group equivalents and sample size. A maxi- mum score of 16 points is possible with these eight items. Studies scoring 12 or more points were considered high quality. Data extraction Data were extracted from the original studies by two independent reviewers who were blinded to journal names, institutions and funding grants. Differences were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors with incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest werecontacted via e-mail.

Begg's rank correlation method was used to assess publication bias by testing for Kendall's using Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA), and a graphical funnel plot was generated using RevMan 26. P<0\u00b7050 was considered statistically signicant.Results The combined searches identied 313 abstracts (Fig.1). After elimination of 79 duplicates and exclusion of irrelevant articles, 42 articles were considered for peerreview. Among these, four 18,27-29were superseded by other articles with overlapping data sets and three30-32were available only in abstract form. In total, nine33-41articles (Korea 6, Italy 2, Taiwan 1) with a total of 7200 patientswere eligible for inclusion. Data were analysed as reportedby the authors. Four authors were contacted for additionalunpublished information. Eom et al. 37and Huang and co-workers38provided non-extractable data such as means and standard deviations that were described as mediansand ranges in the original papers. Yoon and colleagues 36 provided information regarding overlapping patients, and Caruso et al.35provided subgroup data according to the type of surgery. In addition, baseline characteristics ofOG were used, including type of gastrectomy and tumournode metastasis (TNM) stage, which were describedincompletely in the original article from this centre 41. 2013 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk British Journal of Surgery 2013; 100: 1566-1578 Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdRobotic surgery compared with laparoscopic and open (-97\u00b717, -18\u00b783) 39 21 436 38 634 1236 100\u00b704811 65 62 64 42 861 83Pugliese et al .34 Kim et al .33 Caruso et al .35 Huang et al .38 Kim et al .40 Hyun et al .41Yoon et al .36 Eom et al .37 Huang et al .38 Son et al .39 Kim et al .40 Hyun et al .41 Total TotalKim et al .33RAG Loss (ml) TotalLAG Mean difference (ml) Mean difference (ml) Loss (ml) Total Weight ( %) ReferenceRAG Loss (ml) TotalOG Mean difference (ml) Mean difference (ml) Loss (ml) Total Weight ( %)Heterogeneity: 2 = 487 02; 2 = 4071, 7 d.f., P < 0001; I2 = 83% Test for overall effect: Z = 061, P = 054 Heterogeneity: 2 = 11 440 78; 2 = 401 28, 4 d.f., P < 0001; I2 = 99% Test for overall effect: Z = 315, P = 0002a RAG versus LAG b RAG versus OG Fig. 4 Forest plot comparing estimated blood loss in arobot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) versus laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) and bRAG versus open gastrectomy (OG).

Overall, eight articles33,34,36-41including 1870 patients compared RAG (634) and LAG (1236). Five articles33,35,38,40,41including 5859 patients compared RAG (558) and OG (5301).All robotic procedures used the da Vinci TMsurgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California, USA).The included studies all had recent publication dates(2010 or later). Conversion and mortality rates were reported in six and nine studies respectively (range 0-12 \u00b75a n d0 - 5 \u00b75 per cent). A higher proportion of patients in the RAG andLAG groups had stage I cancer than those randomized toOG (overall: 78 \u00b72, 83\u00b72a n d5 0 \u00b70 per cent respectively). The baseline characteristics in three studies 35,36,39were adequately matched for all the factors reviewed. Fivestudies 33,34,37,40,41were not completely matched withregard to patient factors (age, sex and body mass index), and three studies38,40,41had differences in more than one surgical factor (extent of lymphadenectomy and type ofgastrectomy). All trials were observational studies. All except two involved data collection using a prospective database; one study 39used retrospective data and one34did not report on this. In general, the quality of the includedstudies was satisfactory. The median quality score was 12, and six 35-38,40,41had a score of 12 or more. Details of the quality assessment are shown in Table S1 (supporting information). Evidence from primary outcomes Tables 2 and 3summarize the primary outcomes of the included studies. All studies provided information onduration of operation. Mean differences in operating time varied widely between RAG and LAG ( I 2=85 per cent).

Each row represents areanalysis of the data with exclusion of one study at a time toassess the influence of that particular study on the overall result. WMDs are shown with 95 per cent condence intervals; negative values favour RAG indicating robust and consistent results across studies. In contrast to LAG, OG showed inconsistent results in terms of the number of retrieved lymph nodes and estimated blood loss compared with RAG, although only two studies satised matching criteria. There were no signicant differences in PRM between the RAG and LAG groupsmatched for type of gastrectomy: WMD 0\u00b701 (0\u00b794 to 0\u00b792) cm ( P=0\u00b798). Conversely, RAG had a longer DRMthan LAG, when matched for type of gastrectomy: WMD 0\u00b798 (1\u00b775 to0\u00b722) cm ( P=0\u00b701). The influence analysis of hospital stay for RAG and LAG indicated that the studies with the greatest positive and negative influence on the overall pooled estimates seemed to be the data reported by Son and colleagues 39 (after omission: WMD 0\u00b776 (95 per cent c.i. P=0\u00b762) ( Fig.7). The funnel plots for all primary outcomes were relatively symmetrical, suggesting that publication biases were notpresent. Begg's test did not indicate publication bias for any primary outcomes, including duration of operation, number of retrieved lymph nodes, estimated blood loss,resection margin, hospital stay and total postoperative complications (all P>0\u00b7100) ( Fig.8). Discussion A number of pilot series studies examining the feasibility of RAG have been reported, although the effectivenessand oncological safety of this procedure are still unclear given the limited number of observational studies 10-18. Because randomized clinical trials of RAG have not yetbeen performed and long-term survival data are not available, meta-analysis of non-randomized observational clinical trials was used to evaluate the safety and short-termefcacy of robotic surgery for the treatment of gastric carcinoma, compared with conventional laparoscopic and open approaches to gastrectomy. The most consistent nding in this meta-analysis was the long operating time for RAG. Robotic procedures generally take longer than conventional operations because 0 0\u00b75 1\u00b70s.e.

However, robotic set-up times are often less than 30 min43,44, so a difference of greater than 60 min is notable. Hyun and colleagues41excluded the rst 20 procedures completed during the initial RAG learning period to establish an equivalent comparison of surgicalquality, and reported a similar operating time for RAG and LAG (234 versus 220 min; P=0\u00b7198). In contrast, studies including procedures completed during the RAG trainingor learning period consistently reported a signicantlylonger operating time 33-40. This suggests that duration of surgery is influenced by learning curve effects. It has been suggested that experienced laparoscopic surgeons reach aplateau in operating time after about 20 operations 19.A s most of the studies in the present analysis did not explicitly describe the surgeon's level of prociency, a subgroup analysis was carried out by selecting studies with more than20 RAG operations as a surrogate marker of prociency. This analysis failed to demonstrate a signicant reduction in operating time for RAG. Oncological outcome is a critical measure of success in gastric cancer surgery. With short follow-up times, numbers of retrieved lymph nodes and surgical resection margin were used as indicators of oncological acceptability.The analysis showed that the number of retrieved lymph nodes with RAG was similar to that for LAG and OG. To reduce heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis matched for theextent of lymphadenectomy and type of gastrectomy wasperformed 33-37,39,41; this conrmed that similar numbers of lymph nodes were harvested. Only a limited number of studies reported on PRM35-37,39-41. There were no signif- icant differences between the groups overall or in subgroup analysis matched for type of gastrectomy. Conversely, RAG had a longer DRM than LAG, overall and in subgroup anal-ysis matched for type of gastrectomy. Both PRM and DRMlengths demonstrate that RAG is oncologically acceptable for proximal or distally located tumours 45,46. The mean estimated blood loss in RAG was similar to that for LAG, but signicantly less than in OG. Similar differences in blood loss between RAG and LAG were observed consistently in all subgroup analyses, which wereconducted using large sample sizes, matched patients,matched operation type and high-quality studies 33,34,36-41. The biological effect of blood loss on perioperative morbidity is still controversial47,48. As the variation in blood loss between RAG studies was high (range30\u00b73-214 \u00b72 ml), with heterogeneity as a result of different methods of estimating blood loss, this result should be interpreted with caution 33-41. There were no differences in total postoperative compli- cation rates between RAG and the other procedures, butRAG had a signicantly higher rate of anastomotic leakage than OG. Although the overall incidence of anastomoticleak was low in all these studies (2 \u00b78, 2\u00b75a n d1 \u00b77 per cent for RAG, LAG and OG respectively), leakage was the consid- ered the major cause of morbidity and death 40. Other stud- ies have reported higher leakage rates after laparoscopicsurgery compared with open procedures 49. Both limited tactile feedback and the role of staple-line reinforcement have been considered relevant issues50,51. Only two of the studies examined here40,41used previously validated complication grading systems such as the Clavien-Dindo classication52, highlighting the need for objective and reproducible methods to evaluate postoperative complica-tions more accurately after this type of surgery. The duration of hospital stay was shorter by 0 \u00b760 days in patients undergoing RAG than in those having LAG, although influence and subgroup analysis showed that thisdifference was not statistically signicant. Hospital stay for RAG was, however, signicantly shorter (by 2 \u00b718 days) than that for OG and consistent across all studies. Ithas been suggested that a shorter hospital stay for LAGcompared with OG could offset the increased operation costs 53. So far, only two studies29,36have performed a cost analysis of RAG compared with LAG from a single centre,indicating that RAG costs \u00a43189 more per patient than LAG 29.O ft h i s , \u00a42831 per patient resulted solely from depreciation of the da Vinci system and maintenance of capital equipment. If this is eliminated from the total, thenthe cost of RAG is comparable to that for LAG ( \u00a45130 versus \u00a44772 respectively) 29. There have been two earlier meta-analyses related to RAG54,55. Maeso and colleagues54performed a meta-analysis of the use of the da Vinci surgical system compared with laparoscopic surgery for different typesof abdominal intervention, but this included only twoarticles 18,33with a limited number of patients (87). A meta- analysis comparing RAG with LAG55involved only three studies28,33,34, and did not assess the risk of bias with sen- sitivity and subgroup analyses. The present meta-analysis included nine studies33-41with a total of 7200 patients (663 RAG, 1236 LAG, 5301 OG) and used rened subgroupanalysis to produce reliable results and reduce bias. This analysis has some limitations. All included studies were observational, with the likelihood of selection bias. Although sensitivity analysis using matched datashould reduce this bias, it cannot be eliminated. Roboticprocedures included the initial learning period, which may have resulted in an unequal surgical quality comparison. Most of the studies had small sample sizes withfewer than 50 RAG procedures. Results with marginal statistical signicance should be interpreted with caution. 2013 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk British Journal of Surgery 2013; 100: 1566-1578 Published by Wiley & Sons Ltd1576 Hyun, C.-H. Lee, H.-J. Kim, Y. Tong and S.-S. Park The uneven distribution in the number of patients contributed to heterogeneity. One single, high-volumecentre contributed more than half of the total number of RAG operations 40. Most operations were conducted in East Asia and the results may not represent clinical outcomes in the West. Ethnic differences may introduce bias and should be taken into consideration. Future work should focus on the balance between minimizing operating time and reducing cost, but high- quality controlled clinical trials to compare RAG with LAG and OG can now be undertaken.

Reported rates of screw malposition using these techniques vary considerably, though the evidence generally favors the use of image-guidance systems. A miniature spine-mounted robot has recently been developed to further improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. In this systematic review, wecritically appraise the perceived benets of robot-assisted pedicle screw placement compared to conventional fluo- roscopy-guided technique.Methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched between January 2006 and January 2013 to identify rele-vant publications that (1) featured placement of pedicle screws, (2) compared robot-assisted and fluoroscopy-gui- ded surgery, (3) assessed outcome in terms of pediclescrew position, and (4) present sufcient data in each arm to enable meaningful comparison ( [10 pedicle screws in each study group). Results A total of 246 articles were retrieved, of which 5 articles met inclusion criteria, collectively reportingplacement of 1,308 pedicle screws (729 robot-assisted, 579 fluoroscopy-guided). The ndings of these studies aremixed, with limited higher level of evidence data favoring fluoroscopy-guided procedures, and remaining comparative studies supporting robot-assisted pedicle screw placement.Conclusions There is insufcient evidence to unequivo- cally recommend one surgical technique over the other. Given the high cost of robotic systems, and the high risk ofspinal surgery, further high quality studies are required to address unresolved clinical equipoise in this eld. Keywords Robotics /C1Robot assisted /C1Neurosurgery /C1Systematic review Introduction Pedicle screw placement is a common surgical procedure to achieve fusion in the thoraco-lumbar spine. The ana- tomical proximity of the vertebral pedicles to associated neurovascular structures means that surgical misplacementof pedicle screws may result in serious morbidity. It has been estimated using a geometric model of spinal anatomy that a maximal translational error of less than 1 mm and rotational error of less than 5 /C176are permissible to ensure satisfactory screw implantation [ 16]. The clinical corollary is that tools improving the accuracy and precision of ped- icle screw placement can improve the outcome of patients undergoing spinal fusion. At present, most spinal surgeons performing pedicle screw implantation do so using either anatomical land- marks or C-arm fluoroscopy [ 13]. The accuracy of pedicle screw implantation using these techniques varies consid- erably in the literature (from 28 to 94 %), though the evidence generally favors the use of image-guidance sys-tems [ 5,10,25,27].

Since 2006, a number of studies have individually supported its use [ 1,9,11,12, 14,20-22,24,26]. In this systematic review, we collect and critically appraise the evidence to evaluate whether, in patients undergoing pedicle screw implantation, robot-assistedsurgery offers an advantage over conventional fluoroscopy- guided procedures in terms of pedicle screw position. Materials and methods The review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement was used in the preparation of this manuscript. Search methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched between January 2006 and January 2013. Rele-vant combinations of free-text search terms [(robot*) AND (pedicle OR and MeSH terms [''Robotics'' AND (''Spine'' OR ''Bone Screws'')] were used. An Englishlanguage restriction was applied. References lists of selected papers were also reviewed, and expert opinion sought, to identify additional eligible manuscripts. Twoauthors (HM and TPC) independently identied articles using the above search criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Titles and abstracts were screened to identify publications that met criteria of (1) featuring placement of pedicle screws, (2) comparing SpineAssist /C210(Mazor Surgical Technologies Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) and fluoroscopy-gui-ded surgery, (3) assessing outcome in terms of pedicle screw position, and (4) presenting sufcient data in each arm to enable meaningful comparison (more than tenpedicle screws in each study group). Full articles were subsequently obtained and further assessed for eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a seniorauthor. Data extraction The following data were extracted from eligible full arti- cles: (1) study design, (2) study group characteristicsincluding number of subjects and pedicle screws implantedin each arm, (3) outcome measures used to assess pedicle screw position, (4) key results, and (5) other results, such as radiation exposure and duration of operation. Corresponding authors were contacted to provide sup- plemental data when required. In circumstances when this was not possible, data were extrapolated using the original results reported. Appraisal of evidence The Jadad and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scoring systems were used to guideevaluation of the quality of randomized and non-random- ized studies, respectively, [ 8,23]. Studies of greater quality were given appropriately greater weighting in the qualita-tive analysis. Raw data on screw positions were used to determine the odds ratio in each study. The odds ratio for the key resultswas calculated using MedCalc version 12.3.0.0. Results A total of 246 retrieved articles were pooled from elec- tronic library databases and other sources, of which 65 were duplicates (Fig. 1). We excluded 159 articles on the basis of their title and abstract because they did not presentoriginal data, did not feature pedicle screws, did not have both a robot-assisted and a control group, or had insuf- cient data in each arm to enable meaningful comparison.Full text screening of the remaining 22 articles led to the exclusion of a further 17 articles. In all, 5 articles were identied that satised our inclusion criteria, comprisingtwo randomized controlled trials (of which one reported preliminary ndings), one prospective cohort, one retro- spective cohort, and one cadaveric study (Table 1)[9,11, of 1,308 pedicle robot-assistance, and 579 using fluoros- copy-guidance. Pedicle screw placement All included studies using post-operative ne-cut screws placed with robot-assistance were satisfactory, compared with 92.7 % (537/ 579) of pedicle screws placed with fluoroscopy-guidance. Ringel et al. [ 17] favored fluoroscopy-guidance (p=0.019), and the remaining studies supported robot- assistance (albeit often not reaching statistical signicance) [9,11,18,20]. A forest plot summarizing the odds ratios of the included studies is illustrated in Fig. 2.292 Eur Spine J (2014) 23:291-297 123Duration of surgery The duration of surgery in the robot-assisted and fluoros- copy-guided groups was not reported as being signicantly different in any of the three studies that analyzed this data [9,11,17]. Radiation exposure All included studies commented on radiation exposure of patients and surgeons during pedicle screw implantation, though radiation doses during additional planning CT werenot included in statistical signicance testing. Kantelhardt et al. and Lieberman et al. [ 9,11] reported radiation exposure to be signicantly less during robot-assisted pedicle screwinsertion compared to fluoroscopy-guided procedures, while Ringel et al. and Schizas et al. [ 17,20] observed no signi- cant difference in radiation exposure. Roser et al. [ 18] did not perform a statistical comparison on their preliminaryndings, but a trend towards reduced radiation exposure in the robot-assisted group was observed. Appraisal of quality of evidenceThe Jadad system was used to evaluate the quality of the studies by Roser et al. and Ringel et al. [ 8,17,18]. Both studies were randomized but the methods to generate the sequence of randomization were not described. The Roser et al. study presents the preliminary results of 37 patientsand the groups were therefore not balanced, with fewer patients undergoing fluoroscopy-guided ( n=10) than robot-assisted ( n=18) pedicle screw placement. Neither study fully addressed blinding. Although in the Ringel et al. study the position of pedicle screws was evaluated post-operatively by an independent neuroradiologist blin-ded to the technique used, it is unclear whether patients were also blinded. No participant withdrawal or loss to follow-up was reported.Fig. 1 Flow chart of search and selection processEur Spine J (2014) 23:291-297 293 123The quality of the studies by Schizas et al. and Kan- telhardt et al. were evaluated using the MINORS system [ 9, 20,23]. Neither study prospectively calculated the studysize. The Schizas et al. [ 20] study did not report on the baseline equivalence of the control and intervention groups with respect to patient demographic factors such as age, sex and body mass index (BMI). The Kantelhardt et al. [ 9] study was retrospective. Lieberman et al. [ 11] utilized human cadavers in a study that did not report pre-hoc power calculation, but otherwisewas well designed. Discussion The evidence for robot-assisted pedicle screw placement is both limited and inconclusive. Five comparative studies were identied only. The ndings of these studies are mixed, with the largest randomized controlled trial favor-ing fluoroscopy-guided procedures, and the other studies advocating robot-assisted pedicle screw placement.

(2014) 23:291-297 123is therefore insufcient evidence to unequivocally recom- mend one surgical technique over the other. The randomized controlled trial by Ringel et al. [ 17] represents the highest level of evidence study identied inthis review. Applying the Jadad criteria, the method of randomization was not described, and patients did not appear to have been blinded to the procedure they under-went, though this is unlikely to have influenced the primary outcome of pedicle screw position. Notwithstanding these limitations, the study was generally well constructed and demonstrated signicantly poorer screw placement in the robot-assisted group compared to the fluoroscopy-guidedgroup (85 vs. 93 %). Moreover, ten screws placed using robot-assistance required intra-operative revision compared to only one in the control group. Duration of surgery andradiation exposure was not signicantly different in the two groups, though patients undergoing robot-assisted surgery did require an additional planning CT. The other randomized controlled trial by Roser et al. [ 18] reported preliminary ndings and robot-assisted pedicle screw placement. The study aims to enroll 90 patients with 4 screws per patient, but has so far recruited 37 patients, withfewer patients undergoing fluoroscopy-guided evaluation was these interim ndings, but image-guided and robot-assisted pedicle screw placement had a comparable accuracy to conventional fluoroscopy-guided surgery, with atrend towards reduced radiation time and dosage. The studies by Schizas et al. and Kantelhardt et al. [ 9,20] are prospective and retrospective non-randomized cohortstudies, respectively. In both studies, pedicle screws implan- ted using robot-assistance were better positioned than those placed using fluoroscopy-guidance (95 vs. 92 % in bothcohorts). The Kantelhardt et al. study also reported reduced radiation exposure in the robot-assisted group, though the length of surgery did not differ signicantly. Schizas et al. didnot report on the equivalence of confounding variables in the intervention and control groups. Neither study acknowledged a prospective power calculation. Despite being a human cadaver study, the study by Lieberman et al. [ 11] satised our inclusion criteria and was incorporated in our analysis. Although the authors didnot prospectively calculate the study size, it was otherwise of high quality. As with the aforementioned cohort studies, pedicle screws placed using robot-assistance were betterpositioned than those placed using fluoroscopy-guidance (99 vs. 95 %); however, this did not reach statistical sig- nicance ( p=0.082). Radiation exposure was signi- cantly less in screws placed using robot-assistance, but the length of surgery did not differ signicantly.A number of potential sources of bias were identied. Firstly, it is possible that certain patients were more likely to undergo robot-assisted pedicle screw placement in the cohort studies. For example, it may be that following theintroduction of the robot into surgical practice, fairly straightforward cases were selected in the rst instance while the operating team was still becoming more familiarwith the technique. This selection bias is an inherent lim- itation of these non-randomized studies. Secondly, intra- and inter-study variation in patient groups was noted. Not all studies reported on potential confounders such as unbalanced age, sex and BMI. Whilethe studies by Ringel et al. and Roser et al. limited their participants to patients undergoing lumbosacral pedicle screw implantation the remaining studies included thoseundergoing thoracic pedicle screw implantation too. The anatomical differences between the lumbar and thoracic vertebra result in different maximal tolerable translationaland rotational errors in these regions [ 16]. Interestingly, none of the studies included patients with thoracic scolio- sis, and it could be argued that these cases, which have avery high rate of screw malposition [ 7], have the most to gain from the use of robot-assistance. Thirdly, the nature of the robot-assisted operative technique varied considerably, including percutaneous pedicle screw implantation via a paramedian Wiltse approach [ 11,17,18], open pedicle screw implantation [20], and a combination of the two techniques [ 9]. In one study that compared robot-assisted percutaneous and open pedicle screw implantation, the accuracy of screw place-ment did not appear to differ signicantly [ 9 ]. The robot itself may be attached to the spine in various ways, which may also influence accuracy. Ringel et al. [ 17] describe a platform that was xed to a cranial spinal process with a K-wire, and attached to the operating table by a bed mount. They speculate that this may have been an insuf-cient method of xation because, as the robot was only attached to the patient via a single K-wire, relative slip- page might have occurred. Alternative methods ofattaching the robot to the spine, such as the use of a platform connected to a spinous process clamp, with additional K-wires to cranial and caudal spinous pro-cesses, or to the iliac crests, may have therefore improved accuracy. The fluoroscopy-guided (control group) surgical technique of the control group also differed betweenstudies depending on the use of a 2-C-arm set up or a single rotating C-arm, and either percutaneous or open approach. Surgical prociency in the robot-assisted andfluoroscopy groups is difcult to quantitatively assess. All studies reported that operating surgeons were familiar with both robot-assisted and fluoroscopy-guided techniques,though it is suspected that experience and learning curve progression would be more advanced with the latter.Eur Spine J (2014) 23:291-297 295 123Lastly, all included studies involved independent blin- ded investigators to assess pedicle screw position using post-operative ne-cut CT. Unfortunately the metric tools used to satisfactorily determine screw placement variedwidely including the Gertzbein and Robbins scale, Ram- persaud scale, and Wiesner and Schizas scale [ 6,15,19, 28]. In the instance when the same scale was shared, cri- teria for a satisfactory position varied; for example, while the Schizas et al. and Lieberman et al. studies both adopted the Rampersaud scale, the former considered positions A and B adequate (completely in pedicle, or \\2 mm breach), while the latter considered only position A acceptable(completely in pedicle only). The requirement for a uni- versally adopted method of gauging pedicle screw position is widely acknowledged in the literature. In addition to pedicle screw position numerous other factors may influence the choice of surgical technique. The high cost of robotic systems may limit availability of thistechnology for widespread use. In addition, the use of such systems requires additional training to the surgeon and operating team. Surgeons performing spinal fusion may beattracted to the use of robot-assistance if in addition to improving the accuracy and precision of pedicle screw implantation, there is associated reduction in radiationexposure without signicantly lengthened operating times. The safety of such systems is paramount, and surgeons must be reassured that in the event of malfunction orfailure, patient risk is minimal. Large forces are exerted during pedicle screw placement that can lead to skidding of the implantation cannula, or shift of the vertebrae, resultingin malposition if not appreciated during surgery. An often ignored additional prerequisite to the diffusion of robotic systems is their acceptability to patient population. To thisend, although most studies have found attitudes to be generally positive, female and elderly patients may be more cautious about accepting robot-assisted surgery overconventional techniques [ 3]. In conclusion, given the high risk of spinal surgery, and the high cost of robotic systems, further studies to justifythe clinical benet and healthcare economics are required. Acknowledgments H. J.

Chung, MD IMPORTANCE Use of robotic surgery has increased in urological practice over the last decade. However, the use, outcomes, and costs of robotic nephrectomy are unknown. OBJECTIVES To examine the trend in use of robotic-assisted operations for radical nephrectomy in the United States and to compare the perioperative outcomes and costswith laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used the Premier Healthcare database to evaluate outcomes of patients who had undergone robotic-assistedor laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for renal mass at 416 US hospitals between January2003 and September 2015. Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess outcomes. EXPOSURES Robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was the trend in use of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary outcomes were perioperativecomplications, based on the Clavien classification system, and defined as any complication(Clavien grades 1-5) or major complications (Clavien grades 3-5, for which grade 5 results indeath); resource use (operating time, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay); and directhospital cost. RESULTS Among 23 753 patients included in the study (mean age, 61.4 years; men, 13 792 [58.1%]), 18 and 5180 surgery increased from 1.5%(39 of 2676 radical nephrectomy procedures in 2003) to 27.0% (862 of 3194 radicalnephrectomy procedures) in 2015 ( Pfor trend <.001). In the weighted-adjusted analysis, there were no significant differences between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radicalnephrectomy in the incidence of rates, 3.0%) major rates, difference, 0.3%; 95% CI, 1.0% to 0.5%). The rate of prolonged operating time (>4 hours) for patients undergoing therobotic-assisted procedure was higher than for patients receiving the laparoscopic procedurein the adjusted analysis (46.3% vs 2 95% CI, 14.2% to 26.8%). nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90-day costs ($19 530 vs $985; 95% CI, $473 to $1498). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal mass between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-assisted surgery increased substantially.The use of robotic-assistance was not associated with increased risk of any or majorcomplications but was associated with prolonged operating time and higher hospital costscompared with laparoscopic surgery.

This database captures approximately20% of all hospitalizations from more than 700 acute carehospitals in the United States (>530 million hospital visitsand 6 million inpatient discharges per year since 2011).This database also contains information on demographicand clinical characteristics, such as pharmaceuticals admin-istered, laboratory and other diagnostic tests performed,and therapeutic services provided during admission. ThePremier Healthcare database uses a reconciliation processthat allows for verification and validation of hospital report-ing for the use of resources and cost. Data audits are per-formed, and if reported costs submitted do not match thehospital's financial statement, Premier works with the hos-pital to correct the discrepancy. 15Procedure and comorbid- ity data are provided by International Classification of Dis-eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. This method has been used in other studies.6,8,16,17This investigation was deemed exempt from informed consent requirements by the Stan-ford University Medical Center institutional review board. Patients Patients receiving radical nephrectomy between January2003 and September 2015 were identified by ICD-9code (55.51) and included in the analysis. Affiliated codes wereidentified and reviewed to ensure that radical nephrectomywastheprimaryprocedureperformedbasedonthediagnosisor concern for kidney cancer (eTable 1 in the Supplement ). Forexample,casesofuppertracturothelialcarcinoma( ICD-9 codes 189.1 or 189.2), which have unique postoperative com- plication profiles stemming from the need for concurrentureterectomy and cystotomy were excluded. Only patientsreceiving either robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radicalnephrectomy were included. Patients undergoing open radi-calnephrectomyornonelectivesurgerieswereexcluded.Theinclusion and exclusion methodology is further depicted intheeFigureinthe Supplement . Main Exposures Patients receiving robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy were identified using the Charge DescriptionMaster, a catalog of all billable items eventually charged tothe patient, to avoid possible inaccuracies stemming fromthe use of the ICD-9coding system in identifying robotic- assisted surgery. 17The utilization of supplies unique to roboticprocedures,asspecifiedbytheEndoWristInstrument& Accessory Catalog from Intuitive Surgical, was used as anindicatorfortheuseofrobotic-assistance. 18Nonroboticcases wereidentifiedinasimilarmanner.

Outcomes Theprimaryoutcomeofthestudywasthetrendinuseoftherobotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary out-comesofinterestwereperioperativecomplications,resourceuse, and direct hospital costs. Postoperative complicationswere classified based on the Clavien classification system. 20 Thesecomplicationsweredefinedasany(Claviengrades1-5)or major (Clavien grades 3-5). Grade 1 complications in-clude \"Any deviation from the normal postoperative coursewithout the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical,endoscopic, and intervention.\" Grade 2 com-plications \"[require] pharmacologic treatment with drugsother than such allowed for grade 1 complications.\" Grade 3complications\"[require]surgical,endoscopicorradiologicalintervention.\" Grade 4 describes \"Life-threatening com-plications requiring intermediate care/intensive care unit.\"Grade 5 complications result in the \"[d]eath of a patient.\"To identify events defined by the Clavien classificationsystem, we used ICD-9codes as previously described. 6,21 Resource use variables analyzed included blood transfusion (packed red blood cells), operating time (hours), and lengthof stay (days). Operating time (4 hours vs >4 hours) andlengthofstay(4daysvs>4days)werecategorizedasdichoto-mousvariables. 19,22 Two types of direct hospital costs were provided by the Premier Healthcare database.

Statistical Analyses Categorical variables were presented as numbers and per-centages and were compared using the 2test. Linear trends in the proportion of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomiesover 13 years were assessed using a logistic regressionmodel. To reduce potential confounding, we performed anadjustment for differences in baseline patient characteristicsby using a weighted logistic regression model with inverseprobabilityoftreatmentweighting(IPTW). 25Usingthistech- nique, the weights used for patients undergoing laparo-scopic radical nephrectomy were the inverse of 1 minus thepropensity score, and weights used for patients receivingrobotic-assisted radical nephrectomy were the inverse of thepropensity score alone. The propensity scores were esti-mated by multiple logistic regression analysis without regard to outcomes. A full nonparsimonious model wasdeveloped including all variables shown in Table 1. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) for each exposure on perioperative out-comes.Sinceitwasdeterminedthattheoutcomevariablesre-lated to direct hospital costs were not normally distributed,ageneralizedlinearmodelwithgammadistributionwasgen-erated, allowing for a link function to connect the predictorwith the response variables. 26All models were adjusted for clusteringofpatientswithinhospitalsusingrobuststandarderrors to account for interhospital variability. An analysiswas also conducted to determine if the costs related to eachsurgical approach (robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radicalnephrectomy) were related to the source of cost obtainedwithin the Premier Hospital database. For these analyses,the propensity score analyses were re-performed to obtaina new IPTW for each patient. These analyses were not pre-specifiedbutratherposthocandthusinterpretedasexplor-atory. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-sided tests,with a significance level of <.05 and Stata 14 statistical soft-ware(StataCorp).

All rights reserved. Downloaded From: by a Oregon Health & Science University User on 04/25/2018mies.However, little is known about the nationwide use of robotic-assistance for radical nephrectomy in the UnitedStates. Some studies have suggested that the proportion ofrobotic-assisted cases was less than 10% of all radicalnephrectomies during the late 2000s. 13,27In contrast, this study found that the proportion of robotic-assisted radicalnephrectomies increased to approximately 30% of all radi-cal nephrectomies by 2015, which is higher than for thelaparoscopic approach in the United States. A paralleldecrease in the use of laparoscopic radical nephrectomysuggests a shift to robotic surgery from cases that wouldhave been previously treated laparoscopically rather thanby open surgery. It remains unclear why the use of robotic-assistance has increased substantially and has been steadily replac-ing laparoscopic radical nephrectomies. One possibility isthe financial viability of the robotic system in relativelysmall hospitals. The costs of purchasing and maintain-ing the robotic system range from $0.5 to $2.5 million and$80000-$170000 per year , respectively. 28Surgeons have to perform at least 100 to 150 procedures annually tooffset the upfront and ongoing costs of its acquisition. 29Another possibility is that the increase in robotic-assistedradical nephrectomies might be associated with the knownincrease in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomies. Theuse of robotic-assistance has increased in some areas has overtaken laparoscopic partialnephrectomy. 27,30This trend suggests an overall increase in the risk of intraoperative conversion to radical nephrectomyassurgeonsattempttotreatlargerandmorecomplextumorsusing the nephron-sparing approach. 31Considering that the incidence of intraoperative robotic-assisted partial to radicalnephrectomy conversion remains prevalent especially forlow-volume hospitals and surgeons in the United States, theincrease in unsuccessful robotic-assisted partial nephrecto-miesmayhavecontributedtotheincreaseinrobotic-assistedradical nephrectomy use. 32As urological training has been focused on robotic surgery driven predominantly by thewidespread use of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy(more than 80% of the total prostatectomies in the UnitedStates in 2013), urologists completing their residency or fel-lowship training may also prefer the robotic platform overlaparoscopic surgery due to its ergonomic console and3-dimensionalscreen. 6Table 3.

Furthermore,thereareseveraldisadvantagesofrobotictechnologyscarcelyacknowledged by prior literature. For example, robot armsreturn minimal tactile feedback to the surgeon. Moreover,thefieldofviewduringrobotic-assistedradicalnephrectomyisrelativelynarrow.Therefore,specialattentionisrequiredtopreventunintentionaltraumatoperipheralorgansnotfeltorvisualizedbythesurgeon. 10 There is also a significant cost burden attributed to the use of the robotic system. This study shows that the use ofthe robotic platform for radical nephrectomy increased thetotal direct hospital cost by nearly $2700, which is morethan 15% of the total cost of the laparoscopic approach.This increased expense for robotic-assisted radical nephrec-tomy was mostly accounted for by increased operatingroom cost, which is directly correlated with operating time.These findings are consistent with the observations of astudy from Maryland that reported a $5111 increase in hospi-tal charges per robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy com-pared with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. 33Hospitals are likely to increase charges for robotic surgery to recoup costsrelatedtotheacquisitionandmaintenanceoftheroboticsys-tem despite not receiving reimbursement for these fixedcosts from Medicare and private insurers. 34Increased hospi- tal charges for robotic surgery influence future reimburse-ment because the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services(CMS)usehospitalchargestocalculatetherelativeweightforeach diagnosis related group (DRG) annually, which in turnhelp determine the payment made for inpatient services.The DRG weight is determined by the average resourcesrequired to treat cases within the DRG and is multiplied bythe average payment rate for a typical case to yield the totalreimbursement rate. 35Thus, hospitals are incentivized to charge payers for the true cost of robot use. A prior studyestimates an additional cost to the health care system of$2.5billionifconventionalsurgeriesweretobefullyreplacedbyroboticsurgery. 7 As for the acquisition, maintenance, and replacement of the robot, the attainment of these costs remains challeng-ing. The true cost of the robot varies based on factors suchas the number of robotic cases being performed by eachhospital, nonurological use of the robot technology, thetype of robotic system being used, specific price negotia-tions between the hospital and robot company, and likelyother variables as well. Thus, the fixed costs of the robotcannot be accurately determined by this database. Robotic surgery was associated with higher 90-day di- rect hospital costs (>$2692) for hospitals providing reportedcosts, though not for hospitals providing MCCR-estimatedcosts. Although CMS uses hospital charges to estimate therelativecostoftreatingpatients,chargestendtovaryamonghospitals according to size, location, payer mix, and for- profitstatus. 36,37Giventhepotentialforvariabilityusingthe latterprocess,hospitalshavebeenencouragedtoadoptanin-ternalcost-measurementsystem. 38Therefore,thehighercosts for robotic surgery observed for patients from hospitals pro-viding reported costs may have greater clinical relevanceandaccuracy. Roboticpartialnephrectomydoeshavesomeadvantages over traditional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, includingreduced ischemic time and total operating time. However, this study suggests that the traditional advantages of roboticsurgery are not applicable to radical nephrectomy whencompared with conventional laparoscopy. Some high-volume surgeons thrombus in a minimally inva-sive manner. 39However, that does not adequately explain the rapid increase in robotic-assisted radical nephrectomywithin the United States because these advanced kidneycancers have been largely treated by the open approach.Although the initial results of safety and short-term onco-logical outcomes are promising, further investigation isrequired to determine the role of robotic surgery for venacava tumor thrombectomy. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, it is subject topotential misclassification bias as billing codes and ICD-9 procedural codes were used to capture robotic-assisted sur-geries.However, prev ious studies using the same method showed that ICD-9coding for robotic-assisted surgery was sufficiently specific. 6,8,17Second, the Premier Healthcare database does not publish information regarding tumorcharacteristics. Large or complex renal tumors, such as hilarand endophytic tumors, increase the risk for perioperativecomplications during laparoscopic surgery, although morenotably for partial nephrectomy. 40The influence of tumor characteristics is likely negligible for both robotic-assistedand laparoscopic radical nephrectomy because they areboth minimally invasive and have similar clinical indica-tions. Third, because the rate of conversion to open radicalnephrectomy is difficult to evaluate retrospectively, therates of conversion could not be compared between the 2approaches using the Premier Healthcare database. Fourth,long-termdataarenecessarytofurthercompareoncologicaloutcomes and quality of life between robotic-assisted andlaparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Conclusions Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy forrenal mass between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-assisted surgery increased substantially. The use of robotic-assistance was not associated with increased risk of any ormajor complications but was associated with prolongedoperating time and higher hospital costs compared withlaparoscopic surgery.Outcomes and Costs of Robotic-Assisted vs Laparoscopic Radical Investigation Research jama.com 318, Number 16 1567 \u00a9 2017 American Medical Association.

Question source : P&T staff, HERC staff Issue : In November 2017, the HERC adopted modifications to the severe inflammatory skin disease guideline for therapies for atopic dermatitis (AD) based on ICD -10 Dermatology reviewer recommendations. However, these therapies do not completely agree with the ev idence reviews on medication effectiveness done by the P&T Committee. P&T and HERC staff have worked to propose modifications to the guideline that reflect the evidence reviews done by P&T. Specific P&T concerns include lack of evidence to support use o f cyclosporine, methotrexate or azathioprine in atopic dermatitis. Given the safety risks associated with systemic therapy, it would seem that topical therapies such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be recommended prior to systemic therapy. According t o NICE guidelines for AD, systemic immunosuppressants are \"treatments of last resort\" in AD patients. The cost of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have come down considerably since the ICD-10 Dermatology review and should no longer be considered prohibitive. Based on staff and P&T review, removing older language regarding psoriasis was also recommended. P&T review criteria currently match the guideline, but could change in a more nimble fashion if new medications come on the market, costs of medications chang e, etc. Note: line 424 is SEVERE INFLAMMATORY SKIN DISEASE . HERC staff recommendation : 1) Modify GN21 as shown below a. Removes wording regarding medications for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . P&T review criteria will determine coverage GUIDELINE NOTE 21, SEVERE INFLAMMATORY SKIN DISEASE Lines 424, 480, 502, 530, 539, 654 Inflammatory skin conditions included in this guideline are: A) Psoriasis B) Atopic F) Discoid lupus The conditions above are included on line 424 if severe, defined as having functional impairment (e.g. inability to use hands or feet for activities of daily living, or significant facial involvement preventing normal social interaction) AND one or more of the following: A) At least 10% of body surface area involved B) Hand, foot or mucous membrane involvement. Otherwise, these conditions above are included on Lines 480, 502, 530, 539 and 654. Severe Inflammatory Skin Disease Guideline Revisions 2 For severe psoriasis, first line agents include topical agents, phototherapy and methotrexate . Second line agents include other systemic agents and oral retinoids and should be limited to those who fail, or have contraindications to, or do not have access to first line agents. Biologics are included on this line only for the indication of severe p laque psoriasis; after documented failure of first line agents and failure of (or contraindications to) a second line agent. For severe atopic dermatitis/eczema, fist line agents include topical corticosteroids, narrowband UVB, cyclosporine, methotrexate , and azathioprine. Second line agents include topical pimecrolimus and topical tacrolimus and should be limited to those who fail or have contraindications to first line agents. Biologic agents are included on this line for atopic dermatitis only after f ailure of or contraindications to first and second line agents. Ultraviolet Light and Other Light Therapies 1 Question s: 1) Should ultraviolet light therapy be paired with mycosis fungoides and similar cutaneous lymphoma diagnoses ? 2) Should ultraviole t light therapy be removed from certain lines due to lack of appropriate pairings ? 3) Should laser treatment for inflammatory skin disorders be continued? If so, should there be any limitations? 4) Should home light therapy be included on the Prioritized List? 5) Where s hould home bili -lights for treatment of newborns with hyperbilirubinemia be placed? Question source s: 1) Dave Pass, MD Providence Medical Director ; subsequently other CCO medical directors 2) HERC staff 3) CCO medical directors 4) CCO medical directors , HSD staff 5) HERC staff Issue s: 1) Psoralens and ultraviolet A light (PUVA) treatments and narrow -band UVB phototherapy (NB- UVB) treatments are considered standard of care for mycosis fungoides and other lymphomas involving the skin , https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190 -9622(15)02206 -9/pd f). Mycosis fungoides of cutaneous T -cell lymphoma . It generally affects the skin, but may progress internally over time. Symptoms include rash, tumors, skin lesions, and itchy skin. Other treatments for mycosis fungoides include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 2) On review, staff found multiple differen t lines that had PUVA and UVB therapy that did not appear to have any diagnoses that were appropriate for pairing . In addition, PUVA and UVB were missing from lines with some of these appropriate diagnoses. PUVA and UVB are used to treat polycythemia parapsoriasis. 3) CCO medical directors raised concerns abo ut laser light therapy for inflammatory skin disease. They feel that this therapy is being misused. It is considerably more expensive that traditional light therapy [note: fee schedule information indicates that it is generally in the same cost range ], but is being used as first line therapy in many dermatology offices. The CPT codes for laser light therapy (CPT 96920 -96922 Laser treatment for inflammatory skin disease (psoriasis)) are on lines 206 SUPERFICIAL ABSCESSE S AND CELLULITIS, 424 SEVERE INFLAMMATORY SKIN DISEASE, AND 539 MIL D Xenon lamps were developed as targeted NB -UVB treatment devices; they generate monochromatic or very narrow band radiation with a lambda max of 308 nm. Targeted phototherapy devices are directed at specific lesions or affected areas, thus limiting exposure to the surrounding normal tissues. They may therefore allow higher dosages compared to a light box, which could result in fewer treatments t o produce clearing. The American Academy of Dermatology guidelines for the treatment of psoriasis Other Light Therapies 2 targeted phototherapy (excimer laser) is in dicated for adult and pediatric patients with mild, moderate, or severe psoriasis with <10% BSA involvement.\" Level of Evidence: II Strength of Recommendation: B (Mentor 2010). 4) CCO medical directors requested a review into use of home UVB light boxes for treatment of skin disease. This therapy was felt to be cheape r than biologic medications , but the efficacy of home light therapy was not known by the group. The Ontario Health Technology Assessment (http://www.hqontario.ca/Portals/0/Documents/evidence/reports/rev_uv_photo_2009 1201.pdf ) group reviewed home light therapy in their review of UV light, and found \"Effectiveness and safety of home NB -UVB phototherapy was not inferior to NB -UVB phototherapy provided in a clinic to patients with psoriasis referred for phototherapy . Treatment burden was lower and patient satisfaction was higher with home therapy and patients in both groups preferred future phototherapy treatments at home.\" (OHTA 2009) OHTA b ased their conclusions on a single high quality study, and noted the literature is very limited on home therapy. They note: \"When combined with a telemedicin e follow -up, home phototherapy may provide an alternative strategy for improved access to service and follow -up care, particularly for those with geographic or mobility barriers. Safety and effectiveness have, however, so far been evaluated for only one ph ototherapy home -based delivery model.\" a. No additional high quality trials found of home phototherapy other than the PLUTO trial referenced in the OHTA report i. Koek 2009 , RCT t o determine whether ultraviolet B phototherapy at home is equally safe and equally effective as ultraviolet B phototherapy in an outpatient setting for patients with psoriasis (https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/338/bmj.b1542.full.pdf ) 1. N=196 patients 2. Results: of the patients treated at home compared with 79% of the patients treated in an outpatient setting reached the SAPASI 50 (difference 2.8%, 95% confidence interval 8.6% to 14.2%), 50 ( 2.3%, 15.7% t o 11.1%). For patients treated at home the median SAPASI score decreased 82% (from 6.7 to 1.2) and the median PASI score decreased 74% (from 8.4 to 2.2), compared with 79% (from 7.0 to 1.4) and 70% (from 7.0 to 2.1) for patients treated in an outpatient se tting. Treatment effect as defined by the mean decline in PASI and SAPASI scores was significant (P<0.001) and similar across groups (P>0.3). Total cumulative doses of ultraviolet B light were similar (51.5 v 46.1 J/cm2, difference 5.4, 95% confidence interval 5.2 to 16.0), and the occurrence of short term side effects did not differ. The burden of undergoing ultraviolet B phototherapy was significantly lower for patients treated at home (differences 1.23 to 3.01, all P 0.001). Quality of life increased eq ually regardless of treatment, but patients treated at home more often rated their experience with the therapy as \"excellent \" (42%, 38/90) compared with patients treated in the outpatient department (23%, 20/88; P =0.001). 3. Conclusion Ultraviolet B photother apy administered at home is equally safe and equally effective, both clinically and for quality of life, as ultraviolet B phototherapy administered in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, ultraviolet B phototherapy at home resulted in a lower burden of trea tment and led to greater patients ' satisfaction. Ultraviolet Light and Other Light Therapies 3 ii. Koek 2010 , economic analysis of PLUTO trial (https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/340/bmj.c1490.full.pdf ) 1. The average total costs by the end of phototherapy were \u20ac800 for home treatment and \u20ac752 for outpatient treatment, showing an incremental cost per patient of \u20ac48 (95% CI \u20ac77 to \u20ac174). The average total costs by one year after the end of phototherapy were \u20ac1272 and \u20ac1148 respectively (difference \u20ac124, 95% CI \u20ac155 to \u20ac403). 2. Cost utility analyses revealed that patients experienced equal health benefits \u2014that is, a gain of 0.296 versus 0.291 QALY (home v outpatient) by the end of phototherapy (difference 0.005 2, 0.0244 to 0.0348) and 1.153 versus 1.126 QALY by one year after the end of phototherapy (difference 0.0267, 0.024 to 0.078). 3. Incremental costs per QALY gained were \u20ac9276 and \u20ac4646 respectively, both amounts well below the normally accepted standard of \u20ac20 000 per QALY. 4. Conclusions : Home ultraviolet B phototherapy for psoriasis is not more expensive than phototherapy in an outpatient setting and proved to be cost effective. As both treatments are at least equally effective and patients express a prefer ence for home treatment, the authors conclude that home phototherapy should be the primary treatment option for patients who are eligible for phototherapy with ultraviolet B light. 5) HERC staff became aware during this review that home bilirubin lights (HCPCS E0202 Phototherapy Neonatal jaundice is found on line 102 HEMOLYTIC DISEASE DUE TO ISOIMMUNIZATION, ANEMIA DUE TO TRAN SPLACENTAL HEMORRHAGE, AND FETAL AND NEONATAL JAUNDICE Other coverage policies : All major insurers cover PUVA and UVB therapy for mycosis fungoides and related cutaneous lymphomas such as Sezary syndrome.

Additionally, such therapy is used for graft vs host disease and scleroderma. Light t herapy is not recommended for acne by the American Academy of Dermatology. 2) Many of the lines currently containing the CPT codes for UVA and UVB light therapy have no appropriate diagnoses. Other lines with appropriate diagnoses do than have the CPT codes for this therapy. 3) Laser light therapy is only recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology for limited disease (<10% BSE), which by guideline definition limits i ts placement to the lower inflammatory skin disease line. 4) Home UVB light therapy has been shown by one high quality study to be non -inferior to office based light therapy. It may be easier for patients to comply with light therapy if it is available in the home; cost is si milar to office based treatment. 5) Home bili -light therapy should be added to the line containing the diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

Advi se HSC to remove HCPCS E0202 from the Ancillary List Section 7.0 Biennial Review 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 1 Question : Should severe acne other than acne conglobata be included on a covered line on the Prioritized List? If so, what degree of acne severity should qualify for coverage? Question sources : Julie Dhossche, MD, resident OHSU Dermatology; Darin Vaughan, MD, pediatrician in Bend; several community dermatology providers Issue: Acne is a common skin disease affecting approximately up to 85% of 11 -30 year-olds. Acne is a polymorphic, inflammatory skin disease most commonly affecting the face (99% of cases). Less frequently it also affects the back (60%) and chest (15%). At the time of the 2012 ICD-10 Dermatology review, no form of acne was covered according to the Prioritized List. During this review, coverage for acne conglobata, the most severe form of cystic acne, was recommended to be added with a new line and guideline, which went into effect on January 1, 2015. Coverage was limited to acne conglobata resulting in recurrent abscesses or communicating sinuses. The new acne conglobata line is Line 373 ACNE CONGLOBATA (SEVERE CYSTIC ACNE). Previously, cystic acne was on line 545 (now line 520), which was renamed CYSTIC ACNE ACNE; ROSACEA with the ICD-10 review. Cystic acne was on a funded line prior to 2003 (with no guideline note) and then no form of acne was on a funded line after that until the appearance of the new acne conglobata line in 2015. Dr. Dhossche and Dr. Vaughan are requesting consideration for coverage for severe cystic acne that does not rise to the severity of recurrent abscesses or communicating sinuses. Treatment of severe acne may involve oral antibiotics, topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, oral isotretinoin, and oral contraceptives. Currently, by OHA P&T PA criteria, medications commonly used to treat severe acne, including topical antibiotics, retinoids, and benzoyl peroxide, are all listed as not covered due to acne being an uncovered condition. Oral antibiotics (short course) and oral contraceptives are likely covered as they can be used for other indications which are above the funding line on the Prioritized List. Current Prioritized List status: 1)Acne conglobata (ICD-10 L70.1) 2)All other acne diagnoses (ICD-10 L70.0, L70.2-9) are on line 520 ROSACEA; ACNE GUIDELINE NOTE 132, ACNE CONGLOBATA Line 373 Acne conglobata is only included on Line 373 if it involves recurrent abscesses or communicating sinuses. 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 2 Excerpt from Dr. Dhossche's letter to the HERC (please refer to the entire letter for additional helpful information): Given the curative nature and efficacy of isotretinoin in severe and scarring acne, it is the one treatment for acne that should be available to all those at risk for permanent scarring from their disease. Acne disproportionately affects the young population, and it is heartbreaking to see a child's disease cause permanent disfigurement knowing we have the tools to prevent it, but being limited in their tre atment course by their insurance coverage and their parents' economic status. Given the evidence presented above regarding the personal and societal impact of severe and scarring acne on children and adolescents, as well as the excellent and generic trea tments available for acne, I propose the following change to the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). Assuming Medicaid coverage is not possible for mild to moderate acne, we advocate for coverage of acne only in cases of scarring disease, particularly in the pediatr ic population. Currently acne is included with rosacea on line 525, which is not covered by OHP under any conditions. Acne conglobata, which is an uncommon severe eruptive nodulocystic acne, is covered (on line 378) with the proviso that there are communi cating sinus tracts as well as recurrent abscesses. As I have discussed, 'acne conglobata' does not encompass all forms of severe and/or scarring acne that require prompt and appropriate treatment. I propose that medical coverage be provided for a diagnosi s of 'nodulocystic acne', or 'scarring acne' for those under the age of 21. This change will make a profound impact in children's lives. Dr. D hossche's suggested definition for severe acne: \"[The] presence of persistent or recurrent inflammatory nodule s and cysts, ongoing scarring, or recurrent abscesses or communicating sinuses (acne conglobata).\" Suggested alternate definitions: \"The presence of persistent or recurrent inflammatory nodules and cysts AND ongoing scarring, or recurrent abscesses or co mmunicating sinuses (acne conglobata).\" \"The presence of persistent or recurrent inflammatory nodules and cysts AND ongoing scarring, or recurrent abscesses or communicating sinuses.\" Information from Dr. D hossche regarding costs 1) Most acne medications are generic and area available over the counter: generic antibiotics, Differin, benzoyl peroxide 2) Cost analysis of the use of isotretinoin in severe recalcitrant nodular acne in 475 patients in a study done by Neary et al. in 2002 show ed an average cost of $1231 for isotretinoin for 141 days, which included office visits and laboratory testing. After isotretinoin therapy, more than 25% of patients had no expenses related to acne for at least the following year, and the mean acne -related expense for remaining patients dropped from $471 to $135 per year. Information from Dr. D hossche regarding other state Medicaid coverage: 1) California has on their Medicaid formulary list several generic acne products in each category (topical retinoid, t opical antibiotic, oral retinoid), most with a quantity limit per month 2) Certain states, such as Indiana, Mississippi, and Utah, have an age cut -off: they cover in their state Medicaid program a range of generic acne medications, from topical retinoids to oral 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 3 retinoid, for patients with a diagnosis of acne who are under the age of 20 (Utah), 21 (Mississippi), or 25 (Indiana) 3) Other states, such as Michigan and Arizona, cover several topical agents ranging from retinoids , topical antibiotics, and benzoyl peroxide, but require a prior authorization when prescribing isotretinoin 4) Colorado requires a prior authorization for all topical products and isotretinoin; the state authorizes payment for these therapies for the diagno ses of cystic acne, disorders of keratinization, and comedonal or acne vulgaris. 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 4 Evidence 1) Gieler 2015 , review of psychological effects of acne a. Significantly lower self -attitude, uselessness feeling, sense of pride and self -worth, body satisfaction, and a higher percentage of patients harbouring suicidal ideation have been observed in the affected population. Left untreated, acne lesions may persist into adulthood, which translates into higher unemployment rates for patients with severe acne compared to ad ults without acne, implying that acne affects patients' work situations and their ability to obtain employment b. Acne patients are characterized by a tremendous impairment of quality of life equal to that reported by patients with other chronic diseases such as asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, back pain or arthritis. Furthermore, surveys indicated that quality of life does not correlate with the physician's assessment of acne severity. Even in mild forms, acne has a detrimental psychological effect on patients c. Irrespective of the degree of severity, patients with acne are at increased risk of anxiety and depression compared to the non -affected population d. Several studies support the observation that appropriate acne treatment plays a central role in the efforts to e nhance patients' quality of life Expert guidelines American Academy of Dermatology 2016 guideline on treatment of acne 1) Treatments: lists first line and alter native therapies for mild, moderate or severe acne. 2) Definition of mild, moderate or severe acne: a. To date, there is no universally agreed -upon grading system, and systems can differ greatly between studies. In addition, interobserver reliability of these scales varies, but has been poor in some studies. American Academy of Pediatrics 2013 guideline on treatment of acne http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/131/Supplement_3/S163.full.pdf : 1) It has been repeatedly demonstrated that acne can have a signi ficant adverse impact on quality of life, and that the level of distress may not correlate directly with acne severity 2) Defining acne severity: a. Acne severity may be classi fied clinically as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and type of lesions and the amount of skin involved. Although there are numerous grading systems by which to de fine acne severity, there is no agreed -upon standard, and interpretation is subjective b. Typically, patients ' assessments do not correlate well with either those of physicians or published severity scales. 3) Various treatment options are reviewed European evidence based guidelines for the treatment of acne, 2013 https://www.slideshare.net/UtaiSukviwatsirikul/european -evidencebased -s3-guidelin es-for-the- treatment -of-acne : 1) Defining acne severity: 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 5 a. There are inherent difficulties in objectively measuring acne. Over 25 different methods have been described but there is no consensus as to which should be used 2) Evidence for various therapies reviewed . For nodular/conglobate acne, a high strength of recommendation was given to oral isotretinoin; a medium strength of recommendation was given to systemic antibiotics in combination with azelaic acid. Low strength of recommendation was given or oral anti -androgens in combination with oral antibiotics, and to systemic antibiotics in combination with adapalene and/or benzoyl peroxide Consensus conference on acne classification 1990 1) Severe acne was defined as having numerous and/or extensive papules and pustules with many nodules 2) \"The clinical diagnosis of severe acne should be based on the presence of any of the following characteristics: persistent or recurrent inflammatory nodules, extensive papulopustular disease, ongoing scarring, persistent purulent and/or serosanguinous drainage from lesions, or the presence of sinus tracks.\" 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 6 Similar conditions on the Prioritized List Skin conditions which only appear on a funded line include severe, life threatening conditions like scalded skin syndrome as well as conditions with systemic effects such as epidermolysis bullosa or pemphigus vulgaris . Conditions similar to acne affecting facial skin that appear on both a funded and an unfunded line depending on severity include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and discoid lupus. There is a guideline indicating that these conditions are only on line 424 SEVERE INFLAMMATORY SKIN DISEA SE if the condition results in functional impairment (e.g. inability to use hands or feet for activities of daily living, or significant facial involvement preventing normal social interaction) AND one or more of the following: 1) at least 10% of body surf ace area involved and /or 2) h and, foot or mucous membrane involvement . Similarly, hemangiomas of the face are included on a funded line only when ulcerated, infected, recurrently hemorrhaging, or function -threatening (e.g. eyelid hemangioma); otherwise, they are on an unfunded line. Similar conditions which are only o n unfunded lines include contact dermatitis, tinea (ring worm), diaper rash, localized scleroderma, pityriasis, rosacea, and vitiligo. These conditions are either self -limited, do not affec t overall health, are treated with inexpensive over the counter medications, and/ or have no effective treatment. HERC staff summary : Severe acne can have significant impact on quality of life; however, there appears to be no agreed upon definition of se vere acne. Evidence also does not support that the severity of acne correlates with the degree of impact on quality of life. There is evidence that treatment of acne (of any severity) impro ves measures of quality of life for patients. Similar conditions such as psoriasis and eczema have been placed on funded lines for severe forms of the condition. Other similar conditions remain on unfunded lines only. If coverage were adopted for severe acne, the following issues would need to be addressed: 1) Defining severe acne vs mild/moderate disease . There is no agreed upon definition. Staff has worked with Dr. D hossche to develop a definition used in the proposal below only as a starting point for discussion. 2) The increased need for and cost of dermatology con sultation to determine if a patient has severe acne, rather than mild or moderate disease . 3) The increased cost of medications to treat severe acne, such as isotretinoin or topical retinoids. Additionally, most recommended treatment algorithms include medic ations which could be used to treat mild or moderate acne, such as benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics. If these medications were opened for use, P&T would need to develop PA criteria to ensure only severe disease is treated, and the cost and resource utilization involved in managing such a PA process would need to be considered . 2020 Biennial Review Severe Acne 7 HERC staff recommendation : 1) Consider coverage for severe cystic acne . a.

It is typically considered a disease of older youth, affecting up to 85% of adolescents [1,2 ]; however, acne can occur in neonates, infants, and younger children as well [3]. Acne is a multifactorial skin disease that affects the pilosebaceous unit, leading to clinical findings that range from scattered comedones to widespread inflammatory lesions that form nodules and cysts [1]. Inflammation can be severe and cause permanent scarring and disfigurement [4]. The degree of scarring is related to the severity and duration of acne prior to treatment [5,6]. Early, appropriate treatment is critical in the prevention of lifelong disfigurement in patients with severe acne [1 ]. Multiple recent studies have demonstrated the negative impact that acne scarring has on self- esteem, quality of life, and risk for depression and suicidality [7]. This document will focus on the pediatric population and review current literature on the mental health effects of acne on patients, as well as the current treatment guidelines for acne, especially scarring acne. Severe, nodulocystic, or scarring acne poses a substantial burden on the mental health of teenagers and young adults. Successful and cost-effective treatments are widely available and should be covered for children on the Oregon Health Plan. Current Treatment Guidelines: In 2015, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and algorithms for the treatment of acne vulgaris were published by Zaenglein et al, with the approval of the American Academy of Dermatology [8]. Evidence-based recommendations issued by the American Acne and Rosacea Society in 2013 provide a step-wise therapy approach to pediatric acne, based on the type and severity of the acne [3]. These guidelines are endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the advocacy organization committed to the health of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults [9]. The treatment of acne in each age group \u2014neonatal acne, infantile acne, mid- childhood acne, and pre-adolescent acne \u2014is comparable to the treatment of acne in adolescents and adults, as many of the medications have been shown to be safe for use in children younger than 12 years [3]. For mild acne, which may feature comedones and scattered superficial pustules or inflammatory papules, the first line is a benzoyl peroxide product or topical retinoid, or a combination of these. A topical antibiotic agent may be added in combination with benzoyl peroxide (e.g. clindamycin- benzoyl peroxide) ; monotherapy with a topical antibiotic (except dapsone) is discouraged given widespread resistance. For moderate acne, which typically features a marked number of inflammatory lesions with some comedones, topical combination treatment may be first line (benzoyl peroxide with topical antibiotic and topical retinoid), though oral antibiotics may be warranted (in the pediatric population under 8 years old, tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline are avoided in favor of erythromycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). If there is inadequate response, hormonal therapy should be considered for pubertal females, and isotretinoin should be considered. For severe acne, which features inflammatory and/or nodular lesions as well as scarring, treatment may consist of an oral antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and benzoyl peroxide with or without a topical antibiotic; however, oral isotretinoin and hormonal therapy in pubertal females should be considered given that prompt, appropriate treatment is crucial to achieve control of the inflammation and prevent permanent scarring [3,8 ]. Dr. Julie Dhossche Presentation to HERC - May 17, 2018Psychiatric Effects of Undertreated Acne: Acne overwhelmingly affects children and adolescents in the crucial years of ide ntity and social devel opment, and it is no surprise that psychiatric and psychosocial effects of skin disease in the pediatric population have been increasingly studied [2]. Acne adversely affects the self -image and confidence of many patients suffering from the disease [2,10 -15]. The association of acne with psychiatric disorders such as social phobia, anxiety, and depression has been well established [ 12, 15-22]. Multiple studies have shown a strong association between acne and depression: one large retrospective study found clinical depression to be two to three times more prevalent in acne patients than general population [16]. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are also two times more common in those affected with acne . Acne is significantly associated with suicidal id eation in adolescents; adolescent dermatology patients have been reported to be more likely to express suicidal ideation than those with other skin conditions [ 17,18, 20 ]. In a recent study of patients with acne, over 95% of the respondents said they had r educed quality of life due to acne, and 12.9% had suicidal thoughts due to acne [22]. Stigmatization: The disfigurement caused by acne scarring not only affect s behavior and self -esteem, but also impacts social relationships. Discrimination is often exper ienced by those with severe acne and acne scarring . In a study by Timms et al, when compared to photographs of a male and female with clear skin, photographs of a male and female with moderate acne were on first impression judged as younger, less mature, a nd significantly less attractive, and given lower potential friendship and o verall personality scores [10 ]. It has been reported that the social disadvantage of having acne translates itself into disadvantage in obtaining work [11]. The condition of skin has certainly been described as a limiting factor in employment: in an interview -based study by Jowett and Ryan examining the impact of eczema, psoriasis , and acne on various aspects of life, 45% of those with acne reported experien cing interpersonal difficulty, and t he appearance of skin was a limiting factor for a young man wanting to work in a fashion store, and a young woma n wanting to work as a hairdresser [23 ]. Treatment considerations : Isotretinoin has been shown in multiple controlled studies to improve testing parameters and patient symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as quality of life, dur ing and after therapy [24-29]. In fact, compared to groups with topical treatments only, in which there were higher drop-out rates, patients in the isotretinoin group had significantly reduced rates of depression after 4 months of treatment [ 29]. Isotretinoin became available in the early 1980s, and since that time has transformed the treatment for acne vulgaris [ 30]. This vitamin A analogue remai ns the most efficacious treatment for severe acne as well as moderate acne that is unresponsive to topical and /or oral antibiotics . In randomized double -blinded clinical studies isotretinoin has been clearly shown to be effective in the treatment of acne b y reducing acne lesions a nd reducing scarring [25 -27,31]. The efficacy of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe nodular acne and scarring acne is well documented throughout the literature , and the current guidelines for acne treatment recommend use of i sotretinoin in severe forms of acne, including cystic acne or acne refractory to other treatments , as well as acne with marked inflammation and tendency to early scarring [3,8,32 -36]. Factors to consider in the assessment of severity of disease and necessi ty of isotretinoin should include the impact of the disease on the patient and the presence or potential for scarring [ 25,32 ]. Isotretinoin is the only drug available that targets the four main factors of pathogenesis of acne, as it decreases sebum prod uction and sebaceous gland size by decreasing basal sebocyte proliferation and terminal sebocyte differentiation, thereby resulting in an altered microenvironment which decreases Propionibacterium presence and decreases its potential for causing inflammati on [36]. Isotretinoin is usually prescribed as a 4 -6 month treatment course, with the intent to be a curative . Relapses do occur, most often among patients with severe acne on lower doses of isotretinoin [5,36 ]. However, with a repeat course of therapy, the acne remains equally responsive to the drug [37]. A course of isotretinoin is essentially considered a cure for acne. Cost Considerations : Studies regarding the cost -effectiveness of acne treatments are limited. However, most acne treatments are available as generic s, and benzoyl peroxide and differ in, which are effective for mild to moderate acne, are even over the counter. The step -wise treatment approach assures safe, individualized, and targeted treatment [ 3,8]. Isotretinoin has the highest initia l cost of the acne treatments , but given its efficacy and limited course duration, is very cost-effective [38,39]. A 4- 6 month course of isotretinoin has been shown to more effective long -term than a 3 -year combination course of oral antibiotics and topica l treatments: upon reassessment 3 -5 years after treatment, only the patients treated with isotretinoin had complete clearance of their acne [5 ]. Cost analysis of the use of isotretinoin in severe recalcitrant nodular acne in 475 patients in a study done by Neary et al. in 2002 showed an average cost of $1231 for isotretinoin for 141 days, which included office visits and laboratory testing. After isotretinoin therapy, more than 25% of patients had no expenses related to acne for at least the following year, and the mean acne-related expense for remaining patients dropped from $471 to $135 per year. Recent studies are now showing that increased laboratory monitoring is not necessarily beneficial in determining course of treatment given that severe adverse eff ects are rare and most likely occur early in the treatment course; this change will likely decrease costs more [ 40]. Conclusions: Given the curative nature and efficacy of isotretinoin in severe and scarring acne , it is the one treatment for acne that should be available to all those at risk for permanent scarring from their disease . Acne disproportionatel y affects the young population , and it is heartbreaking to see a child's disease cause permanent disfigurement knowing we have the tools to prevent it, but being limited in their treatment course by their insurance coverage and their parents' economic status . Given the evidence presented above regarding the personal and societal impact of severe and scarring acne on children and adolescents, as well as the excellent and generic treatment s available for acne, I propose the following change to the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). Assuming Medicaid coverage is not possible for mild to moderate acne, we advocate for coverage of acne only in cases of scarring di sease , particularly in the pediatric population. Currently acne is included with rosacea on line 525, which is not covered by OHP under any conditions . Acne conglobata, which is an uncommon severe eruptiv e nodulocystic acne, is covered (on line 378) with the proviso that there are communicating sinus tracts as well as recurrent abscesses. As I have discussed, 'acne conglobata' does not encompass all forms of severe and /or scarring acne that require prompt and appropriate treatment . I propose that medical coverage be provided for a diagnosis of 'nodulocystic acne', or 'scarring acne' for those under the age of 21 . This change will make a profound impact in children's lives. Of note, I have listed here a few examples of individual states and how their Med icaid program covers acne. C alifornia has on their Medicaid formulary list several generic acne products in each category (topica l retinoid, topical antibiotic, oral retinoid ), most with a quantity limit per month [41]. Certain states, such as Indiana, Mi ssissippi, and Utah, have an age cut -off: they cover in their state Medicaid program a range of generic acne medications, from topical retinoids to oral retinoid, for patients with a diagnosis of acne who are under the age of 20 (Utah), 21 (Mississippi), o r 25 (Indiana) [42-44]. Utah requires a prior authorization for acne treatment in patients over 20 [44]. Other states, such as Michigan and Arizona, cover several topical agents ranging from retinoids, topical antibiotics, and benzoyl peroxide, but require a prior authorization when prescribing isotretinoin [45-46]. Michigan also has a quantity limit of isotretinoin per month [45]. Colorado requires a prior authorization for all topical products and isotretinoin ; the state authorizes payment for these therapies for the diagnoses of cystic acne, disorders of keratinization, and comedona l or acne vulgaris . For the diagnoses of cystic acne or comedonal acne they do not require previous trials and therapy failure wit h other anti -acne products regardless of age [47]. These are only a handful of examples. Please do the right thing for the children of Oregon. References: 1. Zaenglein 2. Nguyen CM, Koo Cordoro KM.

SUPPLEMENT ARTICLE Acne and quality of life -impact and management U. Gieler,1,* T. Gieler2, JP. for Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine, and Psychotherapy Giessen, 3Institute of Medical Psychology, Giessen, Giessen, Germany *Correspondence: U. Gieler. E-mail: Uwe.Gieler@psycho.med.uni-giessen.de Abstract Acne is a common skin disease with a high prevalence in adolescents and young adults. In addition to physical effects such as permanent scarring and dis gurement, acne has long-lasting psychosocial effects that affect the patient 's qual- ity of life. Depression, social isolation and suicidal ideation are frequent comorbidities of acne that should not beneglected in the therapy of acne patients. Research evidence suggests that the impairment of quality of life can be allevi-ated by appropriate topical acne treatment.

Introduction Acne is a common skin disease affecting approximately up to 85% of 11 -30 year-olds.1Frequently, acne affects the face, is dif- cult to hide and may produce scars that can persist for years or forlife. Although acne is known to be the primary reason for consult-ing a dermatologist, 2the psychological consequences of the dis- ease have often been underestimated. In the classical view, thedisease was dismissed as purely physiological or even discussed asa non-medical symptom. 3Meanwhile, experts agree that ade- quate acne management entails far more than treatment of pim- ples. Adolescence is a time of important physical, emotional andsocial development. With its high prevalence particularly in theadolescent population, 4facial acne has a considerable psychoso- cial impact on these patients by causing signicant negativeeffects on self-image leading to feelings of isolation and loneli-ness. 5-7A signicantly lower self-attitude, uselessness feeling, sense body satisfaction,8and a higher per- centage of patients harbouring suicidal ideation have been observed in the affected population.9Left untreated, acne lesions may persist into adulthood, which translates into higher unem-ployment rates for patients with severe acne compared to adultswithout acne, implying that acne affects patients' work situationsand their ability to obtain employment. 10Consistently, lower social status has been associated with greater acne severity.11 Acne and impaired quality of life In order to improve the understanding of the disease from thepatient's point of view, assessing the quality of life has become astandard outcome measure in most studies. Since acne can adversely affect patient's quality of life in many ways, a variety of methods has been described to assess quality of life includingdermatology-specic measures such as the Dermatology LifeQuality Index (DLQI), the Dermatology Quality of Dermatology Specic of Life (DSQL), theAcne Disability Index (ADI) 12and Skindex.13-15These quality of life instruments can advance the physician -patient relationship by giving clinicians accurate knowledge of how patients live with their disease.16 Unsurprisingly, acne patients are characterized by a tremen- dous impairment of quality of life equal to that reported bypatients with other chronic diseases such as asthma, epilepsy,diabetes, back pain or arthritis. 17Furthermore, surveys indicated that quality of life does not correlate with the physician's assess-ment of acne severity. 16,18Even in mild forms, acne has a detri- mental psychological effect on patients.19Several studies analysed the effect of acne on quality of life in detail.20A greater impact on quality of life was associated with older age, femalegender and longer acne duration ( >5 years). 21,22The way in which patients perceive their skin to be evaluated by others hasimplications for self-perception and may act as a barrier to par-ticipation in public sports and exercise. 23Irrespective of the degree of severity, patients with acne are at increased risk of anx-iety and depression compared to the non-affected population. The greater the impairment of quality of life due to acne, the higher the level of anxiety and depression. 24,25Also, the tendency to experience emotions of anger at regular intervals might be \u00a92015 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV 2015, 4) ,1 JEADVpartly responsible for patients' poor global and skin-related quality of life and dissatisfaction with treatments.26Given the psycho-social ramications of acne, it is important to identifyand treat the affected teenagers at an early stage in order to alle-viate the individual impairment of quality of life and, as a result, reduce the future socio-economic burden of their acne. 4 Management of quality of life problems in acne patients Several studies support the observation that appropriate acne treatment plays a central role in the efforts to enhance patients'quality of life. 27For instance, oral treatment with roxithromycin had a therapeutic effect on inflammatory acne and led to improvement in quality of life.28Similarly, acne grading and acne-related quality of life, along with severity of depression,improved after 8 weeks of oral isotretinoin treatment, wherebyimprovement in depression was found to be directly related toacne-related quality of life improvements rather than toimprovement in the acne grade. 29A small study compared the effect of oral isotretinoin and topical antibiotics or retinoids onquality of life, and on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results revealed that successful treatment in general improved both symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as quality oflife. 30The impact of topical acne treatment on quality of life was further investigated in a prospective randomized case -control study with 382 patients. Patients were randomized (115:130) toreceive topical clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide or adapalene/ben-zoyl peroxide (adapalene-BPO). Improvement in quality of lifefrom baseline to week 12 was observed in both treatment groups. Quality of life increased more in those patients with a successful treatment. There was a higher impairment of quality of life inpatients with more side-effects, and females had a lower qualityof life than men. Patients with higher impairment of quality oflife at baseline had a greater benet from the treatment thanthose with an acceptable quality of life at baseline [data on le].Moreover, in the long-term treatment of patients with predomi-nantly moderate inflammatory facial acne using adapalene-BPO alone or in combination with other drugs, application of the gel over a 9-month period led to a marked increase in quality of lifeat all grades of acne severity. 31Another case -control study com- pared 32 acne patients with 32 healthy individuals. At baseline,the acne group showed a signicantly increased grade of disguston the Skin Satisfaction Questionnaire, lower ratings in attrac-tiveness and self-condence according to a questionnaire evalu-ating their own body, and a signicant reduction in social functioning in the SF-36 questionnaire. Treatment produced highly signicant improvements of Investigator's Global Assess-ment and total face lesion count. Simultaneously, impairment ofquality of life measured by the Cardiff Acne Disability Index(CADI) declined signicantly as well. Women with acne hadbeen signicantly more affected in their quality of life than theirmale counterparts. However, they showed a greater decrease inthe percentage of acne lesions. 32A marked benecial effect of acne treatment on quality of life was also demonstrated in twosequential double-blind randomized studies, in which patientsreceived either adapalene-BPO or vehicle, in combination withdoxycycline for 12 weeks. Patients having obtained at least a good improvement according to investigator global assessment were re-randomized for a 24-week therapy with adapalene-BPOor vehicle. Quality of life assessed by the Acne-QoL wasimproved at week 12 in all domains with a signicant differencefor the acne-symptoms domain in favour of the adapalene-BPOregimen. Additional 24-week adapalene-BPO treatment showeda sustained improvement, signicant for all domains except foracne symptoms. In the vehicle arm, quality of life signicantly worsened for all domains. 33In accordance, a phase IV, prospec- tive, 12-week, open-label trial with 544 patients showed signi-cant improvement on the Acne Quality of Life Index scale12 weeks after switching from a previous dissatisfactory acneregimen to tretinoin dispensed from a pump. 34 Comment The studies summarized above underline the necessity of appro- priate acne treatment in an approach that includes the overall morbidity associated with acne. In this context, medical adher-ence to acne treatment has become a prerequisite to avoid treat-ment failure. Although there have been relatively few formalstudies of adherence in acne, data suggest it is poor overall, espe-cially in young adults and adolescent patients. 35,36The leading factors that contribute to poor adherence may be reduced withenhanced patient consultation, reminder systems, education, as well as ease of application, for instance using formulations for once-daily administration. 37-39Adherence to treatment is also linked to better quality of life40: Adherence to topical acne ther- apy has been shown to increase with impact on quality of life,while increasing acne severity led to a decrease in adherence. 41 Vice versa, quality of life was rated signicantly better in adher-ent patients compared to those with poor adherence. 31Although secondary emotional impairment due to disgurement by acne is undisputed, psychological aspects are often neglected in the therapy of acne patients, which may result in poor adherenceand discontent with treatment. Therefore, it is imperial to con-sider acne as more than a mere cosmetic problem and to includepsychosocial aspects in the management of acne. In conclusion, acne has a considerable impact on quality of life. Especially in the group of adolescent patients, the effect onpsychosocial stress should be given more attention. The impair- ment of quality of life can be alleviated by appropriate topical acne treatment. References 1 Dreno B, Poli F. Epidemiology of acne.

Report of the Consensus Conference on Acne Classification Washington, D.C., March 24 and 25, 1990 Planning Committee Members: Peter E. Pochi, MD, Chairman; Alan R. Shalita, MD, John S. Strauss, MD, and Stephen B. Webster, MD Other Consensus Panel members.\" William J. Cunliffe, MD, H. Irving Katz, MD, Albert M. Kligman, MD, James J. Leyden, MD, Donald P. Lookingbill, MD, Gerd Plewig, MD, Ronald M. Reisner, MD, Orlando G. Rodman, Jr., MD, Maria L. Turner, MD, and Guy F. Webster, MD, PhD A number of systems have been described for the classification of acne vulgaris, but there is no uni- versally accepted method for assessing gradations of acne severity. As a result, determining whether a patient has severe acne or not becomes a subjective assessment. Furthermore, this lack of uniformity from one classification system to another has made it difficult to compare therapeutic efficacy among different studies. To address the issue of acne classification, the American Academy of Dermatology convened a Consensus Conference on Acne Classification in Washington, D.C., on March 24 and 25, 1990, in which a group of 14 expert clinicians and specialists interested in acne participated. In addition, repre- sentatives from the pharmaceutical industry were invited to attend as observers and were asked to offer their opinions. After lengthy discussion on the com- plex issues concerning the clinical rating of acne se- verity, two broad focus questions were addressed. Why is a suitable acne classification difficult to es- tablish unequivocally? What elements should be considered in establishing ratings of severity and how are these modified by other considerations? Question 1: What are the diflicukies in establish- ing a standardized and reproducible system of clas- sifying acne vulgaris? Reprint request: Department of Education, American of Dermatology, Maple Ave., P.O. Box 3116, Evanston, IL 60204-3116. 16/8/26814 The central problem is that acne vulgaris is a highly pleomorphic disorder in which (1) there may be an admixture of both inflammatory and nonin- flammatory lesions involving multiple skin sites; (2) the inflammatory lesions vary in size, density, and severity of inflammation within localized sites of in- volvement in the same person, as well as among per- sons; and (3) there is considerable variability in the natural evolution and healing of lesions, and in the response to therapy.t To the members of the Consensus Conference, it seemed obvious from the outset that one of the more frequently used classification systems, dividing ache into four grades of severity, 2-4 is overly simplistic. Other classifications have attempted to measure the number and extent of inflamed and noninflamed lesions. 59 These semiquantitative classifications re- quire special training for the user and seem better suited for the evaluation of new therapies in the in- vestigative arena rather than for use in the clinical setting. Some methods have relied on standardized photographs to establish baseline observations and to document lesion types. 9\"t2 Although photographs provide a permanent record, they may not accu- rately reflect disease activity. Photographs do not discriminate between macular and elevated lesions; in addition, small comedones may not be fully visu- alized, which result in their being underrecorded. Question 2: Should a standardized system of classification be based on lesion type, lesion count, global evaluation, or a combination thereof, and should the presence of scarring be considered in a 495 Burn Line \"Vital Site\" Definition 1 Question : Should \"vital site\" in the burn line titles be defined? Question source : Kaiser Permanente Issue : Since their creation, two of the burns lines reference \"vital site\" in their line titles. This designation determines which line a burn would be included on. There is no definition of what is meant by vital site on these lines or anywhere on the Prioritized List. No mention was found of such a definition in a search of old minutes . There are currently 4 burn lines and 1 line for other type s of burns : 57 BURN, FULL THICKNESS GREATER THAN 10% OF BODY SURFACE Treatment: FREE SKIN GRAFT, MEDICAL THERAPY 72 BURN, PARTIAL THICKNESS GREATER THAN 30% OF BODY SURFACE OR WITH VITAL SITE; FULL THICKNESS, LESS THAN 10% OF BODY SURFACE Treatment: FREE S KIN GRAFT, MEDICAL THERAPY 181 CONDITIONS INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO NATURAL ELEMENTS (E.G., LIGH TNING STRIKE, HEATSTROKE) Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY , BURN TREATMENT 197 BURN, PARTIAL THICKNESS WITHOUT VITAL SITE REQUIRING GRAFTING, UP TO 30% OF BODY SURFACE Treatment: FREE SKIN GRAFT, MEDICAL THERAPY 602 MINOR BURNS Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY On review, HERC staff found that line 57 included all third degree burn diagnoses and multiple treatment codes not found on other burn lines, mostly involving amputations . Lines 72 and 197 had essentially the same treatment CPT codes. The ICD -10 diagnoses codes that differed between lines 72 and 197 mainly appeared to be regarding burns to the face , neck, genitals , foot and palm (on line 72). Most other second degree bu rn diagnoses appear on both lines 72 and 197 . Line 602 had many similar diagnoses to lines 72 and 197, as well as first degree burn diagnoses. Standard references for defining burn severity state: Major burn injury is defined as partial -thickness burns involving more than 25% of total body surface area ( TBSA ) in adults or 20% of TBSA in children younger than 10 years or adults older than 50 years; full -thickness burns involving more than 10% of TBSA; burns involving the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, or perineum that may result in functional or cosmetic impairment; burns caused by caustic chemical agents; high -voltage electrical injury; burns complicated by inhalation injury or major trauma; or burns sustained by high -risk patients (those with underlying debilitating diseases). Burn Line \"Vital Site\" Definition 2 HERC staff recommendations : 1) For October 1, 2018: Add a new guideline to lines 72 and 197 as shown below GUIDELINE NOTE XXX V ITAL SITE DEFINITION FOR BURN LINES Lines 72, 197 A burn to a \"vital site\" is defined as a burn involving the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, or perineum that may result in functional impairment. 2) For January 1, 2020, consider merging the three upper burn lines (lines 57, 72 and 197) into a single line for \"severe burns.\" The current division of thes e lines does not correlate well with current definitions of severe burns. There is very little differen ces between these lines, other than amputations on the most severe burn line. Prioritize this new line at line 57. Delete the guideline adopted above and add the new guideline shown below. Line: 57 Condition: SEVERE BURN S (See Guideline Notes 6,64,65,XXX) Treatment: FREE SKIN GRAFT, MEDICAL THERAPY ICD-10: Any appearing on line 57, 72, or 197 CPT: Any appearing on line 57, 72, or 197 HCPCS: Any a ppearing on line 57, 72, or 197 GUIDELINE NOTE XXX S EVERE BURNS Lines 57, 602 Severe burns are defined as partial -thickness burns involving more than 25% of total body surface area (TBSA) in adults or 20% of TBSA in children younger than 10 years or adult s older than 50 years; full - thickness burns involving more than 10% of TBSA; burns involving the face, eyes, ears, hands, feet, or perineum that may result in functional impairment; burns caused by caustic chemical agents; burns complicated by inhalation i njury or major trauma; or burns sustained by high -risk patients (those with underlying debilitating diseases).

outcomes were similar in both groups -PUL did not appear to result in significant changes in sexual function or continence, and reduced the likelihood of ejaculatory dysfunction when compared to TURP -Adverse events (including pelvic pain, hematuria, dysuria, and transient urinary retention) were commonly reported, but generally limited to the first 3 months after the procedure and were similar to the rates with TURP -Reintervention rates at 1 year were lower for PUL compared to TURP , but the differences were not statistically significant23 Center For Evidence -based PolicyGRADE Table

(12 or 15) cc/sec on a voided volume that is greater than 125 cc -Prostatic volume 80 cc -No obstructive median lobe -No active urinary infection -Refractory to or intolerant of usual BPH medication29

therapy for BPH (e.g., alpha blocker, PDE5 Inhibitor, finasteride/dutasteride)30 Center For Evidence -based PolicyGuidelines 2 guidelines that include recommendations on the use of PUL -European Association of Urology (2016) PUL leads to objective and subjective short -and medium -term improvements in symptoms High -quality studies are needed to compare the efficacy, safety, and durability between PUL and other established invasive treatments -National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) medical technology guidance (2016) Recommend that PUL be considered for use in men with lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH who are aged 50 years and older and have a prostate of less than 100 cm3 Cost -modeling studies showed that PUL is cost saving compared to TURP if it is used in a day surgery unit31 Center For Evidence -based PolicyPublic Comment Public comment submitted by Jackie Madison, MS, COC, Sr. Manager, Strategic Reimbursement Access, Interventional Urology, NeoTract |Teleflex -Comment: Coverage criteria should be men 45 years or older, and include coverage for obstruction caused by both lateral and median lobes Response: Coverage criteria are based on the most common inclusion and exclusion criteria from the relevant trials 32 Center For Evidence -based PolicyAppointed Expert Input from appointed expert Nicholas Boncher, urologist -Recommended removing PSA score because this high of a score would be investigated separately -Recommended changing recommendation to strong Response: Subcommittee accepted both recommendations33 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Values and Preferences Most men with symptomatic BPH would value surgical intervention that is less invasive and less costly than TURP , if the alternative procedure has similar effectiveness and a similar or lower rate of procedural complications. We would expect low variability in this preference, although some men would still prefer TURP as a more definitive and better established procedure.34 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Resource Allocation When PUL is performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, cost savings are significant compared to TURP (given that procedural complication rates are similar or lower). PUL cost savings are moderated by the low but significant rate of subsequent requirement for TURP , however. Cost -modeling studies performed for NICE showed that PUL is cost saving compared to TURP (if used in a day surgery unit).35 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Balance of Benefits and Harms Fair-quality RCTs utilizing PUL demonstrated small but consistent improvements in health -related quality of life and prostate symptom scores, findings in which we have moderate confidence. Symptomatic improvements have been shown to be durable in a 5-year RCT. C ompared with TURP , PUL has similar procedural complication rates, but PUL appears to be much better in preservation of ejaculatory function at 2 years post -procedure . The balance of benefits and harms weighs in favor of PUL, but benefits are moderated by a subsequent need for TURP in 1.5% to 16 % of patients within 1 year of PUL. 36 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Rationale Our recommendation for coverage of PUL is based on consistent results in critical and important outcomes, demonstrating symptomatic improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH. Values and preferences, as well as resource allocation, weigh in favor of PUL as the less invasive, less costly outpatient procedure (compared with TURP). Our recommendation is strong because of the moderate strength of the evidence and positive balance of benefits and harms. 37 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion The Prostatic Urethral Lift procedure is recommended for coverage (strong recommendation ) for treatment of men with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy when the following criteria are met: Age 50 or older Estimated prostate volume < 80 cc IPSS score 13 No obstructive median lobe of the prostate identified on cystoscopy at the time of the procedure Failure , contraindication, or intolerance to at least 3 months of conventional medication therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) Coverage Guidance: Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 HERC Coverage Guidance The Prostatic Urethral Lift procedure is recommended for coverage (strong recommendation) for treatment of men with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy when the following criteria are met: Age 50 or older Estimated prostate volume < 80 cc IPSS score 13 No obstructive median lobe of the prostate identified on cystoscopy at the time of the procedure Failure, contraindication, or intolerance to at least th ree months of conventional medication therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy Note: Definitions for strength of recommendation are in Appendix A.

In the era of public and private sector health system transformation, reaching these goals requires a focus on maximizing the benefi ts and minimizing the harms and costs of health interventions . HERC uses the following principles in selecting topics for its reports to guide public and private payers: Represents a significant burden of disease or health problem Represents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest HERC bases its reports on a review of the best available research applicable to the intervention(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on clinical interventions and modes of care, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. For more information on coverage gui dance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat , or manage disease at a population level. In some cases , HERC has reviewed evidence and identified effective interventions, but has not made formal coverage recommendations when these policies are implemented in settings other than traditional health care delivery systems because effectiveness may be dependent on the environment in which the intervention is implemented . 4 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic DRAFT VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 GRADE -Informed Framework HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, a nd Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for performing the s teps involved in developing recommendations. The table below lists the elements that determine the strength of a reco mmendation. HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guida nce box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The le vel of confidence in the estimate is determined by HERC based on the assessment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidence -based Policy (CEbP) . In some cases, no systematic reviews or meta -analyses encompass the most current literature. In t hose cases , HERC may describe the additional evidence or alter the assessments of confidence in light of all available information. Such assessments are informed by clini cal epidemiologists from CEbP . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of HERC.

We would expect low variability in this preference, although some men would still prefer TURP as a more definitive and better established procedure. Long -term harms (Important outcome) For the direct comparison of PUL and TURP , erectile function was similar at 2 years in both arms : 98% of PUL patients and 94% of TURP patients met the erectile function criterion; ejaculatory function at 2 years was preserved in 100% of PUL patients compared to 34% of the TURP patients . For the direct comparison of PUL and TURP , urinary incontinence was more likely in the TURP arm at 2 weeks and 3 months of follow -up, but did not significantly differ between the gro ups at 12 or 24 month s follow -up.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource Allocation Values and Preferences Other Considerations Balance of benefits and harms: Fair-quality RCTs utilizing PUL demonstrate small but consistent improvements in health -related quality of life and prostate symptom scores , findings in whic h we have moderate confidence. Symptomatic improvements have been shown to be durable in a 5-year RCT. Compared with TURP, PUL has similar procedural complication rates, but PUL appears to be much better in preservation of ejaculatory functio n at two years post -procedure. The balance of benefits and harms weighs in favor of PUL, but benefits are moderated by a subsequent need for TURP in 1.5 % to 16% of patients within one year of PUL. Rationale: Our recommendation for coverage of PUL is based on consistent results in critical and important outcomes, demonstrating symptomatic improvement in lower urinar y tract symptoms caused by BPH. Values and preferences, as well as resource allocation, weigh in favor of PUL as the less invasive, less costly outpatient proc edure (compared with TURP). Our recommendation is strong because of the moderate strength of the evidence and positive balance of benefits and harms . Recommendation: The Prostatic Urethral Lift procedure is recommended for coverage (strong recommendation) for treatment of men with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy when the following criteria are met: Age 50 or older Estimated prostate volume < 80 cc IPSS score 13 No obstructive median lobe of the prostate identified on cystoscopy at the time of the procedure Failure, contraindication, or intolerance to at least three months of conventional medication therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy Note: GRADE -informed framework elements are described in Appendix A. A GRADE Evidence Profile is in Appendix B . 7 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 ic hyperplasia (BPH) is the nonm alignant growth of the prostate and typically starts at approximately 40 years of age and increases as men age (Roehrborn, 2005). Many men with histologic BPH will never consult a healthcare provider or receive treatment for the condition (Roehrborn, 2005). The most frequen t manifestation of BPH is lower urinary tract symptoms, caused by the prostate putting pressure on the bladder or urethra and thus interfering with urine flow. Urinary symptoms include hesitancy, straining, weak flow, prolonged voiding, partial or complete urinary retention, nocturia, incontinence, and painful urination (Roehrborn, 2005). The chart below shows the calculations to create the International Prostate Symptom Score (I -PSS). A score of 1 to 7 is categorized as Mild , 8 to 19 is Moderate , and 20 to 35 is Severe .

In the U.S., the annual expenditures on the management of lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH are estimate d at approximately $6 billion dollars (Magistro et al., 2017). Treatments for BPH include conservative approaches, pharmacological op tions, and various surgical procedures. Side effects of pharmacologic al treatments can include postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, and compromised sexual function (Magistro et al., 2017). The most frequent form of surgery is monopolar or bipolar tra nsurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), which uses transurethral electrosurgery to remove prostate tissue during irrigation (Ray et al., 2015). Refinements of the technique have improved the safety profile of TURP over time ; however , the procedure cau ses considerable long -term complications including dysfunction (65%), incontinence (2%), and the procedure has a retreatment rate of 6% (Magistro et al., 2017). A more recent surgical intervention is prostatic urethral lift (PUL), sold under the trade name of Uro Lift\u00ae. The PUL system lifts and holds the enlarged prostate tissue to create a continuous anterior channel through the prostatic lumen extending from the bladder neck to the verumontanum (Magistro, 2017). The UroLift\u00ae System (PUL) received De Novo approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 (NeoTract, 2017). Indications The UroLift \u00ae System (PUL) is indicated for the treatment of symptoms due to urinary outflow obstruction secondary to BPH in men 50 years of age or older. The contraindications include: Prostate volume of > 80 cc Obstructive or protruding median lobe of the prostate Urinary tract infection Urethra conditions that could prevent insertion of delivery system into bladder Urinary incontinence Current gross hematuria (Neo Tract, 2017). Technology Description The PUL implantation procedure can be performed in an outpatient or inpat ient setting and under general or local anesthesia, and the attending urologist completes comprehensive training prior to using the PUL system (Neo Tract, 2017). The delivery device is used to compress one lateral lobe of the prostate toward the prostatic c apsule. Then, a needle is used to deploy the implant, with one end of the implant anchored in the urethra and the other on the outer surface of the prostatic capsule, retracting the prostatic lobe away from the urethral lumen (Ray, 2015). The permanent PU L implant is composed of a nitinol capsular tab (diameter: 0.6 mm, length: 8 mm), an adjustable polyethylene teraphtalate nonabsorbable monofilament (diameter: 0.4 mm), and a stainless steel urethral end piece (8 mm x 1mm x 0.5 mm). In most cases , no posti nterventional catheterization is required (Magistro, 2017). Typically, four implants are placed (Neo Tract, 2017). 9 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 Evidence Review Perera et al ., 2016 This is a fair -quality systematic review of six studies of PUL. The review includes one sham -controlled randomized control led trial ( RCT), one observational cohort that followed crossover patients from that RCT, two prospective cohorts, and two retrospective cohorts. These studies involved 680 patients. Results for most of the outcome measures were reported as standardized mean gains (which the authors note d can be interpreted as similar to Cohen's d statistic). In most of the included studies, patients were eligible if they were over age 50, had an IPSS greater than 12, and had prostate volumes estimated betwe en 20 and 100 ml. Patients were excluded if they had obstructive median prostate lobes, urinary infections, acute urinary retention, or prostate -specific antigen (PSA) levels greater than 10 ng/ml. Most of the enrolled patients were between age 65 and 75, and the mean baseline IPSS was in the low to mid -20s. For meta -analytic results at the 12-month follow -up, the standard mean gain in health -related quality of life was -2.2 (95% CI -2.4 to -2.1), where negative scores reflect improvement ; the standard mean gain in prostate symptom scores was -1.5 (95% CI -1.6 to -1.3); and the standard mean gain in male sexual health scores was 0.3 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.4). These effects on health -related quality of life and prostate symptom scores are conventionally regarded as large effect sizes . Among the included studies, the rate of insufficient improvement and progression to TURP ranged from 1.5% to 16% of patients at 12 months. Nearly all of the procedures were performed under local anesthesia. The most commonly reported c omplications in the first three months after the procedure were hematuria (16% to 75% of patients ), of patients ), urinary tract infection (1.9% to 16% of patients ). Overall, the authors conclude d that the procedure is well tolerated with few periprocedural complications and is effective for improving quality of life, prostate symptom scores, and sexual function scores at up to 12 months . Roehrborn et al ., 2017 This is a fair -quality study of five -year outcomes from the prospective, randomized, sham -controlled, double -blind trial of the PUL. The study was performed at 19 centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Patients were e ligible to enroll if they were age 40 or older, had IPSS 13, peak urinary flow rate 12 ml/s, and prostate volume between 30 cc and 80 cc as assessed by transrectal ultrasound. Patients were excluded if they had an obstructive median lobe or active urin ary infection. Patients treated with alpha blockers or 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors were required to stop these medications during a washout period ( two weeks and three months, respectively). Ultimately, 206 patients were randomized (2:1) to PUL or cystosc opy with sham procedure. The groups had similar characteristics at baseline. Planned follow -up for the randomized access portion of the trial was three months, and patients and outcomes assessors were blinded during this period. After three months, patient s in the sham control arm were unblinded and allowed to cross over to PUL (80% of sham control patients did so). About one -third of the patients experienced voiding dysfunction after the procedure and required a catheter for a mean duration of 0.9 days. For the randomized comparison between groups at three months, there was greater improvement in quality of life in the PUL group (2.2 \u00b1 1.8) than in the sham control group (1.0 \u00b1 1.5) (p < 0.001). Similarly, there was greater improvement in IPSS in the PUL gr oup ( -11.1 \u00b1 7.7) than in the sham control group -5.9 \u00b1 7.7) (p = 0.003). 10 Prostatic Urethral for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 At five years of follow -up, data w ere available for 104 of the original 140 patients (74.3%) in the PUL arm (of the 36 patients for whom data w ere incomplete, 18 were lost to follow -up, nine died, five sought treatment for cancer, and four underwent TURP or laser ablation). The overall rate of surgical retreatment at five years was 13.6% : six patients receiv ed additional PUL procedures and 13 patients receiv ed TURP. Intention -to-treat outcomes for the PUL arm (compared to baseline) at five years were calculated using the last observation carried forward. The mean change in IPSS at five years was -7.85 , which reflects a 35% improvement from baseline. The mean ch ange in quality of life at five years was -2.08 , which reflects a 45% improvement from baseline. There was no significant change in sexual function compared to baseline in the per -protocol five -year follow -up among patients in the PUL arm. Adverse effect s were uncommon and most likely to occur in the first three months. Pelvic pain, dysuria, hematuria, and urge incontinence were the most common adverse events, occurring in 3% to 9% of patients. Other adverse effects occurred in less than 1% of patients. CEbP staff noted that t he study was limited by the absence of blinded, randomized follow -up beyond three months, the moderate loss to follow -up at five years, and the attendant use of last observation carried forward to estimate the durability of effects. Three of the authors disclosed conflicts of interest with NeoTract, the maker of the PUL system. This study was rated fair quality for these reasons . Gratzke et al ., 2017 This is a fair -quality RCT comparing PUL to TURP that was conducted at 10 centers in three European countries. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were over age 50 ; were a candidate for TURP ; and had IPSS > 12, a maximum urinary flow rate of 15 ml/s, and prostate volume < 60 cc by ultrasound. Patients were excluded if they had act ive urinary infection, had obstructive median lobe, had previously undergone TURP or laser ablation, or had a PSA >10 ng/l. Ninety patients were randomized (1:1) to undergo either PUL or TURP. Ten patients randomized to TURP declined treatment , and one pat ient randomized to PUL declined treatment; ultimately there were 35 patients in the TURP group and 45 patients in the PUL group . Patients were followed for two years. A variety of prostate symptom -specific measures and general quality of life measures were assessed. Baseline patient characteristics were not reported. The groups were generally similar at baseline, the mean age was approximately 64 years, and the mean IPSS was approximately 22. At two year s follow -up, IPSS and IPSS health -related quality of life had improved compared to baseline in both treatment arms. The change in IPSS was smaller in the PUL arm than the TURP arm (-9.2 vs. -15.3 , p = 0.004). The change in IPSS health -related quality of life was similar between the PUL arm and the TURP arm (-3.3 vs. -2.5, p = 0.066). The proportion of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference in quality of life as measured by the SF -6D utility score was similar at two years (47% in the PUL arm vs . 37.5% in the TURP arm, p = 0.43). Ere ctile function was similar at two years in both arms : 98% of PUL patients and 94% of TURP patients me t the erectile function criterion. However, ejaculatory function at two years was preserved in 100% of PUL patients compared to 34% of the TURP patients. I ncontinence was more likely in the TURP arm at two weeks and three months of follow -up, but did not significantly differ between the groups at 12 or 24 month s of follow -up. The rates of serious adverse events and reintervention between the two groups at 12 months were reported in a previous study (Sonksen et al ., 2015). Overall, Clavien -Dindo grade 1 adverse events occurred in 68% of PUL patients and 74% of TURP patients (p = 0.6); Clavien -Dindo grade 2 or 3 adverse events occurred in 16% 11 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 and 22% of patient s respectively. Reintervention within one year occurred in three patients in the PUL arm (7%) and five patients in the TURP arm (14%) (p = 0.5). CEbP researchers noted that t he study was limited by the differential drop -out of patie nts randomized to the TU RP arm. Five of the authors disclosed conflicts of interest with NeoTract, the maker of the PUL system. Evidence Summary There is moderate -quality evidence that PUL results in improvements in quality of life and prostate symptom scores and that those impro vements persist at up to five years of follow -up. In a single small trial that directly compared PUL to TURP, symptom scores at two years were slightly better for TURP, and quality of life outcomes were similar in both groups. PUL d id not appear to result in significant changes in sexual function or continence, and reduced the likelihood of ejaculatory dysfunction when compared to TURP. Adverse events (including pelvic pain, hematuria, dysuria, and transient urinary retention) were com monly reported, but generally limited to the first three months after the procedure and were similar to the rates observed with TURP . Reintervention rates at one year were numerically lower for PUL compared to TURP, but the differences were not statistical ly significant. Policy Landscape Payer Coverage Policies Medicaid No Washington Medicaid coverage policy was found for PUL . Medicare Three Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), covering 18 states, UroLift \u00ae states that all Medicare carriers provide benefits for PUL when medically necessary (Neo Tract, 2017). L36109 provides c overage for an initial implan t and up to five additional implants , although i mplants in excess of six may be reconsidered on appeal. L36775 provides coverage for t he PUL procedure once in a lifetime per beneficiary with a maximum of six implants . L36601 provides coverage for the surgi cal intervention with up to a total of six implants , although i mplants in excess of six may be reconsidered on an exception basis with a formal redetermination. L36601 and L36775 provide coverage for PUL to treat BPH when all these conditions are met: Beneficiary is at least 50 years old with well -documented voiding symptoms consistent with prostatic hypertrophy AUA symptom index (AUASI) score 13 Peak urine flow rate (Qmax) 12 cc/sec on a voided volume that is greater than 125 cc The beneficiary has had an adequate trial of, but is refractory to or intolerant of, usual BPH medication Prostate volume 80 cc without an obstructive median lobe There are no signs, symptoms, or diagnostic evidence of an active urinary infection and no history of bacteria l prostatitis in the past three months The beneficiary is a poor candidate for other surgical interventions for BPH due to underlying disease (e.g., cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, etc.), or at high risk of bleeding, or the 12 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 beneficiary has opted for PU L based on likelihood of preserving erectile function, or there is another documented clinical reason for opting for PUL. L36109 provides coverage for PUL for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in men who are at least 50 years old wh en all these criteria are met: Moderate to severe BPH, defined as an AUA symptom score above 7 including signs of obstruction, such as increased voiding symptoms or decreased peak urinary flow rate (i.e., individual has a peak urine flow rate (Qmax) < 15 c c/sec on a voided volume that is greater than 125 cc Refractory to or intolerant of usual BPH medication Enlarged lateral lobes without an obstructive median lobe Prostatic volume 80 cc No active urinary infection Normal renal function Private Payers Coverage policies were searched for Aetna, Cigna, Moda, and Regence. No coverage policy on PUL was found for Moda. The Aetna policy on BPH treatments (last reviewed 7/17/2017) provides co verage for PUL. The Cigna policy (effective 10/15/2017) states that PUL is considered medi cally necessary for the treatment of symptomatic BPH when all these criteria are met: Age 50 or above Estimated prostate volume < 80 cc No obstructive median lobe of the prostate identified on cystoscopy Failure, contraindication, or intolerance to at leas t three months of conventional medical therapy for BPH (e.g., alpha blocker, PDE5 Inhibitor, finasteride/dutasteride) The Regence Clinical Position Statement on PUL (last reviewed 6/22/20 17) states that PUL may be considered as an alternative to current surgical procedures for men aged 50 years and older with lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, who have a prostate of less than 100 ml without an obstructing middle lobe. Recommendations from Others Two guidelines were found that include recommendations on the use of PUL. The 2016 guidelines from the European Association of Urology conclude that PUL leads to objective and subjective short - and mid - term improvements in symptoms . However, according to the guideline authors, high -quality studies are needed to compare the efficacy, safety , and durability between PUL and other established invasive treatments (Gratzke et al., 2015). A 2016 medical technology guidance from th e National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) conclude s that using PUL to treat symptoms of BPH is supported by the evidence if it is used in a day surgery unit. The NICE guidelines recommend that PUL be considered for use in men with lower ur inary tract symptoms of BPH who are aged 50 years and older and who have a prostate of less than 100 cm3. Cost mode ling studies showed that PUL is cost saving compared with TURP (Ray et al., 2016 ). 13 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 Quality Measures No quality measures were identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse for prostatic urethral lift or BPH .

Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the d esirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably ou tweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors., but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion. Against: The subcommittee c oncludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but further research or additional info rmation could lead to a different conclusion. Confidence in estimate rating across studies for the intervention/outcome Assessment of confidence in estimate includes factors such as risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias. High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical Element Description Balance of benefits and harms The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. An estimate that is not statistically significant or has a confidence interval crossing a predetermined clinical decision threshold will be downgraded. Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed in the absence of likely cost offsets \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommenda tion is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issues about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 16 Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17 /2018 sets of studies are RCTs with some limitations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the estimate of effect is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect .

Question source : HERC Staff, HTAS Issue : The HTAS approved the following draft \"box language\": The Prostatic Urethral Lift procedure is recommended for coverage (strong recommendation) for treatment of men with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy when the following criteria are met: Age 50 or older Estimated prostate volume < 80 cc IPSS score 13 No obstructive median lobe of the prostate identified on cystoscopy at the time of the procedure Failure, contraindication, or intolerance to at least three months of conventional medication therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy Rationale for Reco mmendations The prostatic urethral lift (PUL) implantation procedure can be performed in an outpatient or inpatient setting and under general or local anesthesia. The PUL delivery device is used to compress a lateral lobe of the prostate toward the prosta tic capsule, and then the implant is deployed, with one end of the implant anchored in the urethra and the other on the outer surface of the prostatic capsule, retracting the prostatic lobe away from the Typically, four implants are placed . Fair-quality RCTs utilizing PUL demonstrate small but consistent improvements in health -related quality of life and prostate symptom scores, and symptomatic improvements have been shown to be durable in a 5-year RCT. Compared with T ransurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) , PUL has similar procedural complication rates, but PUL appears to be much better in preservation of ejaculatory function. The balance of benefits and harms weighs in favor of PUL, although benefits are moderated by a subsequent need for TURP in 1.5% to 16% of patients within one year of PUL. Our recommendation for coverage of PUL is based on consistent evidence demonstrating symptomatic improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH. Values and preferences, as well as resource allocation, weigh in favor of PUL as the less invasive, less costly outpatient procedure (compared with TURP).

I work for the manufacturer of Urolift, NeoTract, now owned by Teleflex, but as one intimately familiar with our data and coding I hope you will take these comments into consideration. In light of the robust clinical portfolio of peer -reviewed published data available for Urolift and coverage from other plans in the state, including Regence, Premera, Providence, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Aetna, and of course, Me dicare, the coverage guidance is very timely. As you have outlined in your draft guidance, Urolift offers a minimally invasive option for men who have failed medical therapy, who are unable to take medications, who may be interested in preserving sexual fu nction, and/or who are not willing to undergo an invasive treatment option with known risks of sexual dysfunction, incontinence, or bleeding. Not to mention, Urolift results in a more rapid relief of symptoms and a faster return Thank you for your comments.

There are only a few comments I would o ffer about your draft guidance: A2 There is a coverage criterion stating that patients should be 50 or older to be eligible for Urolift. The FDA recently updated the indication for Urolift to include men that are 45 years of age or older based on a white paper. The updated indication also i ncludes coverage for obstruction caused by both lateral and median lobes based on clinical data. I've attached both the white paper and the FDA's summary of safety and effectiveness with the updated indication and supporting data. The current coverage cri teria are based on the most common inclusion and exclusion criteria from the relevant trials that established the benefits of the procedure. Unpublished data are generally excluded from HERC's deliberations. A3 HERC indicated that the coverage recommenda tion was \"weak\" based on the fact the future studies could change the understanding of the procedure. However, all studies have been remarkably consistent. The repeatable, reliable improvement has been achieved across randomized controlled studies, open la bel studies, across different centers and even countries, and from first cases (i.e., each physicians' first patients are included in the LIFT study) to cases after any learning curve (i.e., LOCAL study). This consistency, and the ability to observe the de obstruction accomplished during the procedure, is a hallmark of the Urolift procedure. Most recently, a retrospective registry was presented at the European Association of Urology meeting in Copenhagen just last week, vastly increasing the number of patien ts studied. The registry that shows in the 'real world' and outside the rigor of a clinical trial, Urolift reliably performs in the method reported in the prospective studies. The presented poster is attached. We believe the weak recommendation is warrant ed because the major randomized trial data are limited by unblinding and the high rate of crossover at three months. Additional data could change the estimate of effect , particularly data from a high -quality randomized trial in which group assignment and blinding are maintained beyond three months to establish the procedure's longer - term effectiveness. Similarly, additional data on adverse events or the need for reoperation or progression to TURP would alter the balance of benefits and harms. A4 I am confused at the retreatment rate of up to 16% in the first year listed in the coverage guidance. In the prospective studies there is no such retreatment rate that high. The LIFT study shows retreatment of 13.6% at five years. Even the BPH -6 study, slightly higher, shows 11% retreatment at two years. The reported range for progression to TURP is derived from the systematic review by Perera et a l. (2016, p . 709). HERC Coverage Prostatic Urethral Lift for Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 3 ID/# Comment Disposition A5 Lastly, I would mention that the procedure codes used by hospitals and surgery centers to bill for Urolift are excluded from the policy. While 52441 and 52442 are the physician codes, in 2014 CMS issued HCPCS codes that allowed hospitals and surgery centers to bill for Urolift. They elected to assign these codes, C9739 and C9740, to permanen t APCs. Now hospitals and surgery centers cannot bill the CPT codes to Medicare and must bill either C9739 or C9740 to Medicare for the procedure. Because of the structure of these codes, C9739 used for cases using 1 to 3 implants and C9740 used for cases using 4 or more implants), they also work as cost containment codes in the facility setting. I've attached CMS's original memo demonstrating that these particular C -codes are procedure codes and not device codes. I've also attached the current year ASC pro cedures list showing that the C -codes show as billable to Medicare and the CPT codes 52441 and 52442 do not. Thank you for your comments and for providing this information on coding and billing for the procedure. C9739 and C9740 have been added to the list of codes in the draft coverage guidance. A6 I respectfully request that implementation of this coverage guidance is not delayed to ensure that beneficiaries under the care of OHA have the same access to minimally invasive, effective, and durable care as members under the care of other health plans. If you have any additional questions or need any additional studies, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you again for the development of this robust and comprehensive guidance. Thank you for your comments.

positive patients. 22 Center For Evidence -based PolicyEvidence Summary There are only small, single studies regarding the clinical utility of gene expression profiling for neoadjuvant treatment decisions or for determining the use of radiotherapy after surgery for DCIS, and these studies have not reported on long -term clinical outcomes On the basis of a single RCT, patients (including those with 1-3 positive nodes, representing about 20% of the overall study population) who were considered high risk by clinical classification but low risk by genomic classification utilizing MammaPrint can forgo adjuvant chemotherapy without a statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of distant metastasis -free survival at 5-year follow -up23 Center For Evidence -based PolicyGRADE Table OutcomesEstimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Breast cancer mortality (Critical outcome)Use of the 70 -gene signature (MammaPrint) to determine recommendations for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy when there is a discordance between clinical and genomic risk classification does not result in statistically significant differences in the likelihood of 5-year distant metastasis -free survival. (Moderate confidence, based on 1 RCT) In the per -protocol analysis of the same trial (which excluded patients who were ineligible, had a change in risk status, or did not adhere to the treatment assignment), patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who were treated based on their clinical risk (i.e., received adjuvant chemotherapy) had a higher rate of disease -free survival (93.3% vs. 90.3%, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95, p = 0.03 ), but survival without distant metastasis and overall survival did not significantly differ.

Many (but not all) women classified as low risk would value the reassurance that chemotherapy would provide little or no benefit, and that the risks and side effects of treatment can be safely avoided. Similarly, women whose testing confirms high -risk status would value the knowledge that chemotherapy is necessary and likely beneficial. The value attributed to test results would be more variable in women who are clinically high risk, but for whom testing indicates low -risk status, and even less relied upon by women with lymph node involvement who are deemed low risk by genomic profiling.33 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Resource Allocation Coverage of genome expression profile testing would add significant cost, given the prevalence of breast cancer in the U.S. population and the price range of these tests. In cases that can be newly classified or convincingly confirmed as low risk based on these tests, there will be offsetting savings in chemotherapy avoided. Potentially, there could also be treatment savings in cases deemed as high risk by genome expression profiling, if earlier interventions result in more effective initial treatment.34 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Balance of Benefits and Harms The clinical utility evidence base available to determine the balance of population benefits and harms is mainly limited to observational studies, but use of genome expression profile tests appears to consistently result in management decision changes that allow avoidance of adjuvant chemotherapy when scores indicating low risk are identified. Retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial has validated the use of Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting chemotherapy benefit among women with estrogen receptor -positive, lymph node -negative breast cancer. One RCT utilizing MammaPrint demonstrated no significant difference in 5-year metastasis -free survival and overall survival in the high clinical risk group. No safety concerns or direct harms are associated with use of these genomic tests.35 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Rationale We have moderate confidence that genome expression profile testing on patients with early -stage breast cancer results in changes to treatment recommendations and can help identify low -risk patient groups that are unlikely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Values and preferences weigh in favor of additional testing, which provides reassurance that the risks, side effects, and cost of chemotherapy can be safely avoided. There is preliminary evidence from decision impact studies to support coverage of genome expression profile testing in early -stage breast cancer with positive lymph nodes, although values and preferences for reliance on such testing will be more variable among patients with lymph node involvement. Despite the weak evidence, we recommend coverage based on potential benefits of reducing the use of chemotherapy .36 Center For Evidence -based PolicyDiscussion Rationale (continued) Evidence of clinical utility is insufficient at present (small, single studies) to recommend coverage of Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score to determine the use of radiotherapy after surgery for DCIS, and insufficient to recommend coverage of Breast Cancer Index to predict the likelihood of benefit from extended (greater than 5 years) endocrine therapy. The recommendation for coverage of Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score for patients who are lymph node negative is strong because the ability of that profile test to predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit has the largest and best -established evidence base. The other coverage recommendations are weak because additional studies might better establish clinical utility and predictive value.37 Center For Evidence -based PolicyCoverage Guidance The following breast cancer genome profile tests (1 test per primary breast cancer) are recommended for coverage in patients with early -stage breast cancer when the patient is willing to use the results of this testing in a shared decision -making process regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, and when the listed criteria are met (lymph nodes with micrometastases less than 2 mm in size are considered node negative): Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative ( strong recommendation ). Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, with 1 -3 positive nodes ( weak recommendation ).

In the era of public and private sector health system transformation, reaching the se goals requires a focus on maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms and costs of health interventions . HERC uses the following principles in selecting topics for its reports to guide public and private payers: Represents a significant burden of d isease or health problem Represents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest HERC bases its reports on a review of the best available research applicable to the intervention(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on clinical interventions and modes of care, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of the GRAD E methodology. For more information on coverage guidance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat, or manage disease at a population level. In some cases , HERC has reviewed evidence and identified effective interventions, but has not made formal coverage recommendations when these polici es are implemented in settings other than traditional health care delivery systems because effectiveness may be dependent on the environment in which the intervention is implemented . 4 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 GRADE -Informed Framework HERC develops recommendations by using the conce pts of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for performing the s teps involved in developing recommendations. The tab le below lists the elements that determine the strength of a recommendation. HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guida nce box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by HERC based on the assessment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidence -based Policy. In some cases, no systematic reviews or meta -analyses encompass the most current literature. In those cases , HERC may describe the additional evidence or alter the assessments of confidence in light of all available information. Such assessments are informed by clini cal epidemiologists from the Center for Evidence -based Policy. Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of HERC. 5 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Should genome expression profiling be recommended for coverage for early -stage breast cance r?

(Moderate confidence, based on 1 RCT ) In the per -protocol analysis of the same trial (which excluded patients who were ineligible, had a change in risk status , or did not adhere to the treatment assignment) , patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who were treated based on their clinical risk (i.e. , received adjuvant chemotherapy) had a higher rate of disease -free survival (93.3% vs . 90.3%, HR 0.6 3, 0.95, p=0.03), but survival wi thout distant metastasis and overall survival did not significantly differ . (Low confidence, based on per -protocol analysis of 1 RCT ) Coverage of genome expression profile testing would add significant cost, given the prevalence of breast cancer in the U.S. population and the price range of these tests .

Note: GRADE -informed framework elements are described in Appendix A. A GRADE Evidence Profile is in Appendix B . 9 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Background Approximately 1 in 8 women (12%) in the United States develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, making breast cancer the seco nd most common cancer (following skin cancer) in American women (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2017). In 2014, there were 236,968 breast cancer diagnoses and 4 1,211 breast cancer deaths in women in the United States . In men , breast cancer is relatively ra re, accounting for an additional 2,141 breast cancer diagnoses and 465 breast cancer deaths in 2014 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017 a). Treatments for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy using the immune system, and radiation therapy (CDC 2017b). Genome expression profiling tests can be used to predict a cancer's aggressiveness, and thereby inform decision making on treatments . These tests analyze a sample of a cancer tissue to assess the activity level of certain genes , which may indicate the likelihood of the cancer grow ing and spread ing. Other methods to predict cancer prognosis and aid in decision -making include web -based tools such as Adjuvant! Online and PREDICT . Using patient and tumor characteristics (e.g., tumor size and grade, number of positive axillary nodes, hormone receptor status) , these tools estimate the risk of cancer -related mortality or relapse without systemic adjuvant therapy, and then estimate the reduction of these risks if various therapy options are implemented. Indications The breast cancer gen ome expression profile tests Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score , EndoP redict, MammaPrint, Prosigna , and Breast Cancer Index (BCI) are indicated for women with early -stage , invasive breast cancer. Each of these tests can be used for estrogen receptor -positive (ER-positive) or hormone receptor -positive cancers. MammaPrint can also be used with ER -negative cancers. Oncotype DX and EndoPredict can only be use d with cancers that are negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 ). The Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score is indicated for women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ . More detailed descriptions of the indications are provide in the technology description below. Technology Description The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is used to predict the likely benefit of chemotherapy and the risk of distant recurrence among patients newly diagnosed with earl y-stage ER-positive , HER2 - negative invasive breast cancer , both lymph node negative and lymph node positive . The Oncotype DX breast cancer assay uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure the expression of 21 genes , including 16 cancer -related genes and five reference genes. The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score ranges from zero to 100 : higher numbers indicate a higher risk for distant recurrence and higher likelihood of chem otherapy benefit for that patient. The Oncotype DX report also provides a quantitative ER score by RT -PCR to help assess the magnitude of hormonal therapy benefit (Genomic Health, 2017 a). The Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score is an assessment of 12 cancer -related genes that is performed on a tumor sample (after a biopsy or surgery) from a woman with DCIS. The Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score results predict the 10 -year risk of any local recurrence (DCIS or invasive carcinoma) or an invasive local recurr ence, establish a baseline for consideration of the absolute risk reduction from radiation therapy, and provide quantitative ER and progesterone receptor (PR) single gene expression values (Genomic Health, 2017b). 10 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 The EndoPredict test is used to estimate t he 10-year risk of distant recurrence of early-stage ER-positive , HER2 -negative invasive breast cancer , both lymph node negative and lymph node positive . The EPclin risk score algorithm integrates a 12 -gene molecular score, tumor size, and nodal status. The 12-gene molecular score uses quantitative RT -PCR o n eight signature genes, three normalization genes, and one control gene. The EPclin score ranges from 1.0 to 6.0, and the test report includes the likelihood of distant metastasis if the patient receives five years of endocrine therapy alone (Myriad Genetic Laboratories, 2017). The MammaPrint breast cancer recurrence assay is used to assess the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence among women with Stage I or Stage II invasive breast cancer, with a tumor size 5.0 cm, that is lymph node negative, ER positive or negative , and HER2 negative or positive. The assay assess es 70 genes using formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tissue or fresh tissue for microarray analysis. MammaPrint uses an algorithm to classify patient s as being at high or low risk of breast cancer recurrence (Agendia , 2017). The Prosigna breast cancer gene signature assay is based on the PAM50 gene signature, which measures the expression of 50 genes to classify tumors into four intrinsic subtypes : luminal A, luminal B, HER2 - negative enriched, and basal -like. Prosigna is indicated for use in postmenopau sal women with hormone receptor -positive, lymph node -negative or lymph node -positive , Stages I, II, or IIIA breast cancer to be treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy. The Prosigna algorithm uses the PAM50 gene signature, intrinsic subtype, tumor size, nodal status, and proliferation sco re. The risk of recurrence score (ROR ) is on a zero to 100 scale , which correlates with the probability of distant recurrence in a 10-year period (NanoString Technologies, 2017 ). BCI predicts the likelihood of benefit from extended endocrine therapy among women with ER-positive , lymph node -negative or lymph node -positive (with one to three positive nodes) , early-stage, invasive breast cancer. BCI provides an assessment of the likelihood of both la te (post -five years) and overall (zero to 10 year s) distant recurrence after an initial five years of endocrine therapy in lymph node - nega tive patients or five years of endocrine therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy in lymph node -positive patients . BCI also predicts the likelihood of benefit from extended ( >5 year s) endocrine therapy (Biotheranostics, 2017) . Evidence Review Systematic Reviews Scope et al., 2017 This is a good -quality narrative systematic review of the use of gen ome expression profiling (GEP) and immunohistochemical (IHC) tests in adjuvant ch emotherapy decisions for patients with breast cancer. The review was undertaken to inform the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was funded by the National Institute for Health Research. The authors reported no conflicts of interest. It includes 41 studies regarding MammaPrint , Oncotype DX, Mammostrat, and IHC4 testing published between 2002 and May 2016. All of the included studies were observational, although five studies were based on a prospective analysis usi ng archived tissue specimens from a larger adjuvant chemotherapy randomized controlled trial ( RCT). These five studies were judged to be at moderate risk of bias. The remaining studies described changes in treatment recommendations or decisions based on GE P or IHC results and were 11 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 mainly limited by their small size, retrospective designs and incomplete reporting of patient characteristics. The authors also noted high levels of clinical h eterogeneity among the studies. Three of the included studies examined the ability of Oncotype DX breast cancer assay to predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit among women with ER -positive, lymph node -negative breast cancer. The studies were based on archived tissue specimens from RCTs that compared endocrine therapy to endocrine therapy plus chemo therapy. In these studies, a high -risk 21 -gene recurrence score was correlated with chemotherapy benefit defined by 10 -year distant recurrence -free survival or disease - free survival. One of the three s tudies suggested that high -risk recurrence scores predicted benefit for chemotherapy among lymph node -positive patients and might be useful for avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with low recurrence score and positive nodes. The fourth study concluded that recurrence score offered the best predictive information about adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in ER-positive, lymph node -negative breast cancer. The authors note d that three of the four studies included data derived from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Proje ct (NSABP ) cohorts , which raises the possibility of double -counting in the systematic review . The authors identified 28 studies of the effect of Oncotype DX on clinical decisions . These studies reported changes in adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations or recei pt in 21% to 74% of the patients who were tested. All but one of the studies found overall decreases in the recommendation for or receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy ; decrease s ranged from 6% to 51%. The authors note d that in many studies it was not possible to determine whether the findings reported changes to the actual treatments received. The authors identified six studies of how MammaPrint influenced clinical decision s. These studies reported overall changes in adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations or re ceipt in 18% to 40% of the patients who were tested. The studies found that overall, 2% to 32% of patients would have recommendations changed from adjuvant chemotherapy to no chemotherapy. The authors again noted difficult y in ascertaining the effects of t he testing on actual treatments rendered. Two additional studies based on a prospective observational cohort in the Netherlands found that the use of MammaPrint would have increased recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy from 48% (based on the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement guideline alone) to 62%, though MammaPrint would have lowered the rate of adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations compared to recommendations based on other guidelines (St Gallen, Nottingham Prognostic Index, and Adjuvant! Online). In the five -year follow - up study , 15% of low -risk patients by MammaPrint had received chemotherapy and the overall distant recurrence -free survival was 97%; among high -risk patients by MammaPrint , 81% received chemotherapy with a distant recurrence -free survival rate of 91.7%. Overall, the authors concluded that Oncotype DX was \"furthest along the validation pathway\" and metho dological weaknesses\" (Scope et al., 2017, p. 42). The authors stated that new studies showed \" MammaPrint is a strong independent prognostic factor\" (Scope et al., 2017, p. 43), but note d that the populations in these studies were small. They also observed that the limited evid ence and clinical heterogeneity made compar isons between tests difficult. Harris et al., 2016 This is a clinical practice guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on the use of biomarkers for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy decisions in wo men with early -stage breast cancer. The recommendations are apparently based on a systematic review of the clinical utility literature for these 12 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 tests, but the evidence findings are not described in sufficient detail to allow inclusion as part of this evid ence review. The recommendations resulting from this review are discussed in the guideline section below. Randomized Trials Cardoso et al., 2016 (MINDACT) This is a fair -quality prospective RCT of the clinical utility of the 70 -gene signature (MammaPrint) test for early -stage breast cancer , as part of the Microarray in Node -Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy (MINDACT) study . Between 2007 and 2011, 6,693 patients were enrolled at 112 centers in nine European countries. Pat ients were eligible for enrollment if they were between the ages of 18 and 70 years old and had early -stage breast cancer (defined as T1 or T2 disease, or operable T3 disease). The study initially only enrolled patients without nodal involvement, but a protocol amendment in 2009 allowed patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes to enroll. Unlike most other studies of genome expression tests, patients with hormone receptor -negative and/or HER2 -positive disease were included. All patients were classified as clinically low risk or high risk using the Adjuvant! Online tool. Patients were considered clinically high risk if thei r 10-year probability of breast cancer -specific survival without adjuva nt chemotherapy was less than 8 8% for ER -positive patients and 92% for ER -negative patients. All patients had genome expression testing on frozen tumor tissue using the 70 -gene signature (70 -GS) assay to classify them as genomically low or high risk. Patients with low clinical and genomic risk were advise d against receiving adjuvant chemotherapy ; patients with high clinical and genomic risk were advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with discordance between their clinical and genomic risk classification were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy or no adjuvant chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by institution, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, age, nodal status, and type of initial surgical resection. Patients were followed for a median of five years. Overall, 41% of patient s were cla ssified as low clinical and genomic risk and 27% of patients were classified as high clinical and genomic risk. There were 690 patients with low clinical risk and high genomic risk (592 patients after correction, 8.8%). There were 1,497 patients classified as high clinical risk and low genomic risk (1,550 after correction , 23.2%). Within each of the discordant groups, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive adjuvant treatment recommendations on the basis of their clinical or genomic risk classifica tion. Overall adherence to the adjuvant chemotherapy recommendation was 86%. In the intention -to-treat analysis, patients with high clinical and low genomic risk who were randomized to treatment based on their clinical risk assessment (i.e. , recommended t o receive chemotherapy) had a rate of distant metastasis -free survival of 95.9% at five years, compared to 94.4% among those randomized to treatment on the basis of their genomic risk assessment (i.e. , recommended not to receive chemotherapy) ( Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0.50 to 1.21). On the basis of these results, the authors observe d that the use of the 70 -GS would have led to an overall reduction in adjuvant chemotherapy in 46.2% of patients with high clinical risk. It should be noted that in the per - protocol analysis, five year disease -free survival was higher in the group treated with chemotherapy based on high clinical risk (93.3%) compared to those treated without chemotherapy based on low genomic risk (90.3%) (HR 0 .64, 95% C I 0.43 to 0.95). Five -year overall survival and survival without distant metastases did not differ significantly between the treated arms in the per -protocol analysis. In a 13 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 subgroup analysis based on nodal status among patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk, five-year survival without distant metastases was 95.7% and 93.2% for lymph node -negative patients randomized to chemotherapy or no chemotherapy respectively, and 96.3% and 95.6% for lymph node - positive patients randomized to chemotherapy or no chemotherapy respectively. It should be noted that lymph node -positive patients represented only about 20% of the overall study population . In the intention -to-treat analysis of the group with low clinical risk and high genomic risk, patients rando mized to chemotherapy on the basis of their high genomic risk had a rate of distant metastasis - free survival of 95.8% at five years compared to 95.0% for those randomized to no chemotherapy on the basis of their low clinical risk (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.59 to 2 .28). Thus, in the population of patients with low clinical risk, there is no advantage to offering chemotherapy to patients with hig h genomic risk. Similarly, five -year survival without distant metastases, disease -free survival, and overall survival did n ot vary based on the treatment received in the per -protocol analysis for this group, although there was greater imprecision in the estimates of effect. Potential sources of bias in this trial include the use of multiple regimens among those randomized to systemic chemotherapy and the use of different hormonal therapies among women with ER -positive disease. There was also a protocol revision in 2010 to address a misclassification of high genomic risk in 162 patients stemming from a change in the RNA -extract ion solution. An additional 113 patients had their clinical or genomic risk reclassified after enrollment. The study was funded by several research foundations, some of which accept donations from industry. Additional data are being collecte d to determine outcomes beyond five years. The findings of this study suggest that patients deemed to be at high clinical risk may avoid the use of adjuvant chemotherapy when they are classified as low genomic risk by the 70 -GS without a statistically significant increa se in distant metastasis or death at five years of follow -up. Ongoing Trials In addition to the longer -term outcomes of the MINDACT study, the randomized portion of two studies (TAILORx and RxPONDER) involving the Oncotype DX 21-RS score and a UK National Health Service study comparing genome expression test -guided treatments for early -stage breas t cancer (OPTIMA) are ongoing. Additional Observational Studies Additional observational studies published after the dates of the search conducted by Scope and colleagues (2017) are briefly summarized in Table 1. 14 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Table 1: Additional recent o bservational trials Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Sanft et al., 2015 Breast Cancer Index Funding source not disclosed Three authors reported conflicts of interest related to employment, shareholding, or honoraria from the maker of BCI Prospective case series with decision impact analysis Single center Connecticut 2014 N = 153 ER-positive, Stage I-III breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for at least 3.5 years Pre- and post -BCI treatment recommendations were available for 96 patients . Before BCI results, 49% were assessed as low risk for recurrence after 5 years (defined as <5% ri sk), 38% were assessed as intermediate risk (6% to 15% risk of recurrence after 5 years), and 13% were assessed as high risk (>15% risk of recurrence after 5 years) . Overall, before BCI results, extended endocrine therapy was recommended for 71 women (74%) ; after BCI results, treatment recommendations changed for 25 patients and extended endocrine therapy was recommended for 52 patients (54%); most of the changes in treatment recommendation occurred in patients classified as low risk by BCI; 29% fewer patie nts reported that they planned to pursue extended endocrine therapy after testing . BCI was also associated with more accurate risk perception, reduced decisional conflict, and reduced anxiety . 15 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Ettl et al., 2017 EndoPredict (11 -gene expression assay) and Protein marker uPA/PAI - 1 No specific funding reported Two authors report ed past employment, patents, or honoraria from the maker of Endo Predict Prospective consecutive case series comparing treatment decisions with and without information from EndoPredict EPclin and/or protein marker uPA/PAI -1 (a protein marker test commonly used in Germany) Single center Germany 2012 -2015 N = 395 Invasive, intermediate risk, ER - positive, HER2 -negative breast cancer (Intermediate risk as classified by the Interdisciplinary S3- Guideline) EPclin results were obtained for all 395 patients , among whom 250 patients were classified as low risk and 145 as high risk. uPA/PAI -1 results were obtained for 190 patients , among whom 46% were classified as low risk and 54% as high risk. Overall, the tests showed concordant risk stratification in 59% of patients. In the analysis of all patients, the results of EPclin (with uPA/PAI -1 results when available) did not affect treatment recommendation in 225 patients (57%), led to a recommendati on of adjuvant chemotherapy in 20 patients (5%), and led to a recommendation against adjuvant chemotherapy in 150 patients (38%). Among the patients with results for both EPclin and uPA/PAI - 1, when assessed independently, EPclin results led to changes in treatment recommendation in 87 patients (46%) ; uPA/PAI - 1 led to changes in treatment recommendations in 46 patients (24%). 16 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Kuijer et al., 2017 Mamma Print (70 -gene expression assay) Funded by Agendia NV One of the authors reported conflicts of interest Prospective case series with decision impact analysis Multi -center Netherlands 2013 -2015 N = 698 patients with early - stage, ER -positive, HER2 - negative , pN0 -N1 breast cancer Pre-GEP treatment decisions were for adjuvant chemotherapy in 41% of patients and against adjuvant chemotherapy in 16% of patients; in the remaining cases , clinicians preferred to wait for the GEP before making a recommendation. Among patients for whom a pre -GEP treatment recommendation was rendered, that recommendation changed after th e GEP results in 51% of patients. Overall, the rate of actual adherence to the treatment recommendation was 91% and was similar whether the recommendation was for or against adjuvant chemotherapy .

After adjustment for measured confounders, the 70-GS was associated with 9.5% reduction in the absolute risk of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in the linear mixed -effects model; the observed reduction in the rate of chemotherapy use was statistically significant only among women under age 50. 17 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Pohl et al., 2016 MammaP rint (70 -gene expression assay) Funded by the South African Medical Research Council One author reported a conflict of interest Retrospective case series with decision impact analysis Multi -center South Africa 2007 -2014 N = 107 patients w ith hormone receptor -positive, HER2 - negative , 0-3 positive nodes, invasive breast cancer and available 70 -gene expression assay results Overall, 60 patients were considered clinically high risk and 47 were clinically low risk; 56 patients had treatment ch anges based on 70 -GS results. Among clinically high -risk patients, 37 (62%) with low -risk 70 - GS results did not receive chemotherapy.

Overall, 21% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median time to chemotherapy decision was 20 days in the early RS group com pared to 32 days in the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the groups in rate of chemotherapy use, time to chemotherapy start, or the average costs of testing plus planned treatment. Most (80%) of the medical oncologists surve yed reported that the early RS results were useful. 20 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Friese et al., 2017 Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 - gene expression assay) Funding by NCI, CDC, and the California Department of Public Health One author reported research funding from multiple s ources including Genomic Health Inc. and Myriad Genetics Laboratories Inc. Cross -sectional survey using SEER and Genomic Health Inc. registries Population -based study in Los Angeles County and Georgia 2013 -2014 N = 1,527 Early -stage breast cancer survey respondents Overall, 60% of the sample had received RS testing; the rate of RS testing varied by risk group: 62.6% for lymph node negative with favorable disease, 24.3% for lymph node negative with less favorable disease, and 13% for lymph node -positive disease. There were no statistically significant differences in the likelihood of RS testing based on educational attainment, income, or race; women with 2 or more comorbidities were less likely to receive RS testing than those with no comorbidities (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7). Compared with no RS testing, RS testing was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in the low RS group (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2) and a higher likelihood of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in the interme diate RS (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7) and high RS (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.8 to 4) groups. Patients reported high levels of satisfaction with RS testing and 64% rated it as very or extremely helpful in their decision making. 21 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Gluz et al., 2016 Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence S core (21 - gene expression assay) Funding support from Genomic Health Inc., Sanofi Aventis, and Amgen Inc.

RS testing was less likely to be performed in Black patients, those treated at community medical centers, uninsured or governmentally insured patients, and those with poorer prognostic features; Black patients who were tested were more likely to have high -risk RS scores. 22 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Study : Gene expression assay(s) Funding and conflicts Design Setting Population Results Kozick et al., 2017 Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence S core (21 - gene expres sion assay) Funding source not reported Authors reported no conflicts of interest Cross -sectional study using the National Cancer Database Population -based study in the US 2010 -2012 N = 158,235 women with ER - positive, HER2 -negat ive, lymph node -negative breast cancer, tumor size >0.5 cm, who had received partial or total mastectomy and who had no evidence of metastatic disease Overall, 56,323 patients (35.6%) received RS testing. Factors that predicted greater odds of RS testing were younger age, white race /ethnicity, residence in a higher income area, treatment at an academic medical center, and private insurance. Larger tumor size, total mastectomy, and higher comorbidity score were associated with lower odds of RS testing. Among 30,011 patients classified as low risk by RS score, 95% adhered to the guideline -based recommendation to omit adjuvant chemotherapy. Among 4,278 patients classified as high risk, 89.6% adhered to the guideline -based recommendation to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. 44% of patients i n the intermediate -risk group received adjuvant chemotherapy; younger age, larger tumor size, and higher RS score were associated with greater odds of receiving chemotherapy in this group.

Blok et al., 2017 A recent systematic review by Blok et al. (201 8) summarized the available clinical validity studies of breast cancer genome expression tests. The authors identified 50 clinical validation studies including 21 studies of MammaPrint, 20 studies of Oncotype DX, five studies of Prosigna, and four studies of EndoPredict. The authors cautioned that differences in the patient populations and clinical outcome measures across the studies made it difficult to compare the tests. Meta -analysis was not performed, but the authors observed that the tests were generally a ble to distinguish between high and low genomic risk and that those classifications were correlated with various prognostic measures (e.g., distant metastasis -free survival, recurrence -free survival, loco -regional recurrence). Table 2 summarizes the range of reported hazard ratios for outcomes incorporating survival in genomically low -risk patients compared to genomically high risk patients. Using the framework proposed by Simon et al. (2009) (excerpted as Figure 1), the authors concluded that Prosigna and EndoPredict have Level B evidence of clinical validity, and Oncotype DX and MammaPrint each have at least one Level A trial. Table 2 .

Excerpted from Simon et al ., 2009 The review also summarized studies of clinical utility, including one study each of EndoPredict and Prosigna. The included clinical utility study of EndoPredict (Muller et al., 2013) examined treatment decisions among 167 women with T1 -3, N1 -3, HER2 -negative , HR-positive breast cancer. Before testing, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended for 63.8% of patients, which decreased to 47.7% after testing. The included clinical utility study of Prosigna (Martin et al., 2015) examined treatment decisions among 200 women with T1 -2, N0, HER2 -negative , HR-pisitiv e breast cancer. Before testing, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended for 30% of patients, which decreased to 28% after testing. Buus et al., 2016 An additional clinical validity study published after the search dates of the Blok et al. systematic review compared the clinical validity of the EndoPredict EP or EpiClin scores to Oncotype DX RS using the same archived specimens from the ATAC trial (Buus et al., 2016). The ATAC trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing anastrazole, tamoxifen, or a comb ination of the two medications for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with ER -positive , HER2 -negative localized breast cancer. In the trial, 28 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 approximately 60% of women were lymph node -negative, 25% had one to three positive lymph nodes, and 10% had more than four positive lymph nodes. The various genomic scores were assessed from 928 specimens from the original trial (680 specimens were from lymph node -negative patients and 248 were from lymph node -positive patients). In the first five years, EP and RS performed similarly in predicting distant recurrence -free survival (LR2 25.7 vs. 26.1, respectively). EPClin (which incorporates clinical features into the algorithm) showed the greatest association with distant recurrence -free survival (LR2 80.0) am ong tests incorporating genomic information. In years 5 to 10, EPClin had the best correlation with distant recurrence -free survival among the genomic tests (LR2 59.3 vs. 23.6 for EP and 5.6 for RS). However, in both time frames, the clinical treatment sc ore (CTS, a score calculated from information on nodal status, tumor size, tumor grade, and age that was derived from the ATAC dataset) offered the greatest prognostic value (LR2 85.0 in years 0 to 5 and 64.7 in years 5 to 10). An analysis combining the genomic tests with CTS vs. CTS alone showed that each test offered incremental prognostic information over CTS alone, and EPClin + CTS showed the best prognostic performance in years 5 to 10. Sestak et al., 2017 An additional clinical validity study publis hed after the search dates of the Blok et al. systematic review compared the clinical validity of the EpiClin score, Oncotype DX RS, Prosigna ROR, BCI, CTS, and the four - marker immunohistochemical score (IHC) using the archived specimens from the ATAC tria l. The ATAC trial is described above. For this analysis, the various genomic scores were calculated from 774 specimens (591 from patients with lymph node -negative disea se and 183 from patients with lymph node -positive disease). In the univariate analysis f or predicting distant recurrence at zero to10 years, all the studied indices offered prognostic information but showed greater prognostic discernment in lymph node -negative patients (see Table 3).

Hazard ratios for distant recurrence HR for dista nt recurrence (0 -10 years) in LN - patients (95% CI) HR for distant recurrence (0 -10 years) in LN+ patients (95% CI) CTS 1.99 (1.58 to 2.50) 1.63 (1.20 to 2.21) IHC4 1.95 (1.55 to 2.45) 1.33 (0.99 to 1.78) RS 1.69 (1.40 to 2.03) 1.39 (1.05 to 1.85) BCI 2.46 (1.88 to 3.23) 1.67 (1.21 to 2.29) ROR 2.56 (1.96 to 3.35) 1.58 (1.16 to 2.15) EPClin 2.14 (1.71 to 2.68) 1.69 (1.29 to 2.22) Overall, the authors concluded that all of the studied indices offered prognostic information for distant recurrence in postmenopausal women with ER -positive , HER2 -negative localized breast cancer, but that the prognostic value is attenuated in LN -positive patients. However, scores that incorporate clinical and genomic variables tended to perform better in LN -positive patie nts. The study was independently funded, but seven of the authors disclosed various conflicts of interest with the manufacturers of the genomic tests. 29 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Albain et al., 2010 This study was a prospective -retrospective validation of the Oncotype DX RS in patie nts with node - positive breast cancer. The study used 367 archived specimens from the SWOG 8814 trial, which compared tamoxifen alone to six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-flouoruracil [CAF]), followed by tamoxifen (CA F-T). Specimens from a third arm of the parent trial, which used concurrent tamoxifen and CAF, were excluded from analysis since this treatment was inferior to CAF -T. Compared to the overall population from the parent trial, patients whose specimens were i ncluded in this analysis had slightly fewer positive nodes and smaller tumors. The authors found that the RS was prognostic for disease -free survival (DFS) among patients in the tamoxifen -only arm of the trial; for low -risk RS, the 10 -year DFS was 60% comp ared to 49% in the intermediate -risk group and 43% in the high -risk group. The rates of 10 -year overall survival were 77%, 68%, and 51% in th e low -, intermediate -, and high -risk groups respectively. However, the authors observed that the hazard ratios were not constant over time and that for patients who survived beyond five years, the RS was no longer prognostic. The RS was also predictive of whether patients would benefit from CAF -T. For patients with low -risk RS (< 18) , the HR for 10 -year DFS with CAF -T compared to tamoxifen alone was 1.02 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.93) and for 10 -year overall survival was 1.18 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.54). For patients with intermediate -risk RS (18 to 30), the HR for 10 -year DFS with CAF -T compared to tamoxifen alone was 0.72 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.31) and for 10 -year overall survival was 0.84 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.78). For patients with high -risk RS (> 31), the HR for 10 -year DFS with CAF -T compared to tamoxifen alone was 0.59 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.01) and for 10 - year overall survival was 0.56 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.02). The authors observed that the interaction between RS and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit was significant after adjustment for age, race, tumor size, tumor grade, progesterone receptor status, and p53 and HER2 status. However, adjusting for ER level (which contributes to the RS) rendered the interaction non -significant. Evidence Summary A growing number of observational clinical utility studies have found that genome expression testing for patients with ear ly-stage breast cancer results in changes to adjuvant treatment recommendations and can help identify low -risk patient groups that are unlikely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. There is no evidence that directly compares different genome expression p rofiling tests with respect to clinical utility. Although there is a growing body of evidence for the use of these tests in lymph node -positive patients, there is still uncertainty about the effects of these tests on treatment decisions and clinical outcom es in this population, and an evidence -based clinical practice guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2016 recommends against their use in lymph node -positive patients. There are only small, single studies regarding the clinical utili ty of gene expression profiling for neoadjuvant treatment decisions or for determining the use of radiotherapy after surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ, and these studies have not reported on long -term clinical outcomes. On the basis of a single RCT, pat ients (including those with one to three positive nodes, representing about 20% of the overall study population) who were considered high risk by clinical classification but low risk by genomic classification utilizing MammaPrint can forgo adjuvant chemoth erapy without a statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of distant metastasis -free survival at five year follow - up. Additional RCTs are underway. 30 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Policy Landscape Payer Coverage Policies Medicaid The Washington Medicaid Physician -Related Services/Health Care Professional Services Billing Guid e (11/12/2017) specifies coverage for Oncotype DX breast cancer assay and EndoPredict, but does not mention Oncotype D X DCIS, MammaPrint, Prosigna, or BCI.

Recommendations from Oth ers Three guidelines were identified on the use of gen ome expression profiling for breast cancer: Use of Biomarkers to Guide Decisions on Adjuvant Systemic Therapy for Women with Early -Stage Invasive Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline (Harris et al., 2016) Use of Biomarkers to Guide Decisions on Adjuvant Systemic Therapy for W omen with Early -Stage Invasive Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update (Krop et al., 2017) NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Breast Cancer (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] , 2017) Gene Expression Profiling and Expanded Immunohistochemistry Tests for Guiding Adjuvant Chemotherapy Decisions in Early Breast Cancer Management: MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, IHC4 and Mammostrat (National Institute for Health Care Excellence [NICE] , 2013) American Society of Clin ical Oncology The 2016 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology outlined recommendations for each of the gen ome expression profiling tests for women with early -stage invasive breast cancer and with known ER/ PR and HER2 status , as outline d below. Oncotype DX If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -negative) breast cancer, the clinician can use Oncotype DX to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy . If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use Oncotype DX to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy . If a patient has H ER2-positive breast cancer or triple -negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use Oncotype DX to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy . 34 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 EndoPredict If a patient has HER2 -negative) breast cancer, the clinician can use EndoPredict to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use EndoPredict to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. If a patient has HER2 -positive breast cancer or triple -negative breast cancer, the clinician sho uld not use EndoPredict to guide decision s on adjuvant systemic therapy. Prosigna ( PAM50 risk of recurrence score ) has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -negative) breast cancer, the clinician can use the Prosigna score , in conjunction with other clinicopathologic variables, to guide decisions on adjuvant system ic therapy. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use Prosigna to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. If a pa tient has HER2 -positive breast cancer or triple -negative breast cancer , the clinician should not use Prosigna to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Breast Cancer Index If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -negative) breast cancer , the clinician can use BCI to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therap y. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use BCI to guide decision s on adjuvant systemic therapy. If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple -negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use BCI to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Mammostrat If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative (node -positive or node -negative) the clinician should not use the five-protein assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. If a patient has HER2 -positive breast cancer or triple -negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the five -protein assay (Mammostrat) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. MammaPrint The 2017 guideline update from the Americ an Society of Clinical Oncology focused on modifying the recommendations regarding MammaPrint, based on recently published studies. The new recommendations for MammaPrint are below. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative, node -negative breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may be used in those with high clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy because o f its ability to identify a good -prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative, node -negative breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MI NDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, because women in the low clinical risk category had excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy even with a genomic high -risk cancer. 35 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 If a patien t has -negative, node -positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at high clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemo therapy because of its ability to identify a good -prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit. However, such patients should be informed that a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, particularly in patients with greater than on e involved lymph node. If a patient has ER/ PR-positive, HER2 -negative, node -positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay should not be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. There are insufficient data on the clinical utility of MammaPrint in this specific patient population. If a patient has HER2 -positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the MammaPrint assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Additional studies are required to address the role of MammaPrint in patients with this tumor subtype who are also receiving HER2 -targeted therapy. If a patient has ER/ PR-negative and HER2 -negative (triple n egative) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the MammaPrint assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Nation al Comprehensive Cancer Network The NCCN guidelines include d discussion of Oncotype DX pT1, pT2, or pT3, and pN0 or pN1mi, and the tumor is greater than 0.5 cm. The guidelines concluded that the Oncotype DX assay was the best validated breast cancer assay . National Institute for Health Care Excellence The 2013 NICE guidelines recommend ed Oncotype DX as an option for guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for people with ER -positive , node -negative, and HER 2-negative early breast cancer when the patient is assessed as being at intermediate risk and the Oncotype DX results are likely to help in predicting the course of the disease , and therefore help when making the decision about prescribing chemotherapy. Mamm aPrint and Mammostrat are only recommended for use in research in patients with ER -positive , node -negative, and HER2 -negative early breast cancer. The NICE guidelines did not address Oncotype DX DCIS, EndoPredict, Prosigna, and BCI.

GRADE -Informed Framework Element Descriptions Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and p references and other factors., but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion. Confidence in estimate rating across studies for the intervention /outcome Assessment of confidence in estimate includes factors such as risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias. High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Ty pical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but th ere is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical Element Description Balance of benefits and harms The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. An estimate that is not statistically significant or has a confidence interval crossing a predetermined clinical decision threshold will be downgraded. Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed in the absence of likely cost offsets \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issues about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and p ractices within Oregon. 43 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 sets of studies are RCTs with some limitations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the estimate of effect is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low: The subcommittee has very little confidence in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across studies . 44 Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 5/17/2018 Appendix B.

Question source : HERC Staff, HTAS Issue : The HTAS approved the following draft \"box language\": The following breast cancer genome profile tests (one test per primary breast cancer) are recommended for coverage in patients with early -stage breast can cer when the patient is willing to use the results of this testing in a shared -decision making process regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, and when the listed criteria are met (lymph nodes with micrometastases less than 2 mm in size are considered node negative): Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, a nd lymph node negative (strong recommendation ). Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, with 1 -3 positive nodes (weak recommendation). EndoPredict (12 gene) for breast tumors tha t are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative (weak recommendation). Prosigna (50 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative (weak recommendation). MammaPrint (70 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative, lymph node negative, and only in those cases categorized as high clinical risk (weak recommendation) . EndoPredict, Prosigna, and MammaPrint are not recommended for coverage in early -stage breast cancer with involved axillary lymph nodes (weak recommendation). Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score is not recommended for coverage (weak recommendation). Breast Cancer Index is not recommended for coverage (weak recommendation). Rationale for Recommendations Genome expression profiling tests can be used to predict the aggressiveness of breast cancer tumors , and thereby inform decision making on treatments (in particular, those decisions related to the need for adjuvant chemother apy in early stage disease) . The HTAS review focused on the clinical utility of breast cancer gene expression tests, and a brief review of demonstrated clinical validity was added to aid comparison between the various tests. A growing number of observatio nal clinical utility studies have found that genome expression testing for patients with early -stage breast cancer results in changes to adjuvant treatment recommendations and can help identify low -risk patient groups that are unlikely to benefit from adju vant chemotherapy. There is no evidence that directly compares different genome expression profiling tests with respect to clinical utility. Retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial has validated the use of Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting chemotherapy benefit among women with estrogen receptor - positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. One RCT demonstrated no significant difference in five -Breast Cancer Genome Expression Profiling 2 year metastasis -free survival and overall survival in the high clin ical risk group when MammaPrint genomic classification was used to guide treatment decisions. Values and preferences weigh in favor of this additional testing, which provides reassurance that the risks, side effects, and cost of chemotherapy can be safely avoided. Although there is preliminary evidence from decision impact studies to support coverage of genome expression profile testing in early -stage breast cancer with positive lymph nodes, there is some uncertainty about the effects of these tests on clinical outcomes in this population, and an evidence -based clinical practice guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2016 recommends against their use in lymph node -positive patients. NCCN has noted (in a footnote) that Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score can be considered in selected patients with 1 -3 involved axillary lymph nodes, to guide the addition of combination chemotherapy to standard hormone therapy . Values and preferences for reliance on such testing will be more variable among patients with lymph node involvement. Despite the weak evidence , we recommend coverage based on the potential benefits of reducing the use of chemotherapy. Evidence of clinical util ity is insufficient at present (small, single studies) to recommend coverage of Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score to determine the use of radiotherapy following surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ, and insufficient to recommend coverage of Breast Cancer Index to predict the likelihood of benefit from extended (greater than five years) endocrine therapy. Our recommendation for coverage of Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score for patients that are lymph node negative is strong because the ability of that profile test to predict adjuvant chemotherapy benefit has the largest and best -established evidence base. The other coverage recommendations are weak because additional studies may better establish clinical utility and predictive value.

As result, we actually administer less chemotherapy which spares patients unnecessary toxicities with limited benefit s. However, historically, lymph node positive patients t ypically receive c hemotherapy. Thus, we rely upon accurate, predictive and prognostic models validated in clinical trials to guide us in circumstances where chemotherapy may be safely omitted. After review of these data, I am trust that you will appreciate the merits of On cotype DX testing in appropriate lymph node positive patients and will permit testing in the Medicaid population. -Clinical validation of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay was shown in multiple large studies involving N+ patients: Southwest On cology Group (SWOG) 8814; and Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC). Additional supportive evidence comes from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2197, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B -28, and Programme Action Concert\u00e9e Sein (PACS) 01 studies. - Results from multiple prospective studies of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay confirm the findings made in the initial clinical validation studies: 5 -year outcomes in the phase III randomized West G erman Study Group (WSG) PlanB study, and 5 -year outcomes in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Clalit Health Services registries. -Multiple clinical utility studies worldwide demonstrate that the Recurrence Score\u00ae result changes adjuvant treatment recommendations, yielding an overall reduction in chemotherapy recommendations, and health economic studies show the assay to be cost-effective and/or cost -saving .

The assay estimates each patient's risk of distant recurrence and anticipated benefit of chemotherapy, which helps guide adjuvant treatment decision - making. A2 West German Study Group Plan B Trial The WSG PlanB trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, phase 3 study that used the Oncotype DX\u00ae assay as a treatment decision tool for patients with N+ early stage breast cancer. Eligible patients had HER2 -negative, N+ disease (pN1 -3), or high - risk node -negative disease (defined as T3 or T4; grade 2 or 3, elevated uPA/PAI -1 levels, or age 35 years).9,10 Hormone receptor (HR) -negative patients and HR+ patients with Recurrence Score (RS) results >11 were randomized to one of two adjuvant taxane -based chemotherapy regimens. HR+ patients with RS 0 -11 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone (n=348). The primary endpoint of the study was disease -free s urvival (DFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and toxicity. The 3 -year and 5 -year DFS results for patients with pN0 -pN1 breast cancer,9,10 who received endocrine therapy alone with RS 0 -11 or adjuvant chemotherapy with RS >11, show the similarity of both 3 -year and 5 -year DFS among patients with RS 0 -11 and 12 -25 . These results are consistent with those of TAILORx in node -negative patients with RS 0 -10, for whom the 5 -year DFS was 93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92.4%, 94.9%).11 A subsequent analysis showed that distant disease -free survival (DDFS) at 5 years was 97.9% for patients with RS 0 -11 and pN1 breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone (note: the corresponding 5 -year DDFS for patients with pN0 breast cancer was 97.7% ).12 The original WSG PlanB trial was a randomized study comparing two chemotherapy regimens. A protocol amendment in 2009 allowed for patients with low risk scores ( RS < 11) to omit adjuvant chemotherapy in favor of endocrine therapy alone, but the outcom es for those patients are better described as the findings of a prospective cohort. In addition, after the protocol amendment , only patients with pN0 -N1 disease were included, and the small number of patients with pN2 -N3 disease were excluded from analysis . The initial three -year results of the WSG PlanB Study for patients with pN0 -N1 disease (Gluz et al ., 2016) were summarized in the coverage guidance. The five -year outcomes cited here were published after the search dates (October 2017) , and extend and c orroborate the three -year outcomes included in the coverage guidance , as the commenter noted. Citation 12 , which reports results of the study by nodal status, is a meeting abstract and therefore out of scope . A3 SEER Registry Findings of two outcomes -based studies, one using the SEER registry and another using the Clalit Health Services registry, corroborate those of the PlanB trial. The SEER registry is an authoritative source of cancer incidence and survival statistics that Citations 13 and 14 p resent descriptive informati on based on the SEER registry data for patients who had received RS testing . They do not provide direct comparative data on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy , HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 4 ID/# Comment Disposition collects population -based data for about 30% of the US. In an initial analysis of over 44,000 patients with ER+ early stage breast cancer with a Recurrence Score result that included 4,691 patients with N+ disease (defined as micrometastases and 1 -3 positiv e nodes), the 5 -year estimates of breast cancer -specific mortality (BCSM) were significantly different for Recurrence Score groups (p<0.001): 1.0% (95% CI 0.5%, (95% CI 1.3%, 4.1%) for patients -30, and 14.3% (95% CI 8.4%, 23.8%) for patients with RS 31.13 Adjuvant chemotherapy was reportedly used by 23%, 47%, and 75% of patients with RS <18, RS 18 -30, and RS 31, respectively. Moreover, like the findings in node -negative patients, age, tumor grade, tumor size , race, or socioeconomic status, were not informative in N+ patients with RS <18 who had very low rates of BCSM at five years. A subsequent SEER analysis that included 6,768 patients with micrometastases (n=2,820), 1 -3 positive nodes (n=3,663), or 4 posit ive nodes (n=285) confirmed initial findings in the N+ SEER patient population.14 In particular, 5 -year breast cancer -specific survival (BCSS) was highly favorable for patients with RS <18 and micrometastases up to two positive nodes. and therefore do not contribute to estimates of cli nical utility for t hese tests. Additionally, the information included here only describes the rates of adjuvant chemotherapy by recurrence score for patients with one positive node. The rates of adjuvant chemotherapy, even at low recurrence scores (RS < 18), were greater in women with 2 to >4 positive nodes (31% to 59%). The authors further caution ed that chemotherapy use is underreported in the SEER database and that further analyses that a ccount for treatment are needed, \"...in particular, a comparison o f survival among those who did and did not receive chemotherapy is of interest. \" A4 Clalit Health Services Registry Findings from a registry of the Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. A CHS registry study examined the relationship between Recurrence Score results, adjuvant treatment, and outcomes among 709 patients with N+ disease (micrometastases and 1 -3N+). Among the subset with RS <18 who received no adjuvant chemotherapy (n=342), 5 -year distant recurren ce was 2.7% and 5 -year BCSM was 0.6% (Figure 1). Among all patients with RS <18 (n=379), of whom 7% had adjuvant chemotherapy, 5 -year distant recurrence was 1.2% for those with micrometastases, 4.4% with 1N+, and 5.4% with 2 -3N+ (Figure 2). In a multivaria ble analysis that included tumor size, nodal status, and Recurrence Score group, only tumor size (p=0.04) and Recurrence Score group (p=0.001) were significantly associated with distant recurrence risk.15 This study, which was published after the search da tes for the coverage guidance review, reported registry data for 709 patients with N1mi (42%) or 1 to 3 positive nodes (58%) who had RS testing between 2006 and 2012 with a median follow -up period of 5.9 years . Adjuvant chemotherapy was used in 7.1% of the RS < 18 patients, 39.5% of the RS 18 to 30 patients, a nd 86.1% of the RS > 31 patients. In addition to the results provided by the commenter, an analysis of recurrence risk by chemotherapy treatment found recurrence rates of 7.7% for chemotherapy -treated patients vs . 2.9% in untreated patients with RS < 18, and 1.0% in chemotherapy -treated HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 5 ID/# Comment Disposition patients vs . 9.7% i n untreated patients with RS 18 to 30. The authors note d that because adjuvant treatment decisions in CHS rely heavily on the RS results, the analysis of outcomes by chemotherapy use must be interpreted cautiously. A5 Clinical Validation Studies The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay has been validated in in two trials (SWOG 8814 and TransATAC), with additional supportive clinical evidence from three trials (ECOG 2197, NSABP B -28, of postmenopausal, N+, ER+, early stage breast cancer patients from the SWOG -8814 trial showed the Recurrence Score result to be prognostic for DFS and OS in N+ patients treated with tamoxifen alone. Patients with low Recurrence Score results had a better prognosis than pati ents with high Recurrence Score results.16,17 The Recurrence Score result was also shown to be predictive of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF) therapy benefit. Patients with lower Recurrence Score results had little, if any, benefit in terms of DFS from sequential CAF\u00e0tamoxifen (CAF -T) therapy vs . tamoxifen alone (HR=1.02; stratified log rank p=0.97). In contrast, patients with higher Recurrence Score results had a statistically significant benefit with sequential CAF -T therapy vs . tamoxifen a lone (HR=0.59; stratified log rank p=0.033). TransATAC A validation study was conducted in HR+, postmenopausal patients enrolled in the ATAC trial.4 In this study, 1,231 tumor samples from the two monotherapy arms were used to determine whether the Recur rence Score result was predictive of the risk of distant recurrence (prognosis). Of these, 306 samples were from patients with N+ Clinical validity studies were beyond the scope of this coverage guidance. Nevertheless, the results from the studies listed here were inc luded in the systematic review by Blok et al . (2018) , and the findings of the SWOG 8814 trial were separately summarized at the direction of the subcommittee. Citations 19 and 20 are meeting abstracts.

The Recurrence Score result was shown to predict distant recurrence in N+ patients treated with either tamoxifen or a nastrozole. N+ patients with low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score values had an average 9 -year risk of distant recurrence of 17%, 28%, and 49%, respectively (Figure 4). Risk of distant recurrence was shown to increase with the number of positive no des: patients with 1 -3 positive nodes experienced a lower risk of distant recurrence compared with patients with 4 positive nodes .4 Studies Supportive of the Clinical Validation Studies ECOG 2197 Trial An early study of the Oncotype DX assay in an N+ setting involved a cohort of patients whose tumor blocks were collected in the ECOG 2197 trial. An analysis was performed on samples of 465 patients with HR+ disease, including both pre - and postmenopausal patients and both node -negative and N+ (1 -3 positi ve nodes) disease, all treated with anthracycline -based chemotherapy (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide [AC] or doxorubicin/docetaxel [AT]).18 Patients with low Recurrence Score results had lower 5 -year recurrence rates than patients with high scores (node -nega At 10 -year follow up, the Recurrence Score value continued to be a highly significant predictor of distant recurrence (p<0.0001). The authors concluded that the Recurrence Score result may potentially be used to distinguish patients who do well with standard chemotherapy regimens from those who may be suitable candidates for clinical trials evaluating alternative chemotherapy regimens or other strategies. NSAPB B -28 Trial A study was conducted in a cohort of patients who participated in the NSABP B -28 trial, which compared four cycles of AC vs .

The analysis showed that for patients with low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score results, 80.9%, 64.9%, and 55.8% of patients, respective ly, were free of distant recurrence at 10 years. A multivariable model showed that the Recurrence Score result was prognostic for DFS, DRFI, and OS, independently of other indicators including number of nodes, tumor size, tumor grade, treatment, and type of surgery. This large study demonstrated that the Recurrence Score result is strongly predictive of the 10 -year risk of distant recurrence, OS, and BCSS in women with N+ breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. PACS -01 Trial A second study (PACS -01) conducted by Penault -Llorca et al . was similar to the B -28 study in design and evaluated the association between the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score result and the risk of distant recurrence in HR+, N+ breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy plu s adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide with or without docetaxel (FEC vs . FEC-D).20 A cohort of 530 patients were included in the primary analysis and showed that the Recurrence Score result was a significant predictor of DRFI (HR=4.1 fo r a 50 and OS (HR=5.0, p<0.001). multivariate analyses, the Recurrence Score result provided independent prognostic information beyond clinicopathologic factors including treatment, age, tumor size and g rade, number of positive nodes, surgery type, and Ki -67 status (p<0.001). These data further confirm the prognostic significance of the Recurrence Score results previously reported from multiple studies in HR+, N+ breast cancer patients treated with adjuva nt endocrine and chemotherapy. HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 8 ID/# Comment Disposition A6 Summary There is a continuum of biology that extends beyond nodal status in breast cancer and studies have consistently validated and reinforced the value of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay in ER+ patients along this node -negative -to-N+ continuum. Like the experience in node -negative disease, the assay has been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy bene fit in patients with N+ disease. Use of the Oncotype DX assay for patients with 1 -3 positive nodes may identify patients with lower risk of distant recurrence who are unlikely to benefit significantly from chemotherapy. Conversely, the assay identifies tho se at high risk of recurrence who are likely to derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonal therapy. Decision impact studies show that the Oncotype DX assay changes treatment decisions, and economic studies report the assay to be cost-effective/cost -saving. The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay is a quantitative RT -PCR assay that measures the expression of 21 genes (16 cancer -related, 5 reference genes) in triplicate from fixed paraffin -embedded breast cancer tissue. The assay has been validated to predict the risk of distant tumor recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in patients with ER+ early stage breast cancer. The Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score assay provides valuable information beyo nd traditional clinical and pathologic measures. Thank you for your comments. Irrespective of the clinical validity data, the subcommittee found that there was considerably less clinical utility evidence for the use of genome expression profiling in LN -positive patients compared to LN -negative patients. As a weak recommendation, additional clinical utility evidence in this population could change the recommendation. B1 We respectfully submit the following suggested changes to the coverage guidance on Geno me Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer : The following breast cancer genome profile tests (one test per primary breast cancer) are recommended for coverage in patients with early -stage breast cancer when the patient is willing to use the results of this testing in a shared -decision making process regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, and when the listed criteria are met. Lymph nodes with micrometastases less than 2 mm in size are considered node negative. Thank you for your comments. Your suggestions for revisions to the box language will be reviewed by the subcommittee. Substantive issues are addressed separately below. HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 9 ID/# Comment Disposition Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (21 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative (strong recommendation). Lymph nodes with micrometastases less than 2 mm in size are considered node negative. EndoPredict (12 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative or lymph node positive (up to 3 nodes) (weak recommendation). Prosigna (50 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, and lymph node negative (weak recommendation). MammaPrint (70 gene) for breast tumors that are estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative, lymph node negative, and only in those cases categorized as high clinical risk (weak recommendation) . Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score, EndoPredict, Prosigna, and MammaPrint are not recommended for coverage in early -stage breast cancer with involved axillary lymph nodes (weak recommendation). Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score is not recommended for coverage (weak recommendation). Breast Cancer Index is not recommended for coverage (weak recommendation). B2 1) The statement about lymph nodes with micrometastases being considered node negative should apply to all tests, and therefore we suggest moving it to the top for clarity. Thanks you for your comment. The statement in the coverage guidance that lymph nodes with micrometastases are considered node negative does apply to all of the tests . B3 2) In addition to coverage for lymph node negative breast cancer, we request that EndoPredict be covered for breast ca ncers that include up to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes: In general, clinical validity was out of scope for this coverage guidance. However, at the request of the subcommittee, clinical validity data was summarized, including the study cited here (Sestak et al ., 2018). HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 10 ID/# Comment Disposition a) Clinical validation data support EndoPredict's prognostic ability for node positive patients: In a clinical validation study using the TransATAC cohort, 248 out of 928 patients were node positive. For the node positive group, EndoPredict's (EPclin's) hazard ratio (measuring the ability to separate low and high risk groups) was 9.49 (p=0.0001). Nineteen percent of patients were classified as low risk and they experienced a 5% rate of distan t recurrence at 10 years.1 This suggests that EndoPredict can identify a significant number of node positive patients with such a low risk of distant recurrence that they can safely forgo chemotherapy. A subset analysis of the data from the ABCSG6 and ABCSG8 cohorts confirmed simil ar findings. In that study, 537 out of 1702 patients were node positive. For the node positive group, the EndoPredict (EPclin) hazard ratio was 4.70 (p<0.001). Thirty percent of patients were classified as low risk and they had a 5.1% rate of distant recur rence at 10 years.2 The Noridian LCD includes a table that summarizes the data points from these 2 studies.3 Sestak calculated the C -index to be 0.671 for EndoPredict for a subset of 227 node positive patients from the TransATAC cohort, suggesting a good f it between the EndoPredict prognostic prediction and actual outcomes.4 b) Data demonstrate that medical management decisions are made for node positive patients based on the results of EndoPredict: Muller demonstrated a change in therapy for 38% of patient s when EndoPredict is used. Within this cohort, 37% of patients were node positive.5 A large, population based study of 10,434 node positive patients who received a different breast cancer assay demonstrated that use of the assay was associated with a 79% reduction in chemotherapy recommendations compared to 21,991 patients who did not receive the assay.6 c) Guidelines and other coverage decisions would support coverage for node positive breast cancer. Medicare coverage includes node positive disease;3 a similar policy for The Muller data pertaining to clinical utility were summarized in the coverage guidance. It should be noted that although 38% of patients in the study were LN - positive , the data regarding changes to treatment decisions were reported in aggregate and not by lymph node status. The re port by Jasem et al. (2017) was included in the coverage guidance. Medicare coverage policy and criteria were reviewed in the coverage guidance. The Washington Medicaid draft decision is noted. The specifi c NCCN recommendations for LN -positive patients are detailed above in comment A1. However, the statement here that \"other prognostic multigene assays LN -positive patients.

After completing a comparable evidence review, Washington Medicaid has published a draft coverage decision that includes node negative and node positive breast cancer (up to 3 positive nodes).7 The NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines state that Oncotype DX (or other prognostic multigene assays) may be considered in select node positive patients to help assess risk of recurrence and to guide the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy.8 C1 On behalf of Genomic Health, I am submitting these comments regarding the Oregon Health Authority Health Evidence Review Commission's (HERC) draft coverage guidance \"Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer,\" which was posted for public comment on March 2, 2018. Genomic Health, Inc. is the world's leading prov ider of genomic -based diagnostic tests that optimize cancer care, including addressing the overtreatment of the disease, one of the greatest issues in healthcare today. With its Oncotype IQ\u00ae Genomic Intelligence Platform, the company is applying its world -class scientific and commercial expertise and infrastructure to lead the translation of clinical and genomic big data into actionable results for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient journey, from diagnosis to treatment selection and monitoring . Genomic Health is the sole source laboratory for the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score for early -stage breast cancer. We commend the HERC's recommendation for coverage of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score given the preponderance of clinical evide nce supporting the test. We respectfully disagree with the HERC's position that the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score not be recommended for coverage in early -stage breast cancer patients with involved axillary lymph nodes. The coverage guidance states \" there is insufficient evidence to support coverage of genome expression profile testing in early -stage breast cancer with positive lymph nodes.\" However, in reviewing the draft coverage guidance, we noted that several key studies regarding the Recurrence Thank you for your comments. HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 12 ID/# Comment Disposition Score in node positive patients were not included in the HERC's review indicating that conclusions about the evidence of the Recurrence Score in this patient population are not based on the full set of clinical evidence. We are submitting these comments to highlight these studies and to request the HERC incorporate them into review prior to finalizing this coverage guidance. A citations list of studies that we are requesting be included in the HERC's review is pro vided with this comment letter. C2 Approximately 32% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will have regional lymph node involvement without distant metastasis.1 Guidelines recommend the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonal therapy in those with endocrine receptor positive, node -positive disease. However, not all patients benefit equally from chemotherapy.2 As a result, validated prognostic and predictive clinical tools, like the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score, are needed to better inform treatment decis ions within the node -positive patient population. The following are key points from several published studies that were not included in the HERC's review: Clinical validation of the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay was previously established in two large pr ospective/retrospective studies involving node positive (N+) patients. Results from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 8814 and the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trials) constitute Level 1B evidence for clinical validation in this nod e positive population. The HERC review seems only to have included the SWOG 8814 study. We request inclusion of the ATAC trial (Dowsett et al. 2010) in HERC's review. Given the consistency of the results for both node -negative and node - positive patients wi th respect to Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score's ability to predict chemotherapy benefit, the NCCN guidelines incorporated Clinical validity studies were beyond the scope of this coverage guidance. Nevertheless, the results from the studies listed here were included in the systematic review by Blok et al . (2018) , and the findings of the SWOG 8814 trial were separately summarized at the direction of the subcommittee. The NCCN guideline on the use of 21 -gene RS in LN- positive patients is noted above in response to comment A1. Citations 3 to 5 are discussed above in response to comments A2 to A4. Citation 6 (Torres et al ., 2018) is a new clinical utility study that was published after the search dates of the coverage g uidance. In this study , 67 patients with ER - positive , HER2 -negative , and 1 to 3 positive axillary nodes who were eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy had pre -RS treatment recommendations recorded , and these recommendations were compared to actual treatments received after the RS was assessed . For the 38 patients with a low RS (< 18), 29 had initially received a recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy; 11 patients HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 13 ID/# Comment Disposition the Recurrence Score as clinically appropriate for patients with 1 -3 positive lymph nodes beginning in 2015. Recent results from m ultiple prospective studies of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score confirm the findings of the initial clinical validation studies thus confirming the safety and effectiveness of the Recurrence Score for patients with 1 -3 positive nodes.3-5 In the Clal it Health System Registry, women with node -positive disease and a Recurrence Score <18, who were treated with endocrine therapy alone, had only a 2.7% risk of distant recurrence at five years, which demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of withholding chemotherapy in this group of patients.3 The WSG PlanB, multicenter, prospective, randomized, phase 3 study used the Recurrence Score to guide treatment decisions for patients with early - stage, node -positive disease. Patients with Recurrence Score less tha n 11 receiving endocrine therapy alone had a 5 -year disease free survival rate of 94%, consistent with node -negative patients in other studies.4 Breast cancer specific mortality outcomes from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program corroborate those of the WSB PlanB trial and the Clalit Health System Registry. In the SEER registry, 5 year breast cancer specific mortality was 0.9% in patients with micrometastases or 1 positive node(representing 81% of the total study population) who had a Recurrence Score less than 18.5 Most recently, a prospective decision impact study demonstrated a 36% change in treatment decisions for early breast cancer patients receiving the Recurrence Score. In the patient group with a Re currence Score less than 18, 47% of treatment decisions were changed from chemotherapy with endocrine therapy to endocrine therapy alone.6 These results are similar to previously published decision impact studies.7-10 ultimately received adjuvant chemotherapy. For the 23 patients with an intermediate RS of 18 to 30, 20 had initially received a recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy; 18 patients ultimately received adjuvant chemotherapy. For the six patients with a high RS (> 31), four had initially received a recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy; six patient s ultimately received adjuvant chemotherapy. The authors note d that this is the first decision -impact stud y examining an exclusively LN-positive population. This observation underscores the paucity of clinical util ity data that is specific to LN - positive patients. HERC Coverage Guidance: Genome Expression Profiling for Breast Cancer Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 3/2/2018 to 4/2/2018 Page 14 ID/# Comment Disposition These prospective outcome studies show remarkably consistent outcomes at five years in node positive women with a low Recurrence Score who do not receive chemotherapy and the data support what was found in the original prospective - retrospective validation studies in node - positive patients. Th e preponderance of evidence on long -term clinical outcomes plus published clinical utility data clearly supports use of the Recurrence Score in guiding treatment decisions in node -positive women. Based on these data, we request HERC reconsider its assessme nt of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score and issue a recommendation of coverage for the test in node -positive women with early -stage breast cancer. D1 I am emailing to express my serious concerns about retraction of insurance coverage for Oncotype testing and other genomic profiling for node -positive early stage breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting. As you are well aware, many cl inicians use these tests to justify omission of chemotherapy in lower -risk node -positive disease. We have prosp ective data (MINDact) for MammaP rint, and we have bountiful retrospective data for Oncotype, with promise of prospective validation via the RxSPO NDER trial (pending results). Please reconsider. I wish the best for my future patients, and strive to use chemotherapy only when it is likely to benefit the patient. Thank you for your comments. The subcommittee appreciates the perspectives of clinicians who use these tests in practice .

The Oncologist. 2018 Jan;23:1 -8 Section 9.0 New Discussion Items Non -Axial Manipulation 1 Question : Where should the procedure code for non -axial chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation be placed? Question source : CCO medical directors Issue : CPT 98943 ( Chiropractic manipulative treatment (CMT); extraspinal, 1 or more regions ) was on the \"Excluded\" file for many years. During a clean -up of that file, the code was moved to the Ancillary List. This procedure code is used by chiropractors and osteopaths for treatment of conditions such as ankle or wrist sprains. The CCO medica l directors are concerned that this code is being used for treatment of conditions such as constipation in children. HERC staff recommendation : 1) Add CPT 98943 ( Chiropractic manipulative treatment (CMT); extraspinal, 1 or more regions ) to line 605 SPRAINS A ND STRAINS OF ADJACENT MUSCLES AND JOINTS, MINOR a. Advise HSD to remove CPT 98943 from the Ancillary list "}
