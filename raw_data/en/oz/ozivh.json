Meiji Seika Pharma is safeguarding lives with its research and development of new drugs and human vaccines. Our strengths in R&D also extend to generic drugs. Across multiple research centers and labs, we are working on creative solutions to some of the world's most critical health problems today. Ethical Pharmaceuticals We are researching and developing new pharmaceutical products. We are doing this with the aim of becoming the leading company in Japan in areas where we are strong by increasing the speed and improving the certainty of this research and development. We are researching and developing generic pharmaceutical products. This is so that we can widely provide high-quality pharmaceutical products by taking advantage of the development capabilities and high quality we have cultivated up to now. Research and Development Structure - Pharmaceutical Research Center This center develops specification testing methods and manufacturing processes that enable the Meiji Group to strengthen and safeguard its supply of high-quality pharmaceuticals for the global market. The center's contribution to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) results in improvements in QA, product safety, and cost efficiency across a wide range of pharmaceutical products. KM Biologics Co., Ltd. At KM Biologics, we understand the growing needs of today. That's why we perform cutting-edge research into biological pharmaceuticals to develop vaccines for humans and animals in a timely and strategic manner. We have expertise in biotechnology such as culturing technologies for cells, viruses and bacteria, blood plasma protein isolation, and protein engineering. We continue to lead the way in research and development within the biologics industry. Human Vaccines KM Biologics' history of vaccine production started with the smallpox vaccine over a half century ago. Since then, we have produced many vaccines including those for typhoid and typhus, and have contributed to the eradication of infectious diseases in Japan. In recent years, through collaboration with companies and universities in Japan and overseas, we have been working on the development of new vaccines such as cell culture-derived influenza vaccines and DPT-based combined vaccines. Antitoxins and Antivenoms Today, KM Biologics is the only company in Japan to produce antitoxins and antivenoms. We began manufacturing antivenom products (for mamushi and habu) around 1970, and then started producing antitoxins for botulism, diphtheria, and gas gangrene for the national stockpile in Japan. Blood Plasma Products Blood plasma products are highly purified medicines produced from donated blood, with proteins extracted from the plasma that are effective for treating various diseases. Immunoglobulin, albumin, and blood coagulation factor products are effective medical products for treating various severe diseases. These high-quality and safe products can help patients to combat many severe diseases. Veterinary Vaccines KM Biologics has been at the forefront of developing vaccines for classic swine fever, fowl pox, and Newcastle disease. We have also played a significant role in the prevention of acute communicable diseases. In recent years, KM Biologics has been focusing on products for poultry and porcine use, and advancing the development of vaccine technology. Ultimately, we are dedicated to the improvement of hygiene on farms and the stable supply of products for veterinary use. Research and Development Structure - Kikuchi Research Center The Kikuchi Research Center was established in 1985 and has invented various advanced technologies as groundwork for biotechnology research and innovation. Its vast premises include a main research building and vaccine manufacturing buildings, which utilize genetic modification technology and cell culture techniques.
