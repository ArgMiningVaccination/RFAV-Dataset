It is also known as chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia. The number of people who have CML and who are living well is increasing. {About 8,450 people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with CML in 2020. {About 51,342 people in the United States are living with or are in remission from CML as of 2016. Many new CML drugs have been approved since 2001. For most patients, these drugs have changed CML from a life-threatening disease to a chronic condition that can be managed with lifelong oral therapy (treatments given by mouth such as pills and capsules). Other new treatments are being studied in clinical trials. Progress toward a cure is under way.

Stem cells normally develop into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets and then leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) starts with a change (mutation) to a single stem cell in the bone marrow. {CML is diagnosed with blood and bone marrow tests. About Bone Marrow, Blood and Blood Cells The general descriptions below may help you understand the information in the rest of this Guide. Bone marrow is the spongy center located inside the bone where blood cells are made. Blood cells begin as stem cells in the bone marrow. Stem cells grow and mature into different types of cells: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. After the cells have matured, the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets enter the bloodstream. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. When the number of red blood cells is below normal, a condition called anemia usually develops. Anemia may make you feel tired or short of breath. It may make your skin look pale. White blood cells fight infection in the body. There are two major types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and germ-eating cells. called: {Neutrophils {Monocytes Platelets help stop bleeding by clumping together (called clotting ) at the site of an injury. Plasma is the liquid part of the blood. Although mostly water, plasma also has some vitamins, minerals, proteins, hormones and other natural chemicals in it. The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 5Normal Blood Cell Count Fast Facts The ranges of blood cell counts listed below are for adults. They may be a little different from lab to lab and for children and teens. Red blood cell (RBC) count {Men: 4.5 to 6 million red cells per microliter of blood {Women: 4 to 5 million red cells per microliter of blood Hematocrit (the part of the blood made up of red cells) {Men: 42% to 50% {Women: 36% to 45% Hemoglobin (amount of the red cell pigment that carries oxygen) {Men: 14 to 17 grams per 100 milliliters of blood {Women: 12 to 15 grams per 100 milliliters of blood Platelet count {150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood White blood cell (WBC) count {4,500 to 11,000 white cells per microliter of blood Differential (also called diff) { Shows the part of the blood made up of different types of white cells { Counts the types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils I www.LLS.orgAbout CML Leukemia is the general term for a number of different types of blood cancer. CML is one of the four main types of leukemia. CML is a type of cancer that begins in the bone marrow. A person can get CML at any age, but most people who have CML are adults. Only a small number of children are diagnosed with CML. CML starts with a change to a single stem cell in the bone marrow. This means: {A normal stem cell mutates (changes) {Mutated cells multiply into many cells (CML cells) Without treatment, the following changes take place: {The number of red blood cells becomes lower than normal {The number of white blood cells becomes higher than normal and continues to grow Chromosomes and Genes. Normal cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes that are numbered from 1 to 22 plus one pair of sex chromosomes (the 23rd chromosome is called XX for females and XY for males). Chromosomes are structures in the cells that contain genes. The genes give instructions to the cells. The Philadelphia Chromosome. In CML cells, a change takes place on chromosome 22. The changed chromosome 22 is known as the Philadelphia chromosome . It is also called the Ph chromosome . The Ph chromosome is created when a piece of chromosome 22 breaks off and attaches to the end of chromosome 9. A piece of chromosome 9 also breaks off and attaches to the end of chromosome 22. The BCR-ABL1 Cancer Gene. The break on chromosome 22 involves a gene called BCR. The break on chromosome 9 involves a gene called ABL1 . The BCR and ABL1 genes combine to make the CML-causing gene (oncogene) called BCR-ABL1 . This gene makes an abnormal protein that signals the body to make too many granulocytes (white blood cells). The white blood cells that have the BCR-ABL1 oncogene are called \"leukemia cells\" or \"CML cells.\" Leukemia cells are abnormal. They do not become healthy white blood cells, and they do not die when they should. Over time, the leukemia cells build up in the bone marrow and crowd out healthy blood cells.The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 7 Normal Chromosomes CML Chromosomes 92 2 ABL1BCR 92 2 Piece of 22Piece of 9BCR-ABL1 oncogene Philadelphia chromosomeHow the BCR-ABL1 Cancer-Causing Gene (Oncogene) Is Created {A piece of the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 breaks off. {A piece of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 breaks off. {These 2 pieces switch places; this is called translocation . {The switch leads to the cancer gene called BCR-ABL1 . Causes of CML. Doctors do not know why the BCR-ABL1 gene that leads to CML forms in some people but not in others. People treated with high-dose radiation therapy for other cancers have a small increase in risk of CML. But most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop CML. And most people with CML were not exposed to high-dose radiation. There is no link between dental or medical x-rays and increased risk of CML. You cannot catch CML from someone else. Signs and Symptoms Healthy people often have a sign or a symptom when they get an illness or a disease. A sign is a change in the body that the doctors sees in an exam or test result. A symptom is a change in the body that the patient can see or feel. CML signs and symptoms tend to develop slowly. Many of the signs and symptoms of CML are also signs and symptoms of other illnesses. Most people with these signs and symptoms do not have CML.8 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgPeople with symptoms of CML often breath {Fever {Bone pain {Unexplained weight loss {Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side due to an enlarged spleen {Night sweats Diagnosis Many people with CML do not have symptoms when they are diagnosed with it. CML is often found during blood tests for an unrelated illness or during a routine checkup. CML is diagnosed with blood tests and bone marrow tests. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 42-47 for a full list of questions. 1. What kind of testing will be done to diagnose my disease and to monitor my treatment? 2. How long does it take to get the results? 3. How are the results communicated to me? 4. How often will testing be needed? 5. Where will the testing be done? Blood Tests. Testing for CML includes blood cell counts and a blood cell examination. {Blood cell counts. The doctor orders a lab test called a complete blood count (CBC) to check the numbers of different kinds of blood cells. With CML, the number of white blood cells is typically higher than normal and may be very high. The red blood cell count may be lower than normal. The number of platelets may be higher or lower than normal.The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 9 {Blood cell examination. The cells are stained (dyed) and looked at with an instrument called a light microscope . A person with CML has a small number of developing cells called blast cells in the blood. Blast cells are immature undeveloped blood cells that are not found in the blood of healthy individuals. Bone Marrow Tests. Some signs of CML do not show up in blood tests. The doctor has to look at a small number of cells (a sample) from the bone marrow. The samples of cells are obtained by procedures known as bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy . How Are the Blood and Bone Marrow Tests Done? Blood Test \u2014 A small amount of blood is taken from the patient's arm with a needle. The blood is collected in tubes and sent to a lab. Bone Marrow Aspiration \u2014 A sample of fluid with cells is removed from the bone marrow. Bone Marrow Biopsy \u2014 A very small amount of bone filled with marrow cells is taken from the body. Both bone marrow tests are done with special needles. Some patients are awake for the procedure. The patient gets medication first to numb the part of the body that will be used to take the samples of fluid and/or cells. Some patients are given a drug that makes them sleep during the procedure. The samples of fluid or cells are usually taken from the patient's hip bone. Blood and marrow tests may be done in the doctor's office or in a hospital. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are almost always done at the same visit. Visit www.LLS.org/3D to view an interactive 3D image which will help you visualize and better understand the bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedures. 10 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgBone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy Common site where sample is takenA Bone Marrow Aspiration samples fluid and cells A Bone Marrow Biopsy samples bone and marrowNeedles Skin and fat MarrowPatient position Spongy boneCompact bone Figure 1. Left: The place on the back of the patient's pelvic bone where a bone marrow aspiration or biopsy is done. Right: Where one needle goes into bone marrow to get a liquid sample for aspiration and the other needle goes inside the bone for a bone biopsy. The needles are different sizes. Cytogenetic Testing. Samples of the bone marrow cells are examined under a microscope to study the chromosomes. This is called a cytogenetic analysis. The examiner looks at a \"map\" of the chromosomes in the cell. The map is called a karyotype . The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome in a CML cell can be detected on the karyotype. The presence of the Ph chromosome is important information that\u2014along with information about high white blood cell counts\u2014helps the doctor diagnose CML. FISH. A special test called fluorescence in situ hybridization or FISH can detect CML cells that may not show up on a standard cytogenetic test for the Ph chromosome. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). A qPCR test can detect a very small number of CML cells. A qPCR test can be done on cells taken from the blood or bone marrow. The qPCR test may also be used to monitor how well treatment is working. A qPCR test is recommended every 3 months at first. Even for patients with relatively deep disease remissions lasting at least 2 years, the test should be done every 3 to 6 months.The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 11Tracking Your CML Tests These tips may help you save time and learn more about your health. {Ask your doctor why certain tests are being done and what to expect. {Discuss test results with your doctor. {Ask for and keep copies of lab reports in a folder or binder.

Phases of CML Once doctors diagnose cancer, they need to know how much cancer is in the body and where it is located. For most types of cancer, doctors assign a \"stage\" based on the size of a cancerous growth (called a tumor ) and then determine whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. However, CML does not manifest as a tumor and is not staged in the same way as most cancers. Instead, CML is categorized into three groups called \"phases.\" Knowing your phase of CML helps doctors determine your prognosis (how serious your cancer is and your chances of survival) and plan the best treatment for you. Chronic Phase CML. Most people have chronic phase CML when they are diagnosed. CML symptoms are milder in the chronic phase. White blood cells can still fight infection. Once people with chronic phase CML start treatment, they can usually go back to their day-to-day activities. If CML is not treated, it will progress to the next, more serious \"accelerated phase.\" Accelerated Phase CML. People with accelerated phase CML may develop anemia (a decreased number of red cells in the blood). The number of white blood cells and the number of blast cells in the blood both increase. 12 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgThe number of platelets may increase or decrease and the spleen may swell. People with accelerated phase CML may feel ill. If CML is not treated, it will progress to the next, more serious \"blast phase.\" Blast Crisis Phase CML. People with blast crisis phase CML have an increased number of blast cells in their bone marrow and blood. The numbers of red blood cells and platelets drop. People may have infections or bleeding. They may be tired or have shortness of breath, stomach pain or bone pain. Blast phase behaves like an acute form of leukemia. PART 2 Treating CML Overview of This Section {People with CML should choose a doctor who is a specialist in both diseases of the blood and cancer. This type of doctor is called a hematologist-oncologist . {Ask questions about your treatment choices and do not be afraid to be involved in making decisions about your own care. See the Treatment and Follow-Up Care Question Guides on pages 42-47 . {If you want children in the future, or if you are the parent of a child with CML, ask about fertility (the ability to have a child). Find out what treatments may cause problems with fertility and what choices you have. {For most people with CML, treatment begins with targeted drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These drugs are taken orally (by mouth). {It is important to take TKIs as prescribed by your doctor. Not taking the correct dose can affect how well the treatment works. Finding the Right Doctor Choose a doctor who specializes in treating CML and knows about the most up-to-date treatments. This type of specialist is called a hematologist-oncologist. A hematologist is a doctor who has special training in disorders of the blood. An oncologist is a doctor who has special training in cancer. A hematologist-oncologist has special training in both diagnosing and treating blood cancers. The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 13If your local medical center does not have a hematologist-oncologist, ask the cancer specialist you see if they can consult with a leukemia specialist at another medical center. Always check to see if your health insurance covers the services of the doctors (and the hospital associated with them), or the hospital you choose for your treatment. How to Find a Hematologist-Oncologist {Ask your primary care doctor for a recommendation. {Contact your community cancer center. {Reach out to doctor and/or health insurance plan referral services. {Call an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572. {Use online doctor-finder resources, such as {The American Medical Association's (AMA) \"DoctorFinder\" online at https://doctorfinder.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/ {The American Society of Hematology's (ASH) \"Find a Hematologist\" online at https://www.hematology.org/Patients/FAH.aspx When you meet with the specialist, doctor, nurse or other healthcare team members, ask questions to get a better idea of the doctor's experience and to understand how the office works. Some sample questions are below. See pages 42-47 for a full list of questions. 1. How many patients have you treated who have this disease? 2. What problems or symptoms should be reported to the nurse or doctor right away? 3. Is there a release form available so my family/caregiver can be given medical information?

Before you begin treatment, you and your doctor will discuss your treatment options. One option may be participation in a clinical trial. Like all treatment options, clinical trials have possible risks and benefits. By considering all of your treatment options, including clinical trials, you will be taking an active role in the very important decision-making process that affects you. A patient's treatment plan depends on a number of factors including the phase of CML at diagnosis, test results and patient age. For a list of drugs used to treat CML, see Some Drugs Used to Treat CML on page . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a type of targeted therapy that are taken by mouth. TKIs have 16 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgchanged CML from a potentially deadly cancer to one that can be controlled with medication. However, not all patients respond to TKIs. Five TKIs have been approved for use to date. The first therapy given for a disease is called \"initial treatment.\" To date, four TKI drugs are approved as initial therapy (first-line treatment) the first TKI may not work because of unbearable side effects or because of drug resistance (when the cancer does not respond to treatment). If the initial TKI does not work, a second TKI is tried. If both the initial and second-line TKIs do not work, a third TKI can be offered to the patient. In case of resistance and/or intolerance to second-line treatments, in different ways to block the protein produced by the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene. When taking any of these drugs, it is important to: {Take the prescribed amount of medication each day to maintain the response to treatment. {Follow the doctor's instructions for taking your medication\u2014the imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and may {Get regular checkups for CML. Blood tests\u2014and from time to time, bone marrow tests\u2014are needed. For each drug's indication, please see Health Terms beginning on page 35. A generic drug is a medication created to be the same as a brand-name drug that is already on the market. A generic medicine works in the same way and provides the same benefit as its brand-name version. In other words, you can take a generic medicine as an equal substitute for its brand-name counterpart. The FDA has strict standards to ensure that generic drugs are the same as brand name drugs in the United States. The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 17Generic versions of TKIs have been available since 2016. Talk to your doctor about which treatment option is best for you. Side Effects of TKIs. The term side effect is used to describe the ways that treatment may affect healthy cells and the body in general. Many treatment side effects go away or become less noticeable over time. Most can be handled without the need to stop the drug. Talk to your doctor about the possible side effects and long-term effects of your treatment. At your regular check-ups, your doctor should also check you for side effects of the drug you are taking.

Common side effects may include: mesylate, dasatinib and nilotinib have sometimes, although rarely, developed cardiac issues. Most of the patients with these conditions have other health problems and risk factors, including older age and a medical history of cardiac disease. Your doctor should give you a list of medications to avoid, and will monitor you for these conditions as needed. These cardiac effects can include: {Severe congestive heart failure (a weakness of the heart that leads to a buildup of fluid in the lungs and surrounding body tissues) {Left ventricular dysfunction (difficulty emptying blood from the left lower chamber of the heart) A possible side effect of nilotinib that needs to be regularly monitored is a heart rhythm condition called QT prolongation . Patients should avoid other medications that are known to cause QT prolongation. Other Rare Side Effects. Dasatinib may increase the risk of a serious condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) . This side effect appears to be rare. Nilotinib may be associated with an increased risk of vascular events (disease relating to blood vessels). Ponatinib is only for patients who cannot take any other TKI therapy because of an association with severe liver problems including liver failure.

Adherence to an oral therapy means that you: {Take the correct dose of medication. {Take the medication at the correct time. {Never miss a dose. {Never take an extra dose. {Never take a dose with foods, liquids or other medications that are not allowed. In most patients, TKIs can control CML. You must take your medication as prescribed to achieve the best response. Do not skip doses to try to reduce the side effects of the medication. Tell your doctors about any side effects that you are experiencing. Your doctor can help you manage these side effects. It is important for you to continue taking your medication. By not taking the treatment as prescribed, the medicine may not work the correct way and you will not get the best response. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is generally used in patients only with blast phase CML in hopes of returning the disease to the chronic phase. Very high-dose chemotherapy is also sometimes used to prepare patients for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. See page 20 . Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo\u00ae) is a type of drug called a protein synthesis inhibitor. For FDA approval information, please see Health Terms beginning on page 35. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate is given by injecting the drug under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Common side effects of omacetaxine mepesuccinate may include: {Fever {Infection {Reaction were used as initial therapy before TKIs were introduced. They may continue to be used in select patients. {Interferon alfa (Myleran\u00ae) Stem Cell Transplantation. Your doctor will talk to you about whether stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for you. Most people with CML have a good response to drug treatment which may be able to control CML for a very long time. But in some cases, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be used to treat CML. Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. This is a procedure in which stem cells from another person (a donor) are infused into your body. The donor may be a brother or sister. Or the donor can be an unrelated person with stem cells that \"match\" the patient's. Stem cells may also come from donated cord blood (the blood in the umbilical cord after a baby's birth). The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 21The goals of an allogeneic transplant are to: {Cure the patient of CML by killing remaining CML cells with high-dose chemotherapy {Restore the body's ability to make healthy blood cells Before the transplant, the patient receives drugs to bring the disease under control. After the patient responds to this treatment, they are given high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation which prepares the body to receive the donor cells. Stem cells are collected from a donor. The stem cells from the donor are given to the patient through an intravenous (IV) line or central line. The donor stem cells go from the patient's blood into the patient's bone marrow. They help start a new supply of healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This procedure is done in the hospital. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is most successful in younger patients. However, there is no specific age cutoff for stem cell transplantation. It may be a good treatment for a younger CML patient who does not respond well to oral drug treatment and who has a matched stem cell donor. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment that can cure CML. About 7 out of 10 people who have an allogeneic transplant are cured of their CML. But this procedure has a high risk of serious complications. If a transplant is recommended for you, your doctor will explain the benefits and the risks. Reduced-Intensity Transplant. Doctors are working to make allogeneic stem cell transplants safer. A type of transplant called a reduced-intensity transplant uses a lower dosage of chemotherapy than the dosage used with a standard allogeneic stem cell transplant. This treatment is also called a nonmyeloablative transplant . Older and sicker people may be helped by this treatment.

TKIs are often successful at managing CML for long periods of time. Four TKIs are approved as primary treatment for be used as a treatment for chronic phase CML but is not recommended for newly diagnosed patients. Ponatinib is also approved for patients with the T315I mutation. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo\u00ae) is a type of chemotherapy that is FDA-approved for patients who have chronic phase CML with resistance to or intolerance of two or more prior TKIs. After the start of therapy, doctors will monitor your treatment response. If you are not responding well to therapy, the doctor will need to find out why and start a new treatment. Usually people being treated for chronic phase CML feel well. They can go about their day-to-day activities. However, if the side effects of the treatment are decreasing your quality of life, speak to your doctor. Treatment for Accelerated Phase CML. The goal in treating accelerated phase CML is to kill all cells that contain the BCR-ABL1 gene, leading to a remission. If this is not possible, the goal is to return the disease back to the chronic phase. In accelerated phase CML, the cancer cells often have new genetic mutations that may make treatments less effective. Patients should have BCR-ABL1 gene mutation testing (see page 23 ) before starting treatment to find out which treatment option is best for them.The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 23Imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are effective treatments for people who have accelerated phase CML. Other options include {Treatment in a clinical trial {The TKI ponatinib for patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated and for patients who have a mutation called T315I {The drug omacetaxine mepesuccinate for patients who have experienced resistance or intolerance to two or more TKIs {An allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Treatment for Blast Phase CML. Patients with blast phase CML have leukemia cells that have become abnormal. Patients with blast phase CML have higher blood counts and more severe symptoms. Treatment at a specialized center with doctors who have expertise in CML is recommended for patients in the blast phase of the disease. Patients' cancer cells will need to be tested for different mutations (see below). One option for patients with blast phase CML is to receive treatment within a clinical trial. Another treatment option is for patients to receive TKI therapy, with or without chemotherapy, and then proceed to an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Gene Mutation Testing Gene mutation testing may help find changes in a BCR-ABL1 cancer gene. The test should be ordered if there is: {A treatment milestone the patient does not meet {Loss of hematologic, cytogenetic or major molecular response despite taking an appropriate dose of a TKI (see Measuring Treatment Response on pages 27-28 ) {An unexplained rise in CML cells as shown on a qPCR test {Concern that the medication is not working. The results of a mutation test may tell the doctor why one drug may work and another may not. A mutation test does not need to be done for a patient who is switching medication because of side effects. 24 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgPatients should talk to their doctor about ordering a mutation test and sending a blood sample to a reference laboratory (used for specialized tests). For information about the CML mutation testing guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), please visit www.nccn.org. Children and Young Adults with CML A small percentage of patients diagnosed with CML are children and young adults. CML represents about 2 percent of newly diagnosed childhood leukemias. Specific guidelines for CML treatment in children have yet to be determined. Treatment in children often follows guidelines developed for adults. Children with CML should be treated by pediatric hematologist-oncologists (doctors who specialize in treating children with blood cancers). The following TKIs are used in the treatment of mesylate that TKI drugs may slow growth in children, particularly for those treated before they reach puberty. Careful monitoring of the child's height and overall growth during treatment is recommended. With oral medications, it is important to follow the doctor's directions and ensure that the child takes the medication for as long as prescribed. This can be difficult not only for parents of younger children, but also hard for teens and young adults, because remembering to take the drug can be hard. Talk to your child's doctor about the best treatment for your child and any concerns you may have regarding their treatment.

Generally, there are no concerns associated with having children for men who are taking TKIs. Sperm counts tend to improve on TKI therapy. However, for female patients who want to become pregnant, the issues are more complex. TKIs including imatinib mesylate, dasatinib and nilotinib may result in abnormalities to the fetus or miscarriages. Women should consult with their hematologist-oncologist and a high-risk obstetrician to discuss the potential risks of stopping TKI therapy during pregnancy versus the risks of continuing TKI therapy during pregnancy. Doctors continue to study how CML treatment affects pregnancy. For more information, speak with your doctor so that you understand the: {Need to stop treatment during preconception (before you become pregnant) and pregnancy {Risk of relapse, if therapy is stopped {Risk for fetal effects from TKI drugs (probably greatest during the first trimester) {Need for women on TKI therapy to refrain from breastfeeding their babies {Uncertainty about treatment options and getting a stable response during and after pregnancy Treatment-free remission is now an emerging treatment goal for many patients with CML who have achieved a deep, stable response to treatment. Female patients who are interested in having children should discuss all their options with their treatment team, including the possibility of TKI discontinuation to try for treatment-free remission. See Treatment-Free Remission on page 29. If you are on TKI therapy, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are thinking about having a child. 26 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgPART 3 Clinical Trials About Clinical Trials Doctors may recommend that a patient join a clinical trial. Clinical trials are careful studies done by doctors to test new drugs or treatments or new uses for approved drugs or treatments. For example, changing the amount of the drug or giving the drug along with another type of treatment might be more effective. Some clinical trials combine drugs for CML in new sequences or dosages. There are clinical trials for: {Newly diagnosed CML patients {Patients who do not have a good response to treatment (refractory disease) {Patients who relapse after treatment A carefully conducted clinical trial may provide the best available therapy. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 42-47 for a full list of questions. 1. Is a clinical trial a treatment option? 2. How can I find out if insurance covers the cost of the clinical-trial treatment and treatment-related costs such as testing? 3. Who pays for the travel costs to get to the clinical trial? Ask your doctor if treatment in a clinical trial is right for you. For more information, please call (800) 955-4572 to speak with an LLS Information Specialist who can provide more information about clinical trials and help search for a clinical trial for you. When appropriate, patients and caregivers can work with Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators who will help find clinical trials and personally assist them throughout the entire clinical trial process.

The results are used to help your doctor determine if your CML is well controlled. {CML follow-up care varies from patient to patient, but you will need to see your doctor on a regular basis to evaluate your health. Measuring Treatment Response After you begin treatment, your doctors will regularly order blood and bone marrow tests to see how well the treatment is working. In general, the greater the response to drug therapy, the longer the disease will be controlled. The results are used to help your doctor decide if your CML is well controlled or if there is a need to: {Increase the dose to try for a better response {Decrease or stop the drug briefly because of side effects {Change to a different drug to better control the CML {Change to a different drug to manage side effects There are three types of responses: hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular. Treatment Response on page 28 explains the different types of treatment responses for CML. Most people with chronic phase CML have a complete hematologic response with TKI drugs. Most of these individuals go on to have a complete cytogenetic response. Many may also have a major or complete molecular response. Information about what you can do to keep track of your CML tests is included on page 11. 28 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgHematologic Response A complete hematologic response means that the numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are normal or near normal. The Test: A complete blood count (CBC) is done to measure the numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, and the levels of hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and hematocrit (the amount of red blood cells in the total blood volume). Cytogenetic Response A complete cytogenetic response means that there are no cells with the Ph chromosome detected in the bone marrow. The Test: A qPCR test measures the number of cells that have the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene in the blood. Either cytogenetic analysis or a FISH test is used if a reliable qPCR test is not available. Molecular Response A molecular response is a decrease in the number of cells with the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene in the blood. A patient's molecular response is important in predicting outcomes and in determining future treatments. {In an early molecular response, no more than 10 percent of cells (10 out of every 100 cells) have the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene in the blood. {In a major molecular response (MMR), no more than 0.1 percent (1 out of 1,000 cells) have the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene. {In a deep molecular response (DMR) , no more than 0.01 percent (1 out of 10,000 cells) have the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene. {In a undetectable/complete molecular response (CMR), no cells with BCR-ABL1 cancer gene are found. The Test: A qPCR test measures the number of cells that have the BCR-ABL1 cancer gene in the blood. If possible, the same laboratory should be used for qPCR testing each time. This is because the results may vary from lab to lab.Treatment ResponseThe CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 29Treatment-Free Remission At this time, there are no drug therapies that can cure CML. Many patients with chronic phase CML, however, develop deep and lasting remissions with TKI therapies. Treatment-free remission (TFR) is achieved when patients can safely stop taking their TKI medications and still continue to have a deep molecular response. Patients in the chronic phase of CML who have had a good and deep molecular response for at least two years are considered candidates for stopping TKI therapy under careful medical supervision. Talk to your doctor to see whether trying treatment-free remission may be a potential option in your case. It is important to consult with an experienced CML doctor before attempting treatment-free remission. Follow-Up Care Medical follow-up is important for every CML patient. Follow-up care helps your doctor see how well your treatment worked and is still working, and to determine if different treatment is needed. Patients should see their primary care doctors and their hematologist- oncologists (cancer specialists) regularly for follow-up care. Ask your doctor about how often you should have follow-up visits. You can also ask the doctor what tests will be needed and find out how often you need to have these tests. It is important to get and keep a record of your cancer treatment, including the drugs you receive and the time period you received them, so that your doctor can follow up on specific long-term effects that may be associated with your treatment. See page 48 for a place that you can list your treatments.You can view, print or order the free LLS publications Treatment-Free Remission for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia at www.LLS.org/booklets or contact our Information Specialists for copies.WANT MORE INFORMATION?30 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgHere are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare team. See pages 42-47 for a full list of questions. 1. Who will I work with to ensure life-long follow-up care? 2. Will I continue to see this healthcare team? 3. What information can be given to my primary doctor about past treatment and what may be needed in the future? Follow-up care includes physical exams and blood tests. Sometimes bone marrow tests are also needed. For CML patients, qPCR testing is initially recommended every 3 months. After 2 years of achieving and maintaining a BCR-ABL1 level of 1 percent or less, the test should be done every 3 to 6 months. To find survivorship clinics (places that provide services to help cancer survivors live well after cancer treatment) and other resources for child and adult survivors, contact our Information Specialists at (800) 955-4572. Take Care of Yourself {Keep all your doctors' appointments (specialists, primary care, testing). {Talk with the doctor about how you feel at each visit. {Ask any questions you may have about side effects. {People with CML may have more infections. Follow your doctor's advice for preventing infection. {Eat healthy foods each day. It may help to eat 4 or 5 smaller meals instead of 3 larger ones. {Contact your doctor if you feel tired, have a fever, or experience other symptoms. {Do not smoke. Patients who smoke should get help to quit. {Get enough rest and exercise. Check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. {Keep a healthcare file with copies of lab reports and treatment records. {Have regular cancer screenings. See your primary care doctor to keep up with your healthcare needs.The CML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers I 31 {Talk with family and friends about how you feel and about your treatment. When family and friends know about CML and its treatment, they may worry less. {Seek medical advice if you feel sad or depressed and your mood does not improve over time. If you feel sad or depressed every day for a two- week period, seek help. Depression is an illness. It should be treated even when a person is being treated for CML. Treatment for depression has benefits for people living with cancer. Resources and Information LLS offers free information and services for patients and families affected by blood cancers.
