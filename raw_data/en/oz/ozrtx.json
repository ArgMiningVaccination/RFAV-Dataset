The Living Well With Cancer program is a group-based therapy program that incorporates integrative medicine. This program is for cancer patients who are either going through treatment or in remission, who feel the emotional strain and physical hardships of cancer and its treatments. Where: Cashman Center. 2970 Judicial Rd. #100 Burnsville, MN. 55337. When: Group therapy begins on Thursdays at 1pm, immediately followed by integrative care at 2pm. Who: Any patient who has been diagnosed with cancer and is either going through treatments or in remission. Why: It is our mission to help patients who are suffering from the emotional and physical effects of cancer and its treatments. We use a two-pronged approach of group therapy to build relationships and camaraderie, as well as, teach coping skills to help deal with the fear, anxiety, and isolative effects of cancer and its treatments. We also utilize multiple evidence based integrative medicine strategies which, reduce stress and anxiety, ease pain, and improve mood, and reduce the physical side effects of cancer and its treatments. We, at Cashman Center, feel that the Living Well With Cancer program helps cancer patients in pursuing a harmonious mind and body that is calm and at peace. How: Our group therapy team will have weekly check ins to help you cope with the trials and tribulations of cancer together, as a community. They will also teach valuable skills that will help you overcome the emotional hurdles of life during and after cancer. We have an amazing integrative medicine team that includes an acupuncturist, soft tissue bodyworks specialist, art therapist, restorative yoga instructor, a nutritionist, and a Biomat, sound, body energy, and vibration specialist. We understand that the very nature of cancer is costly for both time and money. That is why we have teamed with the Justin Kukowski Foundation to provide scholarships for those in need. We have also designed the program to have a loose attendance policy to ease the burden of obligation on those who are already suffering enough.
