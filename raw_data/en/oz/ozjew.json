IN THE NEWS Dynes' resigns ... UC President Robert C. Dynes , a first- generation college graduate and physicist who rose to become the 18th president of the world's top public university, has announced plans to step down by June 2008. Dynes, who took office in October 2003, will end at the nearly five-year mark he had initially set for himself for serving as head of the 10- campus system, and paves the way for the 64-year-old to focus on his personal life, including a new marriage, and his research into superconductivity. Provost and Executive Vice President Wyatt R. Hume will act as UC's chief operating officer. New nursing school ... The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has announced $100 million in founding support to create the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis . UC currently has nursing schools at UCSF and UCLA. Pending UC and other approvals, the campus anticipates admitting its first students in master's and doctorate programs in fall 2008. The funding is the largest philanthropic grant to UC Davis and one of the largest in UC history. It is also the largest philanthropic gift in the nation in support of nursing education. Top-10 rankings ... Four of UC's nine general education campuses hit the top 10 of Washington Monthly's annual rankings of public interest universities and colleges. UCLA placed second, UC Berkeley , third, UC San Diego , fourth, and UC Davis , eighth. The magazine wrote: \"UCLA does a great job of accepting and graduating students of modest means, while Berkeley excels at service, and both schools boast a profusion of science and engineering degrees. \" Its top pick: Texas A&M. We the people ... UC has an informative Web site that highlights Constitution Day, Sept. 17, the anniversary of our country's founding document. The site (www. universityofcalifornia.edu/constitutionday) is intended to broaden the university community's knowledge of, and appreciation for, this important document. A federal law enacted in 2005 requires schools that receive federal funds to observe Constitution Day annually.HEALTH AND NUTRITION Gehrig's disease ... Tahseen Mozaffar , a UC Irvine neurologist, is part of a national group of scientists who have identified the active genes in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a discovery that provides expanded opportunities for developing therapies to treat this chronic, incurable disease. A comprehensive scan of the human genome has identified more than 50 genetic abnormalities in people with sporadic ALS, the most prevalent form of the disease. ALS also is known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to paralysis and death, usually within three to five years. Social networks ... Research by James Fowler of UC San Diego and a Harvard colleague suggests that obesity is \"socially contagious, \" spreading from person to person in a social network. The study - the first to examine this phenomenon - finds that if one person becomes obese, those closely connected to them have a greater chance of becoming obese themselves. Surprisingly, the greatest effect is seen not among people sharing the same genes or the same household, but among friends. If a person you consider a friend becomes obese, the researchers found, your own chances of becoming obese go up 57 percent. Among mutual friends, the effect is even stronger, with chances increasing 171 percent. The researchers believe that people affect not only each other's behaviors but also, more subtly, norms. Immune system ... A compound found in broccoli and related vegetables may have more health-boosting tricks up its sleeves, according to a new study led by researchers at UC Berkeley . Veggie fans can already point to some cancer-fighting properties of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), a chemical produced from the compound indole-3-carbinol when Brassica vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and kale are chewed and digested. Animal studies have shown that DIM can actually stop the growth of certain cancer cells. This new study shows that DIM may help boost the immune system, as well. Preemie lungs ... A nationwide study led by researchers at UC San Francisco provides evidence that inhaled nitric oxide is safe and effective for the prevention of the most common type of long-term lung disease of very premature infants. Nitric oxide is a gaseous compound normally produced by the body, however, premature infants produce insufficient amounts. The new study found no adverse affects of inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary surfactant, a substance critical to normal lung development and functioning.Diabetes study ... In the first large-scale, multi-ethnic study of its kind, UCLA researchers have confirmed the role played by three molecules, known as cytokines, in causing Type 2 diabetes. These molecules have been identified by scientists as early biological markers that may be used to more accurately predict future diabetes in healthy individuals. Type 2 diabetes, which afflicts roughly 7 percent of the U.S. population, is the most common form of diabetes and accounts for about 90-to-95 percent of all diabetes cases. DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCOVERIES Solar energy ... Using plastics to harvest the energy of the sun just got a significant boost in efficiency thanks to a discovery made at UC Santa Barbara's Center for Polymers and Organic Solids . UCSB physics professor and Nobel laureate Alan Heeger and a team of scientists created \"tandem\" cells made up of two multilayered parts that work together to gather a wider range of the spectrum of solar radiation \u2014 at both shorter and longer wavelengths. Anticipated improvements in the device will yield efficiencies leading to commercial products in a few years, says Heeger. Internet scams ... Computer scientists from UC San Diego have found striking differences between the infrastructure used to distribute spam and the infrastructure used to host the online scams advertised in these unwanted email messages. This discovery should aid in the fight to reduce spam volume and shut down illegal online businesses and malware sites. In 2006, industry estimates suggest that spam comprises over 80 percent of all Internet email with a total volume up to 85 billion messages per day. Spider silk ... UC Riverside biologists have identified the genes and determined the DNA sequences for two key proteins in the \"dragline silk\" of the black widow spider - an advance that may lead to a variety of new materials for industrial, medical and military uses. The black widow spider's dragline silk is a standout compared to other spider silks because of its superior strength and extensibility, a combination that enables black widow dragline silk to absorb enormous amounts of energy. These properties suggest that synthetically produced silk might find applications as diverse as lightweight super-strong body armor, components of medical devices and high-tech athletic attire. Burst of waves ... UCSF scientists have discovered that torrents of microscopic waves propel white blood cells toward invading microbes. The discovery - recorded on videotape - holds the potential for better understanding and treatment of cancer and heart disease. Visible only under a very high-resolution light microscope, the dynamic waves are made of a signaling protein that directs cell movement. This protein and a second key player were already known to trigger cells to move, but their interaction to generate the self-sustaining waves has now been revealed, says Orion Weiner , who led the scientific team.THE CUTTING EDGE Protecting strawberries ... Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a powerful two-pronged approach that greatly reduces pesticide use on strawberries, one of the most valuable crops in California. The new approach uses alfalfa as a trap crop to attract dense concentrations of the western tarnished plant bug, known also as the lygus bug, which are then removed by strong tractor-mounted vacuums. It also employs a tiny parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside the lygus bug and kills it from the inside out. This \"double whammy\" has reduced lygus bug damage in organic strawberry fields by more than 50 percent. Very tiny light ... A bio-friendly nano-sized light source capable of emitting coherent light across the visible spectrum, has been invented by a team of researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley . Among the many potential applications of this nano-sized light source, once the technology is refined, are single cell endoscopy and other forms of subwavelength bio-imaging, integrated circuitry for nanophotonic technology, and new advanced methods of cyber cryptography. Science multimedia ... Science is coming to the Y ouTube generation with the advent of SciVees - video and podcasts that supplement traditional peer-reviewed articles. The new Internet source, SciVee (www.scivee.tv), launched Sept. 1 as a collaboration between the National Science Foundation and the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego . The goal of the initiative is to encourage the further use of open access scientific publishing, by adding multimedia content to standard print formats and online formats. The Public Library of Science (www.plos.org) will facilitate the development and testing of these tools on its freely accessible online peer-reviewed content. PLANETS AND ENVIRONMENT Tahoe report ... The most striking data in an inaugural annual report from UC Davis on the state of Lake Tahoe show that the lake's climate is warming up, which could have profound implications for the natural features that make Tahoe a popular vacation destination. The state of the lake report presents, in easy-to-read charts, a summary of tens of thousands of scientific observations of lake weather, water conditions, and aquatic life made since the late 1960s by UC Davis scientists. The report is designed for the non-scientific community. Climate change ... As California's climate changes, will plant populations adapt, migrate or face extinction? An inter- institutional team of researchers led by UC Merced's earth sciences professor Lara Kueppers aims to find out, using a recent $2.97 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to set up experimental research plots in the eastern Sierra Nevada. The scientists will create manipulated-climate environments for growing two species of pine trees through their seedling stage, changing the temperature and moisture to see how the young trees respond to different conditions.Telescope project ... The University of California and Caltech have each received $7.5 million in additional funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for the development of the Thirty-Meter Telescope. The foundation had previously awarded $35 million to UC and Caltech for the project. With the telescope, astronomers will be able to analyze the light from the first stars born after the Big Bang, directly observe the formation and evolution of galaxies, see planets around nearby stars, and make observations that test fundamental laws of physics. Leaf clues ... The decomposition rate of leaves is related to their rate of photosynthesis - a result that can increase scientists' ability to predict how different plant species can affect the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and, therefore, global warming, says UC Riverside assistant professor of physiological ecology Louis Santiago . Leaves with a high photosynthetic rate and high nutrient concentration tend to be thinner and decompose faster, he says. The findings can help tune global climate models that take into account the effect of vegetation types on the atmosphere. INSIGHTS ON SOCIETY Dropouts' drain ... A first-of-its-kind analysis of California's high school graduation reveals that dropouts cost the state $46.4 billion annually. The figure comprises lost tax revenues, medical costs and the increased likelihood of being on welfare or committing a crime. The study from a UC Santa Barbara research institute estimates California's economic benefit from effective intervention programs at $392,000 per high school graduate. Each year, 120,000 Californians reach age 20 without a high school diploma. Reference reliability ... The online reference site Wikipedia enjoys immense popularity despite nagging doubts about the reliability of entries written by volunteers. A new program developed at UC Santa Cruz aims to help with the problem by color-coding an entry's individual phrases based on contributors' past performance. The program analyzes Wikipedia's entire editing history - nearly two million pages and some 40 million edits for the English-language site alone - to estimate the trustworthiness of each page. It then shades the text in deepening hues of orange to signal dubious content. A 1,000-page demo version is available on a Web page from the program's creator, Luca de Alfaro , an associate professor of computer engineering at UCSC. Academic success ... A new report by Policy Analysis for California Education finds that six in 10 students who enter the California community college system as freshmen with high school diplomas and aspirations to transfer to four-year institutions drop out or lower their academic sights after just one semester. The report recommends increasing support for these students. More preparation for the transition from high school to college is essential to achieve the goal of a more educated population and work force, concludes the study, authored by UC Davis demographer Anne Driscoll .Election disparity ... Despite an increase in the number of non-white officials elected in recent decades, people of color continue to be significantly underrepresented at all levels of government. So concludes a study by UC Santa Barbara political science professor Pei-te Lien and colleagues. At the national level, nonwhites are still severely underrepresented in Congress, state the authors. In 2000, nonwhites were 31 percent of the national population, but less than 12 percent of House members. LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE Investigating autism ... UCLA and UC San Diego are among the five sites provided funding from the National Institutes of Health for a new Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) program that will intensify efforts to find the causes of autism and identify new treatments. At UCSD ACE, the primary goal will be to identify brain or other physical differences that might predispose a child to autism. Researchers at the UCLA ACE will seek to understand how autism spectrum disorders affects the ability to communicate. Autism is a complex brain disorder involving communication and social difficulties as well as repetitive behavior or narrow interests . School planning ... UC Riverside's effort to launch a school of medicine is now entering its final stages of business planning. Several work groups led by longtime campus figures, community leaders, as well as people hired especially for their expertise in planning medical school programs, will meet regularly to plan the financial structure, the relationships with local medical facilities, and the classrooms and offices needed on campus. The campus has hired Deloitte Consulting to help speed the effort to establish work groups, advisory groups and a project infrastructure. Stem cell researcher ... Acclaimed Japanese stem cell scientist Shinya Yamanaka has joined the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease , where he will continue his research into reprogramming adult cells into embryonic stem cells. Y amanaka is the L.K. Whittier Foundation Investigator in Stem Cell Biology at Gladstone. He is also a professor of anatomy at UCSF . A year ago, Y amanaka was the first scientist to report on a new method for \"reprogramming\" skin cells from mice into embryonic-like cells that can differentiate into other types of cells. Gladstone is an independent, non-profit biomedical research organization affiliated with UCSF. KUDOS Literature award ... Alejandro Morales , a novelist and professor of Chicano/Latino studies at UC Irvine , is the recipient of this year's Luis Leal Award for Distinction in Chicano/Latino Literature. Considered one of the nation's premier Latino writers of fiction, Morales is the author of several biographical novels in which he tells the fictional story of a character's life using historical events. The award is presented annually by UC Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara City College and the Santa Barbara Book Council.To learn more about UC research discoveries, and other news from UC campuses and national laboratories: UC Berkeley www.berkeley.edu/news UC Davis www.news.ucdavis.edu UC Irvine www.today.uci.edu UCLA www.newsroom.ucla.edu UC Merced www.ucmerced.edu UC Riverside www.newsroom.ucr.edu UC Santa Barbara www.ucsb.edu UC San Diego ucsdnews.ucsd.edu UC San Francisco pub.ucsf.edu/today UC Santa Cruz www.ucsc.edu/news_events Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/News-Releases.html Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/news.html Los Alamos National Laboratory www.lanl.gov/worldview/news/releases/index.shtml UC system www.universityofcalifornia.edu Robert C.

Marie Cowan , dean of the UCLA School of Nursing , has been chosen to receive the Living Legend Award by the American Academy of Nursing. Considered one of the highest honors in the nursing field, the award spotlights senior academy members who serve as extraordinary role models and whose lifetime of achievements embody the history of the nursing profession. Cowan began her academic career in 1972, and joined UCLA in 1997. She recruited more than 20 prominent new faculty to the school, greatly expanding its research capacity and restoring its reputation as one of the top-10 nursing schools in the country. Helping teachers ... UC Irvine has developed a technology to streamline the time-consuming process of returning exams and, perhaps someday, make handing out graded papers obsolete. Called Rapid Return, the system uses barcode- assisted imaging technology - like supermarket scanners - to automate exam indexing and distribution. Rapid Return recently received a Larry L. Sautter Award from the UC Information Technology Leadership Council , recognizing innovations with potential to improve administrative or academic processes. Industrial innovation ... Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley , Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories captured 10 of R&D Magazine's prestigious 2007 R&D 100 Awards that recognize the 100 most significant proven technological advances of the previous year. Often referred to as the \"Oscars of invention, \" the annual 100 Awards are based on each achievement's technical significance, uniqueness and usefulness. Lawrence Livermore received five awards, Berkeley Lab, three and Los Alamos, two. UC is involved in the management of the laboratories.INVESTING IN EDUCATION Law school ... UC Irvine received a $20 million commitment from Orange County business leader and philanthropist Donald Bren to support the campus's recently established law school. The gift creates an endowment to help recruit and support a nationally recognized dean and 11 distinguished law scholars. It also will provide the dean with discretionary start-up funding. In recognition of the gift, the school will be named the Donald Bren School of Law . The school, approved by the UC regents in November 2006, is scheduled to open in fall 2009, and would be the first public law school to open in California in more than 40 years. Pioneering research ... Research grants and awards for UC Merced's 80 professors increased about 60 percent this past fiscal year versus the previous year, with more than $12.2 million coming from a variety of sources. The dramatic increase underscores the faculty's growing success in obtaining grants in an intensely competitive environment. UC Merced's research strengths include climate change issues; biological diversity and management; cognitive science and artificial intelligence; and biomedical topics including cancer research and stem cell questions. UC Merced, opened in September 2005 as UC's 10th campus, has about 2,000 students. "}
