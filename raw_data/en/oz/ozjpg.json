It is a secondary mineral deposited from circulating waters, and it occurs chiefly in arid environments as blue to greenish, waxy veinlets in alumina-rich, weathered, volcanic, or sedimentary rocks. Turquoise was obtained from the Sinai Peninsula before the 4th millennium BC in one of the world's first important hard-rock mining operations. It was transported to Europe through Turkey, probably accounting for its name, which is French for \"Turkish.\" Highly prized turquoise has come from Neyshbr, Iran. Numerous deposits in the southwestern United States have been worked for centuries by American Indians. Turquoise also occurs in northern Africa, Australia, Siberia, and Europe. The colour of turquoise ranges from blue through various shades of green to greenish and yellowish gray.

Some believe turquoise stones can warn their owners by breaking, like malachites supposedly do. Color changes presumably warn of impending illness. In one tale, a man believed he had broken a bone. Later, he discovered his turquoise had made the cracking sound he heard. It took the injury in his place. Also like malachite, turquoise can supposedly protect from falls, most especially from horseback. Affixing this gem to a horse's bridle can protect the animal, as well. Turquoise's use as a \"horse amulet\" appears to be an ancient magical practice. The Apache highly prized duklij, turquoise, for its talismanic properties. They carved amulets, beads, pendants, and fetishes from this material. If Apache shamans didn't possess this stone, they wouldn't receive proper recognition from their tribes.
