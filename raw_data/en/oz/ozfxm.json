This lemur species is named after James Sibree, an English architect who went to Madagascar to build churches and stayed on as a missionary for the then London Missionary Society - late 19th century, early 20th century. James Sibree wrote a number of books on the flora and fauna of Madagascar, hence the reason for the lemur species being named after him. His son, also James Sibree, after serving as a missionary in Samoa, arrived in Sydney in the mid-1920s to take up a parish in the suburb of Epping. Subsequently two of the Madagascan James Sibree's grandchildren have graduated from Sydney University, together with six of his great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild. Jim Sibree (BEc '68 DipAgEc '75) Fairlight NSWColoniAl SMokESCrEEn Congratulations on Helen McKenzie's terrific cover story on Paul Porteous's work in Madagascar (Autumn '08). It was a great read and left me wanting to know more about the world's fourth-largest island. I also loved your use of Paul's photos, especially the big, all-seeing eyes of the lemur on the front cover. I was intrigued by the anecdotes about the women of Madagascar - where the women broke their new water pump (not vandals); where local women are training as midwives and nurses because they are more likely to stay in their local communities; and where the President wished his newly-wed daughter \"three children\" not \"seven sons and daughters\" as is the usual Madagascan custom. I cringed at thoughts of the French bureaucracy's control of its colony through its \"Organisational Chart\", imagining a colonial smokescreen which hid all laws, so that the only people who knew what was happening and where taxes were being spent were the French. Julia Featherstone (BA '66 DipEd '67) Potts Point NSW rAtS AnD FrogS Helen McKenzie's story about Madagascar (Autumn '08) makes the claim that the island hosts 223 of the world's 226 known species of frogs. Even I, with no biology education, immediately smelt a rat (so to speak). The webpage wildmadagascar.org/ wildlife/frogs.html states less grandly that of the island's 300 or so species, around 99 per cent are endemic. Perhaps this is more like what McKenzie was told. I understand there are five or six thousand species of amphibians world-wide, the majority by far being frogs. However, if the Madagascan frogs can evade pollution-induced reproductive disorders and fungal diseases, there might yet come a day when someone can confidently state that Madagascar has 223 of the world's 226 known species of frogs. Dr Barry Craig Anthrop '60 DipEd '61 MA Hons Anthrop South Australian Museum Adelaide SAilluMinA tion SnuFFED It was good to see the future removal of \"alumnus\" on page 8 (Autumn '08). However, the ban did not last long, as the word appeared on page 10 in the article regarding Lee Burns. Let's hope it will really be banished in the next issue. Laura Jilka (BCom '05) Castle Hill NSW PolitiCAl FliCkS i The list of movies (Autumn '08) was impressive and contained many fine movies. My personal favourite of all American political movies, however, is Advise and Consent, a 1962 Otto Preminger movie with an all-star cast headed by Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Walter Pidgeon, Gene Tierney, Peter Lawford and Burgess Meredith, who won an NBR [National Board of Review] award as Best Supporting Actor. It revolved around a Senate investigation into the President's (Franchot Tone) newly-nominated Secretary of State (Henry Fonda). This reveals a secret from the past that may not only ruin the candidate, but also reflect poorly on the President's character as well. Steve Howard (BA '77) Georges Hall NSWPolitiCAl FliCkS ii One of the best \"political\" movies of recent years has been Election. The 1999 debut feature by director Alexander Payne, Election is a biting political satire set as a school election. Starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick, it's a great look at a campaign and candidate at a micro level. Well recommended! Michael Butterworth (BEc '86) Marsfield NSW HAwkESbury/nEPEAn AnyonE? At risk of being just a bit pompous - but I am getting seriously middle-aged :-) I am an alumnus of both Cambridge and Sydney, and was pleased when a plastic-wrapped magazine turned up last week. \"Ah\", I thought, \"a new issue of CAM.\" Then I saw the University coffee mug brochure and thought: \"What a shame, Cambridge has started flogging coffee mugs and ties, just like Sydney.\" It was only then that I realised that the magazine was called SAM and just happened to have exactly the same typography and cover layout as the Cambridge Alumni Magazine. Is this cultural cringe? Is Sydney trying to position itself as the \"Cambridge of the South\"? In addition, the name is silly. It reminds me of the letters SAM Sydney Alumni Magazine AUTUMN 2008 madagascar artscience medicine books ISSN 1834-393711556SAM_Atm08CvrFA2.qxd 21/2/08 10:49 AM Page Cvr1 3 SAM Winter 08well-known Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham, where the noxious \"Sam I am\" offers green eggs and ham to all. At least the Cambridge original has the same name as the river that runs through the town. How about finding a relevant, really Aussie name for the magazine? Or just going back to the Sydney Alumni Magazine? By the way, the articles in the new-look magazine were interesting. Keep up the good work but find your own voice! David Cameron (BEng '87) Oslo Norway luCiD lA tin lo VErS Congratulations on your fresh approach to the magazine. I really enjoyed Gil Appleton's account of retrieving her study of Latin at the recent summer school. Many of us, like Gil, have found our early studies at the University to be of lifelong value, even when they were not \"market oriented\". That Gil has become a keen Latin student again says lots for the quality of learning available to us at USyd all those decades ago. More such stories please. Susan Ryan AO (BA '63) (Chair - Australian Human Rights Act Campaign) Coogee NSWF'r inSt AnCE Please tell me you were joking and playing a little trick on your readers (trying to catch the unobservant?) in your piece on English usage (Autumn '08). How else could the editor and sub-editor have committed the dreaded comma fault in para 3, line 4? \"However\" introduces a new and independent clausal structure as any English, American, Australian guide to grammar, usage and puctuation [sic] will stress. Try Fowler, Burchfield, Peters, Strunk and White. Similarly in para 4, line 3, surely a semi-colon before \"for instance\" is accepted usage? In para 5, line 6, you begin a long sentence which does not contain a principal clause. I agree that this could be considered a stylistic feature, a colloquial touch so to speak. However (note the full stop and capital letter beginning a new sentence), I am not sure this was the intention. I am all for an easy style and a lack of dogmatism in such matters, and do not wish to stress \"correctness\" as such, but rather the fact that mostly these so called \"rules\" work as guides to clarity and prevent ambiguity. This surely should be the aim in a journal issued by a top-rank university. Yon (Yvonne) Maley (BA '50) Castlecrag you? Please? \"Their's a bear in there\" is indeed a horror but don't blame the blameless apostrophe. The error is in the confusion of homophones. Try \"there's a bear in there\" and, if more than one, perhaps sitting on their chairs. It is important, however, to make sure that the chairs are theirs. Gillian Varcoe (BA '77) Canberra ACT wrong HuMAniSt Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat (mentioned in the profile of Prof Ron Grunstein, Autumn '08), saved literally thousands of Hungarian (mostly) Jews by giving them Swedish passports in 1944. He later disappeared into the Russian gulags, without apparent trace. He had nothing to do with Schindler's List. Oscar Schindler, the subject of Thomas Kenneally's book and later Steven Speilberg's film, was a German industrialist and bon vivant who saved many hundreds of Jewish slave labourers by protecting them at his factory in Krakow, Poland. Schindler survived the war but was never able to really attain any status or wealth. He was partly supported by those he saved (many later came to Australia) and was buried in Jerusalem as a righteous Gentile. The only similarities in their respective stories are their humanity and success in saving Jewish lives.

SiMPLY EMAiL US AT alumniadmin@vcc.usyd.edu.au4 SAM Winter 08 Centre of the Alumni universe A long-held dream of the University of Sydney Alumni Council will come true later this year when the finishing touches are put to the purpose-built Alumni Centre and the doors will be open to all alumni to enjoy its amenities. Melbourne's John Wardle Architects, a firm with a strong track record in academic projects, won the competition to design the building. Late December is the projected opening date, according to Professor Andrew Coats, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Community)who says: \"We will at last have the environment to support the programs we have developed to engage our alumni, donors and friends with the University.\" The Alumni Office is expecting a full calendar as alumni associations and chapters, as well as individuals, take advantage of the opportunities the new \"home\" will present to hold formal meetings and functions, catch up with fellow alumni or simply drop in for a snack or a drink. Situated on the seventh (top) floor of the building (currently known as Sydney Central but soon to be renamed) next to the Wentworth Building on City Road, the new Alumni Centre will serve a multitude of purposes. As all the non-academic student services will be housed in the same building, the new centre will allow students to make a smooth transition from student to alumnus status. In addition to administrative offices, the Alumni Centre will house a 40-seat boardroom, meeting rooms, a club lounge and business centre. These spaces feature outstanding city, park and University vistas as well as balconies from which to enjoy them. At the heart of the centre is a flexible function area for up to 200 people that is suitable for theatre-style The new Alumni Centre (left) with a view of the city from one of its balconies conferences, seminars and workshops. It will also be available and set up to cater for alumni activities such as cocktail parties, sit-down lunches and dinners. \"The new Alumni Centre is available for use by the Alumni Council, all Alumni Associations, University Foundations and other donor relations activities,\" says T racey Beck, Alumni Relations Director. \"And finally our international alumni will have a 'home on campus' when they visit.\"5 SAM Winter 08Northern highlights When the novel Morris in Iceland was launched in April, it was a very Sydney alumni occasion: the author, publishers and launcher were all graduates of the University. After a brief law career, the author, Alex Jones (LLB '64 MA '68), spent his working life in the English Department and is currently an honorary associate there. Publishers Puncher and Wattmann are actually David Musgrave (PhD '97) and Matthew Holt (PhD '98), whose fledgling imprint scored a critical and popular success with Jones's first novel, Helen Garner and the Meaning of Everything (more about them in the next issue of SAM). The distinguished launcher was Ivor Indyk (BA '72), a former member of the English Department staff and now Whitlam Professor of Writing and Society at the University of Western Sydney and also a publisher with Giramondo Press. Professor Indyk entertained the launch crowd of 160 literary enthusiasts with a speech in which he recalled Alex Jones as \"the man who introduced the panama hat to Australian academic life\", adding: \"I think of him as the intellectual concierge of the department.\" Of Morris in Iceland he said: \"A wonderfully light yet erudite piece of work. I was very moved by this book ... it is about making your way in the world, holding it all together and dreaming.\" Morris in Iceland is reviewed on page 24 and is available in all good bookshops, as is the second edition of Helen Garner and the Meaning of Everything. What are our greatest health challenges and how will they affect you and global health? The University's School of Public Health and the Medical Foundation's public lecture series Grand Challenges in Health and Medicine spotlights the foremost challenges facing us. Increasing the use of evidence in health policy, by Professor Sally Redman, chief executive of the SAX Institute on June 18, shows how research evidence can improve policy, programs and services. Professor Redman is a member of the National Health and Medical research Council research committee. On July 30, Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, in The fifty-year revolution in global public health, acknowledges achievements in improving global health, including the contribution of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to health in developing countries. \"All citizens must be concerned about the relief of poverty and betterment of living conditions in developing countries. Better health is one important pathway toward these ends,\" Professor Nossal said. The lecture given by Professor Stephen Leeder, who has 40 years' experience in public health research, education and policy, on August 20 - Rethinking the role of medicine - will doubtless provoke debate. \"The nanotechnological and genetic revolutions will change all phases of medical practice, in all places. Meanwhile, the challenge of chronic disease necessitates new ways of ordering health care and approaches to prevention. The humane mission of medicine - to relieve suffering - will be challenged by these changes,\" says Professor Leeder, co-director of the Menzies Centre for Health. \"Crisis features prominently in press reportage on health, especially in hospitals,\" says Professor Bruce Armstrong. \"A rising burden of chronic disease, along with mismanagement and underfunding, is often invoked as a cause for crisis. Is it? If so, what can we do about it?\" Professor Armstrong's lecture - Lifting the last straw: the challenge of chronic illness - is on September 24. Professor Armstrong received the inaugural NSW Premier's award for Outstanding Cancer Researcher of the Y ear 2006. He is Professor of Public Health at the University. Professor Adrian Bauman's lecture on October 22, Tackling public health's deadly sins - the epidemiology of gluttony and sloth, explores why it has taken so long to grasp these as significant health problems and our commitment to change our approach to fixing them. \"The topic is something we can all engage in, both in our own lifestyles, as role models, family and community members,\" says Professor Bauman, who is internationally known for work in physical activity for health.

The US Studies Centre promises a link-up with the Sydney Film Festival in the not too distant future, but if political cinema is your interest, self-festival is the way to go. Meanwhile, a flutter of the Stars and Stripes gets computers humming across the nation. And when not tapping furious emails, readers are on the phone. One rang to complain about more creeping Americanisation. Not spelling, this time, but the emphasis in the masthead of SAM. This is seen as a forelock tug to Uncle Sam rather than taking visual inspiration from the English CAM (Cambridge's alumni publication). As Acerbic Caller commented: \"But CAM is the river, SAM is not.\" Indeed. But rivers didn't come into it, particularly given the unco-operative nature of Sydney's waterways. Hawkesbury-Nepean-Georges-Cook-Hacking is about as masthead/marquee-friendly as Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson AO. The intention is not a kowtow to Uncle Sam but a nod to elegant, classic design wherever it may be found; and also to give the magazine a title rather than a description. Mind you, given how many still refer to the publication as \"The Gazette\" one might wonder just how truly observant are these eagle-eyed complainants. Another respondent says, however, that \"The 'Comma people' (very like coma) are pointless, always were, always will be. They are shuffling their own disappointment off onto the magazine. Be relentlessly polite and drive them barking mad.\" \"Barking mad\" - a glorious Australianism, don't you agree? In Right Words: A Guide to English Usage in Australia, first published in 1987, the late Stephen Murray-Smith wrote: \"Language belongs to us all, and we speak that language as we please. In speaking as we wish, we help to create the new language that is always being born out of the old. Still, if you call a cabbage a clock people will have difficulty in understanding what you mean.\" Nevertheless, it must be said that all letters and contributions, bouquets and brickbats, particularly those offering ideas and stories to savour, are most welcome. Finally, although I risk the ire of those whose view of the US remains coloured by fear and loathing, 2008's is the gonzo campaign trail of them all. Those similarly interested in the phenomenon of the presidential election circus may visit the US Studies Centre website (http://sydney.edu.au/us-studies/) for updates on forthcoming talks, forums and other functions to help make sense of our amazing neighbour across the Pacific.

An email pinged into the SAM inbox recently from Maggie Burnette of the Blue Mountains. She attached a photograph (below) that she snapped for reasons explained in her message, which read: \"Good morning, \"There was a festival in Springwood last Saturday (April).

The association hosted a spring barbecue in April at the Kerry Lake Egret Nature Park at T ai Po Kau, in the New T erritories. More than 20 alumni took part and enjoyed the opportunity to catch up with old Sydney friends, build new friendships and expand professional networks. According to the report, \"Nice and sunny weather on the day reminded us of an Aussie BBQ back in Australia. A big thank you goes out to Kelly Chan (MLMgt '06) for organising this event, as well other committee members of the Hong Kong Alumni Association. Hope to see you on our next event - the Harbour Cruise!\" Hong Kong alumni may get in touch for future news and events through: alumniadmin@vcc.usyd.edu.au Apology In the autumn issue of SAM, the essay by Dr Edward Duyker, on Lloyd Rees and his long association with the University, was marred by sub-editing errors and omissions.

A corrected version of the profile is now posted on the website at www.usyd.edu.au and follow the prompts to SAM. A violin built in the 1840s by the fabled Parisian violin-maker Auguste Sebastien Philippe Bernadel has been acquired by the Sydney Conservatorium of Music through the generosity of alumnus Professor Gerald Westheimer. Professor Westheimer (BSc '48), science graduate of the University, also studied violin at the Conservatorium before leaving for what has proved to be a distinguished career overseas. Now Professor of the Graduate School Division of Neurobiology at Berkeley, California, he has over the years amassed the Westheimer Instrument Collection. He recently advised his intention to donate the collection - consisting of string instruments and recorders - to the Conservatorium over a period of time and the Bernadel is the first instalment. It arrived in the country under unusual circumstances. Hideki Isoda, Associate Dean (T echnology and Distance Learning) at the Conservatorium, took custody of the precious instrument on a return trip from Sydney to the US, but did not return as scheduled, having been on board the Qantas 747 that famously aborted its take-off from Los Angeles after blowing three tyres on the runway. Isoda reported that he kept the violin with him at all times during the enforced overnight stay in Los Angeles. A spokesperson for the Conservatorium says of the Westheimer Collection: \"We thank Professor Westheimer sincerely for his thoughtfulness in identifying the Sydney Conservatorium of Music as the recipient of this exceptional gift of instruments, library and financial contribution for the ongoing maintenance, in perpetuity, of the collection. It promises to ensure enormous benefits to future student generations. We also thank Mr Matt Hall, Mr John Semmler and the University of Sydney USA Foundation for their assistance with administration in the USA.\" Bernadel and student Christina MorrisHideki and Bernadel's excellent adventure nbBreast health: a new era for Chinese-Australian women According to Dr Cannas Kwok, Cancer Institute of NSW Research Fellow in the University's Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, cultural difference can be a health hazard to Chinese-Australian women. \"Culturally, they are worried to talk about breasts and breast health,\" Dr Kwok says. \"And there is a misconception that breast cancer is only a disease of Caucasian women.\" Language barriers also work against the women, whether elderly or new migrants: health publications and leaflets are most likely to be written in English and also feature illustrations of Western women. For these reasons a \"culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate\" breast health promotion program: \"Living with healthy breasts - to be a breast health advocate \" was trialled in Sydney's Chinatown recently among 37 women. This, the first such program in Australia, aims to develop and evaluate a system of community advocates who can more easily reach the women to raise awareness of breast health, breast cancer screening practices and early detection. There were four sessions on the day, covering issues of breast health, breast screening and the cultural misconceptions and myths about breast cancer. The last two sessions gave specific training on how to communicate the information. The advocates were also given a kit containing information in CD format and brochures about breast cancer and its early detection. \"We encouraged them to talk to friends, work colleagues and family about what they had learned,\" says Dr Kwok, who lost her own mother to breast cancer when she was just 15. \"We were hoping this is the way to get the information into the community.\" A follow-up day, six weeks later, aimed to consolidate the women's knowledge and find out about the community response and how the information kit had been used. \"More than half the original participants attended the follow-up session,\" Dr Kwok says. \"In the focus group discussion we encouraged women to share their experience on spreading the information. They said they now have more confidence and initiative to talk to other Chinese women about the topic. All of them express the urgent need for this kind of program: not only breast cancer but also other women's health concerns, like pap smears.\" Given the program's success and the community's response, Dr Kwok says her team is planning to take it to Chinese communities in different parts of Australia.

As SAM goes to press, however, it is still between five shortlisted authors: Rodney Hall and Alex Miller (each has won twice before), Steven Carroll and Gail Jones (each nominated three times in the past) and Miles Franklin debutant David Brooks, co-editor of Southerly magazine and the director of the University's graduate writing program. His novel is The Fern Tattoo, published by UQP at $32.95 and win or lose, it is an enthralling, demanding and beautifully written book. 8 SAM Winter 08they are symbolic of surmounting the obstacles that people face.\" Partner organisation Save the Rhino is assisting in the logistics of the trip but Watson is anxious for people to know that the challenge has been set up so that all administrative and expedition costs, including flights and other related expenses, are covered by each of the participants. \"This means that all of the donations will go directly to the three organisations in Africa and not one cent of any donation will go to 3P3W or Save the Rhino administration.\" So far, 3P3W has raised close to $400,000 for the people of Africa. Lucinda Watson hopes the 2009 team will double the figure with this expedition. For more information, visit www.3peaks3weeks.org or contact Lucinda Watson: lucewatson@yahoo.com.au When Lucinda Watson (BA Hons '00 MIL '02) was six weeks old, her family left Australia for Malindi on the north coast of Kenya. \"My father was involved in an Australian Aid project focused on dry-land farming to help the Giriama people in becoming self-sufficient in food production,\" Watson explains, adding that although she spent only her first three years of life in the country, the memories are vivid, if a little odd. \"I remember quite a lot, especially dancing feet and knees. They were at my height, I suppose. And I'll ask my mother about a flashback of something and she'll explain what it was.\" The experience was profound because with her father out in the field and her mother in and out of hospital in Nairobi, some 800 kilometres away, Watson was left in the care of Kenyan nannies (ayahs) and soon spoke Swahili as well as any three-year-old. Now she's returning to East Africa for a special purpose. \"I want to give something back,\" she explains of her involvement in the 3 Peaks 3 Weeks Challenge (3P3W). \"It's an expedition to raise money for, and awareness of, the three key problems currently facing Africa: environment, health and education. The funds will go to three grassroots organisations in Kenya and T anzania: Support for International Change, the School of St Jude and the Laikipia Wildlife Forum.\" The challenge will take her to the summits of Mt Kenya (5199 metres), Mt Meru (4566 metres) and Mt Kilimanjaro (5895 metres), all within a magic three weeks. \"It's very much a team event,\" says Watson. \"And I am just one of 14 women from around the world and one of five women from Australia picked to take it on.\" This group is the second after the initial - successful - expedition in 2007, now the subject of a documentary that was judged Best Adventure Film at the Boulder Film Festival in Colorado in February .

She is working in Canberra at the Department of Defence but wants to contribute to what she calls \"noticeable change and benefit in countries that really need it\". Watson is not a mountaineer as such, although she has climbed Mt Kosciuszko (2228m) more times than is sensible. \"I do understand it's nothing like the mountains we're preparing to climb!\" she says. \"Climbing the mountains is not about the peaks.

Who is he? What made him the person he is? Gavin Brown was born in Lundin Links, a small village on the east coast of Scotland, as is immediately evident in his distinctive burr. \"It's good not to lose your accent,\" he says. \"I think it means being at ease in one's own skin.\" Despite its name and the proximity of surrounding golf links, including the most famous of all, St Andrews, Brown was never a golfer. When he was growing up, more so than today, it was a game for the wealthy or upper crust.interview A distinctive profile Professor Gavin Brown AO FAA CorrFRSE retires from the Vice-Chancellorship of the University after eleven years and talks to Diana Simmonds about his life, loves and beliefs11 SAM Winter 08\"It's a strong farming area,\" he says of the windswept region. \"I remember sea fogs, rain and snow. My father was a bricklayer and the weather meant he could be laid off work at any time. Then he would take casual work shovelling snow.\" Famously, Brown is a passionate and prize-winning mathematician. It was a youthful pursuit, although not for the most obvious reasons. \"I didn't choose maths to be successful; I was pretty evenly talented across the board. But I was an only child and spent a lot of time off school because of bronchitis, and those factors tend to assist a mathematical interest.\" But is it true that, as a nine-year-old, he was banned from family Scrabble, was solving crosswords in the local paper and nowadays his half-hour lunchbreak relaxation is doing The Australian crossword? He chuckles and shifts awkwardly in his seat. \"Ay, well I was eight when I started compiling crosswords.\" (This is said with a twinkle.) \"And I was taught you had to be fair to the others in Scrabble. I still enjoy compiling crosswords, when I have the time.\" After primary school, Brown was awarded a scholarship to Madras College, St Andrews, a school founded by a mathematician (the Rev Dr Andrew Bell) and housed in buildings reminiscent of the University's sandstone. He finished as Science Dux and received a Harkness Scholarship to St Andrews University, immediately entering the second year mathematics class. He graduated with first-class honours and the Duncan Medal. Post-graduate work took him over the border to Newcastle-upon-T yne where his PhD thesis was titled Norm and stability properties of semi-algebras. His career maintained its upward trajectory: Edinburgh, Liverpool, Illinois, Seattle, then the big (geographic) move: the Chair of Pure Mathematics and ultimately the Deanship in Science at UNSW. T o a mathematical illiterate the discipline seems unfathomable, but Brown offers an explanation that is at once surprising and immediately comprehensible. \"Creating mathematics is very pleasing,\" he says. \"In any creative act there is discovery. The world is there: you're highlighting that.\" And that immediately brings to mind Jackson Pollock and the fractal geometry detected and quantified in his paintings: suddenly maths is looking pretty exciting and even possible. The twinkle re-emerges and he nods. \"I believe it is very creative. Creating maths is actually to make oneself vulnerable - a flowerchild!\" Not that everything about maths makes Professor Brown twinkle: did he see Copenhagen (Michael Frayn's hit play about two famous mathematicians.)? \"I did, I enjoyed it, but frankly it was a bit long-winded. I'm a great fan of Michael Frayn but I think his books are better.\" He has another interesting reason for his early enthusiasm for maths: \"The absolute truths of solving a problem. Authority comes into it when you have the possibility of more than one correct answer, in other subjects, that is. And by that I mean the authority of the teacher. So it was an objective satisfaction, not an emotional satisfaction. I abhor absolutism, by the way.\" In 1992 Brown's next move was to the University of Adelaide and the post of Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research). T wo years later he became Vice-Chancellor and began the process of management restructure, going out to industry and returning the institution's budget to surplus. It was good practice for 1 July 1996 when he became Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Sydney. It was a challenging move. \"Put it this way: I was aware that there were levers that allow you to do things that might come off in your hands. But I discovered there were no levers. It was a bit worse than I imagined.\" Honour board at Madras College Retrospectively Brown has noted: \"It had lost track of enrolment processes ... I had to pay back millions of dollars to government for under-enrolment in my predecessor's time. The University no longer attracted the best students in the state and research performance had slipped ... we were a poor fourth in the nation and behind UNSW in Sydney. In 1993 Sydney failed to be placed in the top band of the national quality audit.\" Brown was not daunted, or if he was, it was not apparent. He is philosophical and wry amusement is evident when he says, \"Universities are enormously persistent things. They evolve. They appear to be very slow moving but they're complex things. They must be hugely adaptive because they persist! But it's difficult to understand the changes while part of them.\" Those changes are spectacular. Over the past six years the University has led competitive research grants nationwide; in the latest round of Australian Research Council grants it won 66 per cent more than Melbourne and in the Discovery scheme (basic research) it gained more than Sydney's other four universities combined. Moreover, the extensive building work to be seen around the campuses is the result of reinvestment from the University's consistent operating surplus, the largest of any Australian university. In more human terms, for the past three years the University has been designated a preferred employer of women. It seems indicative of the present buoyant, go-ahead atmosphere, a significant change from hidebound attitudes that prevailed. \"It's because he was very influenced by the women in his family when he was young,\" says his second wife, University administrator Dian\u00e9 Ranck. \"He really likes women and he gets on well with them.\" (He has two adult children with his first wife, Barbara, who died in 2001.) Professor Brown is characteristically objective and modest about the changes. \"It's about balance,\" he says. \"In the past 30 years universities have moved from government funding to a more commercial place in the world. The mindset is part business and part romantic ideal: it's about balance.\" So how does the reticent academic cope with such an intensely involved, public position? \"I certainly find two different personalities are required for the job. I need a carapace to do some of the things I have to do. Sometimes I crave the simple life - monasteries. But the other side of that is one could tip over into over excitement at garnering the resources to do wonderful things, then forgetting to do them. Again it's balance. You have to preserve the high ideals and yet be thoroughly businesslike.\" Part of Brown's quest for balance comes from sport: \"I enjoy almost any spectator sport, although I tend to identify more with the coach than the players these days!\" He is touched that the new cricket pavilion has been named in his honour and in recognition of his support of the University's highly successful sporting culture. \"It was very generous of them. I love to watch cricket but I do have traditionalist inhibitions. I've acclimatised to one-day cricket, but 20/20 ...\" he sighs gustily. \"Y ou do have to modify playing codes, but not all rule changes are made to improve the games, as we know.\" Aside from watching ball games and solving impossible numbers problems, his main relaxation is horse racing. He goes whenever he can and, according to Ranck, \"is absolutely content to be dropped off at the racecourse on a Saturday afternoon. He's a serious punter.\" She bought him a share in a racehorse as a birthday present and he has a membership at Kembla Grange and the AJC. \"When I was a boy we used to go to the point-to-points,\" he says of 12 SAM Winter 08prone to wanting to own these things it interferes. What turns me on is helping to make sure there are outcomes.\" He has been described as a dutiful man with high moral standards. Does he recognise those traits? Again, he shifts in his seat and chuckles. \"I don't know about 'moral standards'. I would say I believe in aspiring to high standards. The reward is in the outcome.\" The rewards have come in the form of the wide-ranging successes of the University over the past decade and the honours he has been awarded as a consequence. In the Australia Day honours of 2006 he was appointed an Officer in the Order of Australia; and in 2007, possibly the most cherished of all, he was appointed a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (an accolade from one of the most eminent scientific bodies in the world). What if anything, then, is Gavin Brown tipping for the future of Australian higher education? \"I think the so-called 'soft skills' are going to be recognised as important once again. If you're going to be an engineer, learning more about human relations through the Classics is going to make you a the cross-country events for amateur jockeys and thoroughbred horses so popular in rural Britain. \"It's called the sport of kings but it is a demotic pastime: anyone can watch or take part as a punter and I love the romance of it - the racing silks, the colour. It's tremendously exciting in a transplanted Damon Runyon way.\" Although he owns \"a nostril in a not very good horse, but it has been great fun\", he will become more seriously involved - with a larger chunk of a better horse, perhaps - when he stands down. \"I don't pretend to discern very much by the conformation of the horse,\" he warns. \"I like to study the fluctuations of the betting market when I have time and I have a good memory for trainers: their psychology. But I'm sure you realise the worst possible tipsters are owners.\" Horses are not the only objects of Brown's betting nature. He is well known for picking a human/horse and giving him or her their head to achieve whatever needs to be done. \"It's what sustains me,\" he says. \"I'm interested in the outcomes we can achieve, the objective outcomes for the greater good. I'm not interested in owning the outcomes. If you are more successful engineer.\" In 2000 Professor Brown wrote a paper warning of the looming skills shortage in Australia because of what he saw as the failure to invest in education. Now this prediction can be seen as unfortunately prescient. Does he see a solution? He laughs, but this time there is no twinkle. \"There is no solution aside from investing in education, which is what I said then and is no less true now. It would be desperate if we had no capacity to invest but we have: the mineral resources boom means there is money there. It requires the will of government to do it. I think the real mistake is pursuing any ideology to its stark end. Balance is all.\" SAM A tribute: Professor Gavin Brown Professor Gavin Brown retires from the role of Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Sydney on 10 July. A tribute website will celebrate the history and achievements of Professor Brown during his term as Vice-Chancellor. The online tribute is available from 1 June to 31 July at www.usyd.edu.au/senate/vice_chancellor_tribute.html \"What turns me on is helping to make sure there are outcomes.\"13 SAM Winter 08The former Chancellor, the Hon Kim Santow AO, died on April 10 following a short illness. He was 67. Kim Santow was a much-admired judge in the NSW Supreme Court from 1993 to 2007 and was Chancellor of the University from October 2001 to May 2007. In a speech honouring Justice Santow's career, Chief Justice Jim Spigelman said: \"Throughout your career your Honour continued to serve the community in numerous capacities, particularly in education and the arts. Perhaps your most distinguished contribution was your period as Chancellor of the University of Sydney. All of us on the court came to admire your extraordinary capacity to continue with the full burden of an appellate judge as well as discharging the office of Chancellor ... achievable by redirecting your entitlement to leave from the court to the tasks of the University.\" Kim Santow was named after his Hungarian emigre father, who became a general surgeon and obstetrician in his adopted country. Kim was educated at the Friends' School, Hobart, Sydney Grammar and the University of Sydney, gaining an arts degree, a master of laws with first-class honours and a rowing blue. He was admitted as a solicitor in NSW in 1964 and joined Freehill Hollingdale & Page, in 1965 becoming the firm's youngest partner. While powering the expansion of Freehills he also lectured at the University and at the University of NSW. He made his mark in corporate law and was only the second solicitor to sit on the NSW Supreme Court bench. His Sydney Morning Herald obituarist, T ony Stephens, wrote of his \"ability to combine powerful intellect with genuine humility ... uncommon in the law. Sir William Deane, Sir Gerard Brennan and Justice Murray Gleeson have shown it. So too did Justice Santow.\" Among the many notable cases on which Justice Santow worked were the demutualisation of the NRMA, James Hardie (asbestos) and the action against the directors of HIH. He was the author of more judgments reported in Australian Corporations and Securities Reports than any other judge in Australia. As Chief Justice Spigelman noted in his valedictory address: \"Many of these judgments called for the exercise of discretions and an understanding of the need to reconcile different interests in a practical and positive way ...\" That observation could easily have been a reference to Justice Santow's appointment as Chancellor of the University. It came at a moment of great turbulence in the University's history and he was a conscientious, tireless and calming presence at that critical time. Vice-Chancellor Professor Gavin Brown said: \"It is sad to lose someone who has achieved so much and had so much more to offer. He completed a period of distinguished service as Chancellor last year, and his ongoing contribution to higher education will be deeply missed.\" At various times Justice Santow was a visiting scholar at Harvard and Cornell universities and at Lincoln's Inn, London. He was a director of a number of companies and a member of many government and other committees. He was on the board of the Bundanon T rust, the Art Gallery of NSW, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney Grammar School and the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children. In the June 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Kim Santow was made an Officer in the Order of Australia for services to the judiciary and the law, to education governance and to the arts. In March 2007 he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University. Kim Santow is survived by his wife, Lee (Frankel), their sons, Simon, William and Edward, and their families. A memorial ceremony was held by the University in the Great Hall on April 23 with more than 600 alumni and guests gathered to honour his memory. SAMobituaryAn Appreciation Geza Francis Kim Santow 1941 - 2008 14 SAM Winter 08 section header r Advance Australia ... where? How? Why? The challenges facing Australia beyond 2020 are already on the drawing boards and in the research programs at the University of Sydney. Chris Rodley and Helen McKenzie report15 SAM Winter 08cover storyThere goes the neighbourhood By Chris Rodley At the University's Laboratory for Sustainable T echnology in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, a team of researchers is growing a crop of alfalfa that conceals a remarkable secret: each plant contains 10 per cent of its own weight in gold. The ingenious process by which plants extract metals from the soil is known as phytomining and it has the potential to change the face of Australia's multibillion-dollar mining industry. In the future, farmers could grow a crop of wheat on gold-producing soil and water it with a special chemical that makes the plant absorb the metal and store it in their leaves as nanoparticles. The wheat could then be harvested to produce renewable energy, leaving behind ash that is rich in gold. \"Mining has a poor track record on environmental performance, but with this idea, the mine of the future could be indistinguishable from a farmer's field,\" says Dr Andrew Harris, who heads the interdisciplinary research laboratory. He is one of a number of researchers at the University who believe Australia must change its thinking on environmental issues and adopt radical new approaches to conventional processes. Our priority, he says, is to rethink the way we use natural resources: we are currently using far more than the planet can afford. According to Dr Harris, part of the solution to this critical problem is to supply resources and energy on a local scale rather than using large, centralised factories, which are unsustainable. \"So instead of a large, coal-fired power station for a city, there would be a whole collection of little power stations supplying power for a household or collection of buildings,\" he explains. In co-operation with the Bioregional Development Group, a British charity, he is pioneering a number of these local-scale supply projects, including a sustainable paper mill that produces a much smaller volume of paper than conventional facilities and uses straw and agricultural waste rather than woodchips. The technology holds exciting promise as an alternative to logging trees for pulp and is being commercialised in Britain, China, India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, in the School of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Maschmeyer (BSc (Hons) '91, PhD '95) also believes that pursuing innovative technological solutions to resource and energy challenges is a top environmental priority for Australia. \"Science and engineering give the primary means to enable societal changes because they develop the new tools,\" says the Federation Fellow. He is working on a range of breakthrough sustainable energy projects based on advanced methods of catalysis, including a novel method of producing hydrogen using water and sunlight and a biofuel project that involves treating green waste and then separating and fermenting its sugars to form ethanol, a renewable fuel source. Working with teams from Macquarie University and the University of NSW, his group recently won a Federal Government grant to build the infrastructure to make the ethanol process a commercial reality. Another environmental issue where Australia urgently needs to begin adopting creative solutions is our management of rivers, according to Dr Melissa Neave, a geographer in the School of Geosciences. She has been working with a team from the University of Canberra on the Sustainable Rivers Audit, a program of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission that aims to provide a snapshot of the health of the entire Murray-Darling river system. Dr Neave's research has made her passionate about the need for governments to act on the numerous problems facing this vital basin, which covers one-seventh of the nation's land mass. One key issue she highlights is the amount of water being taken out of the river system by irrigated farming. The reduction in water levels due to irrigation is threatening the wildlife that needs the system to 16 SAM Winter 08survive, she says, arguing that we must move quickly to develop more water-efficient agricultural methods. Another problem is that the dams built throughout the basin have made water flows much more regular, which is devastating to aquatic organisms that have evolved to live in rivers that cycle between high and low levels. T o tackle this, she says, it is imperative that we find more effective ways to use environmental flows - releases of water from dams that coincide with ecological triggers - to support plant and animal life in the river. \"We have a strange disconnect in Australia: we realise that we need water to survive, but we are not investing much energy in trying to understand our rivers or the problems they face,\" she says. One other area where Australia needs to adopt a radical new mindset, according to researchers, is the time-scale in which we operate: we must start thinking about environmental issues from a long-term perspective rather than that of a three- or four-year election cycle. The need for long-term planning is seen most starkly in the issue of rising sea levels, the area of expertise of Dr Peter Cowell (PhD '83), from the Institute of Marine Science. Global warming is causing sea levels to rise across the world, but it is a particularly critical issue for Australia because most of our population lives by the sea. But while Dr Cowell says it is vital to slash our carbon emissions to minimise the extent of climate change, even if we pursue drastic reductions the world will keep warming because of inertia in ocean heat exchanges. Therefore, he argues, we must ensure we adapt appropriately to rising sea levels and the other impending effects of climate change. Dr Cowell is working on advanced forecasting methods that will allow authorities to draw up better planning guidelines for development along Australia's coastline. Our two biggest problems, he says, are erosion of coastal land and the increasing frequency of flooding in towns and suburbs on low-lying coastal plains. Both could cause widespread devastation because of the amount of housing and infrastructure already situated in vulnerable areas and the rapid expansion of development as our population grows. \"The climate change time-scale is longer than 2020, but we will be very much affected by decisions we make now and up to 2020,\" he says. \"We have to be planning for many, many decades ahead, or we will wreck the economy and quality of life of future generations.\" Dr Meilssa Neave (top, photo by Paul Wright) and Dr Andrew Harris Overweight and over here By Helen McKenzie \"Whenever I go to museums and exhibitions I'm always on the lookout for overweight figures in prehistoric drawings,\" says Professor Jennie Brand-Miller of the University's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, an internationally renowned nutritionist and author. \"There are some. They were there. There were overweight people. So obesity has been there right through prehistoric times. There is a thought that fat women might have been venerated because they were thought to be more fertile. But actually research is now showing that obese women are less fertile. One of the products of the obesity epidemic is that overweight women find it hard to get pregnant.\" Moreover, she says, recent statistics suggest longevity is declining. Instead of maintaining the century-long trend of children outliving their parents, we are looking at a shorter life expectancy for the following generations. \"The thought that you might bury your children is awful but we are heading that way with smoking, drinking and being overweight,\" says Professor Brand-Miller, who also says that 50 per cent of adult women and 67 per cent of adult men in Australia are overweight or obese. The best tools to combat the obesity problem are well known: diet and exercise. Simple as the solutions may sound, Professor Brand-Miller knows that the lives many of us lead today do not foster best practice in either department. \"Even though I'm a nutritionist, I wouldn't argue that nutrition is the most important factor in the obesity epidemic,\" she says. \"I would actually argue that it is the increase in sedentariness. We watch more television and we work harder. \"When we get home I think we are physically and mentally exhausted. The thought of doing exercise is not appealing; we just want to sit on the lounge and absorb something intellectually unchallenging on TV . \"People say email is fattening: it's true. I used to go for a walk in the morning, take the dog, but now I've got my laptop at home, with emails accumulating. It's really tempting just to get going and get them out of the way.\" Professor Brand-Miller believes that employers have a case to answer in the balance of work and life. \"Employers have an obligation to their workers to give them opportunities to exercise. I throw much back on the employer. I feel that working hours have really eaten into people's leisure time activity.\" After inactivity, food choices are the most important factor in the obesity epidemic. \"Something in your brain that is really primitive is controlling your appetite. I think that the concept of whether foods satisfy you or not is really at 17 SAM Winter 08the crux of the obesity epidemic. We've made a mistake in trying to encourage people to eat low fat foods as these foods actually don't help people feel full.\" Professor Brand-Miller says our bodies have a reciprocal relationship with food. If you delete one food type, you must compensate with another. \"It is impossible to eat a low-sugar, low-fat diet: no one has that diet. A tiny, tiny fraction of people could manage it. The average person, if they cut out sugar, eats more saturated fats instead, or vice versa; that has been proven again and again.\" This is where the glycaemic index (GI) comes into the equation. Consuming foods that have a high GI makes people feel hungrier sooner, Professor Brand-Miller says. \"The high GI foods on offer are exceptional in what they do metabolically. They make your blood glucose go up high, they make your insulin go up high in ways that palaeolithic diets didn't. The foods we eat these days send you on a roller-coaster ride and make you feel hungry; people are often hungrier when they've eaten more. I really think obesity does come down to appetite, which is a very primitive instinct. In the past we could rely on it to keep us at the right weight; nowadays it doesn't.\" The recommended way to follow a low-GI diet is to exchange high-GI carbohydrates for low-GI carbohydrates. Put simply: ditch white (refined) breads and go for sourdough or wholegrain; pasta and noodles are OK and preferable to potatoes. Breakfast cereals containing oats, barley and bran are preferable to refined products, while basmati rice has the lowest GI in the rice family. And, of course, fresh fruit, vegetables and salad greens should not be overlooked. \"Nobody wants to be overweight,\" she says. \"Most people make an effort to not be overweight and yet are failing miserably. Often a professional says, 'to lose weight, exercise more and eat less'. I think that's a silly thing to say. It just makes for a very hungry individual. Especially to say 'eat less'. I think that sets up pathways in the brain that make you become preoccupied with food. \"There's lots of psychiatric research that says if you want people to become obsessive about something, tell them they can't have it! They quote the studies performed in prisons 50 years ago to see what happened when food given to prisoners was restricted. In one study, prisoners received 25 per cent less calories than they needed, and apparently the prisoners soon took down their pin-ups of nude women and put up pictures of food!\" Nevertheless, Professor Brand-Miller has some good news on the war against weight. \"Y ou don't have to lose a lot of weight to actually improve everything: to improve metabolism, your risk of diabetes, heart disease. Y ou only have to lose about 5 per cent of your body weight, which is not very much.\" Her advice is to \"lose weight very gradually in a sustainable way, with a healthy diet that you like, where you eat enough to make you feel satisfied but not overstuffed\". Possibly the best news for some is the response to her most frequently asked question: what is the GI of a glass of wine? \"Wine has a GI of zero,\" she says. \"We did a study where we accompanied the meal with one or two drinks and we actually found that it was better to have alcohol. It lowered the blood sugar response to the meal, especially if it was a drink you had one hour before the meal. \"Alcohol has a very complex relationship with health. It does appear that one drink or one-and-a-half drinks a day is good for people. Maybe one of the reasons it is good for you is that it lowers the blood sugar response to the meal.\" Nonetheless, it's not a green light for alcopop excess. Booze and drugs - the cringe culture By Helen McKenzie Close examination of Australia's excessive alcohol and drug-taking habits has been a feature of the first half of 2008. Dr Kate Conigrave (PhD '98), FAFPHM, FAChAM, of the University's School of Public Health, is happy that the topic is in the national focus. \"It is good that alcohol has been so placed in the public eye because there has been a normalisation of heavy drinking, particularly amongst young people, resulting in very real physical and emotional problems,\" she says. \"The normalisation of alcohol needs challenging.\" Dr Conigrave contends that our society is accepting of excessive drinking, when the statistics suggest there is no room for complacency: \"Sixty per cent of our late teenagers/early adults are putting themselves at risk. The most obvious outcome is death. We are losing young men in road accidents because of alcohol; a tragic loss of life in its \"It is impossible to eat a low-sugar, low-fat diet: no one has that diet.\" Professor Jennie Brand-Miller, above. Photo by Paul Wright 18 SAM Winter 08after undergoing detoxification [supervised or unsupervised withdrawal],\" Dr Conigrave says. \"There is a far greater chance of success in avoiding heroin, and associated crime, illness and risk of overdose, if replacement opioid therapy is used. The patient receives a daily, usually supervised, dose of a long-acting opioid. This does not make them feel 'high' but relieves withdrawals and craving, enough to allow them to return to a productive life. Once stable, if the patient feels secure to avoid heroin, the prescribed opioid is gradually weaned off.\" Dr Conigrave says Aboriginal Australians are less likely to drink alcohol than other Australians. \"However, when we look at the known risk factors for alcohol dependence - unemployment, loss of sense of control, marginalisation, childhood separation or trauma - it is not surprising that some Aboriginal communities or individuals face significant problems. While the bad news stories most often attract attention, there have been many successes. Many Aboriginal communities have successfully avoided or tackled alcohol problems, often by creative combinations of supply control and community development measures. \"Some communities have chosen to become 'dry'; others have restricted access to take-away alcohol, particularly large-volume, inexpensive alcohol such as cask wine. Others have developed creative systems, such as the permit system that operates in certain Arnhem Land communities, where everyone, indigenous or non-indigenous, must hold a permit to access take-away alcohol. Any alcohol-related crime or violence means access to take-away alcohol is removed. Alcohol is recognised as a privilege and not a right.\" For Dr Conigrave and her department, the previous federal government's Summit on Drugs in 1999 gave rise to \"a strong conclusion that we as a society need to change our drinking habits\". She is now hopeful that thanks to closer ties between federal and state governments, the issue will become part of the national agenda.Dr Kate Conigrave Photo Paul Wright \"They know there is a high risk that their children will become involved in drinking in secret, unsafe settings such as parks.\"prime. But there are other outcomes for young people from excessive consumption of alcohol that are taking their toll, such as unwanted pregnancies and an increase in sexually transmitted diseases.\" Youth binge drinking, according to Dr Conigrave, \"is harder to tackle than, say, the drink-driving issue because you can't punish the offenders\". It is, however, possible to punish those who supply alcohol to under-age consumers or drinkers who have already overimbibed. The enforcement of laws on the responsible service of alcohol is one measure she says can be improved. \"Some licensed premises take great pains to uphold the law and there is good evidence that this really reduces problems. Other licensed premises make me angry because the publicans are looking after their profit over the welfare of our young people.\" Dr Conigrave says a cultural change is required. \"In some countries the young people dance until dawn and have a great time without alcohol. We need to be more creative in our approach to the problem. The training of peer leaders has had success and our sports people have a weighty responsibility to show you can be young, fit and handsome and don't need to get smashed after a game.\" Parents of teenagers face a challenging dilemma, she says. \"They know there is a high risk that their children will become involved in drinking in secret, unsafe settings such as parks. Sometimes parents take the view that a small amount of alcohol served under supervision in the home is preferable. Parents need to remember that this is against the law.\" It is not just the kids who are hitting the grog, Dr Conigrave says. The latest statistics show that one in 25 of us is dependent on alcohol (\"alcoholic\") and up to one in six drinks in a manner that places them at short- or long-term risk of harm. \"So alcohol dependence remains a common condition which is challenging to treat and has a huge impact on the individual and those around them,\" she says. \"Once dependent, it is a lifelong challenge for the individual to avoid relapse to drinking. Many members of the public underestimate the intensity of the biological drive to drink in established dependence.\" In recent years, help for those battling alcohol addiction has come in the form of new medications. \"The past decade has brought some new hope for those struggling to address their alcohol dependence. There is now a range of new medications available or under study which reduce the craving for alcohol. T raditional approaches to treatment such as psychotherapies and Alcoholics Anonymous remain very important and have been shown to be effective. However, these can now be supplemented with medications which help reduce the risk of relapse.\" Medical therapy is also the most successful treatment for heroin addiction. \"Only one in 10 heroin users can stay clean 19 SAM Winter 08 Education: The clever century By Chris Rodley Education in Australia is a perennial topic of debate on the airwaves and across the dinner tables of the nation. Often the discussion will focus on literacy and numeracy standards and how well we are teaching children the three Rs. But that is just one part of a much larger issue facing Australian education, according to leading researchers from the University of Sydney. They argue that our objectives as we approach 2020 must be much more ambitious and wide-ranging. \"We need to look at the nature of an active, successful and engaged citizen and worker in the society of the future and then ask what kinds of skills and knowledge would be good preparation to become such a citizen,\" says Professor Peter Freebody (BA (Hons) '73), a Professorial Research Fellow in the Faculty of Education and Social Work. One of the most important skills he believes children need to acquire is an awareness of their place in today's globalised world, where there is a much faster flow of people, ideas and money. \"That means kids need to understand other cultures much more than we do now, and this in turn means learning the history and culture and even the art and literature of other countries,\" he says. \"When we teach Australian history, we need to help students connect what they learn about this country to their global understanding of the world.\" Providing students with this kind of awareness will involve extensive changes to the content of curriculums and the way classes are taught, he says. But the pay-off will be a generation that has a much better understanding of complex international problems such as global warming and terrorism and is better able to participate in finding solutions. \"World-mindedness needs to be an overall part of educational practice if we want people to contribute to a more peaceful and sustainable world,\" Professor Freebody says. T o be better prepared for the future, our children also need to acquire the technology-based skills that will be important in the 21st century workplace, according to Professor Peter Reimann, co-director of the Centre for Research on Computer-Based Learning and Cognition. One such skill is being able to collaborate in virtual teams, he says, while another is being able to engage with the complex systems that surround us in contemporary life, from traffic systems to the economy. T o fill the gap, he is developing new software programs that give school students the opportunity to work together on projects in virtual teams and enable them to manage complex systems, such as the running of a national park. T o teach these technology-based skills, all schools will need to have the right equipment. For that reason, Professor Reimann supports the Federal Government's promise to provide laptops to every senior high school student in Australia, pointing out that these will be vital to provide the comprehensive training and resources to teachers. An exciting side benefit of using portable computers, he adds, is that students will be able to move outside the classroom and into areas such as parks or museums where they can learn more informally. In creating an education system that equips students for the future, we also need to focus on students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Research suggests that giving these students a proper head start in life may be the most urgent task facing education in Australia today. \"Studies show us that if you come from a socially disadvantaged background, schooling in Australia is less likely to serve you well than it is in other similar countries,\" says the education scholar Associate Professor Debra Hayes (BSc '82), whose research has focused on schools in hard-to-staff regional and outer suburban areas with low retention and high suspension rates. She has found that many of the problems facing these schools can be attributed to the way they are resourced: teachers and leaders are often inexperienced and many stay at the school for only a short time. \"We would not expect a hospital staffed by new medical graduates with limited or no access to specialists to function well,\" she says, \"so we need to find ways to give experienced teachers and leaders incentives to go to these schools and stay there for the longer term.\" As well as strengthening teaching in such schools, we need to support socially disadvantaged students and their families, says Louise Lawler, a University of Sydney researcher based in the Faculty of Medicine. For three years Ms Lawler has been pioneering an innovative program for indigenous and non-indigenous high school students in regional areas of NSW where many families are chronically unemployed or underemployed. Her approach is based on the premise that we need to do more to stop students dropping out of school and becoming unemployed. It involves year 10 students pledging that they will use the final years of school to achieve success by either finishing year 12 or getting a job. T o help them keep the promise they receive assistance such as work experience opportunities and support for their families. The success of the program so far has been remarkable: in 2006, 326 year 10 students at Dubbo College signed the pledge and all but one were still in school or had a job by the following year. Ms Lawler is now set to extend the program to six regional towns in NSW thanks to a $1 million Federal Government grant, and the Prime Minister has asked her to consider making the program even bigger. \"I believe we need to move closer to the world of young people in order to help them,\" she says. \"Adults are separating from young people in society, whereas we need to be coming together to help deal with problems which society is creating.\" SAM\"... kids need to understand other cultures much more than we do now ...\" Professor Peter Reimann.

Faculty of Economics and Business www.econ.usyd.edu.au New courses for 2009: Master of Management Master of Marketing Graduate Certicate in International SecurityFor further information: Lowry (BV Arts '99) won the $100,000 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, the country's richest portrait prize, with What I assume you shall assume. It's an unsettling image: a naked figure of the artist confronting the viewer against the backdrop of Belanglo State Forest. But Lowry says she is \"just putting things together and seeing what happens\". Born in Sydney, Lowry grew up in Bondi Junction and the Sunshine Coast. Her parents gave her an appreciation of art and Lowry's mother wrote poetry. She gave little thought to doing anything else, heading straight to art school from high school. She dropped out a few times but eventually completed her Bachelor of Visual Arts, majoring in painting. She started exhibiting and was picked up by Gallery Barry Keldoulis in Sydney. Much of Lowry's work has been based on contemporary crime scenes, such as Belanglo State Forest, the site of the \"backpacker murders\", south of Sydney. She is interested in how fear manifests itself and in paranoia of the landscape. \"I initially started painting the crime scenes,\" she says. \"I was interested in how those places became affected and infected by what had gone on inside of them, so you couldn't see them for what they were any more.\" Lowry tries to manipulate that idea, evoking the melancholy of places, but says the crime aspect tends to overwhelm other meanings. She initially painted just the crime scenes and then began adding figures. This created ambiguous views, spaces where the viewer could imagine what was going on, drawing on their own experiences. Before making the painting she entered in the Moran, Lowry's figures had always been depicted from behind, making the figure anonymous and placing the viewer in the position of voyeur. \"But in this one, I wanted the figure to look back at the viewer,\" she says. \"It's more of a confrontation, so there is some complicity with the viewer. It is somewhat ambiguous as the figure is possibly vulnerable.\" Although the figure depicted is the artist, it was not initially painted as a self-portrait, nor was it consciously about her, yet she says it is \"self-reflective\". \"It's about my own introspection and willingness to learn about a blind spot in my own thinking in regards to sexual play that involves dominance and submission,\" Lowry says. \"The figure in this painting is not vulnerable but more an active participant in these games.\"The fine mist quality of the airbrush technique Lowry uses gives the portrait a soft-focus, photographic character. Having not really concentrated on portraiture before, Lowry just happened to have completed the picture when entries for the Moran were called for. She realised that, unlike the venerable Archibald, the prize does not restrict entrants to well-known subjects. She saw that the prize had some interesting judges this year (the artist Ben Quilty and the former director of Queensland Art Gallery, Doug Hall AM) and thought that a more risky work might have a chance. Nevertheless, she was unaware she had won until she turned up to the press conference. Even though it is a substantial prize, Lowry is unassuming about what it may mean. \"It just feels a bit abstract. I'm feeling the pressure of my next solo show. A lot more people know my name but it's more about the next work you make.\" Lowry recently completed a Ned Kelly trip through Victoria and her forthcoming work will look at the colonial period and bushrangers, tapping into the mythology of the fearful landscape. Into the spotlight This year, artists from Sydney College of the Arts were honoured in two major prizes. Fiona Lowry and Vilma Bader talk to Marie Jacobs Fiona Lowry (right) photo Paul Wright21 SAM Winter 08 22 SAM Winter 08 Vilma Bader, currently a Masters student at Sydney College of the Arts, has had an installation selected and hung in the Sulman Prize at the Art Gallery of NSW. The Sulman is awarded to the best subject painting, genre painting or mural project by an Australian artist. Bader's work is an installation of 63 paintings of book covers, all Australian literary classics. The work seems to measure the impact of literature on our contemporary culture, with individual paintings representing life-size books. It took her a mentally and physically exhausting three months to complete. Literature has been a big influence in Bader's life. Coming from an academic family and being surrounded by books, she initially wanted to become a writer. While living in Germany, however, she experienced an epiphany. \"Because I didn't speak the language, I spent a lot of time in galleries. That's when I decided I wanted to do art - I understood that art transcends everything,\" she explains. It was a defining moment when Bader, who grew up in Mauritius, came face to face with a self-portrait by Albrecht Durer, where the artist merges his features with those of God. \"I was transfixed by it. When I was looking at it, I forgot about the paint. That's when I decided I wanted to become a painter.\" Back in Australia, Bader enrolled at the National Art School, graduating with distinction. Then she realised that her art was taking another direction and becoming more conceptual: \"Pushing paint was not enough\". She decided to study at Sydney College of the Arts. Her major influences are museums, and she makes archives and inventories by working in series, driven by an urge to collect items associated with memory and time, to categorise and order the world. Another aspect of Bader's work is its contemplation of representation in terms of simulacrum and similitude. She explains that with her Sulman work, because she painted the edge of the painting to represent the spine of the book, it \"looks like a book but it is not a book: it is a simulacrum\". In this it is similar to Rene Magritte's painting with a pipe, The Treachery of Images. With similitude, \"the books all look the same; they are similar but they are all different\". She describes her work as suggesting multiple narratives, such as a library, a link between literature and art or politics and art. Bader is also interested in identity and she says this work suggests the openness of the question of Australian identity. Being a finalist in the Sulman was a significant achievement for Bader as very few students' works make it onto the walls in these prize shows. \"I only wanted my work to be out there when I was 100 per cent sure about it ... midway through last year I realised I was making art and it was a wonderful feeling.\" SAMart Vilma Bader Photo Paul Wright To register your interest: Click on the link at www.usyd.edu.au/spring_back and enter your details, or call +61 2 9036 927823 SAM Winter 08If the first step along the path to redemption is to confess, here goes: I am a clipper. Not in the toenails or sailing ships sense, but newspapers. I confess to being a butcher of broadsheets. I read a newspaper with a pair of eyes and a pair of scissors, ready to snip items of interest. T o celebrate my recent birthday, some friends presented me with a gigantic pair of scissors, the length of a golf club, and a card inscribed: \"Here's to 40 more wonderful years of clipping.\" I was overwhelmed. And nearly decapitated. I chop up newspapers because I love them. I find their daily array of news, knowledge, opinion and trivia mesmerising. Newspapers - the good ones, at least - satiate a hunger for information I want to keep. They were invented for people curious about the world. Or maybe for people with curious snipping tendencies. Naturally, my clippings match my interests: history, particularly ancient; politics, with the Kennedy brothers and Gough Whitlam special favourites; leadership and speechmaking; Formula One motor racing and the Sea Eagles rugby league team; classical literature; the High Court of Australia (a hangover from my days as a law student); the films of Orson Welles (another hangover from days when I should have been concentrating on being a law student); the novels of Graham Greene; the life of T .E. Lawrence; and Shakespeare, most especially Shakespeare. I have a Bard habit. Folders upon scrapbooks of clippings about the Bard: reviews of productions, debates about how he's taught in schools, his prominence in Australia, controversies over the authorship, the use of his expressions in modern communication, opinions on his legacy, the thoughts of great practitioners. Much ado about everything. I use the clippings as research for my own writing, to update or add to information I've already gathered, or just to re-read later. If nothing else, it makes me popular for trivia nights. The clippings go inside books, plastic sleeves and lever arch folders. Silverfish don't get a look in. Lest the reader think I have a second mortgage to house all this material, it takes up surprisingly little space. Neither of my children has given up their room to cater for daddy's \"habit\". And I do regularly cull: it not only reduces the fire hazard but also keeps the quantity down to a manageable vastness. Perhaps the most obvious evidence of my proclivity is the trail of dark newsprint finger smudges on doorknobs and light switches around the house. A review of the new film version of Sleuth, starring Michael Caine and Jude Law, is slipped into a book about the movies of Laurence Olivier, who starred in the original, with a younger Michael Caine, 36 years ago. The special souvenir lift-out covering Kevin Rudd's \"sorry\" speech has been added to a folder on Australian politics, thickened in recent years with clippings on events such as the resignation of a governor-general and the centenary of Federation. Some things don't need clipping at all. The Australian Literary Review, inserted monthly in the national newspaper, is added to a folder of literary magazines. I like obituaries, too. They complete a life. Obituaries of subjects of interest find their way into relevant biographies on my bookshelves. A recent tribute to the life and career of the former Australian batsman and \"invincible\" Bill Brown was folded into a Who's Who of T est cricketers. The obituary of the last French veteran from World War I, who died in March aged 110, now rests in Les Carlyon's weighty tome on that subject. And portraits of the late actor for all seasons, Paul Scofield, the greatest King Lear of the 20th century, were greedily sought out, clipped and deposited between the covers of various books and theatrical programs. I went to the trouble of sourcing Scofield's obituary in English newspapers to ensure the right calibre of clipping. The serendipitous discovery of habits similar to mine is always a joy - and a relief. Hidden in my 1890 edition of Shakespeare's Richard III were pasted-in prints of famous actors in the title role cut from newspapers and magazines by a former owner. They include David Garrick, Edwin Forrest and Edwin Thomas Booth. Falling from the pages of a recently acquired second-hand reader's guide to books by and about T .E. Lawrence was a coloured postcard of the 1919 portrait of Lawrence by the artist Augustus John. For clippers, these are treasures akin to Howard Carter's uncovering of the tomb of T utankhamen but without the curse. Clearly, I missed my calling. I should have aspired to be an archivist when I enrolled at the University of Sydney rather than studying Economics/Law. Or built a career in waste management. Admittedly, once clipped, the bulk of the material isn't looked at again. But it's the possibility of needing it down the track for purposes unforeseen that motivates. One just never knows.

He might have retired from the University but his fiction life is blooming. The tone of Morris in Iceland is similar to the first novel: witty, erudite, sly and wildly imaginative and ambitious. Unlike many wildly imaginative and ambitious writers, however, he pulls off his literary leaps and verbal somersaults. The result is a book that sizzles with energy and amusement as well as drawing the reader into its deeper and more thoughtful places. The title refers, in part, to William Morris, the 19th century English designer and socialist visionary whose influence on wallpaper and homewares is possibly better known today than his poetry and other writing. How he might intersect with Bjork, reigning queen of Icelandic-global popular culture, is something the Inner West Creative Mime Atelier (a Sydney arts organisation, of course) dreams up. Further explanation of the quixotic plot of Morris in Iceland would be akin to catching at quicksilver: grab it and it's gone, or misrepresented, or grimly skewed towards logic when its very illogicality is what makes sense. Alex Jones has acquired many fans since Helen Garner and the Meaning of Everything and they will not be disappointed by this second novel.HEroES oF t obruk DAViD Mullig An SCHolAStiCA, $16.99 When David Mulligan's unusual telling of an otherwise familiar war story opens the main characters, Peter Fullerton and T ony Cantonelli, are best mates and just 16 years old. It is 1940 and the young Aussies are desperate to \"do their bit\" for the Empire. They give false names and lie about their ages to enlist. Soon they are in North Africa and in the thick of the reality of their adventure. Like his previous novel Angels of Kokoda, which told of the New Guinea campaign of WW2, Heroes of Tobruk is also novel aimed at a young readership; but there is plenty for more mature readers who may be interested in a historically accurate but lively and personal account of youthful Australians of the 1940s. Through devices such as Peter's diary entries the reader is also privy to insights into a soldier's mind that are chilling and authentic: no romance and empty heroics here. It also makes one think of the experiences of our forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and even East Timor - and how we fail them by not wanting to know what we blithely expect of them, without considering the consequences. When not writing, David Mulligan is actually David Morris (Mat Med '55) and a happy father and grandfather.PEoPlE oF tHE book gErAlDinE brookSHArPEr CollinS, $33Pb/$50Hb Journalist by trade and novelist by calling, Geraldine Brooks (BA '79, LLD Law '07) is a consummate storyteller and researcher. She seems to start from a basic journalistic premise: what if? She then sets out to answer the question through discovery and embellish the facts with her imagination where she finds no answers. It worked brilliantly in March (a Pulitzer Prize winner), where her \"what if?\" was \"what if the father of Little Women were the main subject?\" And she did much the same with the (real) village of Eyam in England, the setting of Year of Wonders. People of the Book are those who come into contact with the Sarajevo Haggadah, a small Jewish holy book originating in medieval Spain that ended up in modern Bosnia. Brooks's question was: how come this book found protectors across cultures, religions, wars and the centuries when countless other artefacts and treasures were destroyed? She came up with a character - a first-person narrator - Hanna, whose own story drives the novel. She is a book conservator charged with restoring the Haggadah and she anchors the narrative in the present while the story of the book ranges across Europe and the centuries. 25 SAM Winter 08luCy oSburn A lAD y DiSPlACED: FlorEnCE nigHting AlE'S EnV oy to AuStrAliA Dr JuDitH goDDEnuniVErSity oF SyDnEy PrESS $34.95 Dr Judith Godden's notable biography of Lucy Osburn has enjoyed popular and critical success.

At the time, Dr Godden, a University researcher, said: \"I really think Lucy Osburn should be a household name, and I hope this publicity will help her receive appreciation for the important role she has played in the history of Australian health.\" A brief biography explains why Dr Godden was so taken by the nursing pioneer: \"Lucy Osburn (1836-1891) the founder of modern lay nursing in Australia and friend of Henry Parkes, battled with surgeons, was vilified by the press, became the subject of a royal commission, was embroiled in a royal shooting and ultimately rejected by her heroine, Florence Nightingale.\" Lucy Osburn a Lady Displaced is available on demand from www .sup.usyd.edu.au/ and follow the prompts.louiS lAloy (1874-1944) on DEbuSS AnD StrAVinSky DEborAH ASHg AtE, $90 (PrE-rEAD CoPiES AVAilAblE A t www.AMAzon.CoM, PriCES VAry) Deborah Priest (BMus '77), an Honorary Research Associate at the Conservatorium of Music, has translated her original 1999 edition into French and slightly expanded it. It documents one of the key figures of 20th century French music and is a key to unlock that period and those working in it. There is no equivalent to Louis Laloy in the arts today. He was a critic and scholar and a close friend of Claude Debussy (whose first biography in French he wrote in 1909). He was writing at a time and in a place where music and art were in the throes of becoming \"modern\". His aesthetic ideals and understanding of the aims of the composers and painters in question (comparing Monet and Gauguin to Debussy) were crucial elements in their dissemination. He was a linguist (French, English, German, Russian, Italian, Greek, Latin and Mandarin Chinese) and an astute analyst of Rameau, Satie and Dukas as well as the major figures of the time: Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky. Cocteau, Gide, Colette, Breton and Rodin were among his friends. Despite his central position in the modern history of French arts and letters, there has been very little written about Laloy and Priest's book is an important one.SEE tHE Virgin blESt - tHE Virgin MAry in EngliSH PoEtry bArry SPurrPAlgrAVE MACMillAn, $69.95 A 30-year veteran of the University's English department, the author has been a beacon of hope in unpoetic times. (His admired Studying Poetry is now in a second edition.) The title of the book is apparently self-explanatory but conceals more than it reveals. Spurr explores the connections between visual representations of the Madonna and the poetry inspired by them, from Walsingham in Norfolk through The Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance, Michelangelo's Pieta to modernism and Wilde, Pound, Yeats and Eliot. The Christian root of English poetry is the impetus of the book and Spurr's critical study makes this plain through a wealth of material both orthodox and unexpected. His reading of Wilde's two sonnets, Wasted Days and its revision to Madonna Mia, is illuminating, while the section on Eliot's Ash Wednesday signals the subject of his promised next book, a study of Eliot's Anglo-Catholicism. See the Virgin Blest is scholarly yet accessible and fascinating for a wider readership with an interest in English poetry and history and the role of religions in both.

Held in the Great Hall in the presence of Chancellor Marie Bashir, Mr Stevens began a wide-ranging speech by recalling that the last time he had been in the Hall was for his graduation, or possibly an exam. \"Either way,\" he said, \"tonight's occasion is far more convivial.\" Mr Stevens explained that his speech, titled \"The Australian Economy, Then and Now\" was inspired by an old classmate's suggestion: \"That a good topic might be a comparison of the economy of the late 1970s, when we were students, with that of today.\" It was a good idea, he decided, because, \"In the moment-by-moment focus on the economic data, and all the wiggles and ticks up and down of this indicator or that, we can often neglect to stand back and look at the big picture.\" Mr Stevens' address (which may be read in full via the Reserve Bank website at this link: http://www.rba.gov.au/Speeches/2008/sp_gov_150508.pdf) was comprehensive and fulfilled his opening remarks. He defended the bank's long-held demand for a two to three per cent inflation target - adopted in 1993 and official government policy since 1996. \"It's easy to say why not raise the target,\" said Mr Stevens. \"That was the previous thinking of the 1970s. That's how we got 10 per cent inflation, it's too big a liability.\" Mr Stevens said, \"Inflation targeting is not perfect and, on occasion, still leaves policy makers with some quite difficult decisions to make,\" he said. \"It is, however, the best system that has been devised as yet ... \"Even with the recent surge in consumer prices taking the inflation rate to a bit over four per cent, things are not like they were in the 1970s.\" Then, the heavily regulated economy suffered poor productivity growth and sheltered behind high barriers to foreign competition. T oday it is much more open and productive and the contrast is striking. Now, said Mr Stevens, \"Australia needs to adapt to the rise of China. \"It's certainly a once-in-a-century economic event,\" he said. \"Unless something terribly destabilising occurs ... within a generation it's going to rival the large economies of the world. China is at this point over-heating and needs to slow down. Nothing short of a cataclysmic event will stop it growing quickly. What we've got to do as a country is be able to adapt to this.\" China's economic rise posed some environmental challenges, said Mr Stevens. \"Its demand for energy grows very quickly and its environmental problems are growing very quickly.\"T urning his focus to the USA Mr Stevens said, \"We're a long way from out of the woods, the US economy looks like it's having a slight recession.\" Nevertheless, the USA will continue to be an important international force in the years to come. Mr Stevens went on to say he believes there are moral hazards in central banks bailing out struggling financial institutions in the wake of the global credit crisis. \"It's an intervention without precedent,\" Mr Stevens said in relation to the US bank JPMorgan and the US Federal Reserve bailing out Bear Stearns. Nevertheless, Mr Stevens said Australia's strong fiscal position has given the federal government the capacity to respond to future uncertainty. \"There would be very few countries, if any, which would not envy Australia's fiscal position,\" Mr Stevens said. \"The capacity to respond, if need be, to developments in the future is virtually without peer. This seems light years from the situation in the late 1970s.\" At the end of his speech Mr Stevens responded to questions from guests and the media. As a result there was wide coverage in the following day's newspapers, television and radio news. The success of the occasion ensures that it will continue on an annual basis with a featured eminent alumnus speaker. It will help to build the Economics and Business alumni network and research network. SAM An invitation to ...

The day he faced the Japanese pilot who was credited with making the reconnaissance flight over Sydney to survey the harbour in preparation for attack by three mini submarines. Lascelles' meeting with the pilot came at the completion of an airstrip at the Kachu Mountain camp in Thailand. It was only weeks away from the end of the war. Lascelles had been a prisoner of war for almost three years, having survived the Burma railway and the bridge over the river Kwai. \"I thought: What the hell do I say to him?\" Lascelles recalls. \"I hadn't been used to conversation for a long while so I asked him 'How did you find Sydney?' And he said: 'It was fairyland: flying over at night with all the lights blazing; Mascot lit up; the bridge so bright'.\" Lascelles' experience of war was no fairy tale but it did teach him something about the engineering of aerodromes and bridges. A much more friendly familiarity with these structures was to come within six months of his return home in 1945 when, at the age of 28, he became the oldest undergraduate to study for a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at Sydney University (in that year). He was in good company since 49 of the 79 students who graduated were ex-servicemen. The youthful students who enrolled at university straight out of school cheekily called the ex-servicemen \"Dad\", but the mix of men produced a resilient esprit de corps that remains today. Every year without fail since graduation in 1950, and in spite of ever-diminishing numbers, the men meet to celebrate their achievements. Their reunion record remains unbroken and unbeaten by any other faculty. \"It was a Godsend to start university,\" continues Lascelles, now aged 90. \"I was so starved of intellect that I enjoyed it. Not using your brain for all those years, to suddenly have something to do, that was everything.\" Almost without exception, the 1950 graduates went on to impressive careers in vastly diverse areas. They built dams, roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, mines, steel works and power stations in Australia and elsewhere. A large number of the men joined the fledgling Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority and held roles of increasing responsibility for decades. One impressive graduate, Douglas Price, became the managing director of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation formed after the project was completed. When the earth-moving company Thiess Bros became the first Australian contractor awarded a major job on the Snowy project in 1958 - to build the T ooma Dam and T ooma-T umut T unnel - it was regarded as a turning point in the history of the Australian construction industry. Much of the credit for that contract belonged to one of the graduates: Ron Evans. He was the resourceful 29-year-old civil engineer who had persuaded his employers, Les and Stan Thiess, to allow him to prepare a bid for the project which, at the time, would have seemed well beyond the capacity of any Australian company. Thiess Bros broke the world record for hard-rock tunneling in 1960 and went on to more work building dams and driving tunnels through the main Kosciuszko range which diverted water from the Snowy River to the headwaters of the Murray. Another exceptional graduate, Pat Christie, started a company concerned with patents for the automated shearing of sheep and then built a highly successful production facility for the making of teabags. Jim Robson Scott started a large pre-stressed concrete business and in the process made all the pavers for the Opera House. Neville Chidgey had a distinguished career in the banking sector and was, for a time, the chairman of the University's Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering. A sprightly 83-year-old graduate, Beau McFee, says one of the most remarkable in the group was Brian Kelman, who took Australian Ready Mixed Concrete to England and Europe. \"I bumped into him in 1959 at Heathrow getting off an airplane,\" McFee explains. \"I said 'What are you doing here?' and he said: 'Oh, I've got 79 Ready Mixed Concrete plants in the United Kingdom and Europe'. He built RMC (UK) into a huge public company.\" T en years later he returned to Australia and became chief executive officer of CSR Limited. He negotiated the formation of Nabalco Alumina Plant (Gove, NT) and was a founding director of Macquarie Bank. \"We weren't people riding in on white horses doing something different,\" McFee says. \"Infrastructure and new industry construction (and most training) was delayed for five years by WW2 so the 1950 graduates quickly went to jobs with faster than normal promotions.\" The stories outlined here are typical of the experiences and achievements of the 79 graduates of 1950. There are many more worth recounting, enough for a book, and more than enough for another reunion.

Some have left jobs because they cannot state the name of their firm or their boss. Many struggle with simple social and work tasks, finding it almost impossible to utter their own names or do routine tasks such as answering the telephone or ordering a meal. The Founding Director of the Australian Stuttering Research Centre at Sydney University's Cumberland campus, Professor Onslow is a world authority on the treatment of stuttering. The methods he and his colleagues have developed have revolutionised the treatment of stuttering in adults and children, enabling many sufferers to lead a normal life. Professor Onslow says that in the past five years his centre has carried out more than 90 per cent of the world's clinical trials on stuttering (\"stammering\" is the same affliction and a term common in the Britain). Researchers at the centre work closely with the Stuttering Unit of the Bankstown Health Service and with speech pathologists at other universities and two international research centres. He and his colleagues are now involved in promising research on treating stutterers over the telephone and the internet. As less than 1 per cent of Australian speech language pathologists work outside metropolitan areas, these programs could provide vital aid for stutterers in remote areas. While listening to stutterers can literally raise the blood pressure of normal speakers, Professor Onslow says stuttering is \"more than frustrating\" for sufferers. \"T o be unable to speak is like a living death. Y ou can't live a full life because you are often overcome with the fear of being evaluated negatively.\" He says those who stutter might get to say just half of what other people say in a lifetime, or take twice as long to say it. Professor Onslow did a variety of jobs, from acting to working on a garbage truck, before graduating as a speech pathologist and becoming a lecturer in clinical education at the School of Communication Disorders at the Cumberland College of Health Sciences. He says that while working in the theatre he encountered someone with a serious speech defect, which made him interested in researching and treating speech disorders. By the time he completed his doctorate, the college had been incorporated into the University as the Faculty of Health Sciences, the largest health faculty in Australia. It was his mentor, Professor Roger Ingham, previously head of the No longer lost forwords Call it stutter or stammer, Professor Mark Onslow's research means the afflicted may now say either word easily. Linda Vergnani reports29 SAM Winter 08of children treated with the Lidcombe Program showed that most were still speaking without a stutter. (The study will be published shortly.) It is important to treat children early, while their neurological speech mechanism is still developing. \"The message we send out to parents is, 'You definitely need to get your child's stuttering under control by the end of the pre-school years'.\" When they work with stuttering teenagers and adults, the research centre's speech pathologists teach them to simplify speech motor production. Initially, clients are taught to make a very smooth, drawling, unnatural sound and then gradually shape this back to normal speech. Onslow explains: \"Y ou need to restructure the person's speech pattern so that it suppresses stuttering. But that is never going to be a cure.\" He says clients learn to sound reasonably normal with a great deal of practice. \"If you're severely affected you'll say 50 syllables a minute and you need to say about 250. So with restructuring people's speech and getting them to use a new speech pattern that sounds reasonably normal, you can get them to achieve a normal verbal transfer rate and you can help them with the shocking anxiety they may develop.\" Until now this therapy worked best when a clinician sat down with individual clients and taught them how to restructure their speech, Professor Onslow says. The Camperdown Program, developed by the centre and adopted widely in Australia and internationally, is tailored to the needs of each client. Onslow says this therapy for adults \"used to take more than 100 hours. We recently published a trial that cut it back to 25 hours and we just had a clinical trial, in review at the moment, where we showed we could do the whole thing over the telephone.\" This study of 40 people showed that they could be successfully treated over the phone in just 13 hours. \"So you can be in Bolivia and I can give you therapy that is just as good for your stuttering as if you sat with me the whole time. All you need is a phone line.\" Onslow says the Australian Stuttering Research Centre is about to trial a high-tech, website-based version of the program that will \"possibly mop up a great deal of people who need help with their stuttering\". This internet program, which is being tried in Melbourne and Sydney, is among research funded by National Health and Medical Research Centre grants. The Stuttering Research Centre also has a cognitive behavioural therapy treatment program that it hopes to put online to reduce the social anxiety of stutterers. Until recently, the Lidcombe Program involved weekly visits to a clinic by a parent and child. However, Professor Onslow's centre has recently completed a clinical trial showing that the program can be delivered over the phone to children and their parents. The results will be published shortly. The next step will be a trial of the program over the internet, to be carried out in conjunction with colleagues at Charles Sturt University. Using computer-mounted webcams, clinicians will be able to make virtual home visits to parents and their stuttering children. This will enable the treatment of children in rural locations where there are no speech pathologists. \"If these trials work,\" he says, \"in a number of years, when everyone has access to broadband internet and webcams, you can be a clinician sitting anywhere in the world and give therapy to any child and parent anywhere else in the world.\" SAMSchool of Communication Disorders, who inspired him early in his career to focus on stuttering. \"I loved treating stuttering,\" Professor Onslow says. \"I woke up one night and decided to start the Australian Stuttering Research Centre.\" The centre has received more than $7.5 million in government funding since its inception in 1996. Its staff of 15, including three academics, are housed in a prefab on low stilts that features a carpeted balcony that sprouts green moss at the edges. Y et the work is \"bigger than Ben Hur\", according to Professor Onslow. \"We're running clinical trials in Australia and across the world.\" The Professor, who is also a Principal Research Fellow of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, has written more than 200 publications on stuttering, including journal articles, books and chapters. \"Stuttering is a disorder of neural speech processing,\" he says. \"The speech mechanism just does not work as it should.\" It is genetically transmitted and those afflicted by it have been shown to have \"structural and functional brain anomalies\". The defect manifests itself when children are about two to three years old, when they move from babbling simple words such as \"dada\" to stringing sentences together. The exact causes are still unknown. \"Fortunately, we're a lot better at fixing it than we are about explaining it, and we're lucky to have been involved over the years with development of really effective early interventions for stuttering that appear to stop it.\" About three-quarters of pre-schoolers who stutter will outgrow it naturally within two years. But without early intervention, the remainder can be burdened for life. \"The chance of being bullied when you go to school is around 30 per cent, but if you stutter the chances of bullying are virtually 100 per cent,\" Professor Onslow says. showed The peers of three- to four-year-old stutterers already have a negative reaction. It is hardly surprising that a recent trial showed that 60 per cent of adult stutterers warranted a clinical diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Professor Onslow says that 20 years ago parents were advised to politely ignore the jerky attempts of pre-schoolers to get words out, so as not to make them self-conscious. But children who did not outgrow the stuttering by the time they entered primary school never recovered from this benign neglect. Beginning in the 1990s, he and his colleagues at the Stuttering Unit, then located in Lidcombe Hospital, developed a behavioural therapy program that stops stuttering in a large percentage of pre-schoolers. In the Lidcombe Program of Early Stuttering Intervention, speech pathologists train parents to comment positively each time the child speaks normally and sometimes gently point out when the child stutters. So stutter-free speech is acknowledged and complimented with remarks such as: \"That was smooth.\" If the child stutters, the parent may make a mild observation: \"That was a bit bumpy. Would you like to try that again without a stutter?\" According to Professor Onslow, clinical trials around the world have shown that it works. A five-year follow-up Professor Mark Onslow. Photo Linda Vergnaniresearch30 SAM Winter 08While Finn McCall (MEd '06) was working at the Australian Bureau of Statistics he read an ad for English teaching in South Korea. He had completed his BA three years before and was wondering \"what next?\" The ad was an answer and a temptation. \"The jobs in South Korea are offered by hagwons, and to get a teaching visa, you need a tertiary degree,\" McCall said. A hagwon, by the way, is a private institution for students from age four to 18. They operate outside school hours and offer other subjects too, such as maths and music. As well as the \"enormous satisfaction\" of helping young people, Finn said it is also \"a great way to save, because as well as flights and an apartment, the pay for a one year contract is pretty good.\" \"Y oung people have a lot of energy,\" he said of his abiding memory of the South Korean experience. \"I was thrown in at the deep end. And I learned to teach.\" As well, it gave him a future focus and he came home and enrolled in the Masters degree at the University. \"I wanted the theoretical groundings to pursue a practical career.\" At the age of 28, McCall now lives in Lyon, France's second largest city. He has two jobs: as a trainer in English at Concordia, a private language school, where he trains French businesspeople who need a high level of English to maintain their corporate positions. The other is lecturing at Lyon's Universit\u00e9 Jean Moulin.English language, French style A Masters of Education (TESOL) set Finn McCall on course for an international career, he tells Jane Sandilands how While English has long been recognised as the international language of business, McCall says because of increased globalisation and takeovers, today there is an even greater demand. Concordia offers English \"any way that's best for the student\" because its client/pupils face an annual examination of English skills through the demanding T est of English for International Communications (TOEIC). Different scoring levels are needed to retain particular jobs. For instance, a technician must reach 600 of a possible 990 while a manager has to score at least 800. \"There is huge pressure,\" McCall says. \"Many clients holding very senior positions are in their 50s and 60s, so you need to find a way to bring English to them as a positive experience.\" Most sessions are one-to-one, two hours each week. McCall recounts a recent success story of a senior manager with very little English whose French company now has Swedish management. TOEIC had to be faced. \"He wouldn't speak English and it was up to me to find a basis to work from. I used an English language action movie and it became our topic: recounting, questioning, opinion and dialogue. It worked.\" At Universit\u00e9 Jean Moulin, McCall teaches 24 fourth year marketing and business students, completing Masters One. He gives the entire class in \"immersive English\". Between the two very different learning environments, he uses all he learned at Sydney, whether related to the history of ESL teaching, different motivation theories, latest thinking, or task-based language learning. The appeal of working abroad is \"getting to know the people\" McCall said. \"I'm constantly aware of how rich the culture is. When I ask people about France, they start with the country, the wine, the region, their small town and its speciality: perhaps a nougat, cheese or wine. It's the tapestry of identity I like.\" Most appointments for T eaching English as a Second Language happen on-line, as did McCall's appointment to Concordia. A popular site is www.eslcafe.com where schools seeking English teachers and those looking to teach both pay a registration fee. \"Put your name down and you get offers. I got an offer saying 'come to beautiful Lyon' so I did!\" said McCall. Financially, it is less attractive than work in South Korea, according to McCall, because of French bureaucracy and high taxes. A high point of living in France, however, is visitors from Australia. \"No-one came when I was in South Korea.\" And the low point? Waiting to be served in a boulangerie and asking for a croissant using the wrong gender. \"She didn't serve me until I said 'un croissant' properly - and made everyone else wait. I'm scarred for life.\" SAMFinn McCall teaching English in France 31 SAM Winter 08Life at Sydney proved too remote for the young man, and in June 1939 he resigned to become professor of Greek at Durham University in the north of England. He was later to write of \"the dull pang I had known and shared in Sydney University ... the heartache of the exile, the oppressive sense of being remote, so remote, from everything that ultimately mattered, from all that gave one birth\". In August 1939, with the outbreak of war imminent, Powell's resignation was expedited so that he could return to enlist in the British army, where he joined the ranks (as an Australian). His time at Sydney was to be his only academic appointment. At the outbreak of war, Powell was the youngest professor in the British Commonwealth; by its close he was not only the youngest person to hold the rank of brigadier in the British Army, he was also the only person to have risen to that position from the ranks. As professor of Greek, Powell was also the honorary curator of the Nicholson Museum. Given the brevity of his tenure, it is not surprising that he made only a few acquisitions on behalf of the museum. One, however, is of great interest and rarity. It is a papyrus \"As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see the River Tiber foaming with much blood.\" With these words, the English politician Enoch Powell ended his infamous anti-immigration speech given on 20 April, 1968 to his constituents in Birmingham. The speech was to become known as the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech and is still seen as a defining moment in global postwar politics. It is unfortunate that Powell is now best remembered for this speech, rather than for his talents as a politician and as a classical scholar. What is also forgotten is Powell's connection (albeit briefly) with the University of Sydney. In November 1937, precociously talented and aged only 25, Powell was appointed professor of Greek at the University. \"Just out of nappies and as arrogant as hell,\" was the opinion of one of his new students, a certain Gough Whitlam, who dropped his classes because they were \"as dry as dust\". Due to the nature of the young Englishman's scholarship and his awkwardness with women, Whitlam later famously dismissed Powell as \"a textual pervert\".fragment from Book 5 (lines 206-224) of Homer's Iliad, dating to the second century AD. Found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt in the early 1900s, it was first donated to the University by the Egypt Exploration Society in 1922. In 1939 Powell organised for it to be transferred from the Library to the Nicholson Museum, where it is now on display in the Unearthed Tales II exhibition. The fragment tells of (yet another) noisy and bloody battle outside the walls of T roy. The archer, and T rojan ally , Pandaros has just struck Diomedes and Menelaos with his arrows. Neither, however, has been hit fatally and both are still fighting. The T rojan hero, Aeneas, is shouting at Pandaros, encouraging him not to lose heart and to keep fighting. Interestingly, the \"rivers of blood\" quotation that Powell was later to use to such withering effect also involved Aeneas. In Book Six of Virgil's Aeneid, the hero goes to Cumae on the Bay of Naples to see the Sybil, the mad prophetess of the god Apollo. It is she who utters the words, warning Aeneas of the terrible wars he must face before founding Rome. Powell was to say later, in view of the uproar caused by the quote, that he regretted not having said it in Latin.

Courtesy of Express Newspapers PLCRivers of blood By Michael Turner32 SAM Winter 08Anyone who has visited the University in recent decades and walked down the leafy road between the two main ovals will have seen the HK Ward Gymnasium. Standing beside the pathways to the Faculty of Veterinary Science, St John's College and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, it has been used by countless students and staff since opening in 1967. But how many know anything about HK Ward? V ery few, my straw poll suggests. I, too, was unaware of why we should remember this illustrious former student and academic until last September when researching the World War I experiences of our medical alumni at the National Archives in Kew, London. For inquisitive visitors to the gym itself, the inscription on a small framed card behind the desk tells us that \"Emeritus Professor HK Ward\" was \" ... Bosch Professor of Bacteriology, 1935-52, Rhodes Scholar, University blue and Olympian, in recognition of his valuable and devoted service to the Sydney University Sports Union as Chairman of the Ground Committee from 1937 to 1951.\" An impressive start, but there's so much more. Hugh Kingsley Ward was born at Petersham, Sydney, on September 17, 1887, the youngest of eight children. His father, Frederick, was editor of the Sydney Mail, then the Daily Telegraph. His brother, Leonard, also a Sydney alumnus (BA 1900, BE 1903), became a prominent geologist and public servant. Like many bright students of his era, Hugh K. Ward came to the University and St Paul's College from Sydney Grammar School. He gained his blue in rowing, as stroke for his college in an inter-collegiate race, was a member of a winning inter-varsity crew, stroke of the winning crew in the champion Fours of NSW and later a member of the victorious NSW Eight. Ward graduated with first-class honours in medicine in 1910, equal third in his year. In 1911 he was a Resident Medical Officer at Sydney Hospital. He was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship for that year, just the eighth from Sydney and the third from his faculty. This took him to New College, Oxford, where \"he experimented with serological tests for syphilis and in 1913 gained diplomas in anthropology and public health\". While at Oxford he rowed in the winning crew in the annual Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and then, somewhat controversially, was selected in the Australian Eight at the Stockholm Olympic Games in 1912. (In his History of Australian Rowing, Andrew Guerin notes that, before the Games, Ward had rowed for New College against the Sydney Rowing Club at the Henley Royal Regatta. The Sydney Eight won the Grand Challenge Cup and then went to the Olympics with Ward as the only change in the crew, losing in the semi-finals. Critics said that Ward had \"assimilated the New College (Oxford) style of rowing\" and \"it is always dangerous ... to alter a successful crew.\")At the outbreak of World War I, Ward already had a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps Special Reserve. He was soon serving in France and Belgium, in 1914 with a casualty clearing station and the field ambulance and then in 1915-1919 as Regimental Medical Officer of the 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps. He was wounded at Loos (1915), the Somme (1916) and Zeebrugge (1917). After eight months as a prisoner of war in Baden, Germany, he returned to duty and was gassed at Arras (1918). For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross and two Bars, an exceptional feat. In his four-page handwritten report \"on the action of Nieuport-Les-Bains, Belgium, July 10th 1917\", Ward described in graphic detail the artillery bombardment: how all his company's officers were killed or wounded, and how the only communication with their superiors was by pigeon. With devastation all around, \"I surrendered my wounded, my staff and stretcher-bearers, & no bombs were thrown into the dressing-station\". Ward, in an understated note to his Colonel, said he was \"treated fairly decently by the Badeners. All the same we were jolly glad to get out.\" During Ward's extended stay at Harvard, first as a Rockefeller Fellow (1923-1924) and then later as Assistant Professor of Bacteriology (1926-1934), his mentor was Hans Zinsser, author of the classic Rats, Lice and History. While there, Ward influenced John F . Enders to switch from a business career in real estate to research in bacteriology and immunology. Enders later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or (sic) Medicine (1954) for his team's laboratory research cultivating poliomyelitis viruses. In Montreal in May 1927 Ward married Constance Isabella Docker, a librarian, also from Sydney, the daughter of the NSW District Court judge Ernest Brougham Docker, who had graduated BA (1863) and MA (1865) from Sydney. The Wards went on to have a son and a daughter. Back at Sydney as Bosch Professor of Bacteriology, while giving \"undergraduate teaching a high priority\", Ward inspired Don Metcalf (1951), Gus Nossal (1953) and Jacques Miller (1954) to take research BSc (Med) degrees in bacteriology before completing their medical studies. All three subsequently became eminent pillars of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research at the University of Melbourne. \"A man of vision, personal integrity and charm, Ward did not seek recognition and was embarrassed by praise,\" says his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography. He died on 22 November 1972, aged 85.
