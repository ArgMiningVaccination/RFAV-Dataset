As a teacher, it's my responsibility to encourage these students to ask questions, pursue answers and generate solutions. To achieve these teaching goals I strive to teach courses that challenge my students to think beyond the material covered in textbooks and develop assignments requiring students to critically analyze the material covered in class and apply it to situations unfamiliar to them. Through my teaching, I hope to instill a passion in my student through my own enthusiasm and fascination for science and medicine. I teach and co-direct the Molecular and Cellular Foundations Module as well as additional biochemistry lectures throughout the M1 and M2 years.My research program is focused on the molecular mechanisms that regulate development in preimplantation stage embryos. This research aims to enhance the uterine implantation success rate of euploid embryos of infertile couples undergoing IVF. I am also the Director of Medical Student Research at UofSC SOMG. [Grier, Jennifer, Ph.D.](pf09361d28fb24c3a44325286af1cc750e) [jgrier@greenvillemed.sc.edu](mailto:jgrier@greenvillemed.sc.edu) I primarily study the innate immune response in the context of (-)ssRNA respiratory viruses which include RSV and Sendai Virus (SeV), a virulent mouse pathogen in the same family of viruses as RSV. Following infection with RSV or SeV, hundreds of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) are up-regulated, yet the functional significance of many of them remains unclear. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of these early responding ISGs could be used to prevent disease complications or establishment of chronic symptoms. Through targeted mutation and cellular characterization of ISGs, we hope to identify proteins and pathways that are protective for the host following viral infection to serve as targets for new therapeutic approaches.
