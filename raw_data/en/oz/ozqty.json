The concept of energy balance In order to effectively manage your weight, I personally believe you need to understand the basic principles of how and why weight gain and loss occurs. One of the main issues with most 'diets' is that they don't teach these principles, but instead apply a set of restrictive rules to follow. In turn, this does not give you the tools to independently achieve your goal. Instead, you become reliant on a certain 'product' or 'structure' which can be extremely difficult to adhere to (sound familiar!?). As with most things in life, if we don't understand the 'why', adherence and/or motivation can be low (I will discuss 'diets' in much more detail in a further blog post). Evidence shows that educating people on the concept of energy balance and weight loss, will help people develop the skills to combat overeating and sedentary behaviour. So... what actually is energy balance? Very simply, energy balance is defined as the state achieved when energy (calories) intake equals energy expenditure (calories burned). If you eat more calories than you burn over a period of time you will gain weight (energy surplus). On the contrary, if you eat less calories than you burn over a prolonged period you will lose weight (energy deficit). Think of it as a seesaw, if you overeat and drink and don't move enough to burn this energy, the seesaw will tip towards weight gain and this excess energy will likely be stored. How does your family pet get fat? By it eating too much and not doing enough exercise. How do you make it lose weight? Not by giving your dog a 'slimming tea', but by reducing its food and increasing its activity levels. The exact same concept applies to humans. There is no magic pill or quick fix unfortunately. Within this blog post I will hopefully provide you with some understanding of variables involved in energy balance and how can look to balance your own seesaw. Energy intake is determined by the number of calories we eat and drink. People naturally have varying levels of energy intake due to habits and certain environmental factors. When moving into my first field sales role for example, my energy intake rocketed as I found myself snacking and eating out more often as I was constantly on the road. Combine that increase in energy intake with a decrease in energy expenditure, gives you a recipe for tipping the energy balance equation in favour of weight gain! This is where I believe a lot of people go wrong when starting a new job or are experiencing a significant change in their day to day life; one variable on the equation increases/decreases (usually increase in calories and/or decrease in expenditure), but nothing is done counter this. My knowledge and understanding of energy density (how many calories a food contains) in foods and micronutrients is the main way I personally can track my intake. As I am sure you are all aware, some foods are very high in energy and others low. For example, a large meat lovers domino's pizza (my personal favourite...) contains a solid 2,230 calories. To eat the same number of calories from boiled broccoli you would need to consume around 9.2kg, which is around 304 servings! I'm not sure about you, but I personally struggle to eat 304 servings of broccoli a year... This pizza vs broccoli example is obviously very extreme but acknowledging how energy dense a food or drink is can lead to much smarter choices, especially if your job means you eat out of the house on a regular basis. A more realistic example is coffee - a necessity for most busy businesspeople! A venti vanilla latte with whole milk in Starbucks has 386 calories. Compare this to the same sized coffee with no syrup shot and skimmed milk, you cut the total energy over half to 168 calories. By looking at the total caloric content of foods/drinks you can often find alternatives which provide a similar level of satisfaction, but for less calories. However, there can be instances where this approach may not always work. As often foods lower in calories have a less satiating effect, meaning they are not as filling. So be careful you're not switching to lower calorie options at the risk of increased hunger, which can result in more energy consumption throughout the day. The micronutrient (fats, proteins, carbohydrates and alcohol content) breakdown of foods and drinks also explains why some foods are much more energy dense than others. Per gram, it's well documented that alcohol (7kcal) and fats (9kcal) contain the highest calorie intake vs carbohydrates (3.75kcal) and proteins (4kcal). Which is why typically foods high in fat, often have the greatest total calorie balance. All of these micronutrients have place within a diet I believe and removing one of them, e.g. a low carbohydrate diet is one I would certainly avoid and will discuss further in another blog. Understanding this micronutrient breakdown can be useful in situations where you don't have access to the caloric information of foods, in a restaurant for example. Knowing that certain dishes are likely to have a higher fat content as they are covered in cheese, vs a meat and veg option which will likely be high in protein (as long as they don't drench the meat in oil/butter!) is a good way to reduce energy intake if you're eating out often. I also think just understanding this macronutrient breakdown will hopefully enable people to make smarter food and drink choices in general. Energy expenditure is slightly more complicated, as there are multiple factors which contribute to this which I have highlighted below: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) refers to the energy required to maintain normal everyday body functions such as breathing. RMR is also individual with a few key factors impacting this such as age, gender and body size. Typically, RMR reduces slightly with age and females tend to have a slightly lower metabolic rate vs males of the same hight and weight. So, the well-known saying of 'my metabolism has slowed down' is technically true. However, there are things we can do to combat this. The thermic effect of food (TEF) is the energy our bodies require to absorb, digest and metabolise the food we consume. Yes, you heard me correctly... our bodies actually burn calories when we eat them! Unfortunately, this accounts for a very small proportion of total daily energy expenditure. Typically, around 5% with certain macronutrients such as protein having a higher TEF vs certain carbohydrates. TEF is something I think you should be aware of, but in the grand scheme of things has very little impact of weight management vs the other factors. Physical activity and exercise are the final variables in the expenditure equation and should not be confused as the same thing. Physical activity is roughly defined as any bodily movement that requires energy expenditure. For example, walking to work, carrying out chores and any recreational activity. Whereas exercise is a subcategory of physical activity that is usually structured and repetitive with the aim to improve an area of physical fitness, such as weightlifting or running. It is important to distinguish between the two as they are both separate tools you can manipulate to help increase energy expenditure. Some people love going to the gym and others loath it. I personally love lifting weights... a lot. However, as much as your personal trainer may tell you, you do not need to go to the gym to increase your energy output and lose weight. Some people enjoy dog walking, others like competitive sports. It has been estimated that increasing daily physical activity levels such as the number of steps per day can increase daily expenditure by around 400-600 calories. This number of calories burned is the equivalent to around 40-60 minutes strenuous running. Or if you want to look at the glass half full (literally) is the equivalent of earning yourself two delicious pints of beer. Knowing how to increase your total expenditure with methods that work for you and which you can adhere to are the key (the importance of adherence and lifestyle choices within a diet will also be discussed in a later blog post). In summary, there are multiple different ways in which you can impact your energy balance seesaw to help you manage your weight. The three main variables you can control are your energy (calories) intake, and the amount of expenditure you do via physical activity and/or exercise. Below I have listed some top tips I have used which have helped me manage my energy seesaw whilst working in a demanding job environment. - Eating a handful of green leafy vegetables (when possible) with most meals to help reduce hunger. Green leafy vegetables are very low energy and have a satiating impact due to their high water and fibre content. - Stick to a regular meal timing routine, especially when working away, to try and reduce the likelihood of wasting calories on snacking. - Reducing my eating window, otherwise known as intermitting fasting. I often will not eat my first meal of the day until 12-1pm as I don't tend to get hungry in the mornings. This approach allows me to consume my total calorie requirements within a shorter time frame (9-10 hours), making it hard to overeat. This does and will not work for everyone, however. - Increasing my physical activity when I don't have time for the gym. When working in the office or at home I could often average a measly 2,000 steps a day and could struggle to get to the gym. Taking realistic steps to increase my physical activity on these days helped me expend energy when time was tight. This could be as simple as taking the stairs instead of the lift or having one of your regular 1-2-1's on a brisk walk. - Find a hobby you enjoy that increases energy expenditure. Mine are the gym and more recently, golf. This hobby could be anything from swimming through to badminton, find something that works for you. - Don't over stress on hard days. When there are days (because there always are) you are struggling to balance your seesaw, that is okay. You will not gain a significant amount of weight in one day. Start to plan how you can then rejig your equation over the next few days to counteract this. - Use an online calorie requirement calculator to give you an idea about how much energy you should be consuming a day. These calculations are never 100% correct, however they can be a good starting point. The two links below are some of the better calculators as they use the 'Harris-Benedict formula', which is widely used in clinical settings and has strong scientific support.
