In the meantim e, chemoradiation need not constitute an essential compon ent of the therapeutic backbone . Randomized Phase 2 Trial of the Oncolytic Virus Upfront Treatment last month's newsletter. Journal : Molecular Therapy Institution(s) : Ohio State Univers ity, Columbus, O H, and others Corresponding author(s) : Tanios Bekaii -Saab Major finding : Pelareorep causes oncolysis in tumor cells with activated Ras. The authors hypothesized that pelareorep would have efficacy and immunomodulatory activity in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MPA) when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A randomized phase 2 study (NCT01280058) was conducted in treatment -naive patients with MPA randomized to two treatment arms: paclitaxel/carboplatin + pelareorep versus paclita xel/carboplatin. Overall, pelareorep was safe but does not improve progression -free survival when administered with carboplatin/paclitaxel, regardless of KRAS mutational status. Immunologic studies suggest that chemotherapy backbone improves immune reconst itution and that targeting remaining immunosuppressive mediators . FOLFIRINOX for and Patient -Level Meta 14 Journal : Lancet Oncology Institution(s) : Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands , and others Corresponding author(s) : Bas Groot Koerkamp Major finding : Patients with locally advanced pan creatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin and fluorouracil plus irinotecan and oxaliplatin) had a median overall survival of 24 .2 months - longer than that reported with gemcitabine (6 -13 months). Future research should assess these promising results in a randomized controlled trial, and should establish which patients might benefit from radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy or When Agonistic CD40 Antibody Is Given before but Not after Chemotherapy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217585 Journal : The Journal of Immunology Institution(s) : University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Corresponding author(s) : Robert Vonderhei de Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Robert Vonderheide, MD, DPhil: PI, 2013 Tempur -Pedic - Inaugural Research Acceleration Network Grant in Memory of Tim Miller and member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is classically resistant to immunotherapy and lacks baseline T cell infiltration. In this study, the authors used a tumor cell line derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to investigate alterations in the seque nce of anti -CD40 and chemotherapy as an approach to enhance pharmacological delivery of chemotherapy. These studies highlight the dual nature of CD40 in activating both macrophages and T cell responses, and the need for preclinical investigation of optimal anti-CD40 treatment regimens for safe design of clinical trials . Novel Patient -Derived Xenograft Mouse Model for Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma Demonstrates Single Agent Activity of Oxaliplatin http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165126 Journal : Journal of Translational Medicine Institution(s) : Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Jacksonville, FL, and others Corresponding author(s) : Jason Hall Major finding : In summary, the authors repor t the development and characterization of the first and only preclinical pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) patient derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model. Here the authors show sustained anti -tumor activity of single agent oxaliplatin, a compound that is more effective in tumors that harbor mutations in DNA repair genes. Their data shows that BRCA2 is mutated in our PACC model, which could contribute to the oxaliplatin sensitivity observed. Further studies on this rare PACC model can serve to elucidate other novel therapies, biomarkers, and molecular mechanisms of signaling and drug resistance . Journal : Scientific Reports Institution(s) : Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX Corresponding author(s) : Sanjay Srivastava Major finding : These studies established that penfluridol inhibits pancreatic tumor gro wth by autophagy -mediated apoptosis. Since penfluridol is already in clinic, positive findings from the authors' study will accelerate its clinical development . 15 Tumour -specific Delivery of siRNA -coupled Superparamagnetic against PLK1, Stops Progression of Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196585 Journal : Gut Institution(s) : Ernst -University, Greifswald, Germany Corresponding auth : Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coupled with siRNA directed a dual purpose for delivery of siPLK1 to the tumor and for non -invasive assessment of efficiency of delivery in vivo by imaging the tumor response. The authors' data suggest siPLK1 -StAv - SPIONs with dual specificity residues for tumor targeting and membrane translocation to represent an exciting opportunity for targeted therapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . Industry news: NewLink Genetics Announces from Phase 3 IMPRESS Trial of Algenpantucel -L for Patients with Resected Pancreatic Cancer http://investors.linkp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=969978 Pancreatic Genetics C orporation, Ames, IA Major finding : The IMPRESS Phase 3 study of algenpantucel -L for patients with resected pancreatic cancer did not achieve its primary endpoint. Overall survival from time of randomization was 29.3 months for both groups combined. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The median survival was 30.4 months and 27.3 months for the control and study groups, respectively. There was also no statistical difference for long -term survival. Algenpantucel -L is a cancer vaccine comprised of irradiated allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells transfected to express murine alpha -1,3-galactosyltransferase with potential antitumor activity. Aduro Biotech Announces Phase 2b ECLIPSE Trial Misses Pancreatic pancreatic -cancer -vaccine -falls-short/ Company Aduro Biotech, Inc., Berkeley, CA Major finding : Aduro Biotech, Inc. announced that the Phase 2b ECLIPSE trial did not meet the primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival for patients with pancreatic cancer who had failed at least two prior therapies in the metastatic setting. Median overall su rvival (MOS) in this third - line and greater setting was 3.8 months for patients treated with the immunotherapy regimen of CRS - 207 and GVAX Pancreas, 5.4 months for patients treated with CRS -207 alone and 4.6 months for patients administered chemotherapy. CRS-207 is Aduro's LADD (live, attenuated, double - deleted Listeria mononcytogenes )-based therapeutic that has been engineered to promote the expression of the tumor -associated antigen, mesothelin (which is present in multiple tumor types, including pancreat ic cancer). GVAX is a portfolio of irradiated tumor cell lines that express GM -CSF, a key immune cell recruitment factor, and can stimulate a broad -based, highly potent immune response. 16 MabVax Therapeutics' HuMab -5B1 Cancer Therapeutic Featured in Presentation Cancer Research (AACR) Pancreatic Cancer Special Conference: Advances in Science and Clinical Ca re Institution(s) : MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., San Diego, CA , and others Presenting author : Paul Maffuid Abstract : A73: Antitumor Activity of MVT -5873, a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Sialyl Lewis A, Alone and in Combination with Gemcitabine/nab -Paclitaxel in a BxPC3 Human Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft Model Major finding : MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., a clinical -stage immuno -oncology drug development company, announces that its lead cancer therapeutic HuMab -5B1 (MVT -5873) was featured in a post er presentation on May 13th .
