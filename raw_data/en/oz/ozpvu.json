Texas Health Resources' Community Health Needs Assessment was a six -month collaborative process, led by Texas Health's Community Health Improvement Department and entity community advocates with significant input from Texas Health's Community Health Advisory Council. Vast amounts of quantitative and qualitative data were collected, refined and analyzed. Approximately 200 community members provided invaluable information, data, and feedback. Texas Health utilized the following approach to complete a community health needs assessment: Create the Vision for the Community Health Needs Assessment Define the Scope, Including the Zip -Code Level Service Area Identify Key Demographics of Service Area Identify Services Provided by Area Health Resources (Supply) Identify Key Health Needs by Service Area (Demand) Identify Gaps in Services Provided Develop Community Needs Model, Including Criteria for Prioritizing Needs Prioritize Community Needs, Based on Data and Model Criteria Develop Strategies to Address Needs Outline Actionable Objectives, Timelines and Implementation Process Secondary data used throughout this analysis was obtained from more than 30 sources, and is outlined in detail on the following slides.How the Assessment was Conducted44PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL -\u00a9 2012 PREMIER INC.Demographic Assessment Education Levels of the Population: ACS Educational Attainment by Degree -Level and Age -Group ( U.S. Census Bureau, 2011 American Community Survey) .

During December 2012 and January 2013, interviews were conducted with approximately 200 persons representing the community's interests. Information and data were gathered using two different methods: Open -ended discussions, led by Premier, Inc., aimed at soliciting input from the interview participants as to community health resources, as well as the health needs of the community. Likert surveys, containing 11 statements regarding community health for which participants ranked their agreement or disagreement.Process for Consulting with People Representing the Community's Interest49PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL -\u00a9 2012 PREMIER INC. Drawing from the data elements analyzed and presented in each entity community health needs assessment, Texas Health Resources has developed a model to identify and prioritize health needs. At its most basic level, the model outlines all identified health issues in rows, and marks in columns each entity impacted by that specific issue. The specific issues were also grouped into health categories adapted from the Healthy People 2020 categories. Any issue not meeting threshold levels (e.g., a minimum number of indicators showing a problem and/or a minimum number entities having raised that issue) were removed from subsequent analysis. Remaining issues were assessed using criteria designed to rank, or prioritize the issues. Texas Health used the resulting rankings to select which health needs will be addressed over the next three years. Once selected, the organization developed strategies and initiatives aimed at impacting those gaps.Process for Identifying and Prioritizing Health Needs50PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL -\u00a9 2012 PREMIER INC. The vast majority of secondary data required to assess community need was available for Texas Health Resources' analysis. In certain instances, however, data was not available at Texas Health's preferred level of detail. Specific examples of this include: Zip Code Level Data -Some health indicators and behavioral factors are published at the county level, not the zip code level, which prohibited Texas Health from analyzing these data for an entity's defined service area. Examples include sexually transmitted disease rates, obesity rates, literacy rates, and many others. These data elements have been included in the community health needs assessment data as reference points but county -level indicators were not used in the prioritization of health needs . Data for Uninsured and Underinsured -A significant finding of this study is that access to health services is limited for the uninsured and underinsured. This issue was mentioned numerous times by a wide range of participants. However, quantifying this issue is difficult, if not impossible. There is no publicly available source of data to identify providers who accept uninsured patients or providers who accept patients with Medicare or Medicaid. Estimates have been included in the physician supply and demand section of this study, but these are estimates only and do not provide the ideal level of specificity. Lack of Efficacy -Texas Health prefers to utilize evidence based programs to improve the health of the community it serves. However, there are few existing studies that measure, evaluate and/or report the effectiveness of preventative wellness programs and initiatives. Texas Health will proceed with information currently available and supplement with internal expertise as needed. Note: Texas Health does not believe the limitations outlined above impacted Texas Health's ability to reach reasonable conclusions regarding the health needs of the community.Gaps that Limited the Ability to Assess NeedsAppendix52PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL -\u00a9 2012 PREMIER INC.Demographics Needs Summary Population of focus -Grading System Data Sources: Population estimates and projections, income and uninsured, Texas Health Care Information Council inpatient pa yermix, were retrieved by Texas Health Resources Strategy and Business Planning Department from Truven. Higher ranking = higher need based upon the indicator Demographic information was collected from Truven Health Analytics for the four below data elements listed below: 2012 total population 5 year population growth 2012 -2017 Median household income Age 18+ percent uninsured Each of the four elements were ordered either ascending or descending depending upon whether a higher need was suggested: There is more need in densely populated areas There is more need in areas of high population growth There is more need in areas of low income There is more need in areas with high percentages of uninsured These rankings are summed in total and then averaged to obtain a \"score\" which is itself then ranked. Considering these four key factors, the associated maps show the areas of highest need in darker red to areas of minimal need in dark blue.53PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL -\u00a9 2012 PREMIER INC.List of Health Services in Community PROVIDER TYPE FACILITY NAME STREET ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIP ASC CLEBURNE SURGICAL CENTER LLC 2010 WEST KATHERINE P RAINES CLEBURNE TX 76033 ASC HUGULEY TX 76028 ASC SOUTHWEST ENDOSCOPY & BURLESON TX 76028 BIRTHING STREET CLEBURNE TX 76033 COMMUNITY CLINIC CROWLEY HOUSE OF HOPE 208 N.
