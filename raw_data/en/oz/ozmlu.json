CDC Update The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have updated their guidance on how long people who are positive for COVID-19 should self-isolate. New evidence suggests it may take longer for the virus to shed, which means that an infected person may be able to infect other people for a longer period than originally thought. People who are positive or presumed positive for COVID-19 should now selfisolate for 10 days and 72 hours after fever and symptoms subside. This means you must stay home until your fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medications and there is improvement in your respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) for at least 3 days (72 hours) after recovery, AND at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared or you were tested. If you have been in close contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is presumed to be infected with COVID-19, you must quarantine for 14 days from your last contact with that individual. If you begin experiencing symptoms, you must self-isolate for 10 days and 72 hours after fever and symptoms subside.

Security Tips for Working from Home With so many of us now working from home, it is more important than ever to: - Utilize online networks, community resources, and other remote tools to proactively engage with neighbors and community members to (re)establish healthy neighborhood watch practices. Make sure to align your definitions of suspicious behavior and establish simple, clear communication and escalation protocols. - Assess the quality and utility of any existing home security systems and hardware you have. It might be time to replace outdated or non-functioning hardware/software. - Review and update your family emergency response plans. Involve immediate and extended family members, as appropriate, especially those who live close by to reinforce your natural support network. - Update your emergency contacts list to include local authorities and medical resources. Tips for Protecting Your Information The global spread of COVID-19 has provided cybercriminals an opportunity to deceive people into clicking on dangerous links, opening malicious attachments, or volunteering valuable information. To mitigate the risk of falling for a COVID-19 scam, avoid clicking on links or opening files from a distrusted source ( [cdc.gov.com](http://cdc.gov.com/) vs . [cdc.gov](http://cdc.gov/)). Additionally, trusted authorities will never ask for your personal information in an email without any sort of multi-factor authentication to first prove your identity.

Included in this newsletter are links for the CDC on face coverings, Cigna telehealth, CDC myth busters, daycare and family resources, and free cooking videos. Face Covering VS A Mask On 4/3/20, the CDC revised their recommendations to the public and are recommending face coverings when out in public and or while working an essential job. Our employees should check with their supervisor and or manager regarding use of face coverings. In the City of Los Angeles, effective 4/10, the Mayor is requiring that all essential business employees wear a face mask or cloth covering (bandana, fabric, scarf) when working and or visiting an essential business. A face covering is not the same thing as a mask. At this time, you should not be purchasing medical grade masks, which are in short supply. It is extremely important that N95 masks are reserved for those who need them most and have the highest risk of infection, including medical professionals and healthcare workers. You can follow instructions available online from the CDC on [how to make your own face mask.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) Face coverings should be washed after each use. These measures will help flatten the curve and save lives. Face Covering Do's and Don'ts Do: - Use it to completely cover your nose and mouth - Read the directions provided to you on use of the mask - Put it on properly and adjust it as necessary throughout the day - Wash your hands and face after removing the mask before touching your face - Keep it clean - Keep it away from running machinery or equipment that could entangle the mask - Keep it on your person when you are not using it - Request or make a new one if it becomes damaged or in any way unsanitary Dont: - Let it obstruct your vision - Wear it if it causes any difficulty in your ability to breathe - Wear it if it causes your safety glasses or reading glasses to fog up and impair your vision - Let it hang down around your neck - Lay it on a surface where it may contaminate the surface or lay it on a surface that may already be contaminated - Use it if it is damaged in any way Cigna Telehealth Telehealth (also known as telemedicine) is the use of technology such as computers and mobile devices to help you get health care from anywhere, anytime.
