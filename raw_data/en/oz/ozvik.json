This winter does not have to be the same; you can do a huge amount to boost your immunity by eating extra nutritious food and ensuring you have the nutrients to make your immune system work at its best. First and foremost eliminate the substances that are damaging to your immune system such as sugar (and any very sweet foods), alcohol, and fast food with poor quality fats and low vegetable content. One of nature's best immune system boosters is garlic, all the better raw; use it in dips or make a garlic lemon tea. Fruit and vegetables are high in nutrients that help you stay well and ward of illness. Just because its winter you don't have to avoid salads; this may be the best way for you to get those nutrients. But also you may need warming foods. Instead of cooked veggies have a salad with your hot meal. Homemade soups are another way to increase your vegetable intake. Whilst eating more vegetables don't neglect to include protein as this also is very important for a string immune system. Studies have shown that many nutrients are crucial to fight off infection. Zinc and Vitamin C are perhaps the most widely researched nutrients in regard to nutrition. Zinc is high in nuts and seeds and seafood; so include these regularly. Vitamin C along with other nutrients that boost immunity such as Vitamin A (safest to take as \u00df-carotene), the B vitamins, iron, and selenium are all found in vegetables; so have a few more portions than you think you may need, to give yourself that extra help. If supplements are used I recommend the Entire Katoa Food State supplements for the best absorption. Oily fish, flaxseed oil, and extra virgin olive oil will help provide the good quality fats you need; it is particularly important to get adequate omega 3 fatty acids to keep those winter bugs at bay. Recently there has been lots of research which shows vitamin D is hugely important to immunity; oily fish is a good source as is sunlight so stop snuggling in and get out in the sunshine to get some more vitamin D. A brisk walk will warm you up, boost your immunity and make you feel so good that you'll enjoy the wintery days. Original Article May 2010 Copyright Jaine Kirtley FIND OUT MORE ABOUT... "}
