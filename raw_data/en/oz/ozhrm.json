In our vision for the future, the City of Varberg has unique opportunities. Our aim is clear, and we are acting on it. We are building a community converging around means of public transportation in a rapidly expanding region. The railway, which has created a barrier between the seaside and the city centre, will now be relocated into a tunnel underneath the city, and the capacity for commuting will greatly increase. To expand on this opportunity we are moving the harbor to further free up land for the city to reclaim. For people living, working or visiting the City of Varberg, the change will enhance the freedom to experience the beautiful coastline. Places for eating and meeting, places to shop and work, comes as a bonus. The City of Varberg has been awarded Sweden's Best Place To Live in both 2014 and 2015, and is nominated again this year. Our thriving city centre is nominated as third time finalist in Sweden's City Centre of the Year award. We welcome these awards and regard them as appreciative of our chosen path towards the future. Reinventing the City Building on Creativity Come to Varberg. Share our vision.3Europe has excellent business, higher education and research organisations, but still lags behind its global competitors. Why? At the EIT, we believe that a big part of the answer is insucient cooperation among key innovation players. That's exactly where the EIT Community comes in. An electric flying car and an articial tree that cleansthe air with the power of 275 trees. These are not science ction but innovations created by the EIT Community. Earlier this year, 18 EIT Commu- nity innovators were featured by Forbes in their presti- gious 30 under 30 list of the most promising youngentrepreneurs in Europe. EIT-supported ventures raise millions of euros in investment and are among Europe's innovation leaders. How do we do this? In short, we unite Europe's leading business, higher education and research institutions to create innova-tion hubs where the best ideas can grow and become products, services and jobs. We are Europe's largest innovation community- and, quite possibly, the world's- with almost 900 excellent partners spread over more than 30 innovation hubs across Europe. More than 800 entrepreneurs have graduated with EIT-labelled degrees,and almost 2,000 more are about to join them - these change-makers are gaining practical insights to help turn their ideas into action. Our Regional Innovation Schemeensures that we reach every corner of Europe, remain open to new talent and continue to grow. At the heart of every SME is an entrepreneur with bold ideas ready to make a change in Europe. We all know the challenges facing Europe today, from unemploy-ment to climate change, to name only two. How do we face them? Tado\u00b0 had an idea for an intelligent heating control system that links to smartphones. After joining us at the EIT Climate-KIC Venture Competition, they then entered our accelerator programme, beneting from EIT Climate-KIC's start-up advisors, its European network, funding and contact with other investors. In the past 5 years, tado\u00b0 has raised more than \u20ac50m to become one of the world's best-funded Internet of Things start-ups combating climate change. What tado\u00b0 shows - and what the stories of more than 200 start-ups created by the EIT Community within the areas of climate change, digitalisation, sustainable energy, healthy living and active ageing, raw materials and food show - is that there are thousands of entre- preneurs across Europe with bold ideas, ready to bring the change Europe needs. All they need is a spark to set them alight - through funding, mentorship, training or partnerships, through an environment connecting business, education and research, where innovation can grow and reach the market. The EIT Community isthis spark. Join us to make innovation happen!

The newly titled May issue sees a new look in a year that could also coincide with a new UK government. Following the triggering of Article 50 in March earlier this year, the government has recently announced asnap election to be held on June 8th. The election could see a whole new change of direction for the government. In this time of uncertainty, cooperation remains more important than ever. This edition of Open Access Government begins with a foreword from Martin Kern, Interim Director of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), who highlights the importance ofcooperation between key innovation players in Europe and the EIT community. Also in this issue, we highlight Europeanspace policy, with key editorial from the Vice-President of the European Com-mission, Maro efovi. In his piece,efovi outlines the EU Space Strategy and how the space industry is making lives better, safer and happier for Euro- peans. In the same focus, a feature from Peter Mandix Sehestedt of the Ministry of Higher Education and Science in Denmark, outlines why the Danish space sector is just as important for the economy. One country we shine the spotlight onto in Open Access Government is Finland. In our special focus on theNordic country we highlight the environ- ment, energy and healthcare research.The focus kicks o with an article from Riku Huttunen, Director General of the Energy Department at the Ministry of Economic Aairs and Employment. Huttunen shares Finland's ambition toachieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Academy of Finland's Jarmo Wahlfors also shares how key players have developed a growth strategy to ensure a coherent approach to Finnish health research and innovation. Articles from Tekes Finland and the Finnish Environ- ment Institute also feature. Other areas we look into are gynaeco- logical health research, Horizon 2020 in Switzerland, The European Disability Strategy, The European Capital of Cul- ture 2017 and food resilience in the UK. Furthermore, as technology useincreases we examine the growing issue of cybersecurity. Sir Julian King, EU Commissioner for the Security Union, reveals how tackling cybercrime should be a consideration for everyone in Europe. Europol, who share similar thoughts on how to reduce cybercrime, also include their thoughts on the challenges facing Europeans. As always, I hope you nd Open AccessGovernment informative and useful and I welcome any feedback you may have.

Liz Fitzsimons, Partner, Privacy and Information Law, EvershedsSutherland (International) explainsHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 10While improvements in health care and access have contributed to people living longer, this has resulted in an increase in the number of people with non-communicable diseases, including dementia. The numbers are daunting. Recent reviews estimate that globally, nearly 9.9 million people develop dementia annually, translating to one new case every 3 seconds1. In 2015, dementia aected 47 million people (roughly 5% of the world's elderly pop- ulation), a gure that is estimated to nearly triple to 132 million by 20502. The global cost of dementia care was estimated to be US$818 billion, constituting 1.1% of global gross domestic product3. By 2030, the cost is estimated to increase to US$2 trillion, a total that could undermine social and economic development globally.Dementia is not an inevitable consequence of ageing Crucial to interpreting these numbers is that dementia is not a normal part of ageing. Age is the strongest known risk factor for the onset of dementia, but it does not exclusively aect older people. Young onset dementia (onset of symptoms before age 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases4. The gap is wide between the need for prevention, treatment and care for dementia and the actual provi- sion of these services. Dementia is underdiagnosedworldwide, and, if a diagnosis is made, it is typically at a relatively late stage in the disease process. In high- income countries only one-fth to one-half of cases ofThe World Health Organization, says recognising dementia as a public health priority is key to addressing the condition globally Recognising dementia as a public health priority HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 11dementia are routinely recognised and documented in primary care. Data from low- and middle-income coun- tries is scarce; in one study from India, 90% of people with dementia had not received any diagnosis, treat- ment or care5. Care for people with dementia - from diagnosis until end-of-life, is frequently fragmented ifnot entirely lacking. Dementia is a public health priority that touches multiple sectors In 2012, WHO published Dementia: A Public Health Priority4 to provide the knowledge base for a global and nationalresponse and to facilitate governments and other stake- holders to address the impact of dementia as an increas-ing threat to global health. It identied that a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia often results in stigmatisation and barriers to diagnosis and care. Indeed, the impact of dementia is far-reaching. For both the person with dementia and their carers, stigmatisation can contribute to social isolation, delaysin seeking diagnosis and care, and a reluctance to ask for help 4, 6. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia profoundly aect the quality of life of people with dementia and their carers. Providing careto people with dementia incurs a substantial emotional burden, including detrimental eects on carers' mentaland physical health 7as well as considerable indirect costs through loss of income. Dementia, unlike other diseases, does not respect the boundaries of health alone, instead requiring a multi- sectoral response from other sectors such as social services, education, employment, justice and housing to improve the care and quality of life of people with dementia and their carers. A shared global commitment is needed to raise the priority of dementia and reduce the burden In 2013, a G8 Dementia Summit hosted by the UK, cul- minated in a communiqu\u00e9 and signed declaration of shared commitment from participating stakeholders and countries8. Ensuingly, WHO, supported by the UK Department of Health and The Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), organised the rst Ministerial Conference on the Global Action against Dementia in March 2015 with over 450 participants from 89 Member States9. It fostered awareness of the public health and economic chal- lenges posed by dementia and importantly, a better understanding of roles and responsibilities among countries and stakeholders, reflected in the 'Call to Action' adopted by participants. HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 12In June 2016, the WHO Executive Board in decision EB139(1)10requested the Secretariat to develop a draft Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia, with clear goals and targets. Subsequently, in January 201711the Executive Board considered the draft dementia global action plan and recommended to the 70th World Health Assembly to adopt the decision to endorse the plan during its review in May 2017. WHO's vision, as described in the draft action plan, is a world in which dementia is prevented and people with dementia and their carers live well and receive the careand support they need to full their potential with dig- nity, respect, autonomy and equality. To do so requires urgent solutions that adopt a multi-sectoral publichealth approach. WHO is committed to supporting people with dementia and their families WHO's iSupport is an evidence-based online support programme12for carers of people with dementia. It supports dementia carers to provide better care, with less detrimental consequences for their own health,while helping them to take better care of the person with dementia. Dementia, along with depression and other priority mental disorders are included in the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) and its tools, the mhGAP- Intervention Guide 13. This programme aims to scale up care and services by capacity building and health system strengthening approaches. Likewise, a dementia friendly toolkit, currently in devel- opment, aims to provide countries, communities and partners with information to support them to be more dementia-friendly, considering aspects such as the community's built environment and infrastructure,social inclusion and engagement of people with dementia, dementia awareness and knowledge of the broader community. Additionally, the WHO Global Dementia Observatory is an interactive web-based data and knowledge exchange platform 14that collates and disseminates data from countries on key dementia indicators to facilitate countries in strengthening their systems to support people with dementia and their carers. Devel- opment of the Observatory is currently underway.This is a snapshot of WHO's strong commitment to address dementia through its many initiatives, working in collaboration with people with dementia, their carers, national and international partners. We must sustain collaborative global eorts to address this chal- lenge for a better tomorrow for people with dementiaand their carers, families and communities. 1Prince M, Wimo A, Guerchet M, Ali GC, Wu Yutzu, Prina M.

Genomic, epigenomic, cerebrovascular, metabolic and environmental factors are poten- tially involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The age and sex-related syn- dromic profile of Alzheimer's reflects, at least, a tetravalent phenotype: (i) a Accord- ing to this heterogeneous, complex clinical picture, the therapeutic inter- vention in dementia is polymodal in order to modify the expression of all these complex phenotypes. AD patients present concomitant disor-ders including hypertension (20-30%), B12 of RBC (3%), HCT (33%), and Hb (35%). Cardiovascular disorders than 60%), and different modalities of cere- brovascular damage (more than 60%) are also frequent among patients with AD. Most of these biochemical, haematological and metabolic anoma- liesexhibit gender differences and may contribute to accelerate the dementiaprocess. The pharmacological treat- ment of these concomitant patholo- gies adds complexity and risks to the multifactorial therapeutic intervention in patients with dementia. Of major relevance is the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. The chronic treatment of these illnesses increases the risk of drug interactions and toxi- city, aggravating the clinical condition of the demented patient. In this con- text, the incorporation of pharmaco- genetics protocols into clinical practice is fundamental to minimise drug-drug interactions and ADRs, and to opti- mise the global therapeutic outcome, avoiding deleterious effects on mentalfunction and cognition. Major determinants of therapeutic outcome in AD include age- and sex- related factors, pathogenic pheno-type, concomitant disorders, treatment modality and polypharmacy, and pharmacogenetics. Different categories of genes are potentially involved in the pharmacogenetics network responsible for drug efficacy and safety. Pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, and pleiotropic genes represent the major genetic determinants of response to treatment in AD. By-products of these genes are integrated into transcriptomic, pro- teomic and metabolic networks which are disrupted in AD and represent potential targets for therapeutic inter- vention. AD patients may take 6-12 different drugs/day for the treatment of dementia-related tional decline, or for the treatment of concomitant pathologies (epilepsy, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, Parkinsonism, hyperten- sion, dyslipidaemia, anaemia, arthro- sis, etc.). In over to 30% of the patients, behavioural deterioration and psychomotor function can be severely altered by polypharmacy. The principal causes of these iatrogenic effects are the inappropriate combi- nation of drugs, and the genomic background of the patient, responsibleRam\u00f3n Cacabelos of EuroEspes Biomedical Research Center details how the incorporation of pharmacogenomics to treat Alzheimer's patients is crucialPharmacogenomics of polypharmacy disease14PROFILE for his/her pharmacogenomics 60 to 90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The modest effect (and toxicity) of current Alzheimer's disease drugs is in part due to their pharmacogenomics profile, since over 70% of 17 haplotypes exhibit a frequency higher than 1%. In addition to H3, the most frequent indicates that about 80% of the population is deficient for the biotransformation of current drugs which are metabolised via CYP2D6-2C9-2C19-3A4 enzymes.Most anti-dementia drugs are metabolised via CYP enzymes. Alterations in cholesterol (CHO) metabolism are involved in AD patho- genesis and over 40% of AD patients are hypercholesterolemic. The phar- macogenetics of cholesterol response to the hypolipemic compounds shows a great variability with a high response rate (RR) (78.95% responders and21.04% non-responders). APOE- related basal CHO levels are signifi-cantly different, with females showing higher CHO levels than males; how-ever, females and males responded similarly to the hypolipemic treat- ment. The stratification of patients basal CHO levels, except in the case of APOE carriers where the highest baseline levels of CHO are found in APOE-4/4 carriers and the lowest levels in APOE-2/2 carriers, in addition to a clear age-related profile. The construction of a pentagenic hap- lotype integrating all possible variants of the APOE+APOB+EPOC3+CETP+LPL genes identified 111 haplovariants with differential basal CHO levels. About 75% of these haplotypes in the AD population have a frequency below 1%, 10% have a frequency between 1% and 2%, 8% have a fre- quency between 2% and 5%, and only 4% of the haplotypes are present in more than 5% of AD patients. The haplotypes most frequently show the highest CHO levels, and the lowest to the CHO response to conventional lipid-lowering compounds is genotype-dependent and can, in part, be explained on a pharmacoge- netics basis. It is obvious that a simple stratification of patients according to single genotypes is of poor value for a fine interpretation of pharmacogenet-ics results; however, the integration of gene clusters associated with specific phenotypes yields informative haplo-types with potential utility in pharma- cogenetics studies. It is likely that thousands of genes are involved in CHO metabolism, and probably not a single gene plays an absolute domi- nant role over the others; however, some genes exert a powerful effect onother congeners associated with a specific pathogenic cascade (e.g. APOE in AD) or a pharmacogenetics pathway (e.g. APOE vs CYPs in ADtreatment with donepezil). In over 80% of patients with AD, polypharmacy is imperative for the management of concomitant disor- ders; however, drug interactions may constitute a severe complication with deleterious effects on brain function and quality of life. In this regard, the implementation of pharmacogenetics procedures can be of great utility for minimising drug adverse events and for optimising multifactorial therapeu- tics in complex disorders such as AD.

Surgical and subse- quent rehabilitative interventions are important part of the therapy that re- establishes musculoskeletal function. The Laboratory for Muscle Plasticity at Balgrist University Hospital aims to shed light on the underlying mecha- nisms in skeletal muscle with the goal of translating the findings into more effective clinical applications. Skeletal muscle plays a major part in control of movement and posture and affects whole body metabolism through its effects on energy expendi-ture. Affections ranging from simple overuse injury to rupture of tendons and bones, or disease, lead to decon - ditioning of skeletal muscle as a result of inactivity and damage signals. The consequent loss in muscle strength and fatigue resistance exerts a distinct negative impact on the quality of life and may render the affected individ- ual dependent. In these situations asurgical intervention and rehabilita- tion may be indicated, yet may come too late as irreversible changes mayhave resulted. Focus on muscle plasticity The Laboratory for Muscle Plasticity investigates the mechanisms thatunderlie the conditioning of skeletal muscle structure and function during recovery from surgical interventions and rehabilitation. As shown through research on sport performance, this process is driven by mechanical and metabolic stimuli. It is mediated through a gene response that instructs adjustments in muscle com- position with the repeated impact of exercise during training. In conse- quence, force production and fatigue resistance of muscle may be improved or maintained. By contrast, a muscle's functional capacity is reduced in the absence ofa physiological stimulus by a reduc-tion in the size of muscle fibres and their content in mitochondria (Fig. 2). In fact, while the safety and effective- ness of physical factors for muscle conditioning are well established, the dose-effect relationship betweenexercise and muscle adaptation is often not fully respected in clinical practice. An example of this biological regulation is the important role of muscle contraction and loading in preserving muscle mass of the bedrid-den musculoskeletal patient after surgery, who would otherwise lose muscle mass at a pronounced rate.Genetic factors (so called gene polymorphisms) significantly affect this adaptation . This indicates that gene polymorphisms contribute to the inter-individual variability of the response to surgical interventions and rehabilitation. Research projects The emphasis of the research team lead by Prof Martin Fl\u00fcck at Balgrist is on major musculoskeletal affections that arise in the context of the orthopaedic clinics at Balgrist Hospital.

The aim is to develop personalised forms of intervention that maximise muscle adaptation (Fig. 3). The latter approach is based on previous inves- tigations pointing out the important exercise-intensity and exercise-typerelated influence of gene polymor-phisms on muscle response to leisure-type sports activities . This opens a venue to tailor the therapeu- tically effective exercise intervention for patients which otherwise would demonstrate little plasticity to a generic exercise stimulus and for which pharmaceuticals alone do not work due to the importance of activity-induced muscle metabolismfor muscle adaptations. In this regard, the clinical investigation ACE-REHAB into personalised rehabilitation of cardiac patients has been initiated.Patient-led research The laboratory is situated in state-of- the-art research facilities at the Bal - grist Campus . A key ingredient of this research facility is an open-space land- scape where research and develop- ment into musculoskeletal medicine is integrated under one roof between clinicians, biologist, engineers, and industry. The facility situates in the vicinity of the orthopaedic hospital at Balgrist; thus providing a pipeline for a reality-driven approach that re-inte- grates questions from bedside to bench and returns to the patient. The Laboratory for Muscle Plasticity is looking for potential partners that may want to exploit the research options presented in the future campus in the frame of collaboration.

Launching the rst Prime Minister's Dementia Challenge, Mr Cameron pledged to bring political attention to dementia, describing his ambition to tackle the condition as a 'personal priority'. For the rst time in our country's history, we saw a real focus on dementia from government with a genuinedetermination to drive progress in research, change societal attitudes to the condition and improve care. Much has changed since then, and it's no exaggeration to say that much of the progress that has been made has been thanks to the Dementia Challenge. In January this year, Mr Cameron became President of Alzheimer's Research UK. As our foremost ambassador, the rolewill see him continuing to be part of the ghtback against dementia by championing our vision and helping to raise awareness, as well as driving forward progressin research. Putting dementia on the global agenda As a world leader, David Cameron put dementia on the global agenda. A year after launching the Dementia Challenge, we saw him harness the UK's presidency of the G8 to bring together world leaders for the rst ever summit on dementia - setting in motion a worldwide push to tackle a condition which devastates lives worldwide. The summit culminated in a commitment to strive for a cure or disease-modifying treatment for dementia by 2025, and inspired the creation of the World Dementia Council to steer global action to achieve this ambition. The commitments Mr Cameron made on dementia while in oce have led to tangible changes in the dementia research landscape in the UK. Under the rstPrime Minister's Dementia Challenge, government funding for dementia research doubled between 2012 and 2015. Today we see the impact that this had: inMarch, our analysis revealed that the number of UK dementia researchers had almost doubled over 6 years, as had the number of new breakthroughs being published from dementia studies. These numbers tell us we are gaining ground in the search for much- needed treatments and preventions. Of course, the ght is by no means over - somethingthat Mr Cameron himself highlighted on taking up his voluntary role as our President. Following years of under-investment, we started from a low base and despite increases in funding, dementia research stillChief Executive Hilary Evans highlights how Alzheimer's Research UK is helping advance dementia research, but warns there is still more to be done Hilary Evans, Chief Executive, Alzheimer's Research UKHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 18lags behind other serious health conditions. There is still only one dementia researcher for every \u00a32m of costs to the UK economy attributed to the condition,compared to 10 researchers working on cancer. We need even more ambitious investment if we are toachieve the breakthroughs people living with dementia so desperately need. \"Today we know more than ever before about the diseasesthat cause dementia - now we need to translate that knowledge into new treatments that can transform lives.\" Alzheimer's Research UK That's why at Alzheimer's Research UK, we're focused on increasing our funding for research with a range of strategic initiatives designed to speed up progress - from our network of Drug Discovery Institutes, working to fast-track treatment development, to our \u00a32m Prevention and Risk Reduction Fund, designed to support innovative new research projects to nd new ways of reducing dementia risk. We are proud to be a founding charity partner of the UK Dementia Research Institute - the UK's largest ever joint endeavour in dementia research - and to be working on some unique collabo- rations with the pharmaceutical sector, governmentand academia aimed at accelerating the development of new dementia drugs. To match the immense scale of the challenge we face, we need charities, the government and industry working together to tackle it. Today we know more than ever before about the diseases that cause dementia - now we need to translate that knowledge into new treatments that can transform lives. Dementia is the only leading cause of death in the UK for which numbers are still rising. But research has changed the outlook for other conditions that were once considered a certain death sentence, and we can do the same for dementia - if we lift our ambition and continue to increase our investment. Through a concerted and joined up eort, and with influential individuals like David Cameron helping to galvanise support for research, we know we will get there.

Discovering and developing disease modifying drugs isproving very challenging, with many programmes failing. November 2016 saw another phase 3 failure with Lilly's solanezumab failing at the final stages of development. Is this the end of the amyloid hypothesis or a case of too little, too late and too broad? \"AETIONOMY is an Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) funded consortium established to develop a mechanistic based classification of neurodegenerative diseases, with an initial focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\" The amyloid hypothesis Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neu- rodegenerative disease which usually presents in the seventh or eighth decade of life. However, earlier onset is not uncommon. The cause(s) of AD are not fully understood but the pres- ence of amyloid (protein) plaques in the brain was demonstrated in 1911 and since this time the disease hasbeen thought of as a disease of amy- loidosis. Multiple potential therapies targeting amyloid processing have been developed and studied, with sev- eral still in the development stages. These therapies have all demonstrated an ability to reduce amyloid load in preclinical models, but this has so far not been beneficial to humans. Amyloid is undoubtedly associated with AD and its presence has been a core part of the diagnosis, either post mortem or, more recently, through imaging techniques. However, the amount of amyloid does not correlate with disease severity and many sub- jects have significant amyloid depositsbut no symptoms. Despite these anomalies, the majority of current potential therapies have been target- ing this mechanism. The community eagerly awaits the results of a clinical trial using Biogen's aducanumab as the most promising agent so far, but given the failure of other admittedly less potent molecules targeting amy- loid deposition, many are pessimistic about a good result. Drug development for neurodegenerative diseases at a turning point The failure of these therapies to date could be because the amyloid hypothesis is flawed and, despite theUCB's Duncan McHale outlines why reclassification might be a good idea to boost drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson'sTime for a change of tack on drug development for neurodegenerative diseases? 19PROFILE association, amyloid is a downstream consequence of the disease process and not pathogenic in its own right. However, the presence of familial forms of the disease caused by genes involved in amyloid processing make this unlikely. For example, the prese- nilin 1 gene is part of a protein complex which degrades amyloid, creating the pathological 42 amino acid peptide. \"By 2020 there will be more than 40 million people in the world with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and by 2040, without the development of disease modifying drugs, this will rise to more than 80 million.\" It is much more likely that, for most individuals, amyloid is not the sole cause and additional pathological mechanisms are involved. Indeed we now know that the Tau protein is one of these additional mechanisms. It is therefore time to start focussing on some of these other mechanisms to find the causes of AD, which we can then target with new therapies. We need to look for mechanisms that are important in later stages of the dis- ease process and/or can still be suc- cessfully modified once the very early symptoms appear. AETIONOMY is aconsortium with the sole purpose of identifying these other mechanisms involved in AD and reclassifying neu- rodegenerative disease using these discriminatory mechanisms, which will help us develop new treatments. At AETIONOMY we have been taking the totality of research in AD and, using our knowledge base, integrating this information into a common framework to search for other poten- tial mechanisms. By looking for these other mechanisms we hope to find sub-populations of patients who can be treated by targeting the cause inthem which is present with the amy- loid plaques. Success will result in a new way to classify AD beyond just the presence of memory problems and plaques. Success will also result in new mechanisms for targeting and precision medicines for AD. AETIONOMY AETIONOMY is an Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) funded consortiumestablished to develop a mechanistic based classification of neurodegener- ative diseases, with an initial focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This public private partnership is co-led by myself and Martin Hofman- Apitius from SCAI Fraunhofer. The premise behind the project is that, although large sums have been invested in research in neurodegener- ation and a lot of data generated, the co-ordination and integration of this data across the community has been less well addressed. The consortium has brought together experts in informatics, computing, engineering, mathematical modelling of disease, neuroscience and clinical neurology from leading academic centres, as well as neuroscience, informatics andneurology drug development experts from the EFPIA Industry partners. 20PROFILE Duncan McHale Head of Global Exploratory Development UCB Duncan.McHale@ucb.com Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms ofdementia, accounting for 60%- 80% of all dementia. The neuropatho- logical hallmarks of AD include extracellular -amyloid neurofibril- lary tangles (tau). Neuroimaging stud- ies in humans show that decades before the aggregation of A and tau tangles, cognitively normal individuals had developed metabolic and vascular deficits. In particular, significantlyreduced cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRglc) and cerebral blood follow (CBF) were found in people at high risk for AD several decades before the possible onset of dementia. Brain metabolic and vascular integrity plays an important role in determiningcognitive capability and mental health. Failure to maintain CMRglc has beenshown to lead to cognitive impairment and brain volume atrophy. Similarly, studies have shown that neurovascu- lar risk is highly associated with an accelerated decline in language ability,verbal memory, attention and visuospatial abilities. Reduced CBF is linked to anxiety and depression, and impaired blood-brain barrier is associ- ated with neuroinflammation andsynaptic dysfunction. These metabolic and vascular reductions precede brain structural alteration (grey matter and white matter atrophy) and cognitiveimpairment. Therefore, preserving brain metabolism and hemodynamicsare critical for optimising our lifespan, as well as our health span. Caloric restriction (CR), without malnutrition, has been repeatedly shown to extend life expectancy, as well as enhance brain functions. On biochemical and molecular levels, CR shows to improve glucose homeosta- sis and insulin sensitivity, up-regulate brain-derived neuro-trophic factor,reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and retention of A and tau. CR also shows beneficial effects on vascular systems by decreasing blood pres- sure, atherogenic lipids, inflammatorycytokines and increased cellular stressresistance. In line with this, animals treated with CR had lower incidences of age-related neurodegenerative disorders and diabetes. To study the functions in a living brain in real time, non-invasive neuroimag-ing methods have been developed as powerful tools for identifying in vivo metabolic and vascular biomarkers. For example, using positron emission tomog- raphy (PET), and CBF by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our group also uses magnetic resonance spec- troscopy (MRS) to measure levels ofvarious brain metabolites, mitochon- drial oxidative metabolism, and neuronal activity. We have used this state-of-the-art, multimodal imaging technology to identify CR effects in brain aging. Recent neuroimaging studies with mice In a recent animal study, we found an age-dependent decline in CBF, neu- ronal adenosine triphosphate in mice fed with ad libitum (ad lib; mean-Ai-Ling Lin of the Lin Brain Lab details how neuroimaging research can be used to reduce brain aging and the impact of Alzheimer's diseasePreventing Alzheimer's disease with neuroimaging methods 21PROFILE ing \"at one's pleasure\"). However, all these physiological functions preserve with age in mice fed with a 40% CR diet. Interestingly, we found CR also has significant effects in young mice (5-6 months of age). Within 2 months taking the diet, the young mice show significantly enhanced CBF, TCr, ATP, and taurine (related to neurotrans-mission), compared to age-matchedmice fed ad lib. In addition, CR causes a metabolic shift in the mice at a very early age. Instead of using glucose as the predominant energy source for sustaining brain functions, young CR mice shifts to use ketone bodies as the fuel. In bodies with increased ketone, their metabolism suggests increased oxidative metabolism. Utili- sation of ketone bodies significantly elevates the oxygen utilisation in mitochondria through beta-oxidation of fatty acid. This is supported by evi- dence from isolated mitochondria and our imaging results that old animals with CR diet had preserved oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial functions, and neuronal activity compared to the age-matched ad lib animals. The increased oxidative metabolism also plays a critical role in preventing Aretention. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that cognition-associ- ated brain regions have non-oxidative glycolysis exceeding the required needs of oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis (AG). Excessive AG (or the \"Warburg effect\") is a key process that sustains T cell activation and differen- tiation, and is involved in inflamma- tory-mediated conditions. In line with this, the distribution of AG in normal young adults is spatially correlated with A deposition in AD patients andcognitively normal individuals with elevated A. Animal studies further demonstrated that A plaque forma- tion is an activity dependent process associated with AG. Therefore, increased oxidative metabolism in cognition-related regions maydecrease AG and thus reduce the risk for AD, consistent with the literature that CR reduces AD-like symptoms in mice. Reduced AD risk was also found in rhesus monkeys, showing CR impedes age-related iron deposition in the brain, which consequently reduces the potential interaction between metal and A, and thusdecelerates the pathogenesis of AD. CR has repeatedly shown to improve memory in aging, both for studies in humans and animals. We had similar observations in a recent study, show- ing CR had significantly protective effects on learning and spatial memory for old mice. The cognitive outcomes are correlated with CBF in hippocampus and frontal cortex, the brain areas regulating learning and memory. The findings indicate that the level of CBF in cognition-associ- ated brain regions may play a critical role for determining performances on learning and spatial memory. We further identified that the anxiety level in the mice had significant and inverse correlations with CBF in hippocampus and in frontal cortex. These findings indicate that preservation of CBF with age is pivotal for sustaining memory and mental health. More importantly, this positive impact on cognitive functions may also be attributed to early-life changes in neurovascular and neurometabolic functions. A recent study suggested that neuro- protective mechanisms play a major role during early stages and compen-satory mechanisms in later stages of neurological diseases. This is consis- tent with our imaging findings that CR induces early enhancements, and later preservation, on brain metabolic and vascular physiology. In summary, CR has repeatedly shown to extend lifespan and health span in various animal models. Using neu-roimaging methods, we demonstrated that CR induces early enhancements in brain metabolic and vascular func- tions, and preserves these functions with age; the preservation of brain functions is highly associated with cognition and mental health in aging mice fed with CR. As neuroimaging canbe readily applied to humans, it has tremendous translational values to identify dietary effects to slow brain aging and prevent AD in humans.

Currently there is no known cure and as the function of the brain is known to gradually decline, the condition can be portrayed through a negative viewpoint. Anecdotal and published material from people diagnosed with the condition however stress that correctly timed education and available support networks enable them to live more normal lives, and improve the quality of their experiencewith Parkinson's. This happens through interdependent relationships with diering groups of people (family, friends, peers through the voluntary sector, health professionals, social care providers and employers), from the time around the diagnosis, and ongoing through the course of the condition. Progression of Parkinson's The symptoms and progression of Parkinson's dier between individuals, sometimes making diagnosis dicult. It may take a few years before the atypical Parkinson's conditions are distinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's, the most common form. There are certain symptomshowever that are experienced more commonly, cate- gorised according to their eect on movement (motor symptoms) or other issues (non-motor symptoms).Non-motor symptoms can include altered sleep, low mood, altered processing of thoughts, sometimes aecting how easily a person can do more than one task at a time, and memory, plus physiological changes, such as constipation or waxy skin. The main motor symptoms are slower movement in all people (bradykinesia), involuntary shaking (tremor) in some, usually observed as a hand or foot tremor, and the experience of muscle stiness (rigidity). Thecombination of stiness and slowness can cause movements to become smaller. People may experiences these with altered swallowing and speech (quiet voice, less melodic speech pattern), changes to facial expres- sion to become more mask-like, changes to writing (becomes smaller), as well as smaller, more shuing steps when walking. The symptoms rst appear on one side of the body and are thought to arise as a result of the loss of a chemical called dopamine in the brain, which helps regulate movement. It is important to note that not everyone will experience the vast array of motor or non-motor symptoms. Physiotherapists work as part of a team of health and social care professionals to support individuals with Parkinson's in achieving their best possible lifestyle. This might involve providing information about Parkinson's, including a link to the vital social network provided through the voluntary sector. Here, peers have the experience to answer questions about Parkinson's and what the future may hold from one perspective, just asthe professionals can oer their skills and knowledge from a dierent angle. People don't die directly because of Parkinson's, and therefore, they should be encour- aged to take up opportunities to share ideas on how to manage living with the condition with others through a wide support network. Managing Parkinson's through physiotherapy The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocate physiotherapy for people with Parkin- son's. Physiotherapists help people aected by injury, illness or long-term conditions through movement and exercise, manual therapy, education and advice. Where people cannot 'recover' from a condition such as Parkinson's, a role of physiotherapy is to enable people to remain independent and well for as long as possible, regardless of age, manage discomfort or pain, and Writing on behalf of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, Dr. Bhanu Ramaswamy highlights how physiotherapy can help manage the symptoms of Parkinson'sHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 24prevent the complications from a less active lifestyle that occurs secondary to the main condition. A thorough assessment and dialogue between the physiotherapist and person with Parkinson's will identify goals and life priorities to enable planning of areas that require intervention, especially focusing on the ability to carry out everyday tasks based on their unique needs. In general, the benets of physiotherapy for people with Parkinson's and the people most close to them include improving or maintaining tness through exer- cise (especially for balance, strength and flexibility);helping with movement control to maintain independ-ence and prevent or manage falls; help alleviating pain, and ensuring posture is optimised as this aects breathing, swallowing, tasks such as turning (in bed orwhen walking) and balance, including tasks such as walking or getting up out of a chair. Whilst the medical management of Parkinson's is through the prescription of drugs, exercise and move- ment therapies are also necessary to help manage many Parkinson's symptoms. When someone is newly diagnosed, the emphasis of physiotherapy is to support the individual to identify activities to take on or keep up with, to stay t, activeand healthy, thus minimising the impact of Parkinson's later in life. This includes the use of leisure and third sector programmes to promote general tness andinclusion in community activity. For people with Parkin- son's, it is vital to consider taking exercise daily as one would take medication. No exercise done correctly has been demonstrated as harmful, and when done prop- erly, it can help recalibrate slow and small movement (motor symptoms) associated with Parkinson's. Inaddition to the physical benets of training targeted to symptoms of Parkinson's, exercise has been shown to help in managing non-motor symptoms, and physio-logical (including brain) and mental health. There may be a point as the individual ages, as the con-dition progresses, or when Parkinson's is only one of their medical conditions when some of the symptoms of Parkinson's may have a bigger impact on day-to-daylife. At this point a physiotherapist can problem-solve with the individual to consider their needs. They may then teach family and friends strategies to help with better movement that minimise injury to anyone, with an emphasis on everyone staying active and safe. Treat- ments focus on teaching strategies to overcome di-culty in generating automatic movement and thought that are aecting daily function (dual tasking). For exam- ple, external cueing, such as auditory, tactile, visual andsensory cues, or attentional strategy training (e.g.mental rehearsal and visualisation of movement).

About 1% of people aged above 50 are affected worldwide. In Europe alone 1.2 million people suffer from Parkinson's disease, 127,000 of whom reside in the UK. According to Imperial College London, the direct and indirect costs to British society are roughly \u00a32 billion each year. These costs are expected to rise with increasing life expectancy. Parkinson's disease The hallmarks of Parkinson's include general slowing and paucity of move- ment, increased rigidity, reduced facial expression and an emerging tremor in one or both hands. While these symptoms are instrumental in diagno- sis, the disorder is - by then - already ongoing for several years. Before being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients will have suffered a number of prodromal symptoms such as loss of smell, constipation, depressive periods, sleep disorders, lack of motivation, cognitive decline and more for several years. Each separate symptom may not have been worth visiting the GP and the symptoms do not present themselves in every patient nor in any specific sequence. Somewhere between 50 and 60 years of age, however, patients eventually develop tremors and will be referred to a neurologist and diagnosed. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hornykewicz and fellow neurochemists demonstrated a clear depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine in striataltissues (called caudate-putamen in man) of Parkinsonian brains. Moreover, correlating the extent of depletion with clinical records, it became clear that by the time patients got diagnosed with PD, 60-80% of dopamine was lost when compared to healthy people of the same age. Moreover, this deple- tion of dopamine was matched by a 40-60% loss of dopaminergic cellbodies in the substantia nigra, the origin of the dopaminergic nerve cells projecting onto the striatal brain tissue. Two important conclusions are that by the time PD is diagnosed, the patient has already lost their erstwhile massive dopamine reserve. Secondly, about 50% of dopaminergic cells are still alive and offer a promising basis for protecting these cells and restoring adequate dopamine neurotransmis- sion, which is the basis for Genecode's innovation. Pharmacological developments for Parkinson's disease With the neurochemical basis for PD in hand, many research groups world- wide quickly built a comprehensive framework to monitor dopaminergic neurotransmission and to create methods that compensate for the progressive loss of dopamine in PD. Why dopaminergic cell loss speeds up in some people is still unknown. However, patients have benefited greatly from the use of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA which is converted into dopamine in the brain. With such replenishment patients regain control of voluntary movementsand tremors and ancillary symptoms are limited. As L-DOPA therapy turned out to have a limited window of opportunity, the introduction of dopamine-mimetic drugs like Pergolide, Lisuride, Pramipexole and Talipexole, proved to be very effective to normalise motor symptoms in PD patients and to delay the need for L-DOPA as the final recourse to suppress PD symptoms. Looking back on more than 50 years of Parkinson research, and appreciating the enormous progress that has been achieved, still, neurologists have little option but to treat symptoms only. Neurotrophic factors Victor Hamburger and Rita Levi- Montalcini found in their research on neurodevelopment that certain humoral factors could control the development of neural contacts. These factors were secreted by target organs such as muscle and stimulated con- nections between the nerve cells and their target organs. Levi-Montalcini and Stanley Cohen subsequently identifiedthe prototypic neurotrophic factor Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), which the iden-tification of BDNF, CNTF, NT-3, NT-4,CDNF and MANF. We now know that the target-derived neurotrophism is a universal principle with the peripheral nervous system. It is logically assumed that this also applies to the formation of neural circuits in the brain to initiate and maintain neural circuits. This complex interplay between variouscell systems and its dynamics during development and adulthood makes aProtecting and restoring dopaminergic nerve cells in Parkinson's disease 25PROFILEchallenging landscape and is extremely relevant for neurodegeneration as well. In that context, Lin et al. in the biotech company Synergen, discovered glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor GDNF - a dimeric complex of glycosy- lated proteins - that was able to rescue dopaminergic neurons in vitro. This was quickly confirmed and extended towards animal experiments. Based on the accumulated preclinical data on GDNF, several clinical trials were subsequently conducted to demonstrate GDNF's importance in Parkinson's. Although some clinical benefits were seen in a few small phase I/II open-label studies with GDNF and its close congener Neurturin, the placebo-controlled large scale trials failed to reach their primary end-points. As GDNF protein does not pass the blood-brain barrier and as local brain injections do not warrant adequate distribution, the therapeutic use of GDNF appears complicated. Genecode and small molecule GDNF-mimetics While neurotrophic factors were being discovered, other research groups focused on their receptors. Mart Saarma and coworkers at the University of Helsinki (Finland) and a few other research groups independently iden- tified the GDNF receptor. The GDNF receptor is made up of a signalling moiety RET and a ligand-binding moiety, called GFR. Together they form a high-affinity receptor for GDNF. Shortly thereafter, three more GFRs were identified which show preference to either GDNF (GFR1) or three of its close congeners, Neurturin (GFR2), and Persephin(GFR4). RET toexert their effects upon activation.As GDNF protein is not practical as future PD therapy, Mart Saarma and Mati Karelson (University of Tartu, together with Mehis Pilv and Tom Waldin founded Genecode to identify small molecules that mimic GDNF and trigger neurotrophic sig- nalling in dopaminergic neurons. High throughput screens made by Maxim Bespalov in Saarma's laboratory deliv- ered several hits activating GDNF receptors. Subsequent optimisation of these hits by computational mod- elling methods by Karelson and his their biologicalactivity. Yulia Sidorova and coworkers in Saarma's lab demonstrated that some compounds showed neuroprotection and promotion of neurite outgrowth, similar to the effects of GDNF. Surpris- ingly, in animal models selected GDNF-mimetics were found to restore dopaminergic neurons weeks after they were lesioned by neurotoxins. Thus, GDNF-mimetic small molecules can protect and regenerate dopamin- ergic innervation patterns in striatal brain areas which results in normalised motor behavior. Future considerations With protection and restoration of dopaminergic neurons by small molecule GDNF-mimetics, Genecode has established the GDNF receptor as a druggable target. With the advent of GDNF mimetics, the degeneration and death of remaining dopaminergic neurons can be stopped and survivingcells can be stimulated to reinnervate the striatum and restore adequate dopamine levels to regain movement control. The present compounds arein the process of further preclinical development but they need to be further improved and thoroughly evaluated for both efficacy and safetybefore they can be tested clinically in man. With its GDNF-mimetics, Genecode opened a novel chapter in PD research with the hope of actually curing Parkinson's disease. For patients and their treating neurologists, future therapy would consist of GDNF-mimetic drugs alone or in combination with dopamine-mimetic drugs. Genecode believes that with GDNF-mimetics PD patients may continue an active life- style without Parkinsonian symptoms, thereby effectively curing an otherwise progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Improved monitoring of prodromal symptoms would further contribute to neuroprotective therapy and would positively impact on the burden to society.

As dened by the NIDCD, a communication disorder can include a child's voice that may be too weak, hoarse or strained; how a child speaks; problemsmaking speech sounds; or problems with how a child learns and understand words or sentences. Statistics from 2015 revealed that nearly 8% of children aged between 3 and 17 experienced a communication or swallowing disorder, within a 12 month period. Among those, 55% of children received treatment during the same 12 month period. It was reported that 5% had speech problems, 3.3% of children had language problems, and 1.4% reporting a problem with their voice. Language is dened as the expression of human com- munication, by which knowledge, belief and behaviour can be experienced, explained and shared. Language disorders don't only aect children, approximately 17.9 million adults in the U.S have trouble using their voices, with between 6 and 8 million people having some form of language impairment. However, language disorders do aect children and adults dierently, children can acquire an impairment from birth, whereas many adults gain disorders due to a stroke or head injury or even through some form of dementia. Speech disorders Speech disorders are something that is usually picked up in early childhood development stages. During early childhood years, children learn how to regulate the muscles used to produce understandable speech,which is a gradual process. The NIDCD reports that by the rst grade (6 years old), 5% of children have notice-able speech disorders. One of the most well-known forms of speech disorder is stuttering, which aects around 3 million people in America. Stuttering can include repetitions of speech sounds, hesitations before and during speaking and the prolonged emphasis on speech sounds. The NIDCD outlines that , \"the majority of speech disorders in the preschool years occur in children who are developing normally in all other areas. Speech disorders may also occur in children who have developmental disabilities.\" Specic language impairment Specic language impairment (SLI) is a language disor- der that is one of the most common childhood disabil- ities, aecting 7 to 8% of children in kindergarten. However, despite it being one of the most common disabilities in children, SLI is still very much unknown. If not treated early SLI can aect a child's performance at school, as it aects reading and learning. The NIDCD says: \"Since the early signs of SLI are often present in children as young as 3 years old, the preschool years can be used to prepare them for kindergarten with special programmes designed toenrich language development.\" The NIDCD sponsors a wide range of research and stud- ies to help develop further knowledge on the develop- ment and treatment of speech and language disorders. The research also aims to help improve diagnostic capabilities and ne-tune more eective treatments. \"An ongoing area of study is the search for better ways to diagnose and dierentiate among various types ofHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 28speech delay,\" the NIDCD outlines. \"A large study following approximately 4,000children is gathering data as the children grow to establish reliable signs and symptoms forspecic speech disorders, which can then be used to develop accurate diagnostic tests.\" Developing new treatments for SLI is crucial A recent clinical trial at the Uni- versity of Kansas, funded by the NIDCD, uses book reading to help kindergarten children withspecic language impairment learn words. The trial was reported by the NIDCD to have helped determine the number of times a childwith SLI needs to hear a word to learn it. Which is revealed as 36 times, compared with 12 times for children that develop at a typical rate. The clinical trial could be crucial and the rst step needed to develop an eective treatment for children with SLI. Holly Storkel, who directed the trial and is pro- fessor and chair of the University of Kansas' highlyranked Department of Speech -Language- Hearing: Sciences and Disorders, said that treatment for chil-dren with SLI is a critical need. \"Children with SLI have diculty learning new words, which puts them at risk for later reading problems and academic failure,\" she said. Using an escalation method for the trial, 27 kinder- garten children with SLI were randomised to one of 4 intensities of interactive book reading: 12, 24, 36 and 48. Following 36 exposures, the trial reported that there were no further improvement in word learning.Storkel explained that one of the promising aspects of developing a treatment based on book reading is that it could be administered by parents and teachers with minimal training.\"For now, parents of children with SLI should realise that their children need to practice a new word often to be able to learn and remember it,\" she said. \"When you notice that there is a word your child doesn't know, try to nd ways to work that word into everyday activities, conversations and book reading, and realise that this will need to be dine over many weeks.\" The work of the NIDCD and research institutions such as the University of Kansas are crucial to help develop key treatment for speech and language disorders for SLI. Every day, NIDCD-funded researchers are working to better understand voice production and ways to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of voice disorders. As something we use every day, it's important to take care of our voices, as this year's motto for World Voice Day said, \"VO!CE, the original social media.\" Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov The human language faculty has received centuries of interest by scholars of different disciplines, including philosophers, linguists, psy- chologists, educators, among others. It is widely admired as a remarkable gift by nature to humans, regarded as a unique characteristic of humans among the many species of living things. Children around the world acquire their native language without explicit teaching, even though lan- guages come in many different forms - 6,000 different languages are estimated to be in use today. Just as walking is expected for young children everywhere, so is talking in sentences that can be understood by adults. The language-learning task in front of babies is now known to be incredibly complex, which makes this universal achievement even more impressive and at the same time, because it is universal, often thought to be simplebecause babies can do it. Raising awareness for specific language impairment The fact that it is so easy for most children obscures the fact that it is selectively difficult for some children. Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) are sometimes described as having the most common, but unrecognised, develop- mental disorder of childhood (and probably adulthood, too, given new outcome data). The point of this article is to bring SLI to the attention of policy makers, experts, and opinionleaders in public health, medicine, and education, as a largely unrecognised yet high impact disorder of childhood that persists into adulthood, creates high costs to societies and life-long frustrations or shame to the affected persons. It is undoubtedly a crucial but often misunderstood barrier to personal self-actualisation in life. According to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communicative Diseases (NIDCD) in the U.S., Specific language impairment is defined as \"alanguage disorder that delays the mastery of language skills in children who have no hearing loss or other development delays.\" Population- based studies report 7-10% of 5-year- old children have SLI, making it the most common manifestation oflanguage impairments in children and the most common early childhood disorder, more common than Atten- tion Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and autism combined. Chil- dren with SLI are at high risk for lower academic achievement relative to age peers, to encounter difficulties estab-lishing social relationships and to end their education at high school comple- tion 1,2. Language impairments are associated with increased health costs starting in early childhood and approaching the teen years3. Modelled outcomes from 5 to 34 years shows increased risk of unemployment forchildren with a history of SLI 4. Girls with a history of SLI are almost 3 times more likely to experience sexualabuse as adolescents or young adults than girls without SLI 5. Multiple stud-Mabel L. Rice, University of Kansas highlights specific language impairment and why it often goes unrecognised as health disorderOverlooked by public health: Specific language impairment 29PROFILE ies report that only about 25% of chil- dren with SLI receive treatment when they enter school, around age 5 years. Why SLI has a low profile in healthcare sectors Although there is increasing reason to view SLI as an important public health issue, it has a very low profile in public health forums. An important exception is the recent inclusion of the goal to increase the proportion of childrenwith language disorders who receive intervention services as part of the Healthy People 2020 initiative in the U.S., developed by the Office of Dis - ease Prevention and Health Promo - tion. In the press of life-threatening diseases around the world that threaten the well-being of children andtheir families, it could be argued that SLI would be a \"mild\" disorder that could be deferred for a later time when more resources are available. On the other hand, it is clear that in modern societies the ability to use language well is increasingly important for all sorts of life interactions. It is crucial for the effective use of electronic media, understanding the many documents of the modern world, mastering an academic curriculum, advocating for oneself whether in childhood disputes or threat situations, in applying for a first job, health literacy, and engaging in the interactions of commerce. As indicated by the few studies of long-term outcomes of children with SLI, economic risk is likely to be part of the scenario. At the level of scientific inquiry, over- looking the presence of language impairments can complicate interpre-tation of outcomes of studies of children with autism, ADHD, or low nonverbal intelligence, who may or may not have language impairments 6,7. For example, in paediatric studies evaluating diseases such as HIV and associated treatments, recent detailed studies of language impair- ments show that language impair- ment is the most common adverse outcome8and those predictors are not the same for children who have language impairments selectively or in combination with hearing loss or low nonverbal intelligence9-11. The point here is that public policy expertise is vital for a better under- standing of the social and economic consequences of SLI and possible treatment options. Conversely, a better understanding of SLI is vital for the necessary studies of public policy that bear on this important condition. This paper is the first in a series ofpapers to appear in subsequent issues of Open Access Government. Future instalments will address these questions: How is the language of chil- dren with SLI different from typical children? How does SLI compare toHearing Loss, Speech Sound Disorder, Intellectual impairment or ADHD? What causes SLI? What are the social consequences of SLI? What should public policy experts consider for future investigations and ways to pursue effective treatments? References 1 Tomblin JB.

For many, the answer to this question would be - very little. Despite the fact that 2 children in every primary classroom will have DLD (7.6% of children), wider understanding of the condition is in fact limited.As researcher Courtenay Norbury reflected: \"develop- mental language disorder is probably the most common childhood condition you have never heard of\". Previously known as specic language impairment (SLI), children and young people with DLD have persist-ent diculties in understanding and/ or production of spoken language. The cause in most cases is unknown and there is no obvious reason for these diculties, for example there is no hearing problem or physical disability that explains them. But why the name change? The term SLI has in recent times been felt to be somewhat ambiguous, and thebelief was that confusion about the terminology has aected how children can access services, how it is identied and prioritised in schools and how research is funded. Consequently Professor Dorothy Bishop led a consortium of researchers, clinical and education practitioners, policy makers and representatives from parent organisations to achieve consensus on a diagnos- ticterm that was more meaningful to the wider public. The panel agreed on developmental language disorder (DLD) in place of SLI. What does DLD mean for a child or young person? A child can be diagnosed with DLD if their language diculties are likely to carry on into adulthood, if their diculties impact signicantly on their progress at school, or on everyday life and they are unlikely to catch up without help. DLD can look dierent in eachchild and can be complicated to understand becauseof this, and because the cause is unknown. For a diagnosis of DLD a child will often have dicultiesunderstanding language, but they may also have di-culties putting their thoughts into words and sentences. You may see the following characteristics: They may have diculty saying what they want to, even though they have ideas; They may struggle to nd the words they want to use;Mandy Grist, Speech and Language Advisor at children's communication charity I CAN, sheds light on developmental language disorder - previously known as SLI Mandy Grist, Speech and Language AdvisorHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 32They may talk in sentences but be dicult to understand; They may sound muddled and it may be dicult to follow what they are saying. A child with DLD won't necessarily sound like a younger child; instead their speech might sound disorganised or unusual; They may nd it dicult to understand words and long instructions; They may have diculty remembering the words they want to say; They may nd it hard to join in and follow what is going on in the playground. Children with DLD often struggle at school. This is because so much learning depends on being able tounderstand and use language. Children with DLD won't just 'pick up' language; they will need to be taught language skills in a special way. They can do well, but they will need the right support in order to reach their full potential. This support will be from a speech andlanguage therapist, along with other specialists like a language advisory teacher. Children with DLD may struggle because they easily lose concentration as all their eorts are spent making sense of the language in instructions; it can be dicult to listen and work things out at the same time. These children can have diculty learning new words and ideas, and may struggle to keep up - by the time theyhave thought how to say an answer, the teacher has moved on to something else. Supporting children with developmental language disorder Common principles of support for children and young people with DLD include repeated exposure to new words and ideas. In a typical lesson, new ideas and words are introduced once or twice, however children with DLD need to hear and use them much more than this. They require spoken instructions to be broken downinto simpler, shorter sentences and/ or for the spoken information to be presented in a visual way, for example using pictures or gestures. Whilst this extra processing time may help, it is important to remember that childrenwith DLD won't automatically interpret and understand new meanings. There are 'rules' in every language for how sounds are put together, how we learn what new words mean, grammatical rules for sentences, social rules for conversations. Unlike their peers, children with DLD will need these rules explicitly taught. Good speech, language and communication skills are vital for learning and a clear predictor of children's aca- demic success and social and emotional well-being. But, despite their diculties with language, children with DLD can achieve well at school, both academically and socially. They just learn dierently. Knowing their best learning style is therefore crucial to understanding how best to support them. \"A child can be diagnosed with DLD if their language difficulties are likely to carry on into adulthood, if their difficulties impact significantly on their progress at school, or on everyday life and they are unlikely to catch up without help\" I CAN, the children's communication charity, in partner-ship with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) are leading on Bercow: Ten Years On - a review of provision for children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN), including those children and young people with DLD.

My recent appointment as the latest Sci- entic Director of the CIHR-IAPH allows me the chance to consider our mandate and our opportunities to bol-ster the self-determination of Indigenous communities to become healthier Nations, groups and individuals. As researchers, we are committed to working with the priorities Indigenous communities see for themselves in order to advance their progress in becoming health- ier communities. The IAPH fosters the advancement of a national health research agenda to promote and improve the health of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples in Canada through research, knowledge translation and capacitybuilding. The Institute's pursuit of research excellence is enhanced by our respect for community research pri- orities and Indigenous knowledge, values and cultures.Our goal is to contribute to the improvement of the health and wellbeing of Indigenous people in every part of Canada. We will stimulate health research with andfor Indigenous communities, build a community of Indigenous researchers who can engage in \"two-eyed seeing\" research (conducted using Indigenous research paradigms side by side with other paradigms such as those involving Western epistemologies), form researchpartnerships with organisations in Canada and abroad, involve Indigenous communities respectfully in everyproject undertaken, and create new knowledge. Addressing the issue of poor health Canada's recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) presented all Canadians with 94 Calls to Action. Some of these are calls to the government to address the issue of the poor health of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. The TRC calls upon governments to acknowl-edge that the current state of Indigenous health is a direct result of previous Canadian government policies, including Aboriginal residential schools, and to recognise and implement the healthcare rights of Indigenous people as identied in international law, constitutional law, and under the Treaties. Other calls to action includehaving the federal government identify measurable goals to determine the gaps and to report on progress toward closing those gaps in health outcomes betweenIndigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples, increasing the number of Indigenous healthcare professionals, and compelling those who can eect change within the Canadian healthcare system to recognise the value of Indigenous healing practices and to make them available when treating Indigenous clients. Good research can inform good policy and practice and thereby help to achieve good results for people in need. Good research into Indigenous health requires us to see the Indigenous communities we want to work with as partners in Indigenous health research from the early stage of setting research priorities right through to reporting on our research in a way that is accessible, meaningful and, therefore, useful to Indigenous communities. We must be guided by theCarrie Bourassa, Scientific Director, CIHR-IAPH discusses the issue of poor health among Indigenous communities and says research is the key to tackling it HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 34Indigenous communities that are our research part- ners. These communities are not subjects of research; they are active participants in the entire research enterprise. Indigenous communities have protocols forsharing knowledge, and researchers must learn and respect these protocols when undertaking research. Building research capacity An important part of the CIHR-IAPH mission is to build research capacity in the First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tiscommunities. We will do this by mentoring, supporting,and encouraging a new generation of Indigenous people to become health researchers and to create new knowledge that will improve the health and wellbeing of Indigenous communities. We will also help to negotiate partnerships and alliances between Indigenous communities and non-Indigenous health research organisations and institutes at the local, regional, national and international levels. It is central to our mission and our values that, in creating new knowledge to benet Indigenous peoples, the CIHR-IAPH supports health research that respects Indigenous cultures. Part of our task is to make sure that this is how all CIHR-funded health research is conducted and to actas a resource for all of the other CIHR institutes, toensure that all researchers understand the Indigenous perspectives on the issues they are researching andinclude the Indigenous perspectives in their work. The challenges to helping to create healthier Indigenous Peoples and communities are large, but the benets of doing good research in a way that respects and con- tributes to Indigenous communities and actively involves Indigenous communities in the research project make the eort worthwhile. I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish with Indigenous communities in my years as Scientic Director. Carrie Bourassa, PhDScientific Director The Canadian Institutes of Health Research Institute of Aboriginal Peoples' Research Carrie.Bourassa@cihr-irsc.gc.ca www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html www.twitter.com/CIHR_IRSC Dr. Janet McElhaney, Dr. Jennifer Walker and Dr. Carrie BourassaCanada's Indigenous population is composed of First Nation (FN), Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples. They often suffer from a greater burden of disease, notably chronic (e.g. diabetes1,2) and infectious ones (e.g. tuberculosis3), than the rest of the non-Indigenous Canadian population. Part of the health problems faced by Canadian Indigenous populations stems from the cultural disconnect that exists between the health care and ser- vices offered by public sanitary organi-sations, on the one hand, and the worldview of several Indigenous peo- ples, on the other 4. Thus, North Ameri- can Indigenous populations are deeply connected to the Earth and nature. Their health is therefore intuitively more holistic and interconnected with their communities and their environ- ment. Consequently, health care and the response to disease also call to a more holistic approach. Aside from being morally and socially reprehensible, the health inequities afflicting Indigenous Canadians put a significant burden on the Canadian health care system. Apart from high health care costs related to the severity of afflictions, considerable travel and living costs are required by individuals residing in more remote areas, who must be transferred to major centersin order to receive appropriate care. As will be argued in the next sections, Indigenous traditional medicine rep-resents a valuable avenue to explore in order to reduce the burden of health inequities, the cultural discon- nect of modern therapeutics, and the high economic cost of Indigenous health care. Indigenous traditional knowledge and traditional medicine: Valuable opportunities for improved indigenous health Indigenous traditional knowledge (TK) in general, and traditional medicine (TM) in particular, has shown remark- able resiliency in most Canadian Indigenous communities5, even though its transfer to younger genera- tions is currently critically threatened. Indigenous TM is a science that isrooted in so-called \"Natural Laws\" and involves a close contact with nature, aswell as a deep understanding of its ele- ments and their uses for human health and wellbeing. It is also a common misconception to consider Indigenous TK and TM as static or retrograde. TM is a true science and as such evolves continuously. Elders are notably wellaware of the precariousness of TK andTM, while they also fully understand the urgent need to help their fellow community members dealing with chronic or infectious diseases. It is therefore both timely and perti- nent to consider Indigenous TM as afeasible and, strangely enough, innova-tive means to reduce health inequitiesthroughout Canadian Indigenous pop- ulations. Firstly, Indigenous TM hasproven to be safe and efficient, both in historical and contemporary terms 6. Secondly, Indigenous TM is very cultur- ally connected. It is thus plausible that Indigenous people will comply better with treatments originating from their own culture than they do with \"modern\" medicine. It must alsobe stressed that Indigenous TM is a holistic paradigm whereby not only the physical part of the diseased individual is encouraged to participate in the healing process (for instance, by taking a traditional medicinal plant prepara- tion), but also the mental, emotional and spiritual parts. \"Aside from being morally and socially reprehensible, the health inequities afflicting Indigenous Canadians put a significant burden on the Canadian health care system. Apart from high health care costs related to the severity of afflictions, considerable travel and living costs are required by individuals residing in more remote areas, who must be transferred to major centers in order to receive appropriate care.\" Including Indigenous TM in health care also carries great potential to reduce the economic burden of health inequities. Indeed, through the use of local human and natural resources, the cost of therapeutic regimens can bereduced. This holds true even if Indige- nous people continue using both con- temporary pharmaceutical treatments and TM. Indeed, it is conceivable thatProfessor Pierre S. Haddad shares the challenges of overcoming health inequality for Canadian indigenous populations and highlights solutions to the issue Ensuring health equity for Canadian indigenous populations 35PROFILEcombining TM with modern drugs may reduce the dose and length of treat- ment required with pharmaceuticals. If Indigenous TM can mitigate, even par- tially, the impact of several chronic orinfectious diseases, a greater fraction of the population will remain healthy or will develop less severe forms of chronic diseases and their complica- tions. This in turn should diminish the number of Indigenous patients that need to be sent to large urban centers to be treated. Lastly, Indigenous elders or knowledge holders will get recognition and could potentially derive a non-negligible income from their practice. Of course, this raises the question of the \"profes- sional\" framework within which Indige- nous TM will need to be practiced, but this issue is beyond the scope of the present discussion. Given that Indige- nous TM should be delivered in a safe, efficient and ethical way, additional wealth could be generated from its practice and related activities (forinstance, collecting medicinal plants and preparing traditional remedies). The consequence should also involve a reduction of poverty, one of the major social determinants of Indige- nous health. Challenges and solutions Turning to Indigenous TM to reduce health inequities comprises a fair share of challenges. Major ones are: 1) Historical devaluation of Indigenous TM, with ensuing skepticism from themedical establishment; 2) Mistrust by several Indigenous peoples of theestablished order, with associatedconcrete fear of misappropriation of TK and TM and biopiracy; 3) Potentiallyharmful herb-drug interactions; and 4) The development of appropriate models to include Indigenous TM into current healthcare systems. Many call for the integration of Indige- nous TM in Indigenous health care. However, the word \"integration\" raises some profound questions in many FN, Inuit and M\u00e9tis minds. Indeed, integra- tion may lead to a form of assimilation or subordination that many Indige- nous people fear. Given the power imbalance between the established government-run medical system and the parallel practice of Indigenous TM,such fears are legitimate. Although these challenges can appear quite daunting, a number of fruitful endeavors have nevertheless seen the light in Canada and abroad, whereby Indigenous TM is being used safely and efficiently alongside modern health care. The key issues related to success- ful outcomes in such projects includethe following: 1) Indigenous and non-Indigenous stakeholders must be engaged in truly equitable and empowering partnerships; 2) Theagenda must be set by and for Indige- nous communities; 3) Partnerships need to be based on mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual apprecia- tion; and 4) Cultural brokers need to beinvolved to ensure proper knowledgetransfer and exchange. In short, Indigenous TK and TM are viable tools to consider for the reduc- tion of health inequities afflicting Indigenous populations, notably interms of chronic and infectious diseases. Because of the cultural and paradigm gaps that exist betweencurrent health care approaches and Indigenous TM, it is highly recom- mended that partnerships be devel- oped among stakeholders and that these include culturally competent partners.

The most recognised clinical manifestation of heavy and dependant drinking is the development of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), a complex disorder which covers a wide spectrum of conditions including accumu- lation of fat in the liver, development of liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver cancer. The most florid presentation of ALD is alcoholic hepatitis which is a progressive inflammatory condition with very high rates of mortality. Addressing the underlying psychological addiction toalcohol and abstinence remain the mainstay of treat- ment for alcoholic liver disease and there are limited therapeutic options for the underlying physical disease. There are several reasons for this lack of options. Firstly, historically there has been very limited investment in research with a consequent dearth of basic scientic studies as well as clinical trials, despite the signicant global burden. This was very sharply reflected by the dEath TO trial score (ETOh) discussed by Vijay H Shah 'Alcoholic Liver Disease: The Buzz May Be Gone, but the Hangover Remains', published in the Journal Hepatology in 2010. This ratio represents the estimated population mortality rate to the number of clinical trials focused on a particular disease, with a high score reflecting the low number of clinical trials. The ETOh score for ALD was found to be 358, compared to 1.4 for hepatitis B virus infection, 4.9 for hepatitis C virus infection and 15.2 for primary biliary cirrhosis. Why alcoholic liver disease hasreceived such limited research attention is a matter of debate but some people have suggested that this may be due to the stigma associated with alcohol abuse. Dia- betes and obesity, both of which are also closely related to lifestyle choices and behaviours, do not seem to have suered the same fate. However, this situation does seem to be changing and the last few years have seen an expansion in the number of senior clinical and scien- tic investigators interested in ALD and also in the number of grant-giving bodies and charities, including the Foundation for Liver Research which supports my own research group, which are willing to fund research in this area.Integrated research can help understand the physiological pathways of alcoholic liver disease, says Dr Shilpa Chokshi, of the Foundation for Liver Research HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 38Research diculties The lack of good experimental models mimicking the development of alcohol induced disease has also signicantly hampered progress. In vitro cell culture models and in vivo animal models do not recapitulate the complex cellular interactions that occur in humans. The complexity of the liver injury in terms of early damage and the processes leading to brosis and cirrhosis in humans cannot be replicated in isolated primary cells, cell lines and small animal models. The lack of this understanding has hindered the develop-ment of biomarkers both prognostic and diagnostic. Moreover, the pre-clinical testing of therapeutic targets in these models has led to the development of mole- cules that do not always show ecacy when tested in humans. This is now an area of intense research activity. My own group has utilised a human precision- cut liver slice model of ALD and we have found that that it is physiologically relevant and more accurately simulates the in vivo intracellular mechanisms of the hepatotoxic response to alcohol. Moreover, when these slices are cultured in combination with immune cells from the same patients, we are able to re-create the immunological interactions between the immune system and the normal/diseased liver. This is an impor- tant area to be studied as many patients who developsignicant scarring/cirrhosis in the liver as a conse- quence of excess alcohol consumption, actually die of bacterial infections which overwhelm their impaired immune systems. Again this is an area of much current research activity and it is especially relevant in an era of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Several studies are beginning to delineate the reasons for this immunod- eciency including our work showing that this dysfunc- tion is reversible. Finally, integral studies aimed at distinguishing patients seemingly protected from disease from those that go on to develop disease, are fundamental. Only 1 in 5 people drinking at harmful levels will actually develop disease. This does not seem to be an inherited trait and understanding the precise mechanisms that confer protection will, in my opinion, be key in unlocking the development of eective and targeted therapeutics.

Kidney injury leads to a permanent impairment of the kidney function (chronic kidney dis- ease) as the kidney is an organ with low regeneration capability. In clinical practice, acute kidney injury is dened using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, which are based on serumcreatinine and urine output changes. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) explain how SAFE-T DIKI is advancing research into drug-induced kidney injury One of the greatest problems is the late identication of acute kidney injury due to the current standards - i.e. serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Both of these are in fact delayed indicators of injury and may not be changed signicantly until two-thirds of kidney function has already been lost. Species dierences in drug toxicity in preclinical safety tests, the lack of sensitive translational biomarkers and non-representative patient populations in clinical trials are among the probable reasons for the failures in predicting human drug toxicity. However, changesin drug discovery practices and the implementation of specic and sensitive safety biomarkers are expected to decrease these drug development failures. SAFE-T This is where the Safer and Faster Evidence-based Translation (SAFE-T) Consortium comes in. SAFE-T is a non-prot, public-private partnership set up within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative-Joint Undertaking (IMI-JU) - the world's largest public/private partnership in the life sciences sector. The objective of the IMI-JU is to support projects for the develop- ment of tools and methodologies to address key \"bottlenecks\" in the pharmaceutical research and development process. Within this framework, the overall objective of the IMI SAFE-T consortium is the regulatory qualication of clinical safety biomarkers of drug-induced injury to 3 organs, including the kidney. The objectives of the SAFE-T DIKI work package are toaddress the current gaps in sensitive and specic clinical tests to diagnose, predict and monitor drug-induced injury to the kidney. After an initial assessment of glomerular damage biomarkers, the work package focused on clinical biomarkers of drug-induced renal tubular injury. 39HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 40The primary objective has been to identify biomarkers with improved sensitivity and specicity relative to conventional measures. A secondary aim was to deter- mine which biomarkers allow an earlier detection of a renal tubular injury event. Other objectives include identifying prognostic markers and markers of repair,but these require large scale studies and may be addressed in future consortia. Within the framework of the SAFE-T DIKI work package, the following 3 studies were conducted: a study in cancer patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy, a study to collect samples in healthy volunteers, and a study in patients being administered contrast medium for a radiological procedure. The Cisplatin study enrolled cancer patients with normal renal function who were scheduled to receivea 1st cycle of high dose (>65mg/m2/cycle) cisplatin chemotherapy. A total of 114 patients had blood and urine samples collected at the following time-points:pre-dose (baseline) and within 12 hours and 1, 2, 4, 7,14 and 21 days after cisplatin administration. A control group of 21 patients with similar cancers receiving non-nephrotoxic treatment for the malignancy were also enrolled. The control patients had blood and urine samples collected at 2 separate visits.Healthy subjects were recruited in 2 dierent studies. In one study, healthy male and female subjects attended for 3 separate visits 1 week apart to have blood and urine samples collected (N=25 subjects). In a second sample collection study, healthy male andfemale subjects had samples collected during 3 study visits (N=39 subjects) over a 2-4 week period. The data for the study in patients receiving contrast media were not included in the main analysis because patients with impaired baseline renal function were enrolled and therefore this study does not represent the intended use of the novel biomarkers in subjectswith normal baseline renal function. The performance of novel urinary biomarkers was compared to that of standard measures such as serum creatinine, serum cystatin C and BUN. maximum percent change from baseline, serum creatinine showed relatively good performance. In this same analysis, serum cystatin C and BUN alsoshowed good performance. Nevertheless, urinary osteopontin, albumin, KIM-1 and total all out- performed urinary and NGAL showed relatively results, the conclusion was that urinary osteopontin, albumin, KIM-1, total protein and possibly alpha-GST might all be used as individual markers in monitoring for acute nephrotoxicity. European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) info@efpia.euwww.efpia.eu www.twitter.com/EFPIA Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a rare disease that affects the kidney filter (glomerulus) and induces a massive loss of proteins in the urine. Consider- able progress has occurred in the diag- nosis and management of patients since the identification of the major antigens, recognised in the glomerulus by toxic antibodies circulating in the blood. Because the antigens are nor- mally present in the glomerulus, onecan conclude that MN is auto-immune in nature, and thanks to the recent advances in the disease pathogenesis,it can serve as a model for most organ- specific auto-immune diseases. The most prevalent antigen identified in 2009, the receptor of the phospholi- pase A2 (PLA2R1), is localised on the podocyte, a major cell of the glomeru- lar filter where it serves as target for circulating antibodies. Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy: Now possible with a simple serological test Until recently, the diagnosis of MN required a kidney biopsy, an invasive diagnostic procedure with the risk of bleeding observed in less than 5% of patients. The development of assays of circulating anti-PLA2R1 antibodies and their transfer to clinical practice has been amazingly fast. The first immunofluorescence (IF) test used biochips coated with cells expressing the antigen, incubated with the patients' sera. The ELISA using the extracellular domain of human PLA2R1coated to plastic wells enables a more quantitative and faster determination of anti-PLA2R antibodies, but it is a little bit less sensitive than IF. Detection of PLA2R1 antigen in immune deposits in biopsy specimens is also possiblewith the use of commercial antibody after a retrieval step to unmask PLA2R1 epitopes (domains of the anti- gen PLA2R that are recognised by the antibodies). These tests have ushered in a new era of precision medicine. Sev- enty to 80% of patients with MN havemounted an immune response against PLA2R1, which serves as a diagnostic signature since PLA2R1 antibodies are specific for this disease. Monitoring patients with membranous nephropathy: Beyond proteinuria For a long time, proteinuria was the only variable to follow disease activity. Now that specific antibodies have been identified, it has been shown that levels of these antibodies also predict outcome. High titers are correlated with a lower chance of spontaneous or treatment-induced remission, and a higher risk of the emergence of a nephrotic syndrome in non-nephrotic patients, and ofrenal function deterioration. Furthermore, anti-PLA2R1 antibodiesappear to be sensitive markers of treatment efficacy. Partial or complete depletion of anti-PLA2R antibodies precedes clinical remission, which isdisappearance of proteinuria, by sev-eral weeks or months, while re-emer- gence or an increase of these antibod- ies precedes by several weeks a renal relapse. The time lag of several months from immunological remission (deple- tion of antibodies) to renal remission is most likely accounted for by resorption of immune deposits and repair of the glomerulus. Even more, anti-PLA2R1 antibody titers at the end of therapy are predictive of later outcomes. \"Because the rate of remission (including partial remissions) does not exceed 70% with current immunosuppressive treatments, we hope that in future trials, close monitoring of anti-PLA2R1 antibody titer and epitope specificity as well asregulatory T-cells will allow a more personalised adaptation of treatment leading to increased rate of complete remission.\" Toward a serology-based approach to treatment Treatment of MN is controversial because of a high rate of spontaneous remission (up to 40%) and toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs that are used to treat patients with persisting nephrotic syndrome. Patients should not be overexposed to toxic medica- tion if they don't need it. This is the reason why treatment is often delayed by 6 months to give the patients a chance to undergo spontaneous remission. We think that the interna- tional guidelines should be revised to include anti-PLA2R1 antibody in theProfessor Pierre Ronco and Dr Hanna Debiec discuss the viability of precision medicine in treating patients with the rare disease membranous nephropathyIs precision medicine for membranous nephropathy a dream? for patients with idiopathic MN. Measurement of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies may indeed obviate the need for a \"wait and see\" period of 6 months, and allow formore rapid treatment decisions. We recommend that antibodies are assessed every month in patients with a high level, and every two months in patients with low levels before starting immunosuppressive therapy to avoid unnecessary treatment in patients entering immunological remission (substantial decrease or disappear- ance of antibodies). This recommen- dation does not apply to patients with rapidly declining renal function, inwhom a prompt initiation of immuno- suppression is warranted. If immunosuppression has been started, we recommend that antibod- ies be assessed every month duringthe first 6 months. Although the rate of antibody reduction varies amongstudies, the general picture is that antibodies dramatically decrease during the first 3 months, and disap-pear over 6 to 9 months followed by remission of proteinuria over 12 to 24 months. Patients with a prompt and robust immunologic response may receive shorter than usual courses of immuosuppressive agents, whereas a conversion to an alternative therapy or a reinfusion of rituximab (for patients started on this drug which targets the B-lymphocytes involved in antibody production) should be con- sidered in those who do not show a significant reduction in antibody titer at 6 months. Toward more precision medicine: Lessons from molecular and cellular studies There is more to come. Very recent studies by our group and a collaborat- ing group in Nice suggest that diffusion of the immune response to severaldomains of the PLA2R1 antigen (a phe- nomenon called epitope spreading) was associated with a lower rate of remission after 6 months in patients treated with rituximab. We also showed that a population of T-lympho- cytes, the regulatory T-cells, involved in the control of auto-immunity, was decreased in patients with severe MN and that those who responded to rituximab had a lower percentage of regulatory T-lymphocytes at onset of treatment and an increased percent- age of those cells as early as 8 days after starting treatment. Because the rate of remission (includ- ing partial remissions) does not exceed70% with current immunosuppressive treatments, we hope that in future trials, close monitoring of anti-PLA2R1antibody titer and epitope specificity as well as regulatory T-cells will allow a more personalised adaptation of treatment leading to increased rate of complete remission.

The scheme at the bottom shows that anti-PLA2R1 (in red) disappear before proteinuria (in green) and reappear before clinical relapse.Serological tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with membranous nephropathy Indirect immunofluorescence for PLA2R or THSD7AELISA-PLA2R Detecting antibody with HRP Plate bound rhPLA2R Patient serumMeta-analysis (2014) Du et al, PLoSOne 2014, 9:e104936- 15 studies, 2212 patients - Specificity = 99% (95% CI : 96-100%) - Sensitivity = 78% (95% CI : 66-87%) HEK293 cells non PLA2R or THSD7AHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 43Tackling chronic diseases through innovative health If we want to keep people healthy for as long as pos- sible we need to focus on 3 Ps: Prevention, promotion and protection.

The burden of chronic disease in Europe In Europe, chronic diseases lead to the premature death of more than 550,000 people aged 25 to 64 each year, resulting in the loss of some 3.4 million potential pro- ductive life years2. Approximately \u20ac700 billion is spent every year across the EU on the treatment of these diseases. Better public health and prevention policies, as well as more eective health care models need to bedeveloped to face the challenges of an ageing popula- tion and the rise of non-communicable diseases to save hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of euros. Tackling chronic diseases: HFE role to bring innovation As Honorary President of Health First Europe (HFE), I have worked to bring innovation in healthcare which can prevent and diagnose chronic conditions, as wellas improve quality of life of patients aected by chronic diseases. In particular, I emphasise the importance of mobile health initiatives, as valuable ways of delivering healthcare, enhancing prevention, monitoring and managing health and lifestyle across Europe. Mobile health has the potential to maximise patients' autonomy, aid patient choice, improve diagnostics and prevention of chronic conditions, and better connect people to healthcare providers. It oers rapid access to medical records, a regular monitoring of health status and therefore it improves quality of life andhealthcare, empowering patients and their carers. In this frame, the European Commission's eHealth ActionPlan 2012-2020 3provides an important roadmap to empower patients and healthcare workers, link up devices and technologies, and invest in research towards the personalised medicine of the future. Early diagnosis and screening are other vital instru-ments to help prevent both the emergence and acute phase of chronic diseases. Timely diagnosis appears fundamental. Firstly, primary prevention through screening programmes can help people diagnose the disease while it is asymptomatic, with no signs orsymptoms, thus improving possibilities to identify the onset of a disease. Secondly, the earlier detection of disease may impact the progression of major chronic diseases, leading to more cures or longer survival and oering time saving measures. Encouraging the transition towards a new model of integrated care It is the area of chronic diseases where the greatest ben- et lies in developing a new model to address health- care needs and tackle the spread of cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, diabetes and serious mental health issues.John Bowis, Honorary President of Health First Europe highlights how innovations in health are helping with tackling chronic diseases \" HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 44HFE commitment in developing patient-centric solu- tions for sustainable health systems and for enhancinginnovation in Europe has particularly evolved through the development of the HFE model for community care in 2014. Community care is about incorporating patient care across the continuum of life, redening the rela- tionship between dierent providers of treatment by introducing a new channel of 'healthcare' based on amore patient centric and patient empowered model 4'. In line with this, the Expert group on Health Systems Per- formance Assessment (HSPA) has provided a relevantreport 5, March 2017 (HSPA) to assess inte- grated care6, perceived to be a fundamental component of health system reforms and innovation in Europe. \"In Europe, chronic diseases lead to the premature death of more than 550,000 people aged 25 to 64 each year, resulting in the loss of some 3.4 million potential productive life years2.\" I truly support and encourage the eective design and implementation of integrated care frameworks to achieve person centred, ecient and safe care, as wellas to address crucial challenges, such as population ageing, the rising burden of chronic diseases and constraints in public resources. Coordinating eorts to achieve person centred, ecient and safe care With integrated care being one of the key approaches to providing the healthcare that EU citizens' demand and innovative treatments and infrastructures, Europe will gradually face the challenge of chronic diseases. A holistic approach is essential. EU policymakers need to be aligned and pursue shared goals, establishing strong governance mechanisms at all levels and show- ing more political support on overall patient well-being, bringing integrated care and hospitals closer as part- ners in the provision of care. Moreover, stakeholders should create eective communication strategies and make organisational changes in terms of healthcare structures, organisation of workflows, workforce development and resource allocation to provide more responsive care delivery.I hereby call for a strong coordination amongst EU coun- tries to raise awareness on chronic disease challenges, applying knowledge and experiences to implement eective prevention and control policies. To consider assessing EU health systems to further foster the tran-sition towards a model of integrated care, identifying principles and factors that will lead to the development of a new ecosystem where all patients will be members of the \"care team\", more involved in the decision-making processes, and where care plans will be tailored to theirindividual needs. 1 Speech of Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, 21 April 2016 - PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHRONIC DISEASES: A COMMISSION PRIORITY - MEETING ON CHRONIC DISEASES \"TOWARDS THE BETTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES\", Plan 2012-2020: Innovative healthcare for the 21st century, available here https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/ news/ehealth-action-plan-2012-2020-innovative-healthcare-21st- century 4 HFE Model for Community Care \"Delivering positive health outcomes for citizens\", available here http://healthrsteurope.org/uploads/Mod- ules/Newsroom/131124_hfe_model_cc_a4_v06_lr.pdf 5 Report \"Tools and methodologies to assess integrated care in Europe, released in March 2017 by the Expert group on Health Systems Per- formance Assessment\"; http://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/les/ systems_performance_assessment/docs/2017_blocks_en_0.pdf 6 Integrated care includes all initiatives seeking to improve outcomes of care by overcoming issues of fragmentation through linkage or coordination of services of providers along the continuum of care. John Bowis Honorary President Health First Europe info@healthfirsteurope.org http://healthfirsteurope.orgStroke is a major cause of illness and mortality, and a major socio - economic burden. The mecha- nism underlying the insurgence and temporal evolution of stroke needs to be further elucidated. In vivo imaging provides clinically relevant data on the spatiotemporal patterns of tissue injury and repair processes, help improve interventional therapies, and lead to the discovery of novel markers ofrecovery, as well as selective targeted therapies. Recent improvement in clinical imaging technologies has made it possible to resolve small, previouslyinvisible lesions in the brains of elderly humans, associated with age-related mental decline and dementia. These microscopic and focalised lesions caused by disruptions of small blood vessels are known to affect distributed patterns of synchronised neural activity throughout the brain. Accordingly, recent human neu- roimaging studies indicate that spon- taneous fluctuations in neural activity, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging of functional connectivity, are significantly affected following a stroke. Disrupted functional connectivity is associated with behavioural deficits and has been linked to long-term recovery potential. Repair and recovery Among the highest priorities in trans- lational neuroscience, facilitation of repair and recovery have the ultimate goal of improving functional outcomeafter injury. Neuronal plasticity hasbeen long deputed as the basic mech- anism for restoring functions suddenly lost after stroke. The phenomenon of neuronal circuit rewiring encompasses multiple scales, from neuronal con- tacts, i.e. synapses, to large areas of the brain. Indeed, we are now aware that individual cells and cell types in the brain act and react to a stroke as part of an ensemble. Cell to cell inter- action takes place at multiple levels (electrical, chemical, mechanical) andmight causally trigger a specific reac- tion to injury. How this complex cellu- lar and molecular response to injury happens is not well understood yet.Comprehending the mechanism of repair will build a track to guideappropriate interventions. Towardsthis goal, structural and functional changes have to be visualised both at the macro-area and at cellular level. Imaging the brain A valuable tool for understanding the link between molecular mechanisms of stroke repair and human findings at the system level can be achieved by extending functional connectivity methods to mouse models of stroke. Consequently, there is an obvious need for appropriate animal modelsand imaging techniques for visualising how neurons rewire at multiple scales. Historically, optical imaging has been a major tool for investigating the physiological processes from cellular compartments to entire organs, owing to its unique properties, such as hightemporal and spatial resolution and numerous contrasting mechanisms. Traditional optical microscopy tech- niques such as wide-field imaging provide large-scale maps of functional activation. In animal models of stroke wide-field microscopy allows investi- gating the meso-scale disruption and following remapping of functional connectivity. What do we mean for \"remapping\"? In the brain version of Google Maps, location is everything: if a single spot is removed, the cortical territory devotedto that target rapidly remaps to represent the intact digits that project to the neighbouring cortex. This phenomenon of intense compe- tition for available cortical map territory can be easily visualised by wide-fieldoptical microscopy. Works from Tim Murphy's lab combined this imaging technique with voltage sensitive dyes(i.e. dyes that shine proportionally to neuronal activation) to investigate large area remapping after stroke. By analysing the sequence and kinetics of the activation of peri-infarct cortical circuits after a stroke, they found that the surviving portion of cortex actively relays enhanced signals to the adjacent areas, resulting in remapping of the lost function. Some diffuse off-target signalling are strengthened over the days, weeks and months over which recovery from stroke damage occurs. These findings indicate that the recoveryProfessor Saverio Pavone, of the European Laboratory for Non Linear Spectroscopy and Department of Physics highlights the latest advances in stroke researchShining a light on brain functionality after stroke 45PROFILEof functions after stroke and brain remapping involve changes in the temporal and spatial spread of infor- mation processing across local and distant sites. In another study, they found that the focus of cortical activity is rapidly redistributed after ischemia. Given that it occurs within an hour, the effect is likely to involve surviving accessory pathways and could potentially con- tribute to rapid behavioural compen- sation or direct future circuit rewiring. Real time imaging These intriguing studies performed with wide-field microscopy give a view of the large picture, but are not capa- ble of penetrating into the optically highly scattering brain tissue. Recent technological advances in optical imaging allowed for observing and interrogating single cells in real time in their natural environment, thereby preserving the complex ensemble. Analysis of individual neurons can help determine whether stroke-induced plasticity is achieved by surviving neu- rons giving up their usual function or whether individual neurons may be able to process multiple sensory streams. Optical imaging technologies capable of penetrating into the tissue have been developed and applied to in vivo brain imaging. High-resolution imaging of stroke injury and repair in rodents has been now implemented in many labs. Several important characteristics of the imaging modality are critical to assess cells in their natural environ- ment during stroke, like the ability toimage the same region longitudinally,the spatial resolution, sufficient to resolve individual cells, the temporalresolution to resolve the time course of dynamic cellular processes and the penetration depth to enable imaging through the cortex. Only a few optical microscopy technologies satisfy these requirements and have been applied to image ischemic stroke in rodents, like two-photon microscopy (TPM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Among these, TPM imaging is the most mature and widely applied. Two-photon microscopy (TPM) TPM detects photoluminescence that and the images aretypically created from sequential mea- surements. The development of TPM imaging of variation in calcium ion concentration has had an enormous influence on the investigation of the plethora of diverse neuronal functions. By opti- cally recording neuronal activity with in vivo imaging of calcium-associated fluorescence, previous work assessed stroke-induced changes in function and spatial organisation of more than 10,000 individual neurons. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging within reorganised functional maps determined how the response prop- erties of individual neurons were altered during recovery from ischemic damage over several weeks. Single-cell imaging revealed that the selectivity of individual neurons was altered during recovery from ischemia, e.g. neurons normally selective for a single con- tralateral limb processed informationfrom multiple limbs. Altered selectivity were most prominent in border regions between stroke-altered macroscopic map representations, and peaked 1month after the focal insult. Withlonger recovery, these cells developed more specific response characteristics and restored a defined preference. These forms of plasticity indicate that apparently hardwired cortical neurons first adopt wider functional roles as they develop strategies to compensate for loss of specific sensory modalities after stroke.

New papers describe not only what the international competi- tion has achieved, which contributes to the challenge, but also tangential observations that can lead to new lines of enquiry for our own work. Readers who have followed my recent contributionsin this medium will be aware that in my teams we have a compound in clinical trials and many compounds at advanced preclinical stages for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites coming from our DNAminor groove binders programme,compounds that we refer to as S- MGBs. These are heterocyclic com- pounds, the field of chemistry, which is the focus of our synthetic work. We also have a series of compounds with the potential to treat diseases ofimbalance including asthma, rheuma- toid arthritis, and lupus erythremato- sus, to name three, which come from what we call 'the worms project', reflecting the biological starting point for the project. In writing this article, I've selected four publications fromaround the world that have attracted our attention at Strathclyde becauseof their relevance to our programmes. Each of them illustrates a different impact on our studies. Antifungal compounds The first concerns new antifungal compounds [doi/10.1073/pnas.16083 04113] discovered though research in England and the U.S. Most of the pol- itics around antimicrobial resistance refers to bacteria, which most people recognise as the so-called superbugs.However, fungi can be just as life threatening to susceptible patients and around 1.5 million deaths are caused by fungi each year. Many mil- lions more suffer from a long-term chronic debilitating disease with an associated world-wide financial burden of $13.9 billion by 2018. Unlike bacterial infections, for which there are many types of drug available, onlyfour classes of antifungal agents are available to treat invasive fungal infections all of which have practical limitations, not least of which is the emergence of resistance to the limited number of available treatments. Not only did the research I'm highlighting produce a new candidate antifungal compound it also discovered a new biological mechanism for antifungal activity, an enzyme target known as dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase. Both of these features are very encourag- ing for development because high activity without resistance can be expected. In our S-MGB research we have also identified some highly active antifungal compounds that work by a novel mechanism. So there is competition between different teamsand different compound classes which is a good thing. Antibacterial drugs Turning now to antibacterial drugs, one of the biggest challenges concerns the class known as Gram-negative bacteria. This large class of bacteria presents its problem because of its double cell wall and its ability to pump drug molecules out of the cell beforethey can do any damage. The biologi- cal pumps are embedded in the cell wall structure. Many groups around the world are tackling this problem sometimes with new compoundclasses but more successfully with strategies that try to deal with the double cell wall and the pumps. If the cell wall can be weakened or the pumps reduced in activity, for exam- ple, perhaps the new drug could get into the Gram-negative bacterial cell and kill it. One of our S-MGB projects is looking at these approaches with some encouraging results and we are further encouraged by a paper from Canada, my second example [doi: 10. 47PROFILE Strathclyde Institute for Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow City Centre, home to much of our in-house biological evaluationUniversity of Strathclyde's Professor Colin J Suckling shares research being undertaken into anti-infective and immunomodulatory drug discovery programmesThe development of anti-infective drugs1038/nmicrobiol.2017.28], that showed that an old class of minor groove binders, pentamidines, that has been used widely in anti-parasitic therapy can make resistant Gram-negativebacteria susceptible again to the drug colistin. Disruption of the cell wall is believed to be the mechanism ofaction and we think that some of our S-MGBs work partly in the same way. But there's an alternative approach to deal with the cell wall, namely to arrange for the bacterium actively to absorb the drug using its natural uptake mechanisms. One such mech- anism uses compounds known as siderophores, which have evolved to bring iron, an essential element, into the bacterial cell. By attaching a small siderophore through specific chemical bonds to an established drug to which Gram-negative bacteria are resistant, a beta-lactam known as a Monobac- tam, a Chinese group has shown that extremely potent new compounds active against Gram-negative bacteria can be obtained [doi: 10.1021/acs. jmedchem.6b01261]. This beautiful piece of research reached proof of concept stage by showing that theirmost active compound could success- fully treat mice infected with theGram-negative bacterium, Klebsiella pneumoniae. We have some S-MGBs active against this organism but no in vivodata yet. We have not tried the siderophore approach yet; maybe we should. Whilst new antimicrobial compounds are one world-wide need, new drugs to treat diseases of aging are also high profile. For example, researchers have been looking over decades for drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease by targeting the protein modification mechanisms that have been found to occur in the brains of Alzheimer's patients but with- out significant success. A big question then arises about where a new drug should intervene in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Some very recent work from England and Germany has suggested that certain inflammatory pathways controlled by a proteinknown as Nrf2 might be relevant [doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006593]. This surprised us because we have found that one of our compounds from the 'worms project' with anti-arthritis activity engages exactly this pathway [doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2015.04.005]. Does this mean that a drug candidatedesigned to be an immunomodulatory might turn out to be important in a major disease of neurodegeneration? We'll have to do the experiments to see. International approach These selections serve to highlight the truly international character of scien- tific research and also illustrate the penetration of heterocyclic chemistry. When I used to preside at graduations at the University of Strathclyde, I would encourage the new graduates to see what they could make possible for the world using their academic and practi- cal training. Well there's some excep- tionally good academic research intonew anti-infective agents out there answering exactly that challenge. The real question now is whether all of this international science can be translated into medicines available to the public for health care world-wide. Current commercial development models don'twork because good antibiotic steward- ship, which minimises the rate at which resistance arises to new drugs, runs counter to selling large quantities and making lots of money for the pharma company and its shareholders. Things will have to change somehow.

With rising health care costs over prior decades, a single trip to the Emergency Department may cost thousands of dollars. Health insurance significantly reduces those costs; however, prior to the imple-mentation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2014, an estimated 41 million Ameri- cans lacked health insurance. The PPACA, also known as \"Oba- macare\", was enacted in 2010 to expand insurance coverage to unin-sured Americans, and to lower the costs of health care. PPACA also addressed healthcare delivery systemimprovement, and increased the use of technology to improve health outcomes among patients. Major provisions of PPACA went into effectin January 2014. Most insured Americans under the age of 65 years old obtain insurance through their employer. However, prior to PPACA, businesses were not required to offer insurance to their employees. Starting at the age of 65, Americans who have worked and paid into the system through their payroll taxes are eligible for Medicare. Medicare is a national social insurance program administered by the US Government. Prior to PPACA taking effect in 2014, private insurance was sold to individ-uals, and the insurer could determine the extent of insurance or even decline individuals seeking coverage, due to pre-existing health conditions. In other words, an individual with a chronic illness could be denied coverage for that illness, or any other illness. According to the 2015 Centre for Dis- ease Control's National Health Inter-view Survey (NHIS), approximately 52 million (27%) adults between the ages of 18-64 years reported at least one of the medical conditions listed in Figure 1. A limitation of the survey was that state identifiers were not included; many states did not have population sizes sufficient for this survey sampling. Therefore, the impact for each statecould not be immediately extrapolated. Since it is the individual states that offer insurance plans through Medicaid, andexchanges developed for PPACA, the impact of repealing PPACA would vary from state to state. 2 A regression model constructed by The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (a non-profit, non-partisan group), for the CDC's 2015 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), estimates the prevalence of declinable conditions at the state level. This model relies on respondent age, self-reported health status, and self-reporting of declinable conditions. Applying this prediction model yielded a nationwide prevalence of 28% of the total population with a declinable condition, which is signifi-cant when compared to the NHISnationwide estimate of 27%. States such as California face an estimated 5,865,000 non-elderly adults with declinable pre-existing medical condi- tions. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Penn- sylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,Dr Virginia M Stewart asks what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, sounding a warning for the health and lives of millions of AmericansWhat will happen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed? 49PROFILE Congestive Heart Disease Figure 1: Examples of Medical Conditions that are Declinable for Medical Insurance Coverage1 Angina Heart Attack Stroke Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Emphysema Any Heart Condition Cancer Epilepsy Mental Retardation Cerebral Palsy Weak or Failing Kidneys Diabetes Obesity (body mass index over 40) Pregnancy Senility Depression Endocrine Problems Blood forming organ problems Substance Abuse including Alcohol Abuse Schizophrenia Bipolar Disorder Attention Deficit Disorderand Washington, all have over 1 million non-elderly adults with declinable pre-existing conditions. What will happen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed? Without the increased coverage and measures to decrease health care costs provided through PPACA, there is antic- ipated to be an increased strain on Emergency Care Services. Rather than providing mostly life-saving measures, emergency departments have become part of a safety net for those without access to healthcare. By evaluating the impact of loss of insurance due to lossof jobs in 2000s, the impact of loss of insurance from repealing PPACA may predict the impact of delivery of health- care within emergency departments(ED). A 2009 qualitative interview study among ED administrators throughout the US summarised 10 major observa- tions resulting from loss of insurance coverage. Academic, community,urban, suburban, and rural hospitals were included in four major US regions, and included the below findings. 3 1. ED capacity was strained with almost all emergency departments reporting a rise in volume. 2. Many departments observed a new \"recession\" population, who previously had health insurance through their employer, but became uninsured from job loss. 3. Most uninsured people did not have other options to obtain primary careservices other than the ED. Clinics that served uninsured individuals or thathad a sliding fee schedule for care were not accepting new patients. 4. ED volumes of insured patients increased because they could not obtain a timely appointment with their primary care provider.5. High volume and high occupancy in the ED and hospital led to overcrowd- ing in the ED, which increased overallwait times to care. In the study, one facility had wait times within the ED of 18-24 hours. 6. Lack of insurance and access to primary care, led to sicker patients and repeated ED visits.7. Patients refused recommended care due to their concerns about the costs. 8. Anxiety, depression, and stress increased among patients. 9. Uninsured patients did not have follow-up care from their ED visit. This impacted the care patients received, meaning more tests were performed at each visit.10. EDs did not have financial and personnel resources to meet the rising patient volumes. Repeal of PPACA may potentially mean the loss of medical insurance for approximately one-third of non-elderly American adults. The economic reces- sion and increased unemployment in the 2000s may serve as a warning as to how PPACA's repeal could adversely affect healthcare and the lives of millions of Americans. 1.

The Summit was in partnership with the Canadian Medical Association, aimed to open debate and discover solutions to help Canadians lead better and healthier lives - particularly for the more elderly population of the country. In the opening of her speech , she stated that, \"Already, Canada is one of the world's highest spenders on healthcare and yet we are not achieving the kind of results Canadians need and deserve.\" This is evident from in the CMA National Report Card 2016,where only 37% of Canadians assigned a letter grade of A to the \"overall quality of health care services available\".Philpott went on to outline the Federation's \"shared priorities for health\", which include homecare, phar- maceuticals, mental health, and improved healthcare for the Indigenous population. Overall, the Federal Government's priorities for healthcare spending align with aspects of the healthcare system that Canadiancitizens prioritised in the National Report Card. Homecare One of the key priorities for the Health Accord is improv- ing investment for homecare. The Minister outlined how in Canada $10 billion, around 5% of total health spend-ing is spent on home and community care. \"That's a lot of money, but it's probably not enough, especially since our population is aging and burdened by increasing rates of chronic disease,\" Philpott stated. Open Access Government highlights how Health Minister, Jane Philpott aims to improve the lives of all Canadians through their new Health Accord PlanHealth Accord: Healthcare for allHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 52Philpott went on to say, \"Today, some 15% of hospital beds are occupied by patients, who might be better oat home or in long-term care. This has a huge nancial impact. For example, in Ontario, basic homecare costs $42 a day, compared to a minimum of $840 a day in a hospital. \"More importantly, it's not the best way to care for them - we know the hospital it not where they want to be, unless it's absolutely necessary. We have a goldenopportunity to put in place robust systems of services and supports that will address these gaps.\" Not only was Philpott's argument for better invest- ment, she also stressed the importance of putting more resources into homecare, so that patients, carers, and families have more support and \"don't burn out\". Mental Health The National Report Card stated that 83% of Canadians placed mental health services within the top funding considerations. This emphasis on mental health is no surprise when the Canadian Centre for Association and Mental Health (CAMH) found that by the time Canadian's reach the age of 40, half have, or have had, experiences of mental illness. Furthermore, a third of people who had reported mental health issues in the past year said that their needs had not been met. At the Health Summit, Philpott added mental health to her priorities as part of the Health Accord Plan to improve healthcare across the country. She highlighted mental health as something that needs to be discussed openly between families and even communities. The Minister said, \"For too long, mental illness was something to be hidden, something to be ashamed of. Today, we talk about it somewhat more openly in our families and in our communities, and that is a good thing. \"But as the full extent of the burden of mental illness in Canada becomes clear, it's become obvious that oursystems are not well-equipped to heal the trauma caused by mental illness.\" She also admitted that while \"doctors and other front line workers do their best\", they \"often don't have adequate training\".However, she did mention plans to \"build systemswhere mental health services are widely available andsupportive\". Indigenous populations Canadians placed better healthcare for the Indigenous populations below many other healthcare improve- ments, with only 64% of people believing it to be an important area of funding. However, Philpott clearly stated that this was an important issue for the Government. She argued that challenges within the healthcare system are \"magnied many times over for Indigenous peoples in Canada\". Evidence for this includes the 2017 life expectancy sta - tistics that found that life expectancy among the total Canadian population is 79 years for men and 83 years for women. However, for the Indigenous populations, the projected life expectancy is much lower, 64 years formen and 73 years for women. Philpott summarises this gap in healthcare by saying \"If you are an Indigenous, your life expectancy is up toa decade shorter than for other Canadians. Your rates of diabetes are 3 times that of the national average. InFirst Nations, rates of tuberculosis are 33 times that of other Canadians. For Inuit, the rates of tuberculosis are 375 times higher than those for non-Indigenous Cana- dians\". In her speech at the Health Summit, Philpott ended by emphasising the \"need to adapt to new ideas\" and renew Canada's \"approach to health policy\", concluding with the message that \"by working together, Canada can be a world leader to ensure our ultimate collective goal, that is, health for all\".

Georgina RyanWriter Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.orgwww.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov Breast cancer accounts for approximately 26% of all can- cers diagnosed today. One in 8 women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes. According to the National Cancer Insti- tute, in 2016 there were 246,660 new cases and 40,450 deaths from breast cancer in the U.S alone. Like other cancers, breast cancer is most suc- cessfully treated if the disease is diagnosed early. In addition to better health outcomes, there are economic benefits to accurate screening and early diagnosis of the disease. It is estimated that the cost of treating early stage breast cancer is about $12,000, while late stage treatment costs start at around $150,000. Common practice for breast cancer screening is x-ray mammography for women over 50. Unfortunately, for too many women, x-ray mammography is too ambiguous to detect their disease in time for effective treatment. The problem is that the specificity of mam- mography suffers from its difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malignant masses: dense breast tissue appears similar to cancer on x-ray mammograms, leading to inconclusive imaging results. Patients with suspi- cious mammograms are prone to either unnecessary biopsies or late identification of serious disease. Ofthe women that are screened with mammography, roughly 18% have a suspicious but inconclusive finding and a third of these are sent forbiopsy. Roughly 75% of biopsies prompted by mammography come back negative and in the U.S alone these account for 1.5 million unneces- sary biopsies that could be prevented with more cancer-specific diagnostic imaging. The situation is the mosturgent for women with a known highand intermediate lifetime risk for breast cancer. High-risk patients have to be screened at a significantly younger age than average risk women. Younger high-risk women tend to have denser breast tissue which does not produce accurate images when scanned using x-ray mammography. The inconclusive nature of breast cancer detection with either mam-mography or its combination with MRI means that a large cohort of women (especially, high-risk patients) cannot rely on imaging to start disease treat- ment at the early stage. These women are forced to contemplate prophylactic mastectomy because the predictive power of current imaging is so poor. Early detection Radialis Medical Corporation, a joint venture (spin-off) of the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute (TBRHRI) and Lakehead University, Ontario, Canada, addresses this important unmet patient's need. Radi-alis is manufacturing an advanced Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) system for molecular (or functional) imaging of breast cancer. PEM detects small cancerous breast lesions basedon their increased glucose metabolism and in such its imaging performance is inherently independent on breast tissue density. The core technology of the PEM system was developed in Dr. Alla Reznik's research laboratory at Lakehead University and TBRHRI. Radialis PEM employs 2 planar high-resolution detector heads placed on both sides of gently steadied breast (Figure 1). Each detector head contains a large field-of-view (17cm x 22cm) gamma- photon sensor based on the novel type of solid-state (silicon) high-gain detection technology. During image acquisition, detectors fully cover the entire breast that allows for improved sensitivity capable of significant radi- ation dose reduction (by the factor of 4) in comparison with commercially available scanners. Another advantage of Radialis's design is its slim detector head and minimised \"dead area\" (the distance between the imaging part of the detector and its housing). This comparatively small step allows for significant clinical benefits since it tremendously improves visualisation of deep chest lesions, provides more options for detector heads positioning around the patient breast and access to lymph nodes to evaluate its possible metastatic involvement. The assembly and imaging perfor- mance evaluating of Radilis's PEM areDr Alla Reznik, Canada Research Chair in Physics of Medical Imaging, explains how Positron Emission Mammography is effective when detecting breast cancerUsing Positron Emission Mammography to detect breast cancer 53PROFILEunderway. Initial results with phantoms mimicking breast lesions of different sizes demonstrate that tumours as small as 1.2mm in size will be detectable in a clinical setting. The ultra-high resolution achieved com- bined with a large field-of-view detec- tor design enables high-resolution, low-dose molecular breast imaging.Additionally, large area stationary solid-state sensor design means that there will be less radiation that will escape Radialis's device. In addition to improved early breast cancer detection for a large cohort of patients, the use of PEM for screening of the high risk population will allowfor significant improvement in patients' compliance for frequent tests . Indeed, at the current stage of mammo- graphic detector technology, extreme breast compression is applied. The associated pain and anxiety is so strong that a large number of patient refuse mammography after their first experience. In contrast, PEM onlyrequires breast immobilisation rather than compression and hence com- pletely eliminates pain. This has the potential to significantly improve compliance and the effectiveness ofcancer detection. Overall, once implemented in clinicalpractice, Radialis's PEM technology can be used as (1) an adjuvant tech- nique for breast cancer detection, and (2) an integral part of the surveillance protocol of women at high and inter- mediate lifetime risk of breast cancer. In addition, the technological advances used will reduce manufacturing costfor PEM devices facilitating their wide- spread clinical usage, thus positively influencing people health.

She is also affiliated as a Senior Scientist in the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute (TBRHRI). Dr. Reznik has completed her PhD in solid-state physics at the Technion- Israel Institute of Tech- nology. After several years as a Senior Physicist at the GE Medical Systems she decided to return to academia and accepted a Research Associate position at the University of Toronto, Canada. In 2008 she was appointed a Canada Research Chair in Physics of Molecular Imaging and in 2013 re-appointed as a Canada Research Chair in Physics of Medical Imaging. She is a specialist in photoconductive materials and technologies for radiation medical imaging. The focus of her work is on solid-state technology for organ-specific Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The goal is an improvement in resolution and sensitivity over commercially available PET imagers. Another focus of her work is on advanced low-dose direct conversion x-ray imaging detectors based on novel x-ray-to-charge transducers. Reznik group's PET research has led to the launch of Radialis Medical - the first joint Lakehead - TBRHRI spin-off-company, which will produce a commercial version of the technology for breast cancer detection.HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 55Fighting against breast cancer in Canada In 2016, an estimated 26,000 Canadian women and 230 Canadian men were diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer occurs when cells change and no longer grow or behave normally. A Canadian womanhas a 1 in 9 chance of getting breast cancer during her lifetime. Research in Canada and across the world has managed to boost survival rates from 70% in the early 1970s to 87% today. Thanks to this research and advances in screening, today we know more about how to diagnose and treat breast cancer than we ever have. \"Thanks to organised screening programmes, research, improved treatment options and prevention recommendation we now have more breast cancer survivors than ever. We're grateful to now be able to turn more attention to survivorship and how we support women who are able to live their lives thanks to research.\" What increases my risk of getting breast cancer? In general, about half of all cancers can be prevented by not smoking, exercising and maintaining a healthy body weight. The same goes for breast cancer - if you're able to lead a healthier lifestyle, then your chances of getting breast cancer will go down. While the risk of breast cancer increases with age, a personal or family history of breast cancer may furtherincrease your risk. Additionally, studies have shown that women with inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 genemutations have up to an 80% chance of developingbreast cancer in their lifetime. Women with these inherited mutations also have a higher risk of develop- ing breast cancer at a younger age (usually beforemenopause) than other women. Drinking alcohol also increases a woman's risk for breast cancer. Even low levels of alcohol consumption (just over 1 drink per day) can increase a woman's risk. The risk increases with the amount of alcohol consumed. One possible reason for this is that alcohol is thought to cause higher levels of estrogen. Other factors that canincrease a woman's risk of breast cancer include obesity and hormone replacement therapy. Are there tests for breast cancer? In Canada, there are breast cancer screening pro- grammes in each province and most territories. Forwomen at average risk for developing breast cancer, mammogram screening is most eective every 2 years, between the ages of 50 and 74. It's important to note that breast cancer risk varies from woman to woman, so you should make a point of discussing your personal risk with your doctor. If you have family members who have had breast cancer, or you carry a certain gene mutation, then you may be recommended to start breast cancer screening earlier and more often. If youhave high breast density (75% or greater) you may be asked to screen annually. Breast cancer screening is done via a mammography. A screening mammogram is used to look for breast cancer in women who don't have any symptoms of thedisease. It may be done in a clinic, screening centre or mobile screening mammography unit. During a mam- mogram, a plastic plate will be slowly pressed down to flatten your breast and hold it in place for a few seconds while two images of each breast are taken. You will feel some pressure on your breast during the x-ray. Like most screening tests, there are benets and limi- tations to mammography. Scientic evidence tells us that regular mammography screening leads to fewer deaths in women with breast cancer. This is because itCanadian Cancer Society's Dr Rob Nuttall and Shawn Chirrey explain how fighting against breast cancer requires ongoing support for research and screeningHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 56helps nding breast cancer when it is smaller and more treatable, which increases the chances of survival. Limitations of mammography include having false positives, false negatives, or nding cancers that maynever cause any symptoms (over-diagnosis). If you want to learn whether a mammogram is right for you, then we encourage you to use our screening-deci- sion aid tool called My Breasts, My Test . Launched last year, the tool will help you understand what factors to consider and help you to ask questions of your health- care provider. Supporting more survivors than ever before Thanks to organised screening programmes, research, improved treatment options and prevention recom- mendation we now have more breast cancer survivors than ever. We're grateful to now be able to turn more attention to survivorship and how we support women who are able to live their lives thanks to research.

With a yearly budget of over\u20ac101m in 2016, the charity mostly funds research projects and raises awareness of progress in cancer research. The funds raised through the charity each year are allocated to research projects throughout thecountry and throughout Europe that are approved bythe AIRC's scientic committee. AIRC is predominately committed to: Funding research carried out at universities, labora- tories, hospitals and scientic institutions; Completing the education of young researchers in Italy and abroad by oering grants for further study; Informing the public and raising awareness of the progress made in cancer research. Since the charity was founded in 1965, it has funded more than \u20ac984m worth of projects for cancer research and given \u20ac39m for study grants to young researchers. The AIRC's scientic committee is led by Scientic Director, Federico Calligario Cappio, who states: \"With the fair independent and transparent AIRC peer review process, the most competitive and scientically meritorious proposals are funded. The money donated to the AIRC is used to support only the best research in the country.\" Members of the scientic committee who review and select the most promising research programmes for the AIRC to fund are said to be men and women whoare \"at the forefront of Italian oncology\". Research is the key focus of the charity and it is imperative that only the most promising projects are chosen to receive funding. Projects that are selected are usually ones that prove to be innovative as well as having a substantialimpact on cancer patients. Funding research For 2017, the AIRC and its foundation has reportedly raised \u20ac102m to help fund research projects and con- tinue the ght against cancer. This huge investment will enable around 5,000 researchers to work in univer- sities, laboratories, as well as hospitals and research institutions. This funding just tops the investment from 2016, which totalled just over \u20ac101m. The 2016 funding was invested into projects such as a molecular clinical oncology programme, early detection and supporting young researchers. Scientic research is one of the key elements for developing new treatments or therapies for cancer.There are many types of scientic research which the AIRC funds: basic research, translational research, pre- clinical research, clinical research and epidemiologicalresearch. Each of these plays their own role in achieving the ambitious goals for defeating cancer once and for all. The funds that organisations such as the AIRC raise are crucial to achieving this goal, and supporting many patients throughout Italy who are ghting the disease. Open Access Government provides an insight into how the AIRC - the Italian Association for Cancer Research is supporting cancer research in Italy Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovFor a long time, cancer has been considered a strictly biological problem involving the birth, survival and proliferation of tumour cells through an abundant number of complex biochemical processes and pathways that may be triggered by genetic alterations. While this view is fundamentally correct, as confirmed by a large amount of scientific studies, in the last decade it has become increasingly clear that physics may have a relevant role in understanding some aspects of cancer. Multidisci- plinary research teams made of biol- ogists, physicists, chemists, engineers, etc. are more and more often involved in the quest for a cure to cancer. In this respect, physicists are typically trying to understand how far the avail- able description of collections of inan- imate entities, such as particles, can be used in explaining the more complex systems made of cells, livingand motile objects ruled by a myriadof internal processes, powered by metabolic reactions and reacting to biochemical signalling. Cellular jams A notable example of powerful anal- ogy that can be transferred from physics to biology is the so called jamming transition, a transition from a fluid-like state into a solid-like state usually observed in systems of inert particles when the number of particles in a prescribed region of space becomes too large. Think for instance to the behaviour of a granular materialsuch as corn or rice that flows like a liquid through a funnel until it cogs and becomes akin to a solid. Similar behaviour is also exhibited by non- granular inert materials such as foams and dense colloidal suspensions for large densities. Epithelial tissues are made of a large number of cells in close contact. It hasbeen recently understood that it is this crowding that convinces the otherwise very motile epithelial single cells to stop moving and building a tissue as we know it by conferring to its physio- logical properties. Unexpectedly, this crowding inhibition of cell locomotion bears many similarities with jamming 1 and provides a simple mechanism to explain why proliferating cells that are very motile in isolation become arrested at large densities. Finding a physical basis that explains a dynami- cal arrest mechanism in dense cellular assemblies is an important resultbecause it provides a purely physicalmechanism that may help biochemical signalling in inhibiting cell motion in dense tissues. \"Of course, laboratory experiments are only the first step toward understanding the role of jamming and unjamming in real tumours. In the near future, it will of paramount importance to check if this JUT transition is also found in more realistic laboratory systems that mimic in a closer fashion the complex three-dimensional nature of tumours and their surrounding environment.\" Metastatic cells may escape from the jam Cells in a tissue may however escape this configuration. A typical example of such an escape is the so called Epithe- lial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT), literally a change of identity of an epithelial cell that becomes mesenchy-Professor Roberto Cerbino of the University of Milan discusses how cell tissues may be ruled by the same laws of jammed inert particlesJammed inert particles and their role in understanding cancer 58PROFILE mal i.e. it loses adhesion with the sur- rounding cells and it acquires a motile behaviour that makes possible for this cell to move at large distances from the original position. It has been proposed that the EMT is involved in the dissem- ination of cancer from the primary tumour through metastasis, a complex process that is responsible for the large majority of the deaths due to cancer. Once a tumour cell finds a mechanism to move inside interstitial tissues and reach the blood circulation system it can reach distant regions and colonise them by creating secondary tumours, a largely unwanted process. Unfortu- nately, tumours exhibit a degree of plasticity that allows them to adopt a variety of strategies to disseminate in a healthy organism far away from the primary tumours. Knowing and under- standing the largest number of them might be of paramount importance in controlling cancer dissemination. Unjamming a tissue A different gateway to cellular motility in jammed tissues, is represented by the recently discovered Jamming-to- Unjamming (JUT) transition, a phe- nomenon by which motility has been restored either via the action of a mechanical force2or by the activation of a protein (RAB5A) that plays a fun- damental role in aggressive mammary tumours3. Surprisingly, the changes leading to cellular unjamming are mostly physical in that they involve, forinstance, an increase of the adhesionbetween different cells and/or the activation of a 'social' alignment mech-anism such as the one used by birds to fly in flocks. In this last case, we have observed [3] that cells tend to move in groups, in an organised waythat resembles the strategies enacted by crowds to pass in narrow spaces. Unjamming is thus a mechanism that represents an alternative strategy that may be used by cells in pathological conditions as an alternative to other strategies, such as the EMT, in the same way as jamming may be used to ensure the proper development of barrier properties of mature epithelial tissues. It should be however noted that unjamming is also used during wound healing, where cells need to move quickly, in a liquid-like fashion to close the wound. \"While this view is fundamentally correct, as confirmed by a large amount of scientific studies, in the last decade it has become increasingly clear that physics may have a relevant role in understanding some aspects of cancer.\" Relevance of jamming and unjamming to cancer Our findings3suggest that tumours do not emerge solely in response to genetic alterations but rely extensively on the physical contact and interaction with the surrounding environment. While genetic alterations do require some time to become operative, phys- ical-based changes might be faster and thus more dangerous. Of course, laboratory experiments are only thefirst step toward understanding the role of jamming and unjamming in real tumours. In the near future, it will of paramount importance to check if this JUT transition is also found inmore realistic laboratory systems that mimic in a closer fashion the complex three-dimensional nature of tumours and their surrounding environment.Physics at the service of cancer biology The results briefly described here are only one of the many problems obtained by cross-disciplinary teams in which the ideas and concepts of physics are borrowed to tackle intrin- sically biological probes. Interestingly, terms such as forces, tractions, ten- sions, cell mechanics, elasticity, viscos- ity and many others that have been originated in a physics context are now becoming part of the current language of cell biologists. This trend may be somehow interpreted as a kind of acknowledgment of the increasing usefulness of a physics-based approach in understanding the complex and multifaceted essence of cancer.

With the identification of recurrently mutated genes and constitutively activated signaling path- ways, therapeutic approaches in oncology are becoming highly specificand personalised with the aim of max-imising results and minimising side effects. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) isan outstanding example in this con- text. This disease, which representsthe most common form of adultleukemia in Europe and North Amer- ica, has now several highly effectivetargeted therapeutic options that arerapidly substituting the \"old\" regimes of chemo and immunotherapy. The most advanced clinical experience has been accumulated using the btk inhibitor ibrutinib, which targets a specific kinase in the signaling path- way activated by the B cell receptor, clearly the driving force in the pro- gression of the disease. Even if clinical trials using btk inhibitors are proving highly successful, with very few casesprogressing under the drug and with durable responses even in the case of patients with unfavorable geneticaberrations, the cure is still out of the picture. Importantly, some studies have suggested that discontinuation of the drug leads to rapid diseaserelapse and progression, posing ques- tions on the long-term effects of these therapies and also on its costs. The Immunogenetics Unit of the Human Genetics Foundation , an insti- tution that opened in Turin at the end of 2010 from the joint efforts of the local University, the Polytechnic and the Compagnia di SanPaolo, has been working since the beginning in the CLL field, with the aim of unraveling path- ways and mechanisms controlling leukemia proliferation and survival. These studies, significantly supported by the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC), have contributed to our knowledge on how the CLL cell grows and how it manipulates its microenvironment to create local con- ditions that favor growth and survival. One of the areas of research that has attracted our attention as potentially interesting from the therapeutic point of view is based on data indicating that leukemic cells need to be sur- rounded and supported by non- tumor cells to survive and proliferate. These dangerous liaisons take place in privileged niches within the lymph nodes known as proliferation centers (Figure 1). Our group has shown that extracellular adenosine is one of themeans through which CLL cells obtain T and myeloid cell cooperation. This small molecule is the final product of extracellular ATP metabolism, gener- ated through enzymes expressed on the surface of both CLL and non-leukemic cells, and signals through specific membrane receptors. We showed that adenosine effects on CLL homeostasis are twofold: on one side, it directly protects leukemic cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apop- tosis; on the other side, it shapes the environment towards immune toler-ance, by inhibiting T-cell responses and inducing differentiation of sup- portive myeloid cells (Serra et al., 2011; Serra et al., 2016). In addition to tricks adopted to mold a tumor-friendly environment, CLL cells exhibit intrinsic features that heavily impact their behavior, and whose functional characterisation represents the second main topic of our research activity. Before the advent of next generation sequencing, there were few markers to identify patients with an aggressive diseaseAssociate Professor of Medical Genetics, Silvia Deaglio, highlights the research strides being made in the fight against chronic lymphocytic leukemiaChronic lymphocytic leukemia: getting closer to a cure? 60PROFILE Figure 1: Confocal microscopy image showing a proliferation center in a lymph node biopsy from a patient with CLL. Leukemic cells are colored in green, while T cells appear red. The blue dots identify proliferating CLL cells, which appear in close contact with T cellsCD23 (B) Ki-67 (proliferating) CD2 (T)and the expression of CD38 was one of them. Our group has extensively investigated the role and the signaling properties of CD38 and revealed that it actively favors survival and prolifer-ation of leukemic cells by cooperating with chemokine receptors and inte- grin's. By blocking CD38 enzymatic activity, we also provided proof of theprinciple that drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting this molecule might be therapeutically useful in CLL (Vaisitti et al., 2015). More recently, the use of ultra-deep sequencing platforms, led to the iden- tification of recurrent mutations asso- ciated with worse disease outcomesand likely conferring advantages to leukemic cells. These platforms are also used to monitor disease evolu- tion, clearly showing that the genetic profile of CLL evolves with time and therapy. This observation implies that either leukemic cells acquire novel genetic lesions as a result of micro - environmental conditions that lead togenomic instability, or that sub clones of the leukemic population, carrying specific mutations are progressivelyselected during the course of the dis- ease. This discovery pointed out the importance of understanding and predicting the effects exerted bymutated genes in the disease contextand how they affect leukemic cell behavior and therapy responses. Our team has focused on NOTCH1 muta- tions, as they are relatively frequent in newly diagnosed CLL, increasing with the progression of the disease and in conditions of therapy resistance. We have shown that NOTCH1 mutationsderegulate its activities as a transcrip- tion factor, remodeling gene expres- sion of leukemic cells through direct (transcription-mediated) or indirect (epigenetic) mechanisms. Function- ally, mutated NOTCH1 promotes growth and migration of leukemic cells by increasing expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7, through acomplex network of nuclear signaling. As a result, mutated cells exhibit increased chemotaxis toward CCL19, the ligand of CCR7 and an important chemokine regulating trafficking of CLL cells to lymphoid niches. The rel- evance for the disease is that NOTCH1 mutations may contribute to an unfa- vorable prognosis by promoting the migration of leukemic cells to the lym- phoid organs, where the protective micro-environment provides stimula- tory signals favoring a more aggres- sive behaviour (Arruga et al., 2016). Even if it is difficult to predict the future of this highly interesting and rapidly evolving field, the shared hopeis to obtain a cure suitable for the majority of patients. It is possible thatthis will come by combining drugs that target central pathways in leukemic cell biology together with drugs that alter connections and com- munications with the environment, making it inhospitable. The next decade will likely tell if these approaches work. References Arruga, F., B. Gizdic, C. Bologna, S. Cignetto, F. Diop, F. Neri, D. M. Coscia, J. Allan, R. Piva, S. Oliviero, R.R. Furman, D.

Asbestos is just a small subset of dozensof naturally occurring elongated minerals that can cause disease if people come into contact with them on a daily basis. In the U.S exposure to these materials is fast becoming a major health problem. Although the 6 commercial forms of asbestos are regulated in theU.S for occupational exposure, some people argue that those regulations don't go far enough to protect the public because they are outdated. Open Access Government Editor, Laura Evans spoketo Dr. Christopher. P. Weis, Toxicology Liaison and Senior Science Advisor for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in Bethesda, MD, about the many health problems asbestos exposurecan cause and the importance of raising awareness. \"Commercial asbestos is a silicatious mineral containing magnesium and oxygen that can exist in a variety of mineral forms,\" explains Weis. \"It is made up of longthin brous forms of minerals or rock. It's the shape of those minerals, their long, thin nature, along with other physical-chemical characteristics, which causes them to be very poisonous. \"The shape is important because these long particles can make their way deep into the lung by travelling along the laminar flow of the air, as it is breathed in. Since they are made out of rock, they don't dissolve easily, so the lung has a very dicult time removing, dissolving and eliminating them. When the materials that contain asbestos are disturbed or damaged, bres are released into the air. Once these particles are then breathed in, they can have a devastating impact on a person's health. Although sometimes the health prob-lems do not arise until later in life so it's often hard to tell where the exposure occurred or if it was even asbestos exposure in the rst place. \"When someone breathes in asbestos, it causes a series of inflammatory reactions in the lung. When thecells that normally remove particles from the lung cannot remove these elongated mineral particles, theysend out signals called cytokines, that trigger inflam-mation and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which results in brosis or scar tissue forming in the lung,\" Weis says. \"Essentially, when asbestos is breathed in it causes a series of biochemical responses that further aggravatethe problem. This can lead to a variety of diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and a very lethal and aggressive form of cancer called mesothelioma. \"Importantly and frequently, asbestos may cause non-cancer diseases that progress and become debil- itating later in life and that we see a lot of that going on today, in several areas, there seems to be an epi- demic of that non-cancerous disease associated with asbestos,\" he adds. Problems caused by asbestos exposure Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive form of cancer that is almost exclusively related to asbestos exposure - often referred to as Meso. If someone gets Meso it's almost certainly because they were exposed to asbestos. One of the main problems with diagnosis is not always knowing when exposure happened and how, as Weis explains. \"Like most exposures there is a dose-response rela- tionship, the higher the dose the more quickly and more severe the disease. That said, there are manyDr Christopher P. Weis of the National Institutes of Health, shares with Editor Laura Evans the dangers of long-term asbestos exposureHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 63cases of short term exposure that result in disease later in life, the time between exposure and disease is called a latency period. Exposure can occur today or tomorrow, and they don't see the eects of thatexposure for months or years and sometimes even decades, which can be problematic for many reasons. \"It's often dicult for physicians to diagnose the cause of the disease because the patient aected doesn'teven remember being exposed in some cases. They may never even know that they were exposed until they are much older and could develop lung cancer ora non-cancer disease that could be lethal.\" Asbestos-related diseases from exposure have become a major problem in the U.S. People assume that because the mineral is regulated that the problemis under control, however this couldn't be further from the truth. There are still many ongoing exposures to non-regulated asbestos that can cause debilitating or lethal diseases. \"There is a growing epidemic of asbestos-related disease in the U.S and worldwide that is going on un-addressed,\" says Weis. \"This is because we are still measuring asbestos the same way we did back in the late 1800's. The Environmental Protection Agency, under recent revisions to the Toxic Substances ControlAct has proposed regulation of the 6 forms of asbestos using assumptions that came into play decades ago. Unfortunately, regulations have not evolved with our understanding of how the disease has occurred. \"Many elongated mineral forms that occur naturally pose public health hazards,\" adds Weis. \"They just simply have never fallen under any regulatory map in this country and that's unfortunate because the expo- sure to these non- regulated forms is increasing nation-wide. \"One example of this is a tragedy that occurred in a small mountain town in Montana called Libby. Several hundred people were killed and thousands injured bya form of asbestos that was not regulated. There are also cases of similar exposure that are not as focusedas the occurance in Libby, such as the use of asbestos- bearing gravel on roads and for construction materials in California, Nevada, and in the upper United States, for example. The dust from the roads can contaminatevehicles, migrate into homes, and provide a source of ongoing exposure that may last for years.\" Raising awareness to the risks of asbestos exposure Raising awareness of the health problems caused byasbestos exposure is key to ensuring people are aware of the risks. Especially as there is such a close link between exposure and lung disease. Some people will be unaware, for example, that if you smoke and work in places where you are likely to be exposed to asbestos, you run a greater risk of developing lung cancer. Without people knowing the true damage thatasbestos exposure could cause, they are at risk. Weis highlights how the incorrect assumption that asbestos is regulated puts people at risk. \"Awareness is probably one of the most importantthings, but the only way to really reduce the risk is to break the exposure pathway. For example if there is a residential development in an area known to have asbestos - we have one just south of Washington DC for example - and one is aware of the fact that basements and houses are being built on naturally occurringasbestos, there are many steps that can be taken to minimise or eliminate the exposure. However, without knowing about this problem and without taking the necessary actions to understand what the exposuresare, there is really no way to eliminate the exposure and therefore the disease. \"The key thing to remember and think about is that asbestos exposure occurs to a wide variety of elongated minerals outside of the 6 that are regulated. Until we understand that and take active measures to protect public health for the un-regulated forms of asbestos, the health epidemic that is increasing worldwide and in this country will continue,\" Weis concludes.

Weis Toxicology Liaison and Senior AdvisorOffice of the Director - National Institutes of Health/NIEHS christopher.weis@nih.gov www.niehs.nih.govThe community of primary inter- est to the Penn Superfund Research and Training Program (SRP) Center is surrounded and potentially impacted by the BoRit EPA region 3 Superfund site. The site is located in the Ambler Borough, Upper Dublin and Whitpain townships in Pennsylvania. This community has a long history of impact from hazardous asbestos waste. The waste disposal site is proximate to at least 2 very different types of communities: the relatively poor communities of West (predominantly African American) and South (Italian immigrant) Ambler which adjoins the site raising issues of environmental justice. The asbestos fiber used was predominantly chrysotile, which is the fiber considered to be a major cause of mesothelioma in the US. It is of significant concern that in the Ambler zip code 19002, where the BoRit site is located, a cluster of mesotheliomas has been observed. In 1881, Henry G. Keasbey and Dr Richard Mattison moved their pharmaceutical company to Ambler, known initially for the production of milk of magnesia. Dr Mattison discovered that milk of magnesia (magnesium carbonate) could be combined with asbestos to make pipe insulators and shingles. The Keasbey and Mattison Co. was the leading manufacturer of asbestos textiles and products until it was acquired by England's largest asbestoscompany, Turner Newhall, Ltd., which manufactured asbestos textiles and products in Ambler from 1934 to 1962. Asbestos-containing waste from the plant was dumped in several surround- ingareas, a practice that continued when CertainTeed Corporation and Nicolet Industries took over in 1962. CertainTeed ceased operations in 1974, followed by Nicolet in approximately 1988. Site remediation by the EPA under the Superfund Programme began in 1993. This remediation has involved capping the asbestos piles, adding a soil layer and hydroseeding. However, 3 other contaminated sites, in total about 32 acres and up to 42feet deep, collectively known as the BoRit Site, and the abandoned plant site itself continue to present an un- remediated hazard. The BoRit site was added to the EPA's National PrioritiesList of the most hazardous waste sites on April 9, 2009, making it eligible for cleanup, using the federal Superfund Programme funding. Research to reduce effects of hazardous asbestos in the Penn SRP Centre Despite clean-up efforts, there is considerable residual community concern about the effectiveness of the remediation and the health effects of potential exposure to chrysotile asbestos. This has led to 6 major con- cerns being brought to the attention of Penn's Centre of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET). Dr Trevor Penning as Director of the CEET engaged his long-term collaborator Dr Ian Blair to establish a SRP programme configured around thesecommunity concerns (Figure 2).Hazardous asbestos waste causes serious problems in communities in the U.S., Ian A Blair, Penn Superfund Research and Training Program Center detailsAdverse health effects of hazardous asbestos waste 64PROFILE Can asbestos be remediated? Is asbestos transported by water? Why is there a cluster of mesotheliomas among women in Ambler? Is there a genetic pre-disposition to asbestos-induced mesothelioma? Can asbestos-induced mesothelioma be prevented? Is it possible to develop blood tests for asbestos exposure and mesothelioma? Figure 1: Six questions posed by BoRit Community Advisory Group to Penn's Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET)Project 1, which is one of the 2 envi- ronmental science projects, underpins all the other projects. Project 2 assesses the physics that govern how asbestos fibers move through and become trapped in soil. The project works closely with Project 3, as community exposure to remediated asbestos in Ambler (and other areas) is strongly determined by the transport pathways of asbestos fibers in the environment. Project 4will enhance our understand- ingof the pathogenesis of asbestos- related disease, specifically malignant mesothelioma, using genetically defined mouse models. Project 5will develop chemoprevention strategies to prevent mesothelioma.Project 6 will develop sensitive and specific serum biomarkers of asbestos exposure to assess potential inter- individual risks of developing mesothelioma or lung cancer. The six projects are supported by four conventional Cores as well as the Research Core in Biostatistics.

It is estimated that millions of people have pancreatic cysts (2% to 13% of the general popu- lation in the United States undergoing imaging). Because of the prevalenceof these cysts, physicians often see them in patients undergoing diagnosti c imaging, but the patients commonly do not have any symptoms from the cyst itself. This usually represents a conundrum for the doctor and patient because the cysts were not expected. The imaging is usually ordered for rea- sons unrelated to the pancreas (like gallbladder stones or other benign or malignant conditions). The challengelies with the fact that the vast majority of pancreatic cysts are benign, but a small proportion of cysts can turn into pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest diseases that afflicts humans. The common initial reaction: How do I get rid of it? Currently, the only way to cure pan- creatic cysts is with major surgery that may involve removal of part of the stomach and bowel, along with the pancreatic cyst(s). The surgery can be life-altering, and the procedure carries a small risk of death. Even after con- sidering the morbidity and mortality of the surgery, many patients receive too much treatment (also described as over diagnosis) for an otherwise benign condition, largely out of fear that a cancer might be lurking. Refocusing the question: What are the needles in the haystack? Techniques to characterise these pancreatic cysts are urgently needed to spare patients with benign cysts from unnecessary surgery and toidentify the patients with potentially malignant cysts who need surgery. Inour analogy, the haystack represents all the patients with pancreatic cysts. The needles represent the small number of patients who have cysts that may turn into cancer. There are multiple forms of pancreatic cysts. The most common types that can turn into pancreatic cancer areThere are many challenges associated with identifying potentially cancerous pancreatic cysts. Here, Dr. Annabelle L. Fonseca et al that surgical removal of IPMNs or MCNs when they have not yet turned into cancer results in 5-year survival rates of 90-100%. Conversely, if any cancer component is found in the cyst after surgery, the survival rate is reduced by half. The current think- ing by experts is that benign cysts exhibit a cellular pattern known as low grade dysplasia, and that cysts with a higher likelihood of becoming cancerhave high grade dysplasia. Currently, the only reliable method to get the cor- rect diagnosis involves major surgery so that a pathologist can see the entiretissue specimen; a small biopsy is not usually sufficient for an accurate diag- nosis. So how do we select patients with pancreatic cysts for surgery? The current approach: More hay than needles The current approach to deciding which patients should receive surgery involves the use of consensus guide- lines: If a patient meets the criteria,which a group of experts decide on, then the patient is recommended to undergo surgery. This approach does not involve evidence based clinical trials, unfortunately. Although the consensus guidelines have a relatively high sensitivity of around 90% or more (it can detect most cysts with cancer), there is a relatively low speci- ficity of 50-60% (it incorrectly classifies benign cysts as high risk), feeding the over diagnosis problem. How can we accurately identify the high risk pan- creatic cysts non-invasively? A multi-faceted, biophysical approach to the problem In the next few articles, we will explore the approaches to better identify high risk pancreatic cysts. Our approach involves the use of genetics, proteomics, physics, and math to overcome the cur- rent challenges that pancreatic cystspose to physicians, patients, and the general healthcare system.Vittorio Cristini Center for Precision Biomedicine Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) McGovern Medical School J.

AB \"This work was sponsored by the MD Anderson Cancer Moonshots program, Sheikh Ahmed Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research, and National Institutes of Health grant U01CA196403.\"Immunotherapy is starting to play a major role in cancer treatment and it was named as \"the break- through treatment of the year\" in 2013. Cancer immunotherapeutic agents have earned over $60 billion revenues in 2016 and is expected to have a market value of about $80 bil- lion in 2020. Thus, pharmaceutical companies are evaluating new ways to use immunotherapy to treat cancers and develop a wide range of immunotherapeutic drugs for various cancers. Cancer immunotherapy can be defined as \"use of a person's immune system to fight against cancer either by teach- ing it to work smart or stimulating the immune system by man-made immune components to attack cancer cells\". It can also be defined as a \"treatment for cancer by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response\". However, the therapeutic outcome of the immunotherapeutic agents highly depends on the type of cancer, type of the immunotherapy, and treatment modality (mono orcombination therapy). Whilst the immune system is sup- posed to eliminate cancer cells within the body, it is not able to differentiate cancer cells from normal healthy cells. Cancer cells also express CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47) as healthy cells do. CD47 is also known as integrin- associated protein (IAP) and it produces a protein named signal-regulatoryprotein alpha (SIRP) that sends don't eat me signals to the macrophages, a type immune cells, and do not activate to attack me signals to T-cells, another type of immune cells. On the other hand, if it recognised that the response might not be strong enough to destroy the cancer cells. Moreover, cancer cells recruit immune cells such as tumour-associated macrophages, a subtype of immune cells, which keep the immune system in check and chase away T-cells that come to attack the cancer cells. Cancer immunotherapeutic agents can mainly be classified into 4 major categories: Monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and non-specific immunotherapies. Monoclonal antibodies in the immunotherapeutic sector can be defined as man-made antibodies that induce antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), by recruiting immune cells or activating the complement system to attack tumour cells. Recruitment of immune cells can also be accomplished by designing a bispecific antibody that has 2 different monoclonal antibodies with one to recognise biomarker oncancer cells and a second to recognise biomarkers on immune cells. Blincyto (Blinatumomab) is a bispecific antibody that is used to treat acute lymphocytic leukaemia or B-cell lymphoma. It binds to the CD19 protein on B-lymphocytesand to CD3 on T cells. By binding to both of these biomarkers, blinatu- momab brings T cells closer to cancer cells and eliciting an immune response to diminishing cancer cells. Blincyto was developed by Micromet and then later acquired by Amgen, which has conducted further clinical development and is predicted to generate sales revenues of over $1.5 billion in 2019. The second class of immunothera- peutic agents is immune checkpoint inhibitors that take the 'brakes' off the immune system to attack the cancer cells. The immune system has check- point proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cyto- toxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA), that help to keep it from attacking other normal cells in the body. Unfortunately, cancer cells takeadvantage of these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. A joint effort by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical yield to launch blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo (nivolumab), in Japan for melanoma in 2014 and it expects to generate sales revenues of $4.3 billion in 2019. Keytruda (pembrolizumab), PD-1 inhibitor developed by Merck for melanoma, is predicted to generate sales revenues of $2.9 billion in 2019. Yervoy (ipilimumab) is an example of a monoclonal antibody that activates the immune system by targeting CTLA-4, a protein receptor that down- regulates the immune system. WhileDr. Kularatne, vice president of Research and Development at On Target Laboratories highlights cancer immunotherapy as the treatment of next generation to cure cancerCancer immunotherapy: Are we ready to take the next big step? 68PROFILEYervoy was developed by James Allison, clinical development of anti-CTLA4 was initiated by Medarex, which was later acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Industry experts have predicted that Yervoy will generate sales revenues of $1.5 billion in 2019. Cancer vaccines are made from altered cancer cells that have been removed from the patient during surgery, immune cells that have been isolated from the patient's blood, or antigen such as protein, peptide or hapten that have been used to boost immune cells. Cancer vaccines can be used as prevention or therapeutic methods for cancer. In the case of cancer cell vaccines, cells are altered chemically in the lab to ensure they are recognised and attacked by the immune system and then injected back into the patient. On the other hand, isolated immune cells from the patient are exposed to cancer cells, cancer antigens, or chemicals to acti- vate and then injected back into thepatient, where they should cause an immune response to cancer cells in the body. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is a dendritic cell (a type of immune cells) vaccine manufactured by Dendreon and received FDA approval to treat metastatic prostate cancer in 2010. Provenge generated $303.8 million revenue in 2014. The fourth category can be classified as non-specific immunotherapeutic modalities that boost the immune system in a general way. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is promising non-specific immuno - therapeutic modality to fight cancer. In this technique, T cells are removed from the patient's blood and geneti- cally engineered in the lab to express CAR. The T cells are then multiplied in a culture dish and infused back into the patient's blood. Theoretically, these T-cells should seek out the cancer cells and launch a preciseimmune attack against them. Juno Therapeutics, Kite Pharma, Novartis,and Cellectis conducting clinical trials on CAR-T cell therapies for differ-ent types of cancers. While some patients have shown promising results with high remission rates, alarge number of patients have experi- enced untoward toxicities due to non- specific nature of this treatment. It's Obvious that recent deaths in the Juno ROCKET trial are creating uncertainties about CAR-T technology, researchers are currently trying to improve to overcome challenges of current CAR-T cell therapies. We have to get immune cells ready to battle against cancer cells. To out- compete the intelligence of cancer cells, we have to prepare immune systems well by recognising weakness and strengths of cancer cells. Due to tumour heterogeneity, we have toprepare immune cells differently for each cancer type. \" Every battle is won before it is fought\" - Sun Tzu, The Art of War, 400 B.C. That's how I see cancer immunotherapy. Sumith A Kularatne PhD VP of R&D On Target Laboratories, LLC 1281 Win Hentschel Blvd West CARE 70In 2012, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch to serve as the epicenter of gynaecologicresearch at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Gynaecologic disorders aect women's quality of lifein ways distinct from reproduction and infertility and, therefore, require an independent research focus andsupport. Here, Dr. Lisa Halvorson, Chief of the branch, answers Open Access Government's questions on the importance of gynaecologic health and of research to advance our understanding of gynaecologic disorders. What is gynaecologic health and why is it important? Gynaecologic health includes the health, structure, and function of internal organs, including those in the pelvis,and external genitalia that allow for normal menstrua- tion, sexual function, and reproduction without chronicor recurrent pain. Many disorders, although not fatal,can impact gynaecologic health. These include men- strual abnormalities, ovarian cysts, uterine broids, endometriosis, and pelvic floor disorders (pelvic organprolapse, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence), to name a few. In addition, there are several gynaecologic pain syndromes, such as chronic pelvic pain, chronic pain in the area around the opening of the vagina (vulvodynia), pain associated with menstrual cycles (dysmenorrhea), and painful sexual intercourse (dys- pareunia). Obstetric stula, dened as a hole in the birthcanal, and female genital cutting also are important. Gynaecologic disorders are fairly common and have far-reaching health and societal impacts. For instance, the most common non-cancerous gynaecologic tumor in women is uterine broids, with a lifetime prevalence of 70 to 80%, of which 30% are symptomatic. Another disease, endometriosis, aects approximately 10% ofreproductive-age women. Also, it is estimated that several million women in the United States suer from vulvodynia alone, although the true prevalence of this and other gynaecologic pain syndromes remains unknown. Pelvic floor disorders aect almost 25% ofU.S. women between ages 20 and 80 years. As the U.S. population ages, the number of women with pelvicfloor disorders is expected to increase substantially. The detrimental health eects of gynaecologic disor- ders can range from abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, infertility, and sexual dysfunction to substantial psychosocial illness and limitations in daily activities. The nancial burden of these conditions is also veryhigh, with endometriosis and broids alone costing the United States billions of dollars every year in health care resources and lost work hours. How important is research to develop new methods for prevention and diagnosis? Despite the health and nancial burdens of gynaeco- logic diseases, large gaps remain in our understanding of the key processes contributing to the development and progression of these disorders. Without ongoing Dr. Lisa Halvorson, U.S. National Institutes of Health discusses the importance of gynaecologic research to develop new treatments and keep women healthyGynaecologic research: Improving health for womenHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 71research, the gaps will remain, leaving millions of women without evidence-based prevention methods, diagnosis, or treatment. What key target areas comprise the focus of research in the NICHD Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch? Current eorts aim to support research in selectedgynaecologic areas that have traditionally been over- looked or underfunded, such as socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic disparities in reproductive health outcomes. Although NICHD funding is allocated for studies of broids, endometriosis, pelvic floor disorders, and gynaecologic pain, our goal is to expand our portfolio toaddress a wider range of problems. Over the past year, branch research has focused on the following: Supporting longitudinal studies to better understand the natural history of gynaecologic disorders, partic- ularly in adolescents, to help identify risk factors, possible prevention strategies, and treatments; Fostering partnerships with experts in relevant clinical and basic science elds (e.g., neurobiology, muscle biology, cell biology, and immunology) to enhanceknowledge and resource-sharing across disciplines; Applying epigenomics, and proteomics) to gynaeco- logic conditions; Investigating stem cells as a cause and potential therapy for gynaecologic disorders, from studies oftheir role in causing such disorders to projects that utilise stem-cell based therapies to treat the disorders; pharmacologic treat- ments to improve methods and biomarkers to gynaecologic disorders.How does your branch support such research and help raise awareness for gynaecologic health? The NICHD Gynaecologic Health and Disease Branch funds basic, translational, and clinical research to investigate gynaecologic diseases. We also identify research needs and develop grant opportunities to address new or underdeveloped areas of investigation. To ensure that we have our ngers on the pulse of the various elds within gynaecologic health, branch sta participate in national and international meetings and maintain ongoing communication with the scienticcommunity, advocacy organisations, related govern- ment agencies, and the general public. \"Gynaecologic disorders are fairly common and have far-reaching health and societal impacts. For instance, the most common non-cancerous gynaecologic tumor in women is uterine fibroids, with a lifetime prevalence of 70 to 80% of which 30% are symptomatic.\" These contacts enable us to distribute informationrelated to research aims, funding opportunities, and study results to better convey the importance of gynae- cologic health. The branch also supports research train- ing and career development programs to create a future of excellence in women's health research. In short, thebranch serves as a link between the scientic commu- nity, the public, health practitioners, and dierent levelsof government with the ultimate goal of advancing gynaecologic research and health.

These tumours disrupt the functions of the uterus and can cause excessive uterine bleeding, anaemia, defective implantation, recurrent pregnancy loss, pelvic discomfort and urinary incontinence, as well as possi- bly mimicking or masking malignant tumours in many U.S. women at some time during their reproductive life. By age 50, nearly 70% of Caucasian women and more than 80% of African-American women bear at leastone fibroid and 15 to 30% of these women develop severe symptoms. Uterine fibroids disproportionately affect African-American women, who develop significantly larger fibroids at a higher rate and earlier ages, have more severe symptoms and sustain tumour growth for longer periods compared with Caucasian women. Approximately 200,000 hysterec- tomies, 30,000 myomectomies, and thousands of selective uterine artery embolisation's and high-intensityfocused ultrasound procedures are performed annually to remove ordestroy uterine fibroids with an estimated total annual cost to the U.S of $5.9-34.4 billion. It would not be anexaggeration to state that uterine fibroids represent the most important and prevalent benign gynaecologic problem in the U.S. There is a critical need to identify alternative therapeuticapproaches for leiomyomas that do not involve surgical intervention. Surgery, either hysterectomy or myomectomy, is currently the primary avenue of treatment for leiomyomas, since effective non-surgical treatment options are extremely limited. Uterine artery embolisation is effective only in specific subgroups of patients with small fibroids and is not recommended for patients who intend to become pregnant. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, which suppress steroid hormones have significant side effects that restrict their use. There is also a high rate of recurrence of leiomyomas once GnRH analogue treatment is discontinued. Success is now being achieved with the use of the selective progesterone modulator ulipristal acetate. Several recent clinical studies have shown that ulipristal treatment was able to control myoma-associated uterine bleeding in over 90% of cases and significantly reduce myoma volume in more than 80% of women. This treat-ment is considered safe, even at the level of endometrial changes and is viewed as a promising alternative drug therapy. Uterine fibroids are still misunderstood Currently available treatments for fibroids are limited due in large part to the fact that the mechanisms regulat- ing the development and growth ofthese tumours are still not well under- stood. Many investigators in the field hypothesise that leiomyomas develop in the uterine myometrium as a response to inflammation or injury caused by local hypoxia during men- struation or the presence of bacterial or other pathogens. We and others also hypothesise that dietary interven- tion, with compounds known to inhibit inflammation-associated pathways, will decrease growth of fibroids lead- ing to decreased size and ameliorationof symptoms and this is now a very active area of research. Several studies from the laboratory of Dr. Al-Hendy and colleagues have supported the use of vitamin D as a dietary intervention for leiomyomas. His group reported that the vitamin Dreceptor activator, paracalcitol, inhib- ited leiomyoma tumour formation in a rat model and that vitamin D also inhibited proliferation and collagen production in cultured human leiomyoma cells. Dr. Al-Hendy has also shown that green tea extract, given orally to women with fibroids, caused a reduction in fibroid volume and symptoms. Green tea is a natural product, commonly used as a nutritional supplement for multiple purposes. Epigallocatechin gallate, the major catechin in green tea, exhibits several useful biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antipro- liferative, and antioxidant effects. Studies carried out in animal modelsUterine fibroids represent a prevalent benign gynaecologic problem in the U.S, here Romana A. Nowak of the University of Illinois explainsUterine fibroids: Where is research heading? 72PROFILEhave tested the potential benefits of adding lycopene to the diet to slow the growth of fibroid tumours. Lycopene is a major carotenoid present in tomatoes and has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant. The results show that treatment with lycopene reduced the size and incidence of leiomyomas in quail by approximately 45-52%. Recently our lab has characterised oviductalleiomyomas that occur spontaneously in hens as they age, as a relatively inexpensive, naturally occurring animal model for fibroids. We now have preliminary data showing that hens fed a flaxseed diet showed a decrease in the size of the fibroids compared to hens fed the normal corn-based diet. Thus, dietary inter- vention for treatment of symptomatic fibroids has great potential but there is a critical need for larger scale dietary trials in naturally occurring animal models as well as in women. Fibroid tumours represent many genotypes and somatic mutations and are also strongly influenced by epigenetic factors including inflamma- tion, ethnicity, parity, metabolism and diet, and hormonal environment. Several physiological pathways have been implicated in the development of leiomyomas. However, geneticmutation is strongly thought to be the root cause of leiomyomas. Approxi-mately 40% of leiomyomas have non- abnormalities likely reflect general genomic instability,however mutations in leiomyomas that may underlie such genomic instabilities are only beginning to beunderstood. Mutations in a smallnumber of genes including fumarate hydratase the high mobilitygroup 2 (TSC2) and mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) have been implicated in the initiation of these tumours. Several studies have nowbeen published demonstrating that MED12 mutations are present in 56-73% of uterine fibroids. Polymor- phisms in genes such as CYP17 and cathechol-O-methyltransferase, have also been associated with a higher risk of developing leiomyomas. Recent studies have indicated a role for miRNAs in that many miRNAs including miR-21, miR-363, miR-490, and miR-137 have been shown to be differentially expressed in leiomyomas. As new therapies are developed, the heterogeneity of this disease becomestherapeutically relevant, and a broader knowledge of its genetic basis is vital for tailoring specific therapies to patients. Identification of previously unknown genes whose altered expres- sion and function may contribute to the initiation and growth of fibroid tumours will lead to better therapeutic treatments. In contrast to other areas of tumour biology, the number of published studies reporting whole-genome or whole-exome deep sequencing ofleiomyomas is relatively few. These studies have confirmed the high prevalence of MED12 mutations in leiomyomas and have also confirmed aberrations in HMGA2 and TSC2. How- ever, the populations studied appear to have limited diversity, and the datasets from most of these papers are not freely available to the scientific community, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the genetic and molecular underpinnings of this dis- ease. Thus there is a critical need to provide better insight into leiomyoma biology through the identification ofpreviously unknown genes whose altered expression and function may contribute to the initiation and growth of leiomyoma tumours. This includes investigating the potential role of viruses in leiomyoma pathology, by using RNAseq methods to detectactively transcribed viral genes. \"By age 50, nearly 70% of Caucasian women and more than 80% of African-American women bear at least one fibroid and 15 to 30% of these women develop severe symptoms.\" The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has establishedthe Gynaecologic Health and Disease Branch whose focus is on gynaecolog- ical diseases and women's reproduc-tive health. One of the priority areas for NICHD is uterine fibroids and there have recently been funding announcements for proposals focusing on gene sequencing studies and on new therapeutic approaches to treat fibroids. The next 3-5 years will likely lead to major advances in the treat- ment of uterine fibroids as a result of these studies. Romana A. Nowak, PhD Department of Animal Sciences University of Illinois Tel: +1 217 244 3902 ranowak@illinois.edu http://ansc.illinois.edu/ 73PROFILEIn 2009, the Institute of Medicine declared that the National Insti- tutes of Health (NIH) should estab- lish a comprehensive 10-year plan for prevention and promotion research.1 One year later, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 listed prevention - particularly in the context of primary care - as a key element in its plan to improve health outcomes and reduce total health care costs. Innovations in preventive care may result in decreases in health care expenditures and increases in the proportion of the target audiencereached 2. Online interventions are one such innovation that also provide theopportunity to facilitate health care in a stigmatised area: mental health. 3 \"Our eventual goal is conduct a global clinical trial using English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arab versions of CATCH-IT to determine if this technology-based behavioural vaccine could potentially reduce the worldwide, life course burden of major depression.\" CATCH-IT The NIH estimates that in any given year the prevalence of mental, emo- tional, and behavioural problemsamong adolescents is between 14 and 20% 1. There are disparities in access to mental health care within this pop- ulation. To address the dearth of pre- vention interventions for adolescents and their mental health, Dr Benjamin Van Voorhees MD, MPH, and Dr TracyGladstone, PhD, are completing a phase 3 randomised control trial, funded by the National Institutes ofMental Health (NIMH), to evaluate a behavioural vaccine for adolescentdepression prevention. Drs Van Voorhees and Gladstone developed a primary care internet- based depression prevention interven- tion, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioural Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), to evaluate a self-guided, online approach to depression prevention. 4 The CATCH-IT website involves a series of modules developed using the ther- apeutic modalities of interpersonal therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, the resiliency model, and behavioural activation.5CATCH-IT has demon-strated evidence for efficacy in pre- venting depression in adolescents in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials6, with a large phase 3 clinical trial ongoing. This approach targets youth at risk for a major mental disorder with what we call a behavioural vaccine. There are 4key components of Behavioural Vac- cine Model: 1) Life-course schedule, includes booster doses; 2) effective compo- nents (information and training to encode responses to future threats); 3) Motivational framework to boost response to behaviour prescription; and 4) Structured implementation strategy. The dose in this context, is the amount of time spent on the CATCH-IT website, the number of characters typed, and the number ofUniversity of Illinois' Dr. Benjamin Van Voorhees explains how the CATCH-IT intervention is fighting against depression using a behavioural vaccine approachCATCH-IT: helping to prevent depression and mental illness 74PROFILE noitatnemelpmIg seasesmodules completed. A booster dose would be attained when an adoles- cent, in order to maintain the effects of the original dose, returned to and completed modules again that had previously been effective. The behavioural vaccine intervention of CATCH-IT is staged to be imple- mented globally and is proving to be acceptable culturally with changes that are sensitive to the youth of a specific culture. It is important to maintain core general application elements, such as cognitive behavioural therapy techniques. However, at a relatively low cost, expert consultation, focus group, and user testing can be used tocomplete the cultural translations. We have chosen Chinese, African American, Latin American, and Arab youth as the first audiences for our culturally adapted versions of CATCH- IT 7-9. A Chinese version of CATCH-IT, Grasp the Opportunity, has been developed and a successful trial in Hong Kong has been completed. Ado- lescents randomised to the Grasp the Opportunity arm demonstrated lower levels of depression one year after enrolment, compared to those in acontrol group. 10-11We developed CURB (Chicago Urban Resiliency Building), which was adapted specifically for urban African American and Latino youth.12As a cultural adaptation, CURB included a full translation of the parent component to Spanish. We are refining CURB with focus group data to further refine the intervention with more cultural changes. We are plan- ning a Spanish language version of CATCH-IT, which will in part be based on our results from CURB. Further, CATCH-IT is poised to be translated for Arab youth. This program integratesCATCH-IT within the familial and cultural context of the Middle East.13 Online interventions for adolescents with symptoms of pre-depression have the possibility of preventing the onset of major depressive disorder. CATCH-IT has had success in its early phases and we believe it can be adapted to successfully treat culturally diverse populations. Our eventual goal is conduct a global clinical trial using English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arab versions of CATCH-IT to determine if this technology-based behavioural vaccine could potentially reduce the worldwide, life course burden of major depression.

Last week during a parliamentary debate on HIV, Min- ister for Public Health Nicola Blackwood MP reiterated her decision to extend the local authority public health ring fence for an additional year. One of the reasons the Minister gave for the extension was the need tosee \"how we look at transparency and accountability in public health spending\". We agree. We need to get this transition right. As it currently stands, after 2019,the future of vital HIV and sexual health services remains uncertain. 2017 started o positively for those of us that work in the sexual health sector. News continued to come through that some areas of London had started to see a huge reduction in new diagnoses of HIV in men who have sex with men - up to 40% reduction in some areas. Then in March, after a long battle fought by Terrence Higgins Trust, other charities, teachers and young people, the government nally agreed that all young people should receive Relationships and Sex Education - an essential public health intervention. We are also expecting the large-scale trial of the highly-eective new HIV prevention drug PrEP (pre-exposure prophy- laxis) to start imminently. Finally. The pieces of the HIV and sexual health prevention puzzle are coming together - and local authorities have been a key partner in making this happen. Yet it's not over. We must not lose these gains we have all fought so hard to achieve. HIV rates in other at-risk populations and in areas outside London haven't seen signicant reductions in new HIV diagnoses, and ratesof sexually transmitted infections including gonorrhoea and syphilis continue to soar. A recent Kings Fund report showed that the number of new attendances in genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics has increased by nearly a third between 2011 and 2015. Yet the same Kings Fund report indicated that one in 4 local authorities reduced GUM spending by more than20% between 2013/14 and 2015/16, with budgets for 2016/17 showing that cuts are set to deepen as spending on GUM will reduce by 7%. The Kings Fund also found cuts to sexual health pre- vention, promotion and outreach services aimed at high risk groups - reductions in funding of 14.6% between 2013/14 and 2015/16. A recent National AIDSTrust report highlighted a similar trend - HIV supportservices had seen a 28% decrease in expenditure between 15/16 and 16/17.The future of HIV and sexual health services is far from certain, says Debbie Laycock, Head of Policy and Parliamentary Affairs at Terrence Higgins Trust Debbie Laycock, Head of Policy and Parliamentary AffairsHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 77Joint responsibility Local authorities, alongside the NHS, charities and community groups, have a key role to play in continu- ing to address HIV and poor sexual health. There is ajoint responsibility - as HIV charities and community members we need to clearly make the case as to whyit is vital that investment is needed in HIV and sexualhealth services and the positive patient outcomes that are delivered as a result. Some local authorities, in the face of continued funding cuts from central govern- ment, are investing, innovating and collaborating to provide sustainable, reliable sexual health services. This investment can't stop now. That's why we welcome the extension of the public health ring fence. In April 2019 when this expires, we - the local communities and the organisations support- ing people aected by HIV and poor sexual health, need to ensure that it is clear how we can support and,where needed, hold to account local authorities for the degree to which they are meeting the sexual health needs of their local population. It is good news that the ring-fenced public health budget is protected for another year. But the question remains- what happens next? The future of HIV and sexual health services is far from certain, and it is clear thatsexual health needs will continue long after the 'sell by date' of the public health ring fence has expired. Debbie Laycock Head of Policy and Parliamentary Affairs Terrence Higgins Trust www.tht.org.ukwww.twitter.com/THTorguk The importance of hand hygiene in the healthcare environment is a well-known fact. Each square cm of skin contains approximately 1500 bacteria. Proper hand hygiene disrupts the transfer of germs and microorganisms to and from patients, healthcare workers, and environmen- tal surfaces. Hands are the vector for the transmission of contamination and that works both ways. Hand hygiene reduces pathogen transmission In the light of the proliferation of antibi- otic multi-drug resistance, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global campaign in 2009 on hand hygiene and has subsequently shown that improving and implementing hand hygiene practices can reduce pathogen transmission in healthcare by 50%. In England the MRSA rate declined by 56% over a 4 year period as a result of a \u00a3120 million investment in cleaning and other improvement measures. Yet, the WHO reports the average rate of hand-hygiene compliance in healthcare personnel is still only 38.7%. Since 2011, financial restrictions and cuts to cleaning services are simultaneously associated with a 20% increase in infec- tion rates, particularly MSSA and E. coli. Research also shows that MRSA infec- tion rates are 50% higher in hospitals that outsource cleaning contracts, com- pared to those that keeping cleaning services in-house. However, imple- menting change requires engagement and an objective measurement system.\"Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement. If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it. If you can't control it, you can't improve it.\" (H James Harrington) The introduction of simple modern technology have driven significant changes at the Mater Private hospital in Ireland. This stems from behavioural research that shows \"individual experi- ence is of greater importance than formal education in explaining hand hygiene behaviour\". Ann Higgins has shown that compliance rates increase significantly by capturing the imagina- tion and engagement of staff. A base- line audit showed that compliance to hand hygiene procedures was approx-imately 20%. The introduction of a video training tool and a rapid ATP measurement system not only increase the compliance level but also provided quantifiable level of cleanliness. Over a 2 year period, the pass rate for a high level of cleanliness increased from 50% to 100% and the fail rate decreased from 50% to 0%, but also compliance to an even higher cleanliness levelincreased from 20% to 87%. Cleaning of hands or surfaces is a matter of training, the use of the correct material and processes and resources and available time. Since cleaning is time and labour intensive (90% of cost), shortcuts can be taken and cleaning is often a soft target for cost savings. However, cleaning is a fundamental preventative measure inInfection control relies on good hand hygiene practices. Martin Easter, General Manager, Hygiena International Ltd explains why it is so importantHand hygiene and beyond: Its influence on infection control 78PROFILE the fight against infection and super- bugs. Subjective visual assessment methods have been used historically to measure cleanliness but they are not fit for purpose and only detect gross lapses of practice. Visual assessment gives a \"misleading over-estimate of cleaning that undermines infection control strategies\" (Jones 2009). Using an objective quantitative method of cleaning verification such as the ATP system enables standards to be set and measured and engages with staff to effect behaviour change. This simple rapid and cost effective method has many uses in healthcare and can be used anywhere that hygiene matters, to save time, money and lives. Failure costs are high Cleaning cost the NHS \u00a3725m per annum but research shows that only 40% of hospital cleaning policies are delivered in practice, resulting in potential wastage of more than \u00a3400m. The NHS Productivity review 2016 showed that a small improve- ment in cleaning practices alone would save \u00a393m. The cost of failure is high. A singleinfection is estimated to cost \u00a35000 -\u00a310,000. The National Patient Safety Association states that there are more than 200,000 slip injuries per annum that result in 26 deaths. It estimatesthat the average trust spends \u00a392,000 per annum on slip related injuries. \"Hand Hygiene is arguably our most important life skill. So Teach it well and Teach it often.\" Michael J Blackburn, CEO The ATP test is simple and easy to use giving a numerical result in 15 sec- onds. ATP bioluminescence is a simple rapid method for measuring organic soil. It requires a small hand held instrument and an all-in-one sample collection and testing device, and gen- erates giving a numerical result in 15 seconds. The use of ATP biolumines- cence for cleaning verification is well established and has also been the highest recommendation by the RapidReview Panel of the Department of Health and Public Health England in support of the fight against HCAI. The test is also recognised by the CDC in USA and is written into a standard for cleaning in Denmark and Sweden. Monitoring compliance Many users and applications testify to the benefit and value of an instant objective test for cleaning verification from infection control training and compliance of hand hygiene, house- keeping and environmental monitor- ing to sterile service and catering. \"ATP gives you a clean hospital,\" said ValHulme (Team leader Domestic Ser- vices). \"When you're doing a deep clean the staff know they are going to be tested but they do everything to avery high standard now. ATP has helped us to achieve that. \"When you have a number -like the ATP machine gives you - it's more objective than subjective. You can't argue with it. ATPmakes the staff competitive. They allwant to score five or below. And ideally zero.\" Regular objective monitoring of clean- ing increases compliance of cleaningpolicies from 40% to 82%. This decreases contamination levels, reduces infection rates, maximises the use and value of existing resources thus saving time, money and lives. Martin Easter General Manager/Chief Scientific Officer Hygiena the antimalarial drug chloroquine to drug resistance was among the most significant detriments to the antimalarial effort over the last half century. This is in part because chloroquine's target is not a protein - but rather heme, the by-product of haemoglobin digestion by the parasite. This made the evolu- tion of resistance very slow - even in what must be regarded the worst and chaotic of circumstances. Even today's artemisinin combination therapies, that are the current standards of care, require a heme-targeting partner drug for the artemisinin. Many current malaria drug discovery projects are aimed at finding targets other than heme, but these often will usually lead to the evolution of drug resistancemuch quicker, rather than leading to a new heme-targeted drug. The goal of our work has been to provide a drug superior to whatchloroquine ever was, specifically by appending to the chloroquine struc- ture another portion that inhibits Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), the primary transporter whose mutation is responsible for the resistance to chloroquine and drugs like it. Exports of the drug from the parasite's diges- tive vacuole (DV) means that the drug can't build up to a sufficient concen- tration at the site of action to kill the parasite. The resulting hybrid drugs, including our lead molecule, were designed to be at least as potent and safe as chloroquine and could be less susceptible to the evolution of resis- tance. This is especially because it has been 'tuned' to have a shorter resi- dence time in the blood at sub-thera- peutic dose levels, and because they have never been available as a monotherapy in the regions of the world where malaria is found. Yet these new drugs would be fast-acting,potent, and very reticent to develop drug resistance. We call these new drugs, reversed chloroquine drugs (RCQ drugs). \"Many current malaria drug discovery projects are aimed at finding targets other than heme, but these often will usually lead to the evolution of drug resistance much quicker, rather than leading to a new heme-targeted drug.\" We tried the approach with a proto- type RCQ drug a few years ago and then refined the structures to make a more practical drug in terms of whatmight make an orally dose-able medicine. We studied the mechanism of action of the RCQ drugs, to make sure that they were still working like chloroquine did, and to show that they were not very susceptible to resistance, both against strains of malaria from patients and evolved in the laboratory. This all gave rise to ourDavid H Peyton at Portland State University outlines how research has discovered that heme is key to malaria drug developmentThe evolution of malaria drug development 80PROFILE Design of RCQ drugs: The Reversal Agent portion turns off the export of the drug via PfCRTlead molecule but the time and effort between deciding on a molecule and getting approved for a Phase 1 safety study (first-in-humans) are large,especially for an academic (university) laboratory. \"The goal of our work has been to provide a drug superior to what chloroquine ever was, specifically by appending to the chloroquine structure another portion that inhibits Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), the primary transporter whose mutation is responsible for the resistance to chloroquine and drugs like it.\" Laboratory tests conducted for malaria drug development There are also extensive studies required to demonstrate the likeli- hood of safety (non-poisoning) and a lack of genotoxicity (e.g., not carcino- genic) that are needed before a Phase 1 study is approved by a governing body, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. Thesestudies must be done under good lab- oratory practice conditions, which are generally available only from Contract Research Organizations (CROs), and not in-house at the university. In fact, a university researcher generally doesn't even know what tests to do during this process, so consultants need to be hired. For these reasons, and others, I co-founded a start-up company, DesignMedix, Inc., which has the mission of discovering and developing drugs against infectious diseases, especially those which are evolving drug resistance. This began with malaria but now includes bacte-rial diseases. We have therefore spent the last few years learning the process of bringing a candidate molecule from \"Lead\" to Phase 1 candidate. Last week we announced a contract with the National Institutes of Health/NIAID to carry out the Phase 1 first-in-human study. Of course, even a successful conclusion of this study will not be theend of this process: There will be atleast one Phase 2 study that will be needed to be successfully completed, and then it will need to be partnered with another drug (and so, likely, another company) before the Phase 3 study (or studies). The entire process, from the start of the Phase 1 study, will likely be at least another 5 or 6 years before bringing a drug to market. That is if all goes well. David H Peyton, PhD Professor of Chemistry Portland CARE 82The transformation of local authority leisure facilities Local authority leisure facilities are becoming more impressive, in many cases starting to rival those in the private sector. Around 75% of coun- cils have outsourced leisure provision to third party operators - compared with less than 50% 20 years ago - and with it we've seen a rise in standards as they become self-sustaining prot making entities. Ageing leisure stock is being redeveloped or replaced and it's bringing opportunities for additional revenue streams, a wider variety of facilities as well as more forward thinking or less traditional activities. It's anexciting time for leisure operators and their local authority partners. The changing landscape One of the rst things you notice upon entering a renovated or newly built leisure centre is the dierence in quality compared with a decade ago. From the build- ings themselves to how they are tted and kitted out. When it comes to changing facilities, showers, lockers and gym equipment, there's very little to separate the private and public sector today. \"Many of our centres surpass the private sector in terms of quality of facilities and breadth of oering,\" says Duncan Jeord, Regional Director for Everyone Active who operate 150 leisure centres across the UK. \"It's typical to nd a pool, 25m or longer, indoor climb- ing, gyms with over 100 stations and multifunctional studios. We're also starting to introduce more high end spa facilities and hot yoga studios into our facilities. \"Service is an area which allows us to create a point of dierence from both budget gyms and other local authority leisure operators,\" continues Jeord. \"We have higher colleague ratios and invest more in sta training than our competitors, this represents signicant changefrom where the local authority sector was 10 or even 5years ago.\" Facility mix is changing in line with activity trends and we're seeing more non-traditional facilities such as indoor climbing, trampolining and even BMX tracks being incorporated into both new builds and renovations. \"More people want to exercise outside which is both a challenge and an opportunity for the leisure sector,\" says Jeord. \"We are viewing our new build and rede- veloped leisure centres as community hubs fromwhich you can choose a multitude of workout options, whether that is a gym workout, an outdoor running club or an indoor or outdoor triathlon session, there issomething for everyone. This protects revenue while increasing participation, it's win, win.\" Investment = prot Ultimately, local authorities have realised that there is money to be made from investing in leisure. Histori- cally, local authorities paid leisure operators to run their facilities, now forward thinking councils are turning that on its head, investing in facilities and charging themanagement fee to the operator. Over the past decade local authority leisure facilities have revolutionised how they operate. Here, Cheryl Hersey, of Action PR Ltd explains HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 83\"Ten years ago we were paid a management fee to run every one of our centres, because they lost money,\" says Jeord. \"In 2008 we retained our contract with Spelthorne Borough Council, who after committing to asignicant investment in the centre, became one of the rst authorities to charge a management fee. Now we pay the local authority in more than 30% of contracts.Investment by a local authority is a smart move. It gen- erates facilities with the potential to make signicant prots so they can command a higher management fee from the operator.\" The next 10 years Jeord, who has been in the sector for more than a decade, is seeing more new builds year on year. \"Previously, we might have been involved with one new build every couple of years, this year we're involvedwith 4,\" he explains. \"I predict we will see growth in thenumber of new leisure centres over the next 10 years as local authorities realise the revenue potential. Local authorities are asset rich, and with the potential to relocate leisure facilities and build new centres they are in a unique position to free up capital. \"We'll see more land sales generating aordable housing, which in turn will fund the building of more leisure facilities,\" says Jeord. \"These facilities will likely be built in areas with a lower land value, but will be larger and oer a greater selection of facilities. \"We'll see leisure centres taking a more holistic approach to tness and wellness, with centres incor- porating relaxation facilities, such as spas, and heathy eating venues, as well as a broad range of activity opportunities. Health and leisure will become more joined up, already we are seeing health services beingcommissioned as part of the main operational tender, and this makes total sense as operators have the resource and skills to deliver health services.\" Barnet council are in the process of running a joint procurement for health and leisure services. Ten years from now, Jeord predicts that 95% of local authorities will have contracted out their leisure facilities because they recognise it generates them more revenue. CASE STUDY Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre Everyone Active's Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre in St Albans, is an example of the leisure centre of the future. The centre was built in 2012 completely replacing the old facility which had been there for more than 30 years and was no longer t for purpose. Westminster Lodge oers a holistic approach to tness and wellbeing through a wide variety of facilities, not traditionally associated with the typical leisure centre. These include a luxury spa, climbing wall, cr\u00e8che and children's soft play area, as well as the more typical tness suite, two swimming pools, four court sports hall, two group exercise studios and group cycle studio. Everyone Active recognise the growing trend for outdoor exercise and have developed a robust programme of outdoor training to complement the indoor facilities. This includes a partnership with Nordic Walking, to oer a full body walking workout using poles, and numerous outdoor races and events held in Verulamium Park. Committed to staying at the forefront of the local authority leisure market, Everyone Active have recently installed a hot yoga studio, with a range of classes that vary in temperature and style. Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre has also recently undergone a \u00a3500,000 gym refurbishment, with the introduction of market leading equipment such as Skillmills and Watt Bikes.

People's health competence and how communities develop it plays an important role in this context. In daily life, how can I obtain informa- tion about what promotes my health, prevents diseases and improves my quality of life as a whole? Am I in a position to form my own opinion and to make my own decisions? The development of health competence is the responsibility of each individual. However, it depends even more on the quality and availability of informa- tion about health, on the way it is conveyed and the participation of people in the competence-shaping processes, in their community. \"The common aim is the creation of a resilient Palatinate Region until 2025, in which people help each other tostay healthy and to cope better withcrises. Apart from the approach in the local community the initiative also promotes among others, the development of resilience in small and medium-sized companies, as well as in a school setting.\" Indeed, local communities in the rural area have to deal, for example, with a shortage of medical specialists andhard-to-reach educational and health offers. When developing health com- petence they have, however, important advantages over cities because of their tight structures: The direct contact to influencers as the mayor, the general physician or school, to neighbours or clubs, strengthens the solidarity among people and, thus, the readiness for common processes of change. Accompanied by local moral concepts, social-environment-related identity is fundamental for resilient communities. These tight structures, often grownover decades, can be used to develop future-oriented concepts of how people within their community can support each other. In one of their fields of work the initia- tive, 'The Palatinate makes itself/you strong - Ways to Resilience', aims to strengthen the local resilience in the more rural Donnersberg district, in Rhineland-Palatinate.

With just under a year until the deadline, local authorities are considering how best to implement the transition. To renew the focus on the initiative, the government has announced that an additional \u00a340m will be made available to support councils as they move towards the EHC plans. A tailored plan The philosophy behind the EHC plan is that it will span the life of a child from birth right through to the age of 25, and will contain all the records relating to the education, health and social care needs of the child, stored in one place.As a single record, the EHC plan is designed to growwith the child until they reach young adulthood, preparing them for independence and equipping them, if appropriate, for the workplace. As the child's needs change, the plan should ensure that the support they receive stays in line with these needs. Sharing information The dierent teams involved need to be able to work together and share key information eciently and securely about the child or young person with SEND. Technology will be key to supporting this. Some local authorities are looking to provide a secure, central place for all the dierent teams in contact with a childto record and store relevant data. This might include details of previous assessments, information from the child's school or college or notes from meetings with the child, their parents or carers.Mark Raeburn, Managing Director at Capita One, looks at the steps local authorities are taking as they enter the next phase of SEND reformsHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 87This central store of information can hold key notes and documentation from other professionals too, such as social workers, GPs or education psychologists. This will help to ensure that an EHC plan includes all relevant details about the child so that informed decisions can be made about what support they might require. Family view A key feature of the EHC plan is that the views of the child and their family need to be captured and built into decisions about the type and level of support that the child should receive. Storing everything in one place that can be made accessible to parents and carers is an ecient and eective way to enable them to contribute to the evolution of their child's plan. One way that councils are addressing this is to introduce a secure, online portal which gives parents the oppor- tunity to check on the progress of their child's case,quickly and easily, at a time that's convenient to them. Parents can also upload information that is relevant to their child's case, and provide evidence to back up an application or to identify a specic need. This approach should reduce the number of telephone and email enquiries from families, as information on the case is held centrally and can be accessed by the various people authorised to see it. With online access, local authorities can also ask the child or young person to upload their own views into a plan, which is another important element to the EHC plan. Managing trends A major advantage of storing data centrally is that local authorities can use this information in the planning and delivery of services. With greater insight into the origins of referrals, it is possible to identify whetherthese are coming from the families themselves, local health services or schools. Knowing this enables councils to match up service need with service delivery moreeectively, and ensure the most appropriate support is put in place where it is needed to help familiesthrough the process. There have been changes to some of the statutory deadlines local authorities need to meet around SEND provision - the timeframes for responding to information requests, for instance. But, with the right tools, on-screen notications can be set up for practitioners to alert them automatically when deadlines are approaching, and outline what needs to be completed, and when. There may be both challenges and opportunities in moving children across to EHC plans, but for local authorities, the focus, as always, will be on ensuring that the plans help to ensure timely and eective support is put in place for children with SEND and theirfamilies. Mark Raeburn Managing Director Capita Onewww.capita-one.co.uk/ www.twitter.com/CapitaOneHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 88Healthcare analytics: Best practice from all over the world In any country, the state of public healthcare will always nd itself under intense scrutiny. In recent times, however, it feels like it is under the spotlight even more than usual. Just take a look at the NHS in recent months, whether it's waiting times, ambulance responsiveness or bed shortages - the UK healthcaresystem is having to cope with these challenges with the added pressure of reduced budgets, an ageing popu- lation and increased demand. While the challenges are great we should be hopeful as there are innovations that are being deployed today that are easing these issues. Technology is playing a large part in this, with data analytics and visualisation helping healthcare organisations deal with some of its greatest challenges; waiting times, clinical variation and moving to a population healthcare approach. We take a look at some of the best examples from the UK, Europe and beyond. Sahlgrenska, Sweden Sahlgrenska in Sweden is one of the largest hospitals in Northern Europe, and like many organisations has struggled with clinical variation. However, the use of data analytics has enabled them to make great progressaddressing this issue by working on a value based care program which specically uncovered variation in orthopaedic care. This program has reduced adverse events by 18%, reduced reoperation by 17%, increased the number of surgeries by a staggering 44% and, as aresult, reduced waiting time by more than 40 days forhip and knee replacements. This was only possible byengaging clinicians with data, uncovering variations and dispelling widely held myths. Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh, UK Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh (WWL) NHS Foundation Trust, like all NHS trusts, is under huge pressure todecrease A&E waiting times. In a response to this chal- lenge the trust has created an application that provides live A&E intelligence to all sta - doctors, nurses, clini- cians and the board, giving a greater understanding of where patients are in their journey through the hospi- tal - improving discharge levels, reducing delays and minimising re-admissions. By putting analytics into the hands of employees at the point of decision and empowering data-driven decisions to be made at alllevels, its A&E department has been able to decrease patient waiting times by 30 minutes. Veiligheidsregio Noord-Holland, Netherlands Veiligheidsregio Noord-Holland is an aggregated organisation in the Netherlands comprising of the regional re department, the GHOR (medical assis- tance), Ambulancezorg (ambulance care) and theGemeenschappelijke Meldkamer (communal emer- gency control centre). One key insight showed that the further a citizen lived from a city, the worse the lifeexpectancy forecast would be following a heart attack or stroke. By creating a dashboard and collaborating on data across all 19 communities in the region, the organisation was able to reduce the total time from therst emergency call through to the life-saving opera- tion by up to 20 minutes. Not only does this help save lives but means that the quality of life following theoperation is improved as treatment commenced at an earlier stage. New South Wales, Australia New South Wales (NSW) Health covers all aspects of public health in New South Wales, Australia, and has been making strides to improve healthcare eciencies across the region. Using visual analytics, NSW Health are delivering self-service analytics through the ABM Portal to the local health districts. By using and linking up nancial, clinical and patient data they are able toDavid Bolton, Director, Public Sector & Healthcare, Qlik Global Industry Solutions highlights how healthcare analytics vary between countriesHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 89deliver better health services to all, both for short-term treatment, and long-term care. The Need for a Cultural Shift It's clear then that fantastic work is being done in pock- ets. However, what is needed now is greater awareness for these success cases, enabling knowledge sharing and establishing best practice at a national and inter- national level. One of the main challenges is creating a culture of data literacy - the ability to not only read but understand, analyse and work with data - across the healthcare system. The ones that really deliver resultsare those that have clinicians as key stakeholders in the process and where the data is accessible and relatableto hospital sta from ward to board. That means approaching healthcare analytics from a 360-degree view perspective. Healthcare analytics: A prescription for change With this in mind we've outlined the key criteria to help stakeholders create an enterprise-wide, sustainable and progressive environment for analytics: A framework to ensure stakeholders properly embed analytics strategy within the wider organisational environment to generate value; A value generation checklist outlining the critical factors in building pathways to tangible results;Examples of healthcare organisations which have successfully generated value from analytics. This checklist is based primarily on lessons from the healthcare transformation, improvement and analytics frontlines as we've seen from these examples. How- ever, a one sized approach does not t all, and the best analytics strategies are those that are aligned to anorganisation's specic characteristics, potential and limitations. The challenges facing healthcare are not going away; in fact they are likely to intensify. But what we have seen is the potential technology can have in not only improving eciency in the wake of limitations, but also most importantly improving patient care. More should be done to celebrate the great improvements being made across the world, so others can learn from these successes.

But space also enables a wide range of technologies which are necessary for many elds of our lives here on Earth. These include ghting climate change; smartening our transport; ensuring safety of critical infrastructure for energy, telecommunications or transport; enabling modern farming; providing disaster response; support- ing border and maritime surveillance; monitoring of the ground, sea levels or the atmosphere. Europe's space industry is doing well, and it has many reasons to be proud; it already captures a third of theglobal market, employing some 230,000 professionals and with an annual value of approximately \u20ac50 billion. Yet, our ambition does not end here, given the tremen- dous potential of Europe's space industry in creating more jobs, enabling more disruptive technologies andallowing more satellite-based services. To be perfectly honest, Europe's space industry is also facing new risks and growing competition from new players. That is why before the end of last year, the Commission presented the rst Space Strategy for Europe with a clear shared vision for the years to come. It is the fruit of long discussions with numerous stakeholders and with our partner organisations, like ESA and with Member States' national space agencies. A strategy for European space The EU Space Strategy is our way to continue Europe's historic quest 'far and beyond'; far above the skies and beyond Europe's current space capacities. It will ensureEurope's space industry can serve us humans, boostour economy, and protect our environment. Take geo-localisation for example. Without us realisingit, geo-localisation technologies make some of the most mundane (yet critical) activities possible; from drawing out cash out of an ATM, zapping between (satellite) TV channels, or using GPS navigation when driving. It is also a necessary component of more advanced technologies that are omnipresent in our lives (like interactive maps, shared car services, or location-based technologies). Thanks to our joint EU eorts, the new generation of geo-localisation just started, as we just launched the initial services of Galileo, the EU Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) that provides radio signals for position, navigation and timing purposes. Galileo, which just became operational in December, is very much like the American GPS but oers a more pre- cise free public service. Once completed in 2020, it will be 10 times more precise than the best geo-localisation signals currently available. oaro efovi, Vice Sresident of the European Commission in charge of the Energy Union, outlines the EU Space Strategy and explains how the sector makes lives better, safer and healthier Image: \u00a9 European Union, 2015 / Source: EC - Audiovisual Service / Photo: Claus Bj\u00f8rn Larsen Maro efovi, Vice President in charge of Energy UnionSPACE FOCUS 93It will shift us from 10 meters to 1 meter precision level! Galileo will also provide services to public authorities andcommercial companies that will be even more precise. Just to mention one recent example - Galileo, Europe's own satellite navigation system (GNSS), will be able to locate the caller of emergency number 112 with much greater accuracy. We have looked into how Galileo canimprove caller location using the Advanced Mobile Solu- tions, through an EU-nanced project HELP 112. It wastested in the UK, Lithuania, Italy and parts of Austria. \"The EU Space Strategy is our way to continue Europe's historic quest 'far and beyond'; far above the skies and beyond Europe's current space capacities. It will ensure Europe's space industry can serve us humans, boost our economy, and protect our environment.\" We also have Copernicus which is a leading provider of Earth observation data across the globe. Copernicus is already helping to save lives at sea, improve our response to natural disasters such as earthquakes, forest res or floods, and is allowing farmers to bettermanage their crops - by collecting data from earth observation satellites, as well as ground and sea-bound stations. 2016 was a very exciting year for Europe's space indus- try, but we're not quite done. We have to continue implementing the strategy. For example, in order to bring Galileo to its full capacity, more satellite launches will be needed. We will therefore see 4 additional satellites launched on a single Ariane5 missile within a few months. In the coming year we will also see 3 launches of Copernicus satellites - the world's largest single earth observation programme. A commitment to advancement The European Commission is committed to ensuring the market uptake of both Copernicus and Galileo,through various means. We will launch 2 networks to help raise awareness about the programmes at regional and local levels. We will co-organise 2 SpaceWeeks this year with the 2017 EU Presidencies (in June in Malta and in November in Estonia). We also continueorganising competitions for innovative start-ups that use data from Copernicus and Galileo in new, innova-tive ways. It will furthermore build on this support by launching the Copernicus accelerator and incubation programme, to help start-ups develop ideas into realapplications and products. All in all, the Commission has dedicated some \u20ac1.4 billion from the Horizon2020 budget (of 2014-2020), yet we see a very high return on this investment. The benet for the economy from \u20ac1 invested in space is \u20ac7 back. As you can see, space is not only the domain of the unknown and it's not only thousands of kilometres away from our planet. It is about how we make human lives here better, safer, healthier, more convenient, ecient and secure. For all those reasons, the Commission will continue supporting Europe's space technologies and industries, for the benet of all our citizens. Maro efoviVice President in charge of the Energy Union European Commissionhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/sefcovic_en www.twitter.com/MarosSefcovic Image: \u00a9 OHBNearly a century ago Arthur Eddington had the foresight to question \"Our telescopes may probe farther and farther into the depths of space; but how can we ever obtain certain knowledge of that which is hidden beneath substantial barriers? What appliance can pierce through the outer layers of a star and test the conditions within?'' The answer is asteroseismology, the study of the internal structure of stars through their intrinsic global oscilla- tions. As with musical instruments, these oscillations resonate in a cavity specific to the \"instrument\", i.e. a star in this case. In this way, the oscillations reveal information about the proper- ties of this cavity and thus the star. It has been long known that stars can show periodic brightness variations that originate from an intrinsic mecha-nism in a star. In such a mechanism energy flowing from the core to the surface could be trapped in an opaque layer before reaching the surface. This causes the star to expand. Upon expanding the opaque layer becomes more transparent to the energy flow removing the blockade and making thestar contract again (Eddington 1926, Aerts et al. 2010). These breathing oscillations of a star change its radius by a few percent in a coherent manner while at the same time changing itssurface temperature and brightness. An early remarkable result from starswith such breathing oscillations (Cepheids) is a relation between the period of the oscillations and the lumi- nosity (absolute brightness) of the stars, the so-called period-luminosity relation (Leavitt and Pickering, 1912). This relation plays an important role in measuring distances of galaxies and star clusters and ultimately the expansion of the universe. In the 1960's non-coherent oscilla- tions with low amplitudes (much less than a percent) were first discovered in the Sun. These oscillations are stochastically (i.e. in a random way) excited by the turbulent convection in the outer layers of the Sun. Effectivelysome of the convective energy is transferred into the energy of global oscillations. This type of oscillations is referred to as solar-like oscillations. The oscillations detected in the Sun have provided unprecedented detail of the stellar interior. We know now that the Sun rotates as a solid body in its radiative region up to about 0.7 of its total radius. Above this region there is latitudinal differential rotation in the convective layer, i.e. the outer layers of the Sun rotate faster at the equatorthan at the poles. At the boundary between solid body rotation and dif- ferential rotation, there exists a shear layer, the so-called tachocline. This tachocline could play an importantrole as a dynamo to form large mag-netic fields. Additionally, seismology of the Sun was pivotal in the discoverythat neutrinos are not massless and that low energy neutrinos change flavour (Nobel Prize for physics 2015). Other stars with an outer convection zone also excite solar-like oscillations. Among these are stars similar to the Sun, with similar mass and hydrogenfusing to helium in the core, as well as more evolved stars (the future of our Sun). These evolved stars have exhausted their core from hydrogen and either fuse hydrogen in a shell around an inert helium core, or around a core in which helium fusion takes place. These stars are red (cold at the surface) and large (up to 100 times the Sun) and are referred to as red-giant stars (Hekker and Chris- tensen-Dalsgaard 2017). Over the pastdecade, dedicated space telescopes have made it feasible to observe solar- like oscillations in red giants, as well as solar-like stars; these observations resulted in an asteroseismic revolution. It was discovered that red-giant starsare like musical instruments with 2 cavities, having one cavity located in the deep interior of the star and one in the outer layers. The oscillations that resonate in both cavities are so- called mixed oscillation modes and provide a direct means to pierce into the cores of red-giant stars and reveal its properties; for instance, whether the helium in the core is inert, or fusing (e.g. Bedding et al. 2011). The mixed modes also allow for studies of the rotation of the stellar cores andThe power of asteroseismology - what can we learn from the stars? Saskia Hekker from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research reveals here Asteroseismology: It's written in the stars 94PROFILEenvelopes. In red giants, the cores are rotating about 10 times faster than the envelopes (e.g. Beck et al. 2012). Through their sensitivity to the internal structure of the stars, the oscillations combined with surface properties (temperature and chemical composi- tion) can also reveal the stellar mass, radius and age with unprecedented accuracy. Although the ages are dependent on comparisons with stellar models, asteroseismic ages are superior to other age determinations in terms of precision and accuracy. The power of asteroseismology The power of asteroseismology reaches farther than the structure and properties of stars. It also impacts sig- nificantly on our knowledge of extra- solar planets, the Milky Way and as mentioned before the expansion of the universe. The determination of the planetary properties (mass, radius and age) critically relies on the knowl- edge of the same properties of the host star. Indeed, it was thanks to asteroseismology that it was possible to detect earth-mass planets in thehabitable zone (e.g. Borucki et al. 2012). Furthermore, stars are a main observable ingredient of the Milky Way and galaxies in general. To under- stand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (galactic archaeology) knowledge of stellar properties, and particularly stellar ages are indispens- able. With asteroseismology, it now becomes possible to derive stellar masses and ages to an accuracy level that they can indeed be used for galactic archaeology. To utilise the full extent of the power of asteroseismology it is essential to fully understand all the oscillation features that are present in the data and understand their physical origin.This work is still in its infancy and will require many in-depth asteroseismic studies as the field matures.

The ESA has a budget of around \u20ac5.75 billion for 2017, which is invested into space programmes to deliver benets to the citizens of Europe and the world. This is a common aim that the ESA shares with the European Union (EU) and they are working together more and more to achieve this. So much so that some 20% of the funds managed by the ESA, now originate from the EU budget. In more recent years, the 2 institutions have come together and reinforced by the increasing role that space plays in supporting Europe's social, political and economic policies. A shared vision In December 2016, the European Space Agency and the European Commission signed a joint statement on the shared vision and goals for Europe in Space, allow- ing both organisations to work even more closely together to strengthen Europe with the common objective of benetting its citizens as much as possible. The vision is to foster a future European space sector that maintains Europe's world-class space industry while ensuring that the scientic discoveries of future space programs are fully integrated into European societies and economies. Further developments in European space activities were also set as a priority on December 2nd by the ESA ministerial Council in Lucerne. A resolution titled \"Towards Space 4.0 for a united Space in Europe\" was adopted and in this resolution, the member states of the ESA stated that their priority is to make ESA capa- ble of channelling regional, national and Europeandemands for space programmes. \"Using its 50 years of experience in designing and implementing European space programmes across all space domains, ESA isready to support European states in realising their shared visions.\" 2016 marks the European Commission's eort to boost this competitive and innovative sector, making the most of space for Europe's society and economy in the form of the Space Strategy for Europe. \"eu space programmes already provide countless services, which benefit millions of people throughout europe. The european space industry employs over 230 000 professionals and generates a value estimated at euR 46-54 billion (representing around 21% of the value of the global space sector).\" Vice-President of the European Commission Maro efovi said : \"The European Union is a key player in space policy. We want to build on that and use this leadership role strategically to create jobs and growth and deliver on our common policy priorities: security, climate change, transport, data economy, and manage-ment of natural disasters. This requires cooperation with our partners and stakeholders in Europe and internationally.\" Space Strategy for Europe The Space Strategy for Europe clearly states, \"The potential of space for Europe and the world is enor- mous. Europe faces huge global challenges, whichrequire global responses. Europe must contribute to this collective responsibility. No single Member Statecan do this alone. The EU, alongside its Member States and ESA, must act as a global stakeholder to promote and preserve the use of space for future generations.\" open access Government's M f Warrender highlights how the european space agency and the eu are working together to drive space sciencespace focus99The new Space strategy for Europe is focussing on 4 strategic goals: Maximising the benets of space for society and the EU economy; Fostering a globally competitive and innovative European Space Sector; Reinforcing Europe's autonomy in accessing and using space in a secure and safe environment; Strengthening Europe's role as a global actor and promoting international cooperation. EU space programmes already provide countless services, which benet millions of people throughout Europe. The European space industry employs over 230 000 professionals and generates a value estimated at EUR 46-54 billion (representing around 21% of the value of the global space sector). Europe is manufac- turing a third of the world's satellites. It has achievedmany successes in space with breakthrough technolo-gies and exploration missions. However, the overall international space context is changing fast: competition is increasing, and there are constantly new challenges being brought about alongside new ambitions in space. In order to maintain this global role in Space,Europe must continue to stay ahead of the fast movingindustry.

How this happens in prac-tice is less obvious than in the case of applied research, where the goal of the project is more practical and its results easier to identify. To make anexample, the utility of a research pro- ject on HIV vaccines is immediatelyobvious both to specialists and the general public, while that of a project to map the large-scale distribution of galaxies in our Universe or to look forthe Higgs Boson is more subtle and indirect, yet possibly equally relevant. Basic research has in general more sophisticated and usually long-term consequences, which require differ- ent levels of communication and thusa well thought-out communication plan, to be properly appreciated. Darklight \"Darklight\" is one such endeavour. A 5-year project led by Professor Luigi Guzzo at the University of Milan and the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy, it is supported by an advanced grant of \u20ac1.7m by the European Research Council (ERC). Its aims are to build maps of galaxies to describe the large-scale structure of the Universe and to develop the mathematical tools to interpret them. The final goal is to provide a key contribution to the quest for understanding the nature of the mysterious \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\" that seem to permeatethe Universe, i.e. what represent thecurrent key open questions in cosmol- ogy. The plain deliverables are thusnot a new vaccine or a new engine or an electronic device, but simply the increase of human knowledge. As such, the communication plan for such a project had to follow different routes, which can be divided into essentially 3 levels. The first communication level has been internal, i.e. focused on commu- nication within the research group created with this grant. At its peak, the group involved about a dozen people, among staff, postdocs and students. The opportunity of having such a concentration of talent and skills, all focused on the same goals defined by Darklight, was unique. We had toEuropean-supported project \"Darklight\" shows how basic research can have an impact at several levels, including the general public, if properly communicatedOptimising the communication plan of a basic research project 100PROFILE The large-scale distribution of galaxies in one of the two fields explored by the VIPERS survey. Each point is a galaxy, with its colour reflecting the age of its stellar population (blue = young; red = old) and its size proportional to the galaxy luminosity. The bottom scale gives the distance from us in millions of parsecs; one parsec corresponds to 3.28 light years, thus the centre of this sample, at 2000 Mpc, corresponds to about 6 billion light years from us. Developing the tools to optimally analyse data like these is the subject of the ERC-funded Darklight project. Making people aware of these advancements is also one of the goals of the project (courtesy Ben Granett and the VIPERS collaboration)Redshift 0.50.550.60.650.70.750.80.850.90.951.01.05 02h30m02h15m02h00m -1Mpc]180017001600150014001300properly maximise its effectiveness. Periodic group meet- ings, weekly journal club discussions, personal discussions and tutoring were the tools through which these exchanges were fostered. In addition, 2 summer group retreats of a few days were organised during the first 3 years of the project, and a closing meeting will be held near its end in September 2017. The second communication level addressed the interaction of the group members with fellow scientists, i.e. experts in the specific field of the project, i.e. cosmology. First, an \"expert visitor\" program was conceived as part of the project since its very begin- ning, as to feed the young students and fellows through lectures by and discussions with recognised leaders in their field. Second, 2 summer work- shops with ~50 participants, obviouslyincluding the full Darklight group, were held on the Italian Alps. These were further occasions for the project members to discuss with the founders and leaders of their research area, learn new concepts, mature new ideas and create ties and connections with other scientists. Both the first andsecond communication levels had eventually a broader impact in terms of new job opportunities for these young scientists, which indeed arose abundantly. The third level of communication has been the one towards the general public. This was implemented first ofall through a regular activity of public lectures, performed by the project Principal Investigator. Popular articles for both specialised magazines and newspapers were also written, often in connection to press releases presenting the achievement of specific researchmilestones. Impact on the wider public was eased by the fascination that cosmology produces on people of all ages, a clear demonstration of how basic research can be of great interest, if properly communicated. Finally, there are also other subtle ways, yet meaningful, through which the project has been important for society at large. For example, the Darklight group has been an interna- tional one, with 2 postdoctoral fellows from the U.S and one each from France, the UK, Japan and Italy. Thisinternational presence has been a significant exception in the Italian scenario, in which the brain drain of young scientists towards foreign countries is not adequately compen-sated by a corresponding incoming flow from abroad. Thus, the European contribution was instrumental toshow that when a front-ranked, well- funded project exists, the process can be easily inverted: a great goal achieved by Darklight in particular, a positive message to the Italian society in general.

The meeting gathered some of the recognised leaders in the field, including a founding father of modern cosmology, Nick Kaiser (University of Hawaii, 5th standing from the right). At his left, John Peacock (University of Edinburgh), another renowned cosmologist with whom the young members of Darklight had the benefit to interact through these small, focused meetingsInvestigating the physics of the early Universe is the great goal of modern cosmology, which shifted over the years from the discovery to the current precision measurement epoch. The Cosmic Microwave Background-CMB, the first and oldest light emitted when the universe was 380,000 years old, is by far one of the most powerful tools of the experimental cosmology. We observe it today, 13.4 billions of years after the Big Bang, having a unique insight on how the universe was at the beginning and how it evolved with time. Thus, the CMB observations consti-tutes the natural tool to constrain models of particle physics at energies which will never be reached by labora- tory experiments and trace new physics beyond the standard picture.The discovery of the CMB by Penzias and Wilson in 1965 provided the first and strong evidence for the so-called hot Big Bang. Tiny variations in themean CMB temperature (or intensity) with the observing directions (the so- called CMB temperature anisotropies) were first detected on large angular scales in the 1992 by the DMR experi- ment on board of the NASA COBE satel- lite. This detection provided the first and robust confirmation of the theories describing the formation and the evo- lution of the large-scale structure of the universe based on the gravitational instability scenario, pioneered in the 1940's by Lifshitz. The ESA Planck mission (with the Ital- ian leadership of the LFI experiment) has by all practical means exhausted the information content of the CMB temperature anisotropies and defi- nitely established a breakthrough in the comprehension of the current concordance model of cosmology, the so-called CDM model, where only about 5% of the universe constituentsis formed by ordinary matter (protons and neutrons). The other 95% is a combination of what is called dark matter (presumably formed by still unknown weakly interacting massive particles) and dark energy (something conceptually very similar to the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein 100 years ago). In the concor- dance model, dark matter and dark energy are in a rough proportion of 3:7. Thus, the dynamics of the universe is today dominated by the dark energy, responsible for the presently accelerated expansion of the universe. The very first evidence for such an accelerated expansion was obtained using the supernovae Ia observations by Adam Riess and Samuel Perlmutter at the end of the 1990s, which has been further confirmed by the most recent supernova data and by other low redshift data such as the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation datasets. 102PROFILE The ASI/COSMOS project provides knowledge Prof. Nicola Vittorio, of the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma 'Tor Vergata', shares details on the ASI/COSMOS project and how it will advance cosmologyThe ASI/COSMOS project At the beginning of the 1980s, Alan Guth proposed the so-called cosmic inflation to explain why the universe is so smooth on large scales and to resolve some known puzzle of the standard Friedmann models. Cosmic inflation requires an early phase of accelerated expansion and it was at the beginning considered a very interesting but speculative theoretical paradigm.The precise mapping of the CMB tem- perature anisotropy lent credibility to this scenario and the case for cosmic inflation has strengthened significantly over the years. However, the conclusive evidence for the inflationary theory of the early universe will be provided by a detection of tensor perturbations of the space-time metric, which lead to a primordial gravitational wave back- ground. This background imprints aunique pattern (the so-called B-modes) in the polarisation of CMB photons. Therefore, the primary scientific exploitation of CMB B-mode data aims to a definitive probe of the inflation paradigm and to an estimate of the energy scale at which inflation occurs. Unfortunately, the amplitude of these modes is model dependent. Thus, while the observations of the weak polarised CMB signal (the so-called E- modes) have opened a new channel and a new era in the observations of the polarised microwave sky, the hunt for the elusive B-modes is much trickier and has only started. This is a very ambitious goal in which the whole Italian CMB community intends to be involved, participating tothe main international collaborations of future challenging orbital and sub-orbital experiments. To reach thisgoal, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) has decided to support this effort by funding the Cosmic Orbital and Sub-orbital Microwave Observations(COSMOS) project. The goal is to exploit in an integrated and synergic way, all the competences that the Italian CMB community has developed over the years, also thanks to the Planck mission. COSMOS has the followingmain objectives. \"The Cosmic Microwave Background- CMB, the first and oldest light emitted when the universe was 380,000 years old, is by far one of the most powerful tools of the experimental cosmology.\" First, the study of the scientific potential and technical feasibility of a medium long-term (5-15 years) program to measure the CMB polarisation fromsub-orbital platforms, identifying the best observational strategies. Second, to acquire full control of a number of foregrounds: the B-modes from diffuse Galactic foregrounds, in spite of the Planck results, are still far from beingdetected with the deepest details; grav- itational lensing removal is a subjectthat requires to be further developed and understood if we want to accu- rately measure B-modes; clusters ofgalaxies and point source contribution in the observed data set must be also known to high precision. Third, a coordination at the national level of the ASI balloon based Large- Scale Polarisation Explorer (LSPE) data analysis pipeline that will heavily rely on the use of synthetic data, produced by an instrument simulator, taking into account a sky model, as well as instrument characteristics, perfor- mance, calibration, uncertainties and systematic effects. Last but not least, the COSMOS project will provide resources for the formation of a new generation of cosmologists and astro- physicists active in observations, theory and simulation/data analysisactivity, which will be able to ensure tothe CMB Italian community the lead- ing international role that it has played up to now. In fact, even if focused on the CMB B-modes, it must be remem- bered that the observation of the microwave sky is also important for other, not less important, astrophysi- cal problems which are on the frontier of current research, such as clusters of galaxies, lensing, point sources and, the not yet fully explored, CMB spectral distortions. COSMOS started with the beginning of 2017 and will be financed until the end of 2019. To the project contribute 11 nodes: Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Ver- node has the responsi-bility of coordinating its activity at the national level, monitoring the implementation and delivering of theproducts. ASI will review the COSMOS results every six months. Prof. Nicola A strategy for the future Traditionally, the space sector has required huge investments, e.g. in human spaceflight, and has therefore been the preserve of large nations and large organisations with substantial budgets. However, due to the rapid pace of technological change, the exploitation of space is now possible by means of constellations of small and cheap satellites, which allows even small countries like Denmark to partici- pate. The disruption of the old ecosystem is reinforced by new private launcher systems which, so far, seem to be successful in introducing new innovative tech- nologies, e.g. re-useable rockets. These technologicalbreakthroughs happen to coincide with the launch and implementation of 2 new global space systems, whichwill provide free access to high-quality positioning and data from space: Galileo, Europe's Global NavigationSatellite System (GNSS), and Copernicus, the Europeansystem for Earth observation. Together these events explain why the space sector isbecoming an ever more important international catalyst for technological development, as well as for innovation in general and is set to unlock new opportunities for businesses in the economy as a whole. GNSS has already changed the way both businesses and people navigate.The agricultural sector could be the next sector to bene- t from an acceleration of the digitalisation of its produc- tion activities through the use of space data, for instance in precision farming. But public authorities will also be able to both optimise their working processes and deliver better solutions, e.g. the control and surveillance of trac in the air or sea. \"To explore the possibility of bringing big data from space closer to the public in Denmark, the strategy recommended a study of the need for a national data hub. The study is now underway and the conclusions will be published later this year.\" The question is, which economies will be the rst ones to benet from what many call New Space? A space strategy for Denmark Against the backdrop of this new kind of space race, the Danish National Space Strategy was published in June 2016, as the result of the intensive work of 8 ministries. For the rst time, the Danish government acknowledged the important role of space in growing the Danish econ- omy. The Strategy was accompanied by a new study thatshined a completely new light on the Danish space sector. Using OECD guidelines for the rst time, the study showed that contrary to traditional thinking the Danish space sector is, in fact, 4 times bigger in terms ofrevenue than rst anticipated, but space businesses are also predominantly located downstream in the value chain, in terms of both number of businesses and share of revenue. The report shook the old world view, whichPeter Mandix Sehestedt, Senior Consultant, Ministry for Higher Education and Science shares why the Danish space sector is important for the economy SPACE FOCUS105had the public believe that the space sector is dominated by a few businesses exporting technology to be usedupstream in the construction of big satellites. The report was seen by the government as evidence in support of the strategic goal of growing a downstream-oriented space sector. \"Together these events explain why the space sector is becoming an ever more important international catalyst for technological development, as well as for innovation in general and is set to unlock new opportunities for businesses in the economy as a whole.\" To achieve this goal the government for the rst timeprovided the political framework for using part of Den- mark's yearly contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA) as a means to actively pursue a nationalgrowth agenda. This means that the Danish participa- tion in ESA's technological support programmes in the future will be awarded only after a national selection,and on the basis of their potential contribution to the Danish economy. On a national level, many of the more than 46 initiatives in the national strategy weretargeting a perceived knowledge gap in society and hence, the need for promoting information about space in the rest of the economy. Furthermore, newfunding in existing Danish innovation programmes was earmarked to the space sector and in particular, proj-ects that focused on the new opportunities in the use of small satellites and application of free data from large Earth observation systems, such as Copernicus. To explore the possibility of bringing big data from space closer to the public in Denmark, the strategy rec- ommended a study of the need for a national data hub. The study is now underway and the conclusionswill be published later this year. The implementation of the strategy is supported by a formal framework which was put into place in recent years. The responsibility for coordinating space activi- ties was placed under the auspices of the Ministry ofHigher Education and Science by a royal decree on 8May 2015. Furthermore, the Ministry of Higher Educa-tion and Science set up a space division within the Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education. Also, in spring of 2016, the Ministry set up a formalised inter- ministerial cooperation through the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Space Committee, which is chaired by the Ministry of Higher Education and Science. The Inter-Ministerial Space Committee is composed of the Danish Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Environment and Food, the Ministry of Transport and Building and the Ministry of Foreign Aairs of Denmark, which have responsibilities in areas with stakes in the space economy. Finally, the Danish Parliament adopted the Outer Space Act in May 2016. Will the strategy be successful? In the coming years, the Ministry of Higher Education and Science, together with Statistics Denmark will be adding new questions about the use of space onto 2 existing national IT-sur- veys covering most of the branches of the Danish Econ-omy, including the Danish farmers. When the rst results on use of space systems in the Danish economy are published in October 2017, for the rst time we will get the complete picture of the Danish space economy, as well as establishing a rm baseline for determining the actual impact of the strategy going forward.

M\u00f8ller and Chastine Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Foundation, the Center for Electron Nanoscopy at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Cen) was inaugurated in 2007. The center was established as a state-of-the-art electron microscopy (EM) facility with a suite of microscopes housed in a high specification building that only a handful of other labs world- wide could rival. The broad aim of the center is to ensure a balance between advanced research, teaching and train- ing, and fostering collaborations with national and international partners. Now, a decade after the official inaugu- ration of DTU Cen, the center employs 17 researchers (including PhD students and post docs.) as well as 7 technical and administrative staff. Over the years, the activities of the center have been expanding as DTU Cen attracts funding from both Danish and European fund- ing agencies. Access for academic and industrial sci- entists to DTU Cen's electron micro- scopes supports existing research and results in the creation of new research fields and in the sharing of knowledge for the development of materials, pro- cesses, technologies, techniques and instrumentation. The list below givesan idea of the broad research areas that the center is currently pursuing: In situ characterization of individual nanoparticles under controlled atmosphere;Nanostructures for Plasmonic sensing; Magnetic and 2D carbon struc- tures; Grain boundary mapping and phase transitions of alloy materials. What does EM bring to the table? Nanotechnology has been a hot topic for more than a decade. The extraor- dinary properties of materials revealed when structures approach the nanometer regime calls for a better understanding of the structure-functionality relationship. Only byestablishing a fundamental under- standing of such relationships, is itpossible to tailor-make materials and nanostructures for properties not necessarily found in nature. EM is a versatile tool that can be used to map out the structure and elemen- tal composition of a material from the micrometer scale down to the atomiclevel. With a spatial resolution in the sub-\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m regime, it is actually possible to image individual atoms in high-end electron microscopes. However, even though EM can provide wonderful images of materials at the nano- and micrometer scale, the ultimate goal of EM is not to obtainaesthetically pleasing images, but to advance materials science. This means that EM has to evolve from describing to understanding materials properties. Considering that that the obtainable resolution in an electron microscope has reached well below 0.1 nm, theThe Center for Electron Nanoscopy's Professor Jakob Birkedal Wagner highlights the strides being made in nanoscale imaging researchNanoscale imaging research: Why is it useful? 106PROFILE Figure 1: Combined orientation map of ferrite and austenite (left). Misorientation color coded grain boundary map (right)200um 200umchallenge now lies with improving time resolution with high sensitivity. Game-changing developments in high - speed cameras and highly sensitive detectors are creating the platform for making EM an even better analysis tool, especially in so-called in situ EM studies in which the electron micro- scope is used as an in situ experimental laboratory. The analysis of the dynam- ical response to stimuli such as heat, gas and liquid exposure, electrical bias, stress, illumination, magnetic fields, etc. are all possible by using in situ EM. Even though EM is a powerful tool for studying materials it should not be seen as a stand-alone technique, but has to be used in a complementary way with other methods. Further-more, high-end electron microscopes are usually very specialized in order to push the limits. Thus, a centralized infrastructure like DTU Cen with a broad suite of electron microscopes and the accompanying expertise is more beneficial than having single instruments spread over a wide area. You could consider high-end EM as Formula One; you need a good car (microscope), a good driver (opera- tor/scientist) and a comprehensive support team (technician, materials science collaborators) to achieve out-standing results. If one is missing, you have to settle for the mediocre. Highlights from DTU Cen The mechanical properties of materi- als are strongly related to grain size, grain boundary length and type. Map- ping the microstructure in terms of phase and orientation in the way shown in Figure 1 before, after and (ideally) during mechanical treatment or annealing, provides invaluable insight into the relationship between macroscopic mechanical propertiesand the microstructure. Such insight and fundamental understanding are aids towards creating tailor-made materials for wind-turbines, aircraft parts and other materials used in harsh environments. Chemical surface reactions, such as those taking place in catalytic pro- cesses, are highly dependent on the atomic structure of the active species. The structural aspects of the materials often change with the environment (gas, temperature, etc.). This means that in situ studies are necessary to obtain the real picture of the active material. In Figure 2, a Pd surface is viewed as synthesized and duringreduction in hydrogen at elevated temperature. The native oxide layer of the particle is removed and the relevant structure of the surface is revealed.EM also provides the possibility to map out plasmonic responses via electron energy-loss spectroscopy and magnetic fields by electron holog- raphy. Figure 3 shows an example of the spatially resolved plasmonic response probed by swift electrons of gold and silver. Electron holographyallows magnetic and electric fields in materials to be studied quantitatively at the nanometer scale. Figure 4 shows in-situ magnetic reversal behaviors of individual pseudo-spin- valve thin-film elements (NiFe/ Cu/Co) after the application of a magnetic field, suggesting a variation of the switching field in the adjacent elements.

And the fact is that somehow they're all dierent. They are the best in the world but I thinkthat what really amazed me and what dierentiates them is not only that they are best. What dierentiatesthem is their being contagious about their passions. They are great story tellers. They have a way of commu- nicating their project that you do not nd anywhere else. This is an amazing strength for Europe. This is an amazing strength for our collective future. \"In the next 10 years and beyond we will try to bridge the ERC to a future EIC. If we are to overcome the challenges that President Juncker spoke of, we need to reinforce the link between research and innovation. But with each keeping its own distinct identity.\" The European Research Council ERC storytellers are able to make you passionate about things that you don't fully understand. That's mindblowing. Ben Feringa and Jean Pierre Sauvage tell a story about how they created a four-wheel nano-car and how one day these nano-cars would be able to travel into your body and repair cells. You immediately become passionate about it without understanding it. How powerful is that? This way of storytelling is contagious. This is a unique trait. It's that unfailing belief that has made the ERC a major European success. And not just for the European project. In fact, we can even see the ERC reach beyond planet earth!Michael Gillon, who some of you may have heard of recently, is a perfect example of the success of the ERC. He is the lead researcher behind the SPECULOOS project and the recent discovery of the 7 new planets. Michael, a Belgian based out of the University of Liege (those of you who have lived in Belgium will appreciate the name SPECULOOS!) is an ERC grantee. I recentlyhad the chance to talk to him. He has an amazing story.And what he said towards the end of our conversation struck me. He said: The European Research Council believed in our intuition. I think Europe is one of the very few places where you still believe in scientic intuition and the ERC is the real proof of that. That is what makes the ERC exceptional: its belief in the potential of science. Its belief in intuition. Its belief that science is at the intersection of dierent elds. The problem with this story is that for several days nobody knew it was a European Scientist with Euro- pean money behind it. The news was: \"NASA discovered7 earth-like Planets\". So we have to be more vocal about our stories. We hesitate too much to tell our stories to the broader public. We are shy about our science. I am proud that the European Commission took the bold step in 2005 to propose the establishment of the European Research Council as part of the 7th Framework Programme. At the time, there was strong opposition to this proposalIn a speech, Commissioner Moedas shares how the European Research Council has pushed the boundaries of discovery and helped to develop European scienceSCIENCE & RESEARCH 109- including from several Member States. After 2 years of tough negotiations - and the vocal support of the scientic community - the ERC was nally agreed upon by the European Parliament and the Member States. The ERC was a success from day one, and has gone fromstrength to strength ever since. For Horizon 2020, the Commission proposed a doubling of the budget for the ERC. This was - for the most part - achieved. Followingthe mid-term review of the EU budget, the Commission proposed an increase in funding for Horizon 2020, including for the ERC. I am happy to announce today that the Commission plans to increase the budget for the ERC by \u20ac50m for the remaining years of Horizon 2020. Pushing research In 10 short years the ERC has become a powerhouse of science. It is recognised as the best in the world in the way it supports fundamental research. But I believe its importance goes beyond science. It shows how the European Union itself can innovate. In10 years the ERC has consistently demonstrated that it is responsive and understanding of what scientists need. Some of the simplications that the ERC intro- duced have now been mainstreamed across all parts of Horizon 2020. Such as the use of lump sums foroverhead costs. As boring as it sounds to give statistics, the numbers for the rst 10 years are so impressive that I can't pass them up: ERC funded projects are responsible for 6 Nobel Prizes, 5 Wolf Prizes and 4 Field Medals. ERC funded projects have resulted in 100,000 articles being published in scientic journals, including over 5,500 in the 1% most cited scientic journals. That means that for the rst time, Europe has surpassed the US in the number of top 1% most cited scientic publications. So let's be vocal about it. To be European is to be proud of science. Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Research, Science and InnovationImage: \u00a9 EUSCIENCE & RESEARCH 110The strong belief that the Commission and the ERC has in basic science has become contagious. Its model has been recognised as an example of best practice for national funding. Since the creation of the ERC:Eight Member States have set up their own national research councils inspired by the ERC model. Eleven Member States have launched funding mechanisms based on ERC funding. In 10 years, the ERC has not only become a beacon of excellence in science. But it has kick-started a domino eect in this belief throughout Europe, and the world. We're not just here today to talk about the past successes of the ERC. We have another task. We needto talk about where we see it going in the future. You may know that European Commission President Juncker recently released the White Paper on the future of Europe. And in it, he took considerable care to pointout the challenges we need to overcome. Science is recognised as a central element of the future of the EU for 2 reasons: Because it is the best tool we have to reconnect with people. Science is about creating bridges, about collaboration about understanding others. So we need you in Europe. Because it is only with science that we can overcome our biggest challenges such as climate change, our ageing population and even security threats. As a paradigm of excellence, the ERC should also act as a model for the Future of Europe. While we are number 1 in science, this is not the case for innovation. So this is why I am working so hard to create a European Innovation Council. To create more impact from European innovation support.If we are successful with an EIC, I believe this will increase even further the success of the ERC. The ERC Proof of Concept scheme has shown that there are many fantastic ideas for innovation that come from the ERC projects. A future EIC should accelerate the application of these ideas. And scale up the successful applications so they have a real impact on people's lives and wellbeing. So the EIC will be a complement to the ERC, not a competitor. In the next 10 years and beyond we will try to bridge the ERC to a future EIC. If we are to overcome the challenges that President Juncker spoke of, we need to reinforce the link between research and innovation. But with each keeping its own distinct identity. This is very much in keeping with the 3 values I have set out for the new Framework Programme: Excellence; Openness: and Impact. The ERC is already a beacon of excellence. It is at the forefront of open science and open to the world. And it is having tremendous impact in so many dierent ways. I believe the ERC must be a key pillar in an even more ambitious Framework Programme that follows Horizon 2020. This is an edited version of a speech from Commissioner Moedas. Carlos Moedas Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation European Commission https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/moedas_en www.twitter.com/Moedas Numerical cognition is essential to many aspects of life and arithmetic abilities predict academic achievements. Acquiring a solid sense of numbers and being able to mentally manipulate numbers are at the heart of this ability. Children with poor numeracy are at a disad van- tage in both academic and everyday life situations (e.g., handling money). Adults with poor numeracy are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those who are numerically compe- tent. Poor numeracy often means low financial proficiency, with negative consequences for economic wellbeing. However, it is also clear that studying arithmetic is not simple and is extremely difficult for those whosuffer from specific learning disabili- ties in arithmetic, henceforth termeddevelopmental dyscalculia (DD). In recent years, research in numerical cognition has expanded and we have witnessed a flourishing field with research aiming to advance our knowledge, unravelling the building blocks of numerical cognition and its development. Research in the area of numerical cognition has led to a widely accepted view of the existence of innate, domain-specific, core numerical knowledge based on the ability to perceive and manipulate dis- crete quantities (e.g., enumeration of dots). Moreover, a deficiency in thiscore knowledge is thought to be the basis for arithmetic disability (i.e. DD). Many believe in the existence of 2 sys-tems. One system represents large, approximate numerical magnitudes (i.e., the approximate number system, ANS). The second system, devoted to small sets of objects (1-4 objects), is based on the ability to simultaneously track several objects separately, and enables the precise knowledge of the number of objects. However, as is the case in many other research areas,questions and doubts regarding accepted views continuously fuel research and bring up new develop- ments and insights. Numerical cognition Much of the research in the area of numerical cognition has targeted numerical abilities and accordingly, employed tasks that involved discrete variables like arrays of dots orrevolved around enumeration or esti- mation of the number of presented dots or objects. In contrast, recent research has turned the spotlighttoward non-countable, continuous variables (e.g., how much water is contained in the glass or which glass has more water?). Such research was triggered by various observations like the following: (a) Arrays of items (used to study numerosity - the number of items in an array) are always con- founded by various continuous prop- erties like area or density. It is clear that these continuous properties are naturally correlated with numerosities. (b) One such continuous property, size, seems to be a basic property of objects that infants notice early in life.(c) Symbols that are employed in our mathematical system (e.g., 2, 5) are intimately associated with sizes and other non-countable dimensions (e.g., area, brightness). These observationsand research suggested that percep- tion of continuous properties mightbe important to the development of arithmetic. Accordingly, we suggest that a relatively neglected aspect ofperformance - the ability to perceive and evaluate sizes or amounts -might be an important foundation of numerical processing. This ability might even constitute a more primi-tive system that has been used throughout human evolution as the basis for the development of thenumber sense and numerical abilities. We devoted effort to study these issues. Our research is carried out at the Cognitive Neuropsychology Labo- ratory, at Ben-Gurion University of theNegev. It has been supported by a grant from the European Research Council (ERC) for the project titled Size Matters in Numerical Cognition (SMiNC). To convey the flavour of our experimental work, let me give an example of the studies of the relation- ship between numbers and sizes. One of the first demonstrations of the intimate connection between numbers and sizes was the size congruity effect, or sometimes referred to as the numerical Stroop effect. In exper- iments designed to examine thiseffect, participants are presented with 2 digits that differ in both numericalDistinguished Professor Avishai Henik provides insight into the research being undertaken into numerical cognition via the ERC-supported SMiNC projectThe SMiNC project: Understanding numerical cognition 111PROFILEvalue and physical size. The pair of digits can be congruent (when the numerically larger digit is also physi- cally larger) or incongruent (when the numerically larger digit is physically smaller). Participants are presented with such pairs of digits and are asked to decide which one is larger physi- cally or numerically. The physical task (i.e., decide which digit is larger phys- ically and ignore the numerical values) and the numerical task (i.e., decide which digit is larger numerically and ignore the physical sizes) are carried out in separate blocks of trials. The size congruity effect is indicated by aslower response to incongruent than to congruent trials and appears both when the physical sizes are relevantand numerical values irrelevant, andvice versa. The effect appears not only with digits but also with number words. Moreover, a similar effect appears with other non-countable dimensions like luminance. Similar effects have been found with objects (e.g., a small violin presented simulta- neously with a larger banana). Impor- tantly, we found that participants whosuffer from DD show deficiency in both the numerical size congruity effect, as well as in the object congruity effect. What are the foundations of numerical processing? We suggest that routines and neural structures built for size judgments were made available to other systems through evolution, allowing for the development of an exact numerical system. Non-countable representa- tions and the ability to perceive and evaluate sizes or amounts were essential for such development. Note that this fits in with the idea put for- ward by Piaget that continuous spatial extent serves as the antecedent to a child's concept of discrete numbers. In order to gain a comprehensive picture of numerical cognition, there is a needto study the ability to perceive andevaluate sizes and amounts, and their relationship to the development of the numerical system.

The efficiency of plant, whetherland based or on the wing deterio- rates with use and service life. One of the causes of this gradual deteriora- tion is through wear of leading edges in rotating turbo machinery caused by solid particulate erosion at elevated temperatures. This damage process can reduce the efficiency of turbines by as much as 7 to 10%, and in the case of a large power plant, can cause an additional emission of 250,000 tonnes of CO 2over the lifetime of the plant1. The cause and type of solid particle erosion varies across different industries and locations in plant, for instance the particles could be volcanic ash in aero-engines, fly ash in boilers, exfoliated scale in steam turbines or mineral matter in oil excavation. In all cases the performance of materials can be improved through better surface engineering and coatings, but the development of these is often restricted due to the lack of generic models, well controlled andinstrumented tests and international standards. New test facility The National Physical Laboratory(NPL) in Teddington has been working with other national measurement institutes and research bodies acrossEurope, to design and build a new test facility. The aim of this being to produce a versatile apparatus with embedded instrumentation to monitor and control the temperature of the gas, sample and particles, to measure and control the gas velocity and to measure the mass change and erosion scar volume in situ during the test. Critically this new test facility includes in situ evaluation of the mass andvolume change of the sample and provides a real time measurement of the erosion process, with the added benefit of removing the need to ther- mally cycle the sample for the ex situ mass and surface measurements at room temperature. This enables the erosion test to be conducted without interruption, thereby allowing the test to be completed in a matter of hours,as opposed to a number of days. This new system has been designed to carry out experiments at temperatures up to 900\u00b0C and particle velocities up to 300 ms-1. To validate the in situ mass measure- ment against conventional ex situ measurements a small inter-compar- ison exercise was conducted as part of the METROSION project2. Results from tests performed on Nimonic 80A by the 3 participating laboratories at 600\u00b0C using different stand-off distances and acceleration lengths are shown in Figure 1, which presents data collected at 2 incident angles over a range of particle velocities. The error bars represent the standard deviation in the data provided by the 3 laboratories. This shows that thePrincipal Research Scientist Tony Fry discusses using in situ measurements to accelerate the development of material solutions to particulate erosionIn situ measurements can offer insight into particulate erosion 113PROFILE y=5E-05x2.0334 y=3E-06x2.4581Steady State Erosion Rate, mg/g Velocity, m/s0 01 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 030\u00ba 90\u00ba30\u00ba Data90\u00ba Data1234567 Figure 1 Erosion rate as a function of incident angle for all data collected for Nimonic 80A at 600\u00b0C by three laboratories as part of an intercomparison exerciseerosion rate from the 3 laboratories fall on the same curve for the different test conditions, providing confidence in the data generated from the in situ measurements compared to the ex situ measurements which were conven- tionally made. This figure also illus- trates the influence of the incident angle on the erosion rate, where the erosion rate is lower at the higher incident angle. Further tests have been conducted to measure the erosion performance for a range of hard coatings. In each case HTSPE tests were performed at 600\u00b0C using 2 velocities of 117 and 140 ms-1 with a stand-off distance of 50mm and incident angles of 30\u00ba and 90\u00b0. In situ mass measurements were made during the testing. Ex situ data were also obtained after the completion of the tests. Figure 2 shows typical results for uncoated Nimonic 80A and for samples coated with TiAlN, plotting the erosion rates obtained from insitu mass measurements, compared to those calculated from the ex situ mass measurements. For both sets of samples, the slope of the line is close to one indicating that the in situ and ex situ mass measurements agree. In the uncoated sample, the maximum erosion rate was approximately 6mg/g. The application of a TiAlN coating to the Nimonic 80A substrate has provided protection against HTSPE, reducing the maximum erosion rate to approx- imately 2mg/g. It has been demonstrated that this new mass measurement method works well and that it has many benefits over conventional methods. Not only does this new approach allow for the real time evaluation of the erosion rate during testing but it avoids additional errors from thermally cycling the sample and errors in repositioningthe sample during room temperature ex situ mass measurements. This approach has the added benefit of decreasing the time needed to con- duct a test, from several days to 90 minutes, which in material develop- ment provides time and cost savings. This new erosion test facility adds to the range of tribological measure- ments NPL can offer industry in the assessment and measurement of material performance.

Operating in some of the most demanding environments, Honeywelltechnology increases reliability and efficiency, whilst enabling missiles, satellites, fighting vehicles, underwater weapons and submarines to more effectively and accurately complete their missions. Through our expertise in Joule-Thomson cryogenic coolers, linear Stirling cycle cryocoolers and compressors and extensive knowledge of long life stored energy technologies, Honeywell offers customers an integrated solution for their cooling requirements. From our dedicated cryogenic facility, weprovide a bespoke manufacturing ser- vice and a responsive aftercare infras- tructure to support through the lifecycle of the product. Joule-Thomson Cryogenic Coolers and Stored Energy Gas Systems Joule-Thomson (J-T) coolers remain the simplest, lightest and easiest technology for cryogenic cooling across a wide range of IR sensor applications, employed in numerous global missile programmes such as, Javelin, StormShadow and ASRAAM. They provide rapid, accurate cooling, within tight space envelopes. We offer a variety of J-T coolers that can optimise gas consumption, resultingin more efficient operation. Compli- mentary to this are our stored energy products that provide fuel for the J-T coolers and can utilise a variety of gas species, dependant on requirement, throughout their typically extensive 25 year life cycle. These gas systems can often include various gas management ancillaries that control flow rates under varying ambient pressures (altitudes), temperatures and other complex environmental requirements often akin to tactical/airborne applications. What this ultimately provides is a complete solution for cooling, gas supply and management of gases for the intended application regardless of the environmental complexities customers are often faced with. Linear Stirling cycle cryocoolers Designed for use in high duty applica- tions for continuous use as a replace- ment for legacy cooling systems, the Linear Cryocooler offers a significantlyextended life and enhanced levels of performance. Honeywell's Linear Cryocoolers incor- porate unique, patented technology from the development and industrial- isation of an Oxford University design concept. This patented technology, born out of the need for extremelyhigh reliability for space applications, offers superior durability to traditional tactical Linear Cryocoolers. Designed to 'fit and forget' standards, the system uses a non-contact dynamic sealing of the internal working gas, coupled with a high reliability linear electric drive, which has been proven to deliver over 120,000 hours of con- stant, maintenance-free operation. Due to their durability, reliability and military-grade performance, 85% of US long life flexure bearing Linear Cryocoolers in orbit on satellites today contain Honeywell Hymatic hardware. Other potential applications include:Peter Iredale, Engineering Lead at Honeywell HymaticCryogenic technologies for precision tactical and space applications 115PROFILE Joule-Thomson Cryogenic Coolers and Stored Energy Gas SystemsExtended operation cryogenic sensor cooling requirements; High efficiency compressors for space applications; High reliability/durability sensor cool ing - radio isotope detection systems; Power generation for forward outposts. Future developments and forging relationships Under a General Support Technology Program (GSTP), funding from the European Space Agency (ESA), a consortium of Honeywell Hymatic, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) and Thales Alenia Space UK are now working on the next generation of long life Linear Space Cryocoolers for Europe. Cryocoolers such as these are critical to future Earth observation missions where the need for high resolution IR sensing needs to be balanced carefully against the satellite payload size, weight and efficiency. ESA identified the need to push tech- nology of Cryocoolers with respect to size, weight and efficiency after benchmarking US Space Cryocoolers as world leading, including those supplied by Honeywell. The program, currently at its mid-point of a 3 year schedule, promises to deliver engi- neering qualified units to ESA that will be market leading within Europe, with respect to low mass/size and high effi- ciency, whilst maintaining the long life heritage required for said applications. Our relationship with RAL is yielding further development of products for tactical/commercial applications. The Cryogenics team at RAL has a long established heritage in the field of long life Space Cryocoolers, working with ESA and the UK Space Agency. Recently RAL have been developing a Small Scale Cryocooler for use in miniature space satellites, pushing the space envelope ever smaller. Honey- well Hymatic, seeing an opportunitywith this design, has taken the tech- nology and is applying our manufac- turing techniques to ensure a versioncan be produced for tactical and commercial IR applications without the high costs traditionally associated with space applications. However this does present an opportunity for space applications in the respect that a Cry- ocooler may be taken from a standard production run, and with a minimal increase in testing and quality control, supplied to a space customer for amuch reduced cost over traditional Space Cryocoolers. The key with this philosophy is sustainability of source product and their manufacturers. The space market represents very low quantities of product per annum,whereas the volumes for tactical/com- mercial coolers are far greater and often the technology cannot read from oneto the other. This is a dichotomy that Honeywell Hymatic is working to break with the Small Scale Cooler. Honeywell Hymatic employs a dedicated team of specialised engineers and technicians with a combined experience of more than 300 years in cryogenic products. We continue to invest in developing leading-edge technology, working in partnership with our cus-tomers, to offer effective solutions based on our mission proven expertise.

Supporting basic sciences across all academic disciplines, the SNSF is Switzer- land's key research funding organisation. The organi- sation nances over 3,200 projects involving 14,800 researchers each year. The SNSF see's knowledge as the key to the future and with this research creates knowledge. The Foundationdenes its ambitions and values informing its work: Quality, Independence, Reliability, and Fairness. Recruiting talented researchers One of the key areas of concern for the SNSF is encour-aging young talent into the area of research. The SNSF supports over 4,000 doctoral students and around 2,500 postdocs through their projects and programmes, every year. In their 2013-2016 Action Plan , the SNSF outlines the importance of ensuring the emergence of the next generation of researchers, and says: \"In Switzerland, careers in academia are led with uncertainties which, particularly for Swiss researchers, reduce their appeal in relation to other career oppor- tunities. Encouraging young talents to consider a career in research is therefore the uppermost priority of the SNSF. \"Supporting measures for project collaborators, redesigned mobility fellowships and doctoral programme in the humanities and social sciences are expected to create opportunities for young researchers at key stages in their careers.\" The Plan says: \"Switzerland is a highly successful and attractive research location with excellent researchgroups working to the highest international standards, oering good infrastructure, well above-average salaries and a high-quality of life. \"The large proportion of researchers from abroad is evidence of the fact that in the international battle for the best talents, Switzerland occupies a good startingposition. Both its institutions of higher education and its funding organisations are called upon to ensureoptimal framework conditions so as to continue to attract the most innovative researchers, increase the number of home-grown talents willing to pursue an academic career and be able to secure Switzerland'sposition as a top research location in the long term.\" Flexible research Another priority area for the SNSF was to oer flexible research to scientists in their quest for excellence. \"The pace, scope and impacts of scientic discovery in research are increasing at a tremendous speed. Today,new methods of investigation and technologies building on years of basic research are enabling researchers to tackle problems and issues that are signicantly more complex than those encountered only 10 years ago. \"The goal of the SNSF is to support individual perform- ance by oering flexible funding options for all disciplines and types of research and by working to ensure good framework conditions for international co-operation and mobility, participation in national and international collaborative projects and programmes, and access to infrastructure.\" Open Access Government highlights how the SNSF is supporting science in Switzerland while attracting talented researchers into the field Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.orgwww.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovFocusing on the sustainable use of our resources, wood is one of the best materials to develop multi-functional wood and composite materials, as well as innovative prod- ucts for the timber and construction industries. A successful product development goes through an interdisciplinary approach covering different disciplines as product design, material sciences, bonding technology or material testing. \"The wood industry is entering a new generation of production processes. Through digitalisation, machine will be connected and able to produce more complicated pieces and composite materials.\" This approach has been successfully tested in our research institute, where the extensive knowledge of our collab- orators on wood and other renewable materials enables us to find innovative ways of using these materials. Five core competencies for a successful material development Material science and design Developing new materials and products calls for creativity, technical know-how, and a thorough grasp of economics and ecology. Based on these competencies, our Institute develops solutions for the development of wood-based materials and, together with our business part- ners, put them into practice. We givecareful consideration to a holistic view of the development process from raw material, the production processes, to the finished product. In parallel, we also carry out life cycle analyses and assess the economics of products and processes. Wood modification and surface treatments Our team works on solutions for sur- face treatment and wood modification for indoor and outdoor environments. Wood anatomy and physical analyses are additional focal points of our work. Furthermore, our applied research looks at ways to develop and optimisenew material technologies, coatings, and processes. For example, we devel-oped self-cleaning coatings, UV protec- tion systems for wooden curtain walls, and UV technology to dry coatings. Our basic research efforts are attempting to use biological ingredients to modify wood and thus provide ways to ecolog- ically protect wood. Bonding technology Our institute develops and optimises synthetic and natural adhesives for load-bearing and non-load-bearing applications. Important focal points include the substitution of synthetic raw materials with natural polymers, developing low-emission adhesives, and defining the chemical and mechanical characteristics of adhe- sives. Thanks to our modern labora- tory infrastructure, we are in a position to characterise the hardening processof adhesives and to investigate their adhesive and cohesive characteristics. Our portfolio of projects also includes innovative connection technologies. For example, we have developed the linear friction welding of wood, an innovative connection technology without adhesives. Analytic and chemical formulation Our well-equipped chemistry labora- tory enables us to carry out projects with an analytical and preparative orientation. The laboratory contains instruments for spectroscopy, equip- ment for analytical separation pro- cesses, devices for various physical and chemical measurements, and enables us to carry out and observe reactions under high pressure. Fur- thermore, we conduct analytical research, the characterisation of organic materials, the derivatisation of organically-based substances, the modification and functionalisation of surfaces, and the analysis and appli- cation of nanoparticles. We have alsospecialised in the development of LED UV and polymer systems for blue-light hardening that can be used in various applications. Material emissions and extractives Our activities focus on the characteri- sation, the development, and the appli- cation of low-emission and odor-free materials and furnishings, as well as on the resulting indoor air quality fromA multidisciplinary approach is necessary to stimulate the wood technology sector, says Professor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pichelin, of Bern University of Applied SciencesBoosting innovation in the wood technology sector 118PROFILEthe building construction processes. We also work on thermal insulation and the characterisation of extractives from renewable materials and their uses. Furthermore, we develop proce- dures for removing biocides applied to cultural assets in the 20th century. Such biocides have been found to be damaging to both health and property. How can this research approach be transferred in a global context? During the last few years, the Institute has been working at the international level in a challenging area: the devel- opment of bio-based resins for the production of building materials. The composite industry is using a wide range of petroleum-based resins. Depending on the type of resin, the ecological impact of the products can be seriously influenced. Especially in the field of wood-based composites,the mixing of natural fibres with synthetic resins cannot be consideredas a durable solution. The priority of further development should be led on the use of bio-based resins with a low ecological impact and when possible no influence on human health. \"A successful product development goes through an interdisciplinary approach covering different disciplines as product design, material sciences, bonding technology or material testing.\" Merging the competencies of the polymer chemists and wood-based specialists, a new generation of resins based on the use of HMF (5-hydrox- ymethylfurfural) has been developed. The first test has been successfully carried out at the laboratory scale,showing promising results for the production of particleboards. More recently, one of our research groups has investigated the potential of bark extract from local European species like Norway spruce. Extractsfrom Norway spruce have been used at the laboratory scale for the produc- tion of particleboard and plywood. This tannin-based resin has also being mixed with natural fibres for the production of insulating material withvery high fire resistance. Further perspectives The wood industry is entering a new generation of production processes. Through digitalisation, machine will be connected and able to produce more complicated pieces and com- posite materials. One example is the used of wood compounds for the 3D printing of small and larger pieces. A fast bonding like the welding of wood will also offer new perspectives in this digital transformation.

National measures were put in place to nance Swiss project participations in areas of Horizon 2020, to which Switzerland was not associated. Since thebeginning of 2017 Switzerland has become fully associ- ated with Horizon 2020. Philipp Langer, Head of the EU Framework Programmes section at the State Secretariatfor Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), looks back on the period of partial association and explains how things are likely to continue over the coming years. What is Switzerland's ocial position regarding Horizon 2020? Switzerland's ocial position over the last 3 years has always been the same, namely, the desire for full asso-ciation to Horizon 2020. There is great satisfaction because this association to all parts of the Horizon 2020Programme has been in place since 1 January 2017. Researchers from Switzerland can now participate in all sections of the 8th Programme generation (Horizon 2020 and the Euratom Programme), just as they could under FP6 and FP7, between 2004 and 2013. In addition, Switzerland is also able to take part as an observerwhen it comes to dening the programme's content and strategy. Did the impediments of the last 3 years cause problems for higher education institutions and researchers in Switzerland? The possibility of participating in the Horizon 2020 research framework programme is extremely important for Swiss institutions and businesses involved in research and innovation. For one thing, collaborativeprojects allow Swiss actors to position themselves in international networks at the cutting edge of their scientic eld. Moreover, the possibility of applying forindividual funding (e.g. ERC grants) allows researchers in Switzerland to measure themselves against the world'sgreatest talents and is a key argument in drawing the best researchers to Swiss institutions, particularly cantonal universities, federal institutes of technology and universities of applied sciences. Obtaining such a grant brings with it prestigious recognition, which isextremely important in a researcher's career. Over the last 3 years, Switzerland was only able to participate to a limited extent in Horizon 2020, both in terms of content and duration: researchers in Switzer- land were only able to participate in a third of the Hori- zon 2020 as associated partners, and this was only untilthe end of 2016. Besides, even this partial association as of September 2014 has only been possible because Switzerland granted citizen from Croatia de facto the same treatment in terms of free movement of persons as other European countries. As of 2017, Switzerland had only 2 options: full participation as an associated country or total exclusion from the Programme. ThePhilipp Langer, Head of the EU Framework Programmes section, SERI, highlights Switzerland's participation in Horizon 2020 now it has full association Philipp Langer, State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, Head EU Framework Programmes Image: \u00a9 Ga\u00ebtan BallySCIENCE & RESEARCH 121uncertainty that reigned over the least 3 years regarding Switzerland's partner status within Horizon 2020 dimin- ished our country's appeal. Including Swiss partners in a given project, who were considered a risk for that project, so they were sometimes disregarded by international consortiums. The upshot was a signicant drop in Swiss participation, a problematic situation as international connection is a key factor for Switzerland'sstanding as a scientic location. What further possibilities are open to Switzerland with full association? Full association status in Horizon 2020 allows Switzer-land to sit as an observer on the programme's various advisory groups at European level and contribute to dening research topics and other strategic aspects.This is important for a number of reasons. On the one hand, calls for the topics of cooperative projects at European level are dened in a more top-down manner than in Switzerland, and that takes place in theadvisory groups for each area covered by Horizon 2020 (health, ICT, environment, space, energy, climate, andtransport). On the other, the funding available through Horizon 2020 (some \u20ac80 billion, over 7 years) is so important that each rule associated with these programmes (for example, the obligation to publish ndings in Open Access journals) has a real impact on the way in which research and innovation is conducted throughout Europe. During the period of partial association between 2014 and 2016, Switzerland was considered a third country for certain programme sections of Horizon 2020. The federal government took over the funding of Swiss elements of the projects. What will happen to these projects now that Switzerland is again fully associated? Projects already underway that have received funding under Horizon 2020 will not be aected by the change in Switzerland's participation status: Their source of funding is assured for the full duration of the project. SERI will continue to fund projects submitted to Brussels by researchers in Switzerland and positively evaluated between 2014 and 2016. This aects around 1,000 projects with a nancing volume of around 600 million Swiss francs. The last of these projects areexpected to conclude in 2023. Until then, SERI has tomaintain the structures set up to implement the transitional measures. After the uncertainty and stress surrounding Horizon 2020 between 2014 and 2016, can we now expect calmer times ahead? The period between 2014 and 2016 was fairly workintensive. For all projects where Swiss researchers could still submit projects, but did no longer receive funding by the EU, we had to set up the whole national project funding system within a short space of time, which involved putting in place a new legal basis and creating a new IT database (the former database dated from 1993). The national funding of projects with a normal duration of 4 to 6 years, as opposed to paying a set annual contribution to Brussels, meant we had to make adjustments to the annual payment appropria- tions involving hundreds of millions of francs. That is still having an impact on the federal budget. Depending on political developments between the EU and Switzerland, the future should be somewhat more ordered, yet implying double work: In addition to assuring the obligations that come with full associationwith the managing bodies in Brussels, SERI also has to ensure the continued project-based funding ofresearchers in Switzerland. Administering the 1,000 or so nationally funded projects will be particularly time consuming between 2018 and 2020, because that iswhen the detailed project invoices will be due. The Horizon 2020 projects are also more extensive than earlier EU projects. But it was clear from the outset that Switzerland's third country status would require thesetting up of the necessary administration.

For example, for industrial applications as transparent electrodes in large area printable electronics and sensor developments, for functionalised surfaces in food packaging and security tracking, as well as for the manufacturing of flexible medical electrodes. Main R&D projects at the Laboratory of Applied NanoScience (COMATEC- LANS), of the Department of Industrial Technologies at the HEIG-VD, School of Business and Engineering Vaud of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland, therefore focus on applied research and demonstrator developments based on nanocompos- ite materials for 2D and 3D printing and processing technologies. Here, we present the impact of applied R&D projects of COMATEC-LANS through 3 show case examples: Flexible biopolymer nanocomposite electrodes for Medtech applications To eliminate the stiff and uncomfort- able parts of some of today's medical electrodes was the aim of an interdis- ciplinary project involving engineers and scientists from the Laboratory of Applied NanoSciences (COMATEC-LANS) of HEIG-VD and network partnersfrom HES-SO Wallis. The are highly promising: the novelnanocomposite materials have suc- cessfully been tested for medical applications such as signal acquisition in electrocardiograms (ECG), as well as nerf stimulation (TENS). Part of the results have been published recently: in an article \"Design and Characterisa- tion of Conductive BiopolymerNanocomposite Electrodes for Medical Applications\" in the journal Materials Science Forum by Trans Tech Publications (2017). Furthermore, various materialsprocessing, printing and coating techniques are applied and developed for nanocomposite polymers at COMATEC-LANS/HEIG-VD. Hyprid-polymers and nanocomposites for 2D and 3D electrodes and circuits Printable polymer-nanocomposite materials for electrodes and 2D or 3D printable electrical circuits are another R&D focus of the laboratory COMATEC- LANS. One major topic concerns trans- parent and flexible electrodes; they areApplied nanosciences offer new possibilities for printing and processing, as outlined by Prof. Dr. Silvia Schintke from Heig-VD/HES-SO Switzerland 122PROFILE Applied nanosciences for printing technologiesin particular of technological relevance in photovoltaic and OLED applications, as well as for flexible displays. The nano- and micrometerscale topography of oxide based transpar- ent electrodes and of light manage- ment structures are studied at COMATEC-LANS/HEIG-VD in joint projects or as a service for companies from the photovoltaic sector. Polymer based transparent electrodes and sensors were e.g. investigated at COMATEC-LANS/HEIG-VD in collabora- tion with TU Sofia in a project sup- ported by the scientific exchange program Sciex-NMS between Switzer- land and the new EU member states. During this project a measurement technique for thin film conductivity of soft materials has been developed, as well as a printable transparent photo-electric sensor. The developed electrical measurement technique is published in IEEE Xplore (2015) \"Electrical characterisation of transparent organic conducting thin filmspreventing mechanical damage and preserving optical transparency\". Through its design in a transmissionline geometry it prevents the soft poly- mer film to be mechanically damaged by electrical probes and allows for the monitoring of the electrical conductiv-ity under light exposure without probe shadowing effects. The main investi- gated material was PEDOT: PSS, a transparent hole conductor which is widely used in organic photovoltaics. The influence of various dopants as additives that improve the thin film conductivity and aging behaviour under UV exposure has also been studied in this context. Nano- & microstructures and printing technologies for security tags and printable sensors Last but not least, the COMATEC- LANS/HEIG-VD performs research and development in the field of printingand processing technologies for sur- face structuring and functionalisation for security tags and printable sensors. Materials and surfaces are coated or locally functionalised with molecules and/or various nanoparticles and typically studied with advanced non- contact atomic force microscopy tech- niques, 3D profilometry and optical spectroscopy methods in order to optimise the printing and processing techniques and to analyse advanced security tags at the nano and micro - metre scale, as well as for their optical, electrical or magnetic signatures. Recent results on \"Inkjet-printing of aptamers for sensor developments\"have been presented at LOPEC, Inter- national Exhibition and Conference for the Printed Electronics Industry, 2017. Major collaborative projects of COMATEC-LANS/HEIG-VD in this field concern currently, the surface func- tionalisation and modifications for the development of sensors and surfaces in biomedical, environmental, food and active or smart packaging applications.

A few examples are manufacturing machines, positioning devices, vehicles and their components, etc. Their func-tion is closely controlled by adaptedelectronics & software, monitoring data can be produced by integrated sensors allowing for new function and maintenance concepts. In the age of digitalisation and networking, their development not only demands strong competences in the field of mechanical engineering itself, but also requires a holistic perspective and an interdisciplinary approach. The Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts' Competence Centre Mechanical Systems (CCMS) focus isthe development of such systems. Itsareas of expertise are design, simula- tion, mechanics, hydraulics, robotics, automation, production and measure-ment engineering. Driven by the ever increasing complexity of mechanical hardware, system approaches are inevitable for development and prob- lem solving. In this sense its technical and methodological skills in all these areas are the centre's greatest strength. The daily research and development work of the CCMS is based on a strong collaboration with industrial partners. Located in Central Switzerland it provides the Swiss industry with appli- cation oriented solutions. In order to provide answers in an increasingly competitive environment, its research activities are focused on the future challenges. More and more projectsand activities address some of the major key research areas in the con- text of Industry 4.0, i.e. virtual product development, additive manufacturing and automation. The following 3 examples emphasise these topics. Virtual Product Development Today the optimisation and develop- ment of new products is hardly imagin- able without the use of numerical simulation methods. Even for demand- ing manufacturing processes, these techniques are used to optimally adjust the production parameters. The St\u00f6ckli Swiss Sports AG produces approx. 50,000 pairs of skis per year, mainly at its location in Malters, Switzerland. As apremium manufacturer a high quality at low reject rate is required. Addition- ally the trend towards customised products requires an increasing degree of flexibility and short changeover times. This can only be achieved with an in-depth understanding of the phys- ical processes occurring during produc- tion. Virtual models can provide this understanding. Within the framework of a research project financially supported by the Commission for Technology and Innovation CTI, the CCMS developed a computer model that simulates the complete ski manufacturing process. In doing so, the individual layers of the ski are glued together in a hot-press- ing process. Machine and process parameters, as well as the initial mate- rials of the skis determine their shape and stiffness. Based on the finite The University of Applied Sciences' research group discuss the challenges of mechanical systems and the benefits they bring to everyday lifeWhat is the importance of mechanical systems? 124PROFILE element method (FEM), the transient temperature profile is simulated during the heating and cooling phases and the residual stresses resulting from bonding are computed. The validity of the model was confirmed by measurements and extensive tests. With such virtual models, a qualitative and even quantitative prediction of the main characteristics of a ski is possible.This is an innovation in ski develop- ment and helps to ensure the long- term competitiveness of St\u00f6ckli as an independent Swiss ski manufacturer. Additive Manufacturing Rapid prototyping technologies are used in student and engineering pro- jects. Different facilities are available to generate 3D-models for analysis of early design concepts. Besides com- monly used plastic fused deposition (FDM) recently activities are focusing on metal selective laser melting (SLM) for additive manufacturing. The CCMSoffers analysis and services for the complete process chain, i.e. 3D data processing, design optimisation, build process, post-processing / finishing, testing and material characterisation. For future applications major advan- tages in functional integration of assemblies and structural optimisa-tion are expected. Especially the design of variable stiffness and damp- ing gives completely new opportuni- ties for development of new products or components. In the context of addi- tive manufacturing a detailed material characterisation is of great importance. Dimensional aspects of parts and surface finishing have to be taken into account - using existing and new measurement equipment at hand. A micro tensile testing device was devel- oped with special specimen design. Further aspects of the research activities of the CCMS will consider the use and robotic assisted removal of supporting structures.\"In the age of digitalisation and networking, their development not only demands strong competences in the field of mechanical engineering itself, but also requires a holistic perspective and an interdisciplinary approach.\" Automation A very lively field in the context of Industry 4.0 is automation and robotics. Not only are the intercon- nection of data from and to the robots of importance, but also the smart reaction of robots to imperfect envi- ronment (e.g. parts not placed exactly to an expected location), as well as collaboration with humans (e.g. recog- nition of human body parts in the path of tool or gripper). The CCMS is looking for smart ideas to tackle such problems by using visual and tactile sensing techniques and focus on their implementation into industrial robots, if possible even to upgrade available hardware and by this enabling our industrial partners on their way to smart factories. Ralf Baumann Head of Competence Centre Mechanical Systems Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and ArtsTel: +41 the alka- line constituents of concrete by carbon dioxide in the air, forming mainly calcium carbonate. In this neu- tralised environment, reinforcing steel is no more protected by the alkaline pore solution of fresh concrete. When the carbonated surface zone reaches the depth of reinforcing steel, signifi - cant corrosion may be initiated . \"...achieving sustainable reinforced concrete structures clearly requires not only decreasing the environmental footprint of the materials at the time of their production (reducing the clinker content), but to combine this with high durability, thus enabling long and maintenance free service lives of the structures in their actual exposure environments.\" Indeed, corrosion of steel in carbon- ated concrete was a major concern of research and practice in the years from 1950 to 1980. The research findings lead to the requirement of dense concrete (lower w/c ratio), the control of concrete properties and to a marked increase in the cover depth (from 20 mm to 35 mm) in the codes of practice. The European standard on concrete EN 206-1 published in the year 2000 classified the risk of carbon-ation-induced corrosion depending on the severity of the environment (XC1 to XC4). With the minimumrequirements given in the recommen- dations (maximum w/c ratio, minimumcement content, minimum cover depth) the codes of practice since then give guidance for reinforced concrete made with Portland cement (CEM I) on how to avoid carbonation induced corrosion for structures with expected service life of 50 or 100 years. The role of carbonation as a factor that contributes to the degradation of reinforced concrete is becoming increasingly important again (Figure 1) for two reasons. First, many old reinforced concrete structures that were built before modern standards were applied are ageing and have to be maintained. Secondly, the needto reduce CO 2emissions and to obtain materials having a reduced environ- mental footprint, is leading to a reduc- tion of the clinker content in thecements. Clinker (CEM I) is substituted with supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as limestone, fly-ash, geopolymers etc. In the future blended cements with increasingly lower clinker content and a huge vari- ety of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) will be used. Theintroduction of non-Portlandite binders has strongly reduced the pH buffer capacity as a result of the reduction (or elimination) of the calcium hydroxide reserve considered one of the main reasons for the corrosion inhibiting nature of Portland cement systems. The carbonation rate of such modern blended cements is a factor of 2-4 higher than for Portland cement (figure 2), thus the recommen- dations based on the experience with Portland cement do no more guaran- tee the required service life.The effect of corrosion on reinforced concrete must be addressed both for safety and environmental reasons, say researchers from ETH ZurichCarbonation induced corrosion of reinforced concrete revisited 126PROFILE Carbonation, Corrosion serious problem 1950 Research efforts w/c, porosity Codes of practice w/c, cover Problem solved 1990 for Portland cementBlended cements SCM up to 65% CO2 reduction reduce clinkerCarbonation, Corrosion serious problem 2010 Figure 1: The carbonation cycle For service life prediction of concrete structures with new, blended cements, corrosion rate data are urgently needed because the so-called \"corro- sion propagation stage\" might be a sig- nificant part of the total service life. Literature data are scarce and refer mainly to Portland cement. To be able to collect data of corrosion rate in a reasonably short time, a new experi- mental set up has been designed (figure 3). The new test setup consistsof small (8 x 8 cm) and thin (6 mm) cement mortar samples instrumented with a reference electrode, 5 steel wire electrodes and a stainless steel gridcounter electrode. The thin sample allows rapid full carbonation (max 1 week in 4% CO 2) and rapid equilibra- tion of environmental humidity (checked by the sample weight). Parameters that can be measured are electrical resistivity of the mortar, corrosion potential and corrosion rate (LPR measurements) of the steel wires, oxygen diffusion and consumption rate. From these data the mechanism of steel corrosion in carbonated concrete made of different blended cements can be evaluated. \"The role of carbonation as a factor that contributes to the degradation of reinforced concrete is becoming increasingly important again for two reasons. First, many old reinforced concrete structures that were built before modern standards were applied are ageing and have to be maintained. Secondly, the need to reduce CO2emissions and to obtain materials having a reduced environmental footprint, is leading to a reduction of the clinker content in the cements.\" In summary, achieving sustainable reinforced concrete structures clearly requires not only decreasing the envi- ronmental footprint of the materials at the time of their production (reducing the clinker content), but tocombine this with high durability, thus enabling long and maintenance free service lives of the structures in theiractual exposure environments. 1 A.

Research in Germany is seen as one of the foundations of the country's future. The Federal Ministry for Education and Research is the main governing body in Germany and promotes the importance of research throughout the country. However, there are other organisations,such as the German Research Foundation, who oer funding for research programmes to all branches ofscience and humanities. In Germany, education and research are seen as a Federal government policy priority. Through excellent research, Germany is able to nd solutions to global problems, as well as devise strategies for sustainable growth. High-tech strategy for German research The Federal Cabinet recently adopted a report in the high-tech strategy, 'Progress through research and innovation'. The report, which was adopted in March, provides information on the implementation of the strategy and how it is working. Speaking recently at the launch of the report, Federal Minister for Education and Research, Joanna Wankaoutlined the importance of investing in research and innovation to maintain Germany's key position in this sector. \"Germany's strong position as the world's leading inno-vator and export world champion is no coincidence. It is the result of a policy that has been consistently focusing on research and innovation for more than a decade under the umbrella of the high-tech strategy,\" she said. \"If we want to maintain and expand this position, we must be prepared to invest even more in research andinnovation, so our goal is to increase spending onresearch and development to 3.5% of gross domestic product by 2025 There will still have to be two-thirds of the additional investment from the economy, which will only succeed if we are motivating more companies to generate innovation, which is why we need tax- related research funding alongside tried and tested project funding.\" Over the last 10 years, the Federal government has increased its R&D expenditure by more than 60% and has an outstanding track record in research and inno- vation during the current electoral period. The high-tech strategy, which was launched in 2014, has 6 priority points: digital economy and society; sustainable eco- nomics and energy; innovative working environment; healthy living; intelligent mobility; and civil security. Germany also takes pride in supporting its young sci-entists and aims to further encourage more youngpeople into the world of research. A recent report indi - cated that from 2000 to 2014 there was a 76% increase in the number of young scientists who were employedas academic sta at universities. In 2000 the number stood at 82,400, whereas in 2014 that number rose to 145,000. \"The young academics in Germany are an indispensa- ble part of our knowledge society, which needs highly qualied workers and a spirit of innovation, and invest- ment in young academics is paying o, which is why theFederal government recently launched 3 initiatives in favour of young scholars We are able to achieve a moretransparent and better plannable career path,\" explains Federal Minister Wanka. \"We have countered developments in short-term practice with a reform of the science-time agreement, andIn March, a new hi-tech strategy for German research was adopted. Open Access Government discusses the report and how it will aid innovation in the countrySCIENCE & RESEARCH 129because reliable data such as abort and success rates, we have also reformed the Higher Education Statistics Act. Only if we are even more aware of the situation of young scientists can we promote it even more eectively.\" The report, 'The Federal Report on Young Researchers 2017' , was published by the Federal Research Oce in collaboration with the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. According to the report, young scientists are consistently supported more professionally. The Ministry's key objectives to promote young scientists are: To increase the attractiveness and transparency of scientic career paths; Improve the transitions from the stage of scientic qualication to occupations in business and society; To promote the international competitiveness and mobility of young scientists;To aid with the career development of young academics; To create conditions under which scientic services of the highest possible quality can be provided. Well-qualied scientists are key for the country and are needed for both academic work, as well as for employment in the state society and the economy. It is one of the central concerns of the Federal government to ensure the quality of training for young academics is at the highest possible level to create attractive career structures and prospects for the scientists of the future. Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov Finding and designing new phar- maceuticals based on small organic molecules literally con- stitutes the search for the needle in the haystack. The first challenge thereby is to find the specific structure with the requested biological activity among myriads ( ~1060) of possible organic molecules. But not enough, this molecule also needs to meet certain standards with regards to metabolic stability, bioavailability, toxicology etc. mandated by the drugagencies. In the process of evolution - over millions of years - Nature has singled out so called \"privileged struc- tures\" exhibiting all kinds of biological activities and uses them for its pur- poses (chemical communication; chemical defense etc.). These \"privi- leged structures\" e.g. natural products are produced by organisms of the animal, as well as the plant-kingdom. Ever since mankind has taken advan- tage of nature by what is known todayas \"ethno or traditional medicine\". Traditionally, extracts, teas or pastes of these organisms containing these natural products have been usedwithout the knowledge of their exact structure and mode of action. Nowa- days, natural product researchers capitalise on the head-start Nature provides with these \"privileged struc- tures\", by identifying the exact molec- ular architecture of these natural products and understanding their mode of action, thereby enabling rational drug design. Yet, these inves- tigations strongly depend on the actual availability and natural abun- dance of the investigated natural products. Extracts of organisms typically contain very low quantities (scale: mg/kg dry weight of organism) of natural products, making drug development based on isolated material from their natural producers virtually impossible. Synthetic access to natural products - independent of the natural producer - is thereforeinevitable for the development of new drugs, since exploitation of the producing organisms would threaten them with extinction. Challenges Since the molecular architecture of natural products is very complex, their laboratory synthesis poses aformidable challenge for synthetic organic chemists and represents the cutting edge of the science of synthe- sis. Consequently, natural products remain an underexplored source in pharmaceutical industry. Neverthe- less, around 32% of pharmaceuticals in the market to date are based on small molecules derived from natural products (Figure 1), underscoring their vital importance in drug design. What makes the application of natural prod- ucts in drug development further challenging is the fact, that synthetic access to \"derivatives\" is extremely laborious and very often impossible. \"Derivatives\" constitute small struc-Prof. Dr. Tanja Gaich, of the University of Konstanz -Department of Chemistry discusses new strategies in drug development and the challenges involvedThe pursuit for new strategies in drug development 130PROFILE Biologicals 32% Synthetic Small Molecules 32% Natural Product derived small molecules 32%Cell-based Therapy 4% Synthetic Small Molecules Biologicals Natural Product derived small molecules Cell-based Therapy Conventional Synthesis: Starting material N.P.

Family lll Figure 1: Percentage of natural product derived pharmaceuticals on the marketFigure 2: Comparison of strategic approachestural changes introduced to the original molecular architecture by means of organic synthesis. These small changes of the original molecular structure are indispensable in drug development. Nature has designed natural products for its own purposes, which do not necessarily contain aspects of phar- macology in humans or meet the high approval standards of national drug agencies. Thus, \"derivatisations\" con- stitute an optimisation process of natural products with regard to these standards and requirements, and ulti- mately allow to bring the drug to themarket. However, in conventional organic synthesis almost every small structural change (derivatisation) inthe original molecular architecture requires a complete redesign of the synthetic route. In other words, a small change in molecular structure does not lead to an incremental change in the synthetic problem, but potentiates it. On the other hand, a big advantage of the complexity of natural product structures and oppor- tunity for drug design, is the fact, that often \"substructures\" of less molecu-lar complexity than the natural prod- uct itself already display the same biological activity. This reduces the complexity of the synthetic problem, only demanding a synthesis of a sub- structure of the molecule and its sub- sequent derivatisations. Objectives To overcome the obstacles connected with derivatisations in conventional synthesis and embrace the opportu- nity of substructure synthesis, nowa- days synthetic chemists develop new strategic concepts of synthesis design. An example for such a novel concept is ANaPSyS (Artificial Natural Product Systems Synthesis). ANaPSyS is based on structure pattern recognition and allows to synthesisebiogenetically completely unrelatednatural products based on their corpo- rate molecular architecture by a shared synthetic sequence. This sequence is upgraded every time a synthesis makes use of it hence net- work diversification leads to a rise in revenue. Figure 2 contrasts our strate- gic approach to conventional synthe- sis. Thereby we take advantage of common structure motifs often shared by totally different natural products. It is this shared motif that we term \"priv- ileged intermediate (PI in red Figure 2)\", and which has to be identified and designed first. This is taken out by structural comparison and database searches. This intermediate is then synthesised, and diversified by means of synthetic chemistry into the respec- tive natural products. For comparison, in conventional synthesis a target structure, which has been identified is synthesised via a specifically designed route. This route can only be used for the synthesis of this one individualmolecule. Any changes made in the final structure require redesign andthus reinvestigation of the synthetic route (see Figure 2).A specific example for such a research program is highlighted in Figure 3. Herein, 3 different natural product families with a broad range of pharma- cological spectrum ranging from anti- cancer to anti-malarial activities (see Figure 4) share a common structure motif (highlighted in color in Figure 3). Up to date, the sum of chemical trans- formations required to synthesise 3 of these natural products (one congener per natural product family) is 69 steps. By contrast, ANaPSyS will only require 33 steps. The number of synthetic steps is thus cut in half, moreover the synthetic system created for these natural products is flexible and can be used to access any other molecule sharing the common structure motif. This strategic approach thereby cre-ates an artificial synthetic network suitable for efficient synthesis of nat- ural products, their derivatives, and thus will provide access to their phar-macological properties as listed in figure 4. This will enhance efficacy in drug development, which is urgently required in pharmaceutical industry.

Instead, often com- plex interactions between the environ- ment and host, the host and microbe,and the microbe and environment have to be taken into account. Today's view on microbial pathogenicity has profoundly changed. Pathogenicity is no longer considered a specific prop- erty of the microbe, but thought to arise from a complex and dynamic interaction with the host. Microbes may grow and multiply only in certain hosts. Likewise, a pathogen might simply exist within a host and cause no signs or symptoms of infection or elicit disease to variable degrees, ranging from mild to deadly. Accord- ingly, we have to shift the focus onto the host-microbe interplay as a complex and malleable phenomenon governed by the properties of both the microbe and its host environment. To avoid a microbe or host-centred view and to rather implement a holistic approach, infectious disease- related research should be cross-dis- ciplinary and integrate traditionally separated biomedical and life science disciplines. In order to open up new therapeutic avenues to interfere with infection, we have to explore bacterial pathogenicity factors and infection pathways, but also the role of co-colonising bacteria, abiotic and bioactive factors, and pathogen and host variables. Furthermore, for many microbes, fac- tors required for microbial pathogenic- ity in a normal host cannot be identified. Many pathogenicity-associ- ated traits can be found in pathogenic, as well as in non-pathogenic variants of a species. Additionally, properties conferring pathogenicity depend as much on the host as they do on the microorganism. Recent developments in modern medicine further corrobo- rate the fact that in many cases pathogens and non-pathogens cannot be unequivocally distinguished based on specific traits, because the introduc- tion of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, immunosuppressive therapies, moderntreatment options (including, organ transplantation and joint replacement, implantable devices and indwelling catheters), each of which alters host-microbe interactions, created conditions, in which the host became susceptible to microbes that were previously considered non-pathogenic. Consequently, many microbes previ- ously considered non- or albicans), turned out to be able to cause serious disease. Many microbes cause disease in some, but not all of those individuals who are colonised by them. This is exemplified by bacteria such as staphylococci, which are actually present in most individuals, but onlycause disease in some. There is also growing evidence from microbiome analyses, that alterations of the normal composition of the microbiota or of the balanced relationship between microbes and the host barriers, can making the host more susceptible to infection by microbes that usually do not cause disease. Pathogenicity is therefore an outcome of host-microbe interaction and is thus linked to characteristics of thehost, as well as those of the colonising and infecting microbiota. Continual research to monitor microbial pathogenicity Despite the ongoing research activi- ties worldwide regarding bacterial pathogenesis and the development of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic- ity-associated traits, the underlyingevolutionary mechanisms and genetic elements in relation to the complexinteractions between pathogens and their hosts are not yet well under- stood. We study bacterial genome plasticity and gene expression in vivo to understand bacterial interaction with their hosts during infection orcolonisation which may result in differential susceptibility to infection (Figure 1). Next-generation sequenc- ing (NGS) allows the comprehensive genome wide identification of DNAsequence alterations, such as re-arrangements, insertion/deletion as well as horizontal gene transferevents.

An increased understanding of bacterial genome plasticity and gene expression in vivo will support the development of preventive, therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to specificallyinterfere with relevant virulence or colonisation mechanisms of pathogens in the reservoir and the infected patient. Bacterium-host interactions drive adaptive changes in bacteria, their phenotypic diversity and genome complexity. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is aversatile pathogen, acting as a major cause of morbidity and mortality as well as a commensal, which colonises the human gastrointestinal tract within hours after birth, and typically builds a mutualistic relation. We analysegenome plasticity and gene expression in vivo and the mechanisms by which E. coli adapts during long-term coloni- sation of the urinary tract or the intesti- nal tract of individual human hosts. Long-term colonisation of the urinary bladder or the intestinal tract by indi- vidual E. coli strains is one therapeuticstrategy to counteract infection by bacterial pathogens in these niches. In addition, isolates of uropathogenic E. coli from different time points of a chronic urinary tract infection also allow to monitor bacterial adaptation during infection. Comparative and functional genomic analysis of E. coli re-isolates from the bladder of deliberately colonised patients or re-isolates from the intes- tine of individuals colonised with an E. coli strain identified unique bacterial adaptation patterns in each person supporting the idea that, in addition to stochastic events, adaptive bacte- rial evolution is driven by individual host environments. Our data support the idea that hosts appear to person- alise their microbiota. Furthermore, our studies of pathogenic and non- pathogenic, commensal E. coli isolates have identified that, rather than conventional pathogenicity factors, determinants involved in bacterial fitness, e.g. in nutrient uptake and utilisation, as well as protection against the host's immune response are advantageous as they allow rapid adaptation and growth of these strains in niches where they can cause infection. We are convinced that the combined analysis of bacterial andhost responses during infection will define promising targets for novel antimicrobial strategies. Defining a role for metabolic traits during disease and identification of novel processes underpinning this capability could allow development as potential approaches (e.g. dietary manipulation, attenuated vaccines or anti-infectives) for preventing infection. Prof. Dr. Personalised microbiotaIndividual host susceptibilityThe international age of the New Kingdom in Pharaonic Egypt (c. 1539-1077 BCE) resulted in the foundation of several Egyptian towns and settlements in the area known today as Upper Nubia in Sudan. Some of these are well preserved and offer the unique chance to explore domestic life in an ancient Egyptian set- tlement outside of Egypt proper. The most promising example of such \"colo- nial sites\" is the exceptionally well pre- served town on Sai Island because of its long occupation period and its attested history as important site of the African Kingdom of Kerma. Prior to the New Kingdom, Sai was the northernmost stronghold of the Kerma Kingdom with a significant strategic role, well attested by archaeological remains. The ERC AcrossBorders project has conducted archaeological fieldwork on Sai Island from 2013 until 2017. Archaeological excavations in the New Kingdom town and cemetery were complemented with kite aerial pho- tography, structure from motion approaches, terrestrial 3D laser scans, geoarchaeological surveys, micormor- phological soil sampling and various archaeometric analyses of diverse materials. Human remains, animal bones, botanical material, soil, plaster, sandstone and all kinds of objects are currently being assessed under the general question: Can Sai be evalu- ated as an Egyptian microcosm, despite its location outside of Egypt and its specific topographical, envi-ronmental and cultural situation? How did the local Kerma Nubians react to foreign influences and how did the Egyptians present themselves outside of Egypt? The town layout has been pieced together The recent 2017 field season on Sai Island provided some answers to these general research questions, especially by new insights on the layout and function of the New King- dom town. At sector SAV1 West, an early occupation phase, predating the town enclosure, was confirmed - sup- porting the reconstruction of an early Egyptian landing place on the island founded at the beginning of the New Kingdom, a period when the Kerma Kingdom was still the major rival to Pharaonic Egypt. Some new mud brick buildings of modest scale and irregu- lar outline were excavated, providing additional data for the city map. In this respect, sector SAV1 East proofed to be highly relevant. This area yieldednew material for understanding the function of the town. Large subter- ranean storage rooms were unearthed in rooms with schist floors, stressing the role of Sai as Egyptian administra- tive center. The new cellars and rooms are comparable to the southern sector of the town, excavated by a French Mission in the 1970s, and are probably related to the Egyptian stone temple close by. With our new field- work, the town map can be updated and fresh remarks on the internalstructure are possible. Although Sai was definitely a planned Egyptian town with an orthogonal layout, AcrossBorders excavations have illus-trated that within the city there are several different sectors that contrast regarding their layout. Theoretical urban planning may differ signifi- cantly from real developments within Egyptian towns like Sai - especiallysince the past occupants represent a potentially dynamic factor, in particu- lar if they include both Egyptians and Nubians as it is the case for Sai.Excavations and 3D reconstructions on Sai Island provide a glimpse into the history and culture of an Ancient Egyptian settlement, says Professor Julia BudkaReconstructing an Ancient Egyptian Microcosm in Sudan 134PROFILE The 2017 AcrossBorders team on SaiCooking vessels a key find Within settlement archaeology, occu- pants of ancient sites may be tenta- tively traced by material evidence. One of the primary goals of the AcrossBorders project is reconstruct- ing life during the New Kingdom on Sai according to the architecture and finds. For this task, the most numer- ous finds to be considered are thousands of potsherds. Such ceramicvessels attest to the use and function of sites and individual buildings and can also provide information on the occupants. In this respect it is remark-able that, from the earliest strata onwards, Nubian ceramics appear at Sai side by side with imported Egyp- tian wares and locally wheel-made products. Since the Nubian pots are the minority, it seems safe to assume that the Egyptian style town was ini- tially occupied by Egyptians. However, the production of hybrid pottery typesillustrates that Egyptians and Nubians lived and worked side by side, combining aspects of both cultures. Although it comes as no surprise that Egyptian representation is dominant within a colonial site like Sai, a localJulia Budka Professor of Egyptian Archaeology traceable as well. The pottery attests to individuals who identified themselves primarily as Egyptian officials and occupants of an Egyptian site, but may nevertheless have had family ties in Nubia and derive from a local group whose spe- cific cultural identity was never com- pletely abandoned, resulting in a very dynamic world in New Kingdom Sai. \"The most promising example of such \"colonial sites\" is the exceptionally well preserved town on Sai Island because of its long occupation period and its attested history as important site of the African Kingdom of Kerma.\" Currently busy with post-excavation work, the AcrossBorders project conducts a detailed assessment of architecture and material culture embedded in the environmental settings and landscape. The ongoing analysis will result in the reconstruc- tion of aspects of daily life on a regional level, but will also include new information about the historicalcontext of Egyptian towns set up in Nubia, thus combining research questions on the micro-level with the macro-level.

More- over, innovation is important for addressing global challenges, such as climate change and sustainable development. The importance of the socio-eco- nomic eect of investments in scientic research is reflected in the international competitiveness of the state and in the living and cultural standards of the population. However, despite the importance of innovation, many countries face diculties in strengthening perform- ance in this area. During the Slovak Presidency of theCouncil of the European Union, we tried to use the oered opportunity to promote European science and research, and Slovakia's contribution in these areas, by showcasing sectors that we consider especially impor- tant and benecial. We have laid down a number of priorities in this sphere - support for young researchers, increasing the attrac- tiveness of the scientic professions, improving the framework conditions for researchers in the European Union with regard to their eect on employment, growth, the economy and competitiveness, and inten- sication of relations between the EU and the European Space Agency. Peter Plavan, ninister of Hducation, Science, Research and Sport shares how the Slovak Republic strengthened innovation during its HU Council Presidency SCIENCE & RESEARCH 137Innovation brings competitiveness It is evident that innovation is the key to ensuring the competitiveness of European states in a globalised marketplace. Innovation is the result of scientists and researchers nding new solutions to problems, both old and new. It is vital to the interests of the EuropeanUnion that it provides the broadest possible support for highly qualied specialists who make up one of our most important forms of capital. It will be necessary toincrease eorts to promote careers in the sciences and other benecial professions because they are notrespected enough in many cases, nor do they oer a direct career ladder. It gives me a strong sense of satisfaction that despite often working in more dicult conditions than their colleagues abroad, Slovak researchers manage to compete with the best in the world in some areas, for example within research of materials and nanotech- nology, ICT, biomedicine and biotechnology, environ- ment, and sustainable energy, etc. We can also be proud that our researchers and local companies are making an active contribution totoday's largest infrastructure projects such as CERN orthe European x-ray free electron laser (European XFEL). I consider this another step in the right direction thatSlovakia became a cooperating state of the European Space Agency a few months ago since this does notonly open the way for us to participate in high-level technological research, but also has a growing influence in everyone's daily life. In recent years, the EU's structural funds have funded the construction of a number of science parks at Slovak universities and the Slovak Academy of Sciences. They provide a good foundation and essential infrastructure for further progress. Now we face the challenge of maintaining development of these facilities and attracting the best specialists to work there. This includes young scientists at the doctoral or post-doctoral level, who often have trouble nding research opportunities in Slovakia and frequently go abroad to look for better conditions. We would be very glad if these centreswere able to oer researchers interesting opportunities to enable them to stay in Slovakia as well as attractingforeign researchers. The Slovak Academy of Sciences is also going through changes. An act to transform its institutes into public research institutions was drafted a while ago. In my view, it should be passed as soon as possible to increasethe competent areas of research and development that can be explored, and to interlink the public and private sector with the aim of generating new institutional and social forms for the production, transfer and application of knowledge. I hope that these activities that we plan to implement will not only increase the attention given to science and research here in Slovakia, but also promote our results and our potential on the European level. That is some- thing that we would all benet from. Peter Plavan Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic www.minedu.sk Electronics and photonics have been identified as the key enabling technologies that have a tremendous impact on innovation in our life. Today there is no industrial or societal branch which is not armed by micro/nano-electronics and/or pho- tonics structures, devices and smart systems. They provide various equip- ment, technology lines, automotive and transportation networks, with significant smart abilities enabling them to control the functional capabil-ity. They are an integral part of systemsfor energy harvesting, to supply autonomous communications plat-forms and systems, as well as systems for monitoring the quality of the environment. The Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STUBA), is the oldest techni- cal university in Slovakia. It is attended by around 15,000 students and belongs to the leading university in micro/nano-electronics and photonics education and R&D activities in the new EU member states. The Institute of Electronics and Photonics (IEP), Fac- ulty of Electrical Engineering and Infor- mation Technology of STUBA is very active in advanced key semiconductor technologies. Its activities are ensured by complex involvement of new inno- vative solutions based on smart elec- tronic, sensory and photonic systems for a bigger competitiveness, as well as for a better quality of life in a field of health, wellness, and the environment. Corresponding long-term effort bringsa lot of knowledge and experience which are immediately implemented into related curricula in electronics, particularly in master's and PhD stud- ies, which are unique in Slovakia and serve as a platform for the interna- tional exchange of students within pro- grammes such as ERASMUS. Micro/nano-electronics at STUBA The technology line for preparation of micro/nano-electronics structures is very costly, therefore we concentrate more on the measurement, character- isation and parameters evaluation, as well as on device design including 2/3D electro thermal modelling and simulation. The IEP is mostly oriented on design, characterisation and parameters extraction of selected semiconductor structures and devices supported by 2/3D electro thermal modelling and simulation. Such simulation is impor- tant particularly for power devices where the generated heat is signifi- cant and its distribution through the chip may strongly influence device properties. We have developed numerical tools for fast electro ther- mal simulation with calibrated param- eters of the device models for Si and GaN based structures. The results of modelling and simulation are useful not only for design and prediction of the properties of new structures, devices and systems, but also for the identification of origin and locations of defect regions. The simulatedresults are compared with experimental electrical characteristics, which com- pared with optical and analytical char- acteristics provide complex view and identification of defects and critical regions on the analysed samples. IC design uses the EUROPRACTICE services, targeted the ultra-low energy IC design on a chip, IC design for energy harvesting as well as fullcustom (ASIC) and semi-custom (FPGA) circuit particularly for smart systems. Chip testing, measurement, character-isation and evaluation are the integral part of our work in IC design. In sensory IEP is involved in new types of sensors using either the metal oxides for gas sensors or sensor arrays, or sensors based on diamondand graphene nanostructures. Themain focus in metal-oxide sensors is given to design, preparation and pro- cess optimisation by special surface treatment with sensors on a minia- turised heat platform and integrated read-out electronics. The results are then used in international collabora- tion on solutions for research grants and/or as the innovations of industrial partners, implementing them as thegas sensor arrays for measurement asa concentration of carbon like gases. Organic electronics. Problems of an ageing society is not only the issue of decreasing working populations, it is also the need to sup- port the overall level of healthcare.Slovak University of Technology's Professor Daniel Donoval highlights the scope as well as the influence of electronics and photonics in the modern worldElectronics and photonics: Key enabling technologies 138PROFILEOrganic electronics have gained tremendous research interest for applications not only in electronic devices such as organic light-emittingdiodes (OLEDs), or organic solar cells, but also in the growing field of wear- able sensors. Organic electronics pro- vides flexible, low-cost, biocompatible, and roll-to-roll mass production that makes it attractive for manufacturers of wearable sensors. Besides this fundamental research of organic materials, thin film fabrication technologies and the optoelectronic device properties, the research is also focused on sensor applications. Mea- suring electrocardiographic (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) bio signals, skin moisture monitoring, heart rate variability (HRV) monitoring, respirom- etry, etc. on a daily basis can be essen- tial for tracking the health of patients, professional athletes, fitness trainees and professionals, and so forth. Photonics Photonics has been identified as a key technology with far reaching influ- ences in communications, transporta- tion, medicine, manufacturing, construction, computing, and defence. Photonics research at IEP has long- term experiences in optoelectronics devices design, processing and characterisation of semiconductor PIN photodiodes, LEDs, OLEDs and lasers. Present research is oriented around obtaining a new knowledge in the development of micro/nano-structures up to nanowires (1D) and nanoparti- cles (0D) for realisation of new opto- electronic and photonic devices based on their unique properties. The inves- tigated structures are fabricated at IEP and within partner institutions, coop- eration is based on mostly GaAs, GaN, ZnO and their alloys, as well as new organic semiconductors. Inthe terms of recent research activities, a universal nanowire platform based on nanowires completely filled with an optically active shell layer is solved for interdisciplinary applications. Struc- tural, electrical and optical properties of prepared micro and nanostructures are studied in the terms of heterojunc- tion analysis, technology process opti- misation and photonic crystals (PhC) of different modifications on surface or in the devices. These are applicable in all LED, OLED, photodetectors, solar cells, silicon nano photonics, and hybrid organic-inorganic photonic integrated circuits, with the orientation on enhancement of total device and system efficiency. Industrial and International collaboration The well-equipped laboratories, expertise and enthusiasm of institute staff ensure a successful project solu- tion. The 10 experienced professors are supported by about 25 post-docs and PhD students. Active participation in international research projects in frameworks and ECSEL JU projects (about 10 projects), as well as about 15 national projects attract and stabilise young people. Dissemination of obtained results is ensured by their publication in scientific journals and conference proceedings. Collaborationwith companies, particularly SME, organisation of conferences, work- shops and transfer of innovation technologies is another means of dissemination activities. Based on the presented technologies and results, it is clear that IEP STUBA belongs to the leading European insti- tutions and contributes to further development, supporting the leadingrole of Europe in the mentioned key enabling technologies.

In 1939, it was assigned to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and under SpanishHistorical Heritage Law, it was declared a \"Historic andArtistic Garden\" in 1985. After so many years, the garden still considered itself an institution of learning, research and reformation. Feeling bolstered by the change in location to further its activities, it took advantage of the situation to brighten up Madrid, placing itself in a privileged position for the capital's future urban planning programme. Nowadays, the Botanical Garden is a scientic institution, consisting of grounds where both wild and ornamental plants arecultivated. In essence it has 3 major functions: scientic research, conservation, and display & education. The site, located on Madrid's so-called 'Mile of Culture', is surrounded by the city's most prestigious art galleries, and is host to over 420,000 visitors every year. Research at the Garden The scientic aspect of the garden is perhaps what identies it best and is the only aspect that has been maintained since its beginnings. It started o as an orchard dedicated to the study of medicinal and food plants. Nowadays, research at the Botanic Garden ranges from the elds of floristics (the study of plants in a given region) and plant taxonomy (awareness ofthe diversity and evolution of a particular group ofplants), to those of ecology and conservation, etc. All these studies also require the use of a herbarium, where dried plants, collected from natural populations, are organised methodically and labelled with data on their collection, etc. In addition, studies also use labo- ratories with varying levels of complexity.The task of dissemination is also intrinsic to this type of gardens, in exhibiting a collection of living plants to the public, as in the case of recording, by properly organising and labelling, the diversity of the plant kingdom is best presented. All of this is combined with the responsibility of protect- ing endangered plants in their host environments, growing them in ideal environments, safeguarding their seeds so they do not lose their ability to germinate, and studying the biology of reproduction to be able to implement recovery programmes. The resulting interrelation between all these elements is what denes day to day activities at the Royal Botanic Garden. There are 2 sides to daily work: on one hand-and open to the public- are the 8 hectares of gardens, and on the other is the scientic and research work carried out in the Herbarium, the Archive, the Library, the research laboratories and the Germplasm Bank. Events The garden has a variety of areas than can be used to hold events: The Function Suite, The Bonsai House, the Plane-Tree Square, the Chestnut Square, and the Vil- lanueva Pavilion, few of which were originally designed for their current purpose. Therefore, in many cases, aseries of quite dierent approaches are required when it comes to the designing, assembling, and producing an event, compared with other purpose-built venues. The garden's areas have evolved over the years within their surroundings and which, today, oer the possibility to hold events not only of an academic or scientic nature, but in fact of any nature, provided both theimmediate surroundings as well as the garden's normal activities are unaected and respected.Julia Gil Hern\u00e1ndez, Head of Protocol- Royal Botanic Garden, (CSIC), shares how the Royal Botanic Gardens in Madrid are a key centre for researchSCIENCE & RESEARCH 141Each application to organise an event which reaches the Royal Botanic Garden must be mindful of these pre- requisites. Appreciating the technical characteristics ofthe space which will be used is not enough- it is also necessary to know its constraints. The approach taken in setting up an event is influenced by many factors,from the weather to the arrival times of school visits. The greater the involvement with its surroundings, themore successful the event. In terms of the nature of events currently organised at the garden, these can be classied as follows: in-house,private, and collaborations. The theme of any given event can be classied as sci- entic, educational, cultural, social or institutional, with a clearly dierentiated nuance compared with the con- tent of a private function given that things may dier considerably, varying from marketing to commercial, and from charitable to leisure. However, all these variables share a common character- istic in that they reflect the cultural, social and academicactivity of the day. Taking the above into account, we can appreciate that the characteristics which dene the institution as a centre of investigation dedicated to the study of botanyare those which, since its origins, have bestowed the centre with a special uniqueness in the celebration of events which have taken place on its premises. One might say that the excellence in the results of the events celebrated in the Royal Botanic Garden lies inits very own raison d'\u00eatre. The marked element of public service, its intrinsic dedication to the teaching of botany and its own natural environment have,throughout its history, permitted the centre to keep itsphilosophy intact. The contents of its events have always reflected the social, scientic, political and economic context of the era, and, as one might expect, this remains so today. The rules applicable to the management of the zones and the strict compliance to regulations have been the factors that have allowed the same philosophy to be maintained since its beginnings. On most occasions this rigor has been maintained thanks to the responsibility and professionalism of its organisers. The decision to hold an event in the Botanic Garden may produce an initial impression of limitation or inconvenience, given the venue's specically unusual setting. Although, if treated correctly, this novelty becomes its real strength. Julia Gil Hern\u00e1ndez Head of Protocol - Royal Botanic Garden Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) www.csic.eswww.twitter.com/CSIC SCIENCE & RESEARCH 142Promoting science and higher education in Portugal Education and science in Portugal go hand in hand. With science steadily progressing over the last 20 years, the government in Portugal is keen to encourage research within the country further. According to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Educa- tion in Portugal, internationalisation within these 3 areashas shown an unprecedented growth in recent decades. This is believed to be down to increasing numbers of stu- dents studying in Portugal, as well as researcher mobility. The Portuguese government has acknowledged the pre- vailing role of higher education institutions and research centres, as places for knowledge production and shar-ing. Hence, by spurring innovation, they contributetowards social, cultural and economic development. Manuel Heitor, Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education in Portugal, (who served as Secretary of State of Science, Technology and Higher Education between 2005 and 2001) is also a Professor at Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, where he directs the Centre for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research, which he founded in 1998 . On top of this, he works for the European network step4EU , science, technology, education and policy for Europe, who aim \"to create and promote an independ- ent and credible international network to help improvescience, technology and higher education policies andbudgets across Europe\". In June 2016, Minister Heitor introduced a workshop at the OECD , whose goal was to discuss the terms of reference for an OECD review to Portugal Science, Technology and Higher Education. A new direction for science and higher education in Portugal In his introduction, the Minister said: \"A new direction for science, technology and higher education policies is critical to strengthening countercyclical measures stimulating the necessary knowledge-driven conditions for Portugal to evolve and better use its strategic Atlantic positioning\". He went on to argue that political actions and policies adopted over the period 2012 to 2015 caused \"the level of support for attracting young researchers from abroad to work in Portugal\" to be \"considerably reduced\". The Minister believes that \"internationalising the knowledge base\" is an essential part of this new direction for science and higher education policies. The implications of this on Portugal's policy making are categorised by Heitor as: People, Institutions, and Incentives. People: A human potential building program in science and technology in all areas of knowledge and including doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships, as well as strengthening the hiring of PhDs and scientic employment. Institutions: Enhancing autonomy, promoting diversity and modernising scientic and higher education insti- tutions should be considered as a matter of priority, to guarantee an institutional framework of international reference and to facilitate its diversication along with specialisation and the rejuvenation of the teaching sta of our institutions.Open Access Government highlights how science and higher education in Portugal are helping to turn the country into a knowledge hub for future generationsSCIENCE & RESEARCH 143Incentives: Strengthening public and private R&D expenditure, including competitive grants for projects and R&D ideas, as well as business R&D in cooperation with scientic institutions. The future of Portugal requires more knowledge and scientic culture, ensuring access to science and education as an inalienable right of all. More science and the systematic democratisation of accessto knowledge means more equal opportunities, more social mobility and a new stimulus for entrepreneurial activities in Portugal. Study and research in Portugal In order to achieve this, and to internationalise science, technology and higher education, it is imperative that Portugal encourages foreign students to study and research in what is seen as a hub for creativity and innovation. Heitor, along with Ana Mendes Godinho, the Secretary of State of Tourism, and the General Direction of Higher Education, the Foundation for Science and Technologyand the Tourism of Portugal, have launched an initiative called Study and Research in Portugal . The programme illustrates the country's commitment to knowledge, creativity and innovation. The Study and Research in Portugal website lists 10 reasons why foreign students and researchers should study in Portugal. 1 Quality learning - Portugal has 132 higher education institutions, which feature in the world's top rankings. 2 Research for the future - Portugal is the home of 307 research and development centres, who are at the forefront of exploring knowledge from social sciences to engineering or life sciences. 3 Connecting the world - 12% of Portugal's higher education students are foreign students. Thousands of foreign students and researchers of over 200 nation-alities contribute to a diverse ecosystem. 4 Travelling for knowledge - Portuguese Higher Educa- tion Institutions and Research Centres understand crossing knowledge as a way of breaking down barriers for opening up to new paths to progress and modernity.5 Knowledge for all - 35 times increased scientic production in the last 25 years, as well as 45 times the increased number of patents registered in Europe inthe last 25 years. 6 Creativity and innovation - Portugal has 31,000 new start-ups a year, many of which are recognised across the world. Several of these were incubated in a stimulating higher education institution environment, in Portugal. 7 Sport and culture - Portuguese higher education institutions host hundreds of clubs and associations that foster sports, arts and cultural activities which allow you to meet people who are excited about sharing their interests. 8 Learn Portuguese - Portuguese is the fourth most spoken language, with 215 million native speakers, and 260 total speakers worldwide. As well as this, Portuguese is the ocial or working language of 32 international organisations. 9 People who care for you - Portugal has an open cul- ture which connects people. For Immigrants integra- tion, Portugal is the \"2nd best country in the world, and with a population famous for openness and diversity. 10 Authentic life - On average, Portugal gets 3000 hours of sun per year, and it is the home of 850km of sandy beaches. Along with aordable living and great work-life balance, Portugal comes top in great places to live. The Study and Research in Portugal programme urges students and researchers to be curious, learn, think Science, and choose Portugal. With 39,500 researchers currently working in Portugal, the government arekeen to expand that further and grow the country into a leader of higher education and research. Georgina RyanWriter Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.orgwww.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov Regulated cell death (RCD) is under tight genetic control, allowing a cell to trigger its own suicide. Apoptosis, the best-charac- terised RCD process, is crucial to eliminate damaged cells, avoid virus spreading from infected cells, and maintain tissue homeostasis. When the latter is compromised, different human pathologies often arise, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Until recently, due to a per- ceived beneficial role only to multicel- lular organisms and to the difficulty in finding orthologues of the core mam- malian cell death machinery, apopto- sis was thought to be confined to higher eukaryotes. However, a largebody of evidence emerged in the late nineties supporting a physiological role for apoptosis, as well as otherforms of RCD, in lower eukaryotes such as the baker\u00b4s yeast Saccha- romyces cerevisiae. The added advantage of easy handling and genetic tractability, including the ectopic expression of human genes while preserving their functional role and without interference from the mammalian complex regulatory net- work, makes yeast a powerful and suitable model organism to approach key questions on cell death and its deregulation in humans. This fostered the field of yeast cell death, which we embraced from the early beginning, since we believed it offered greatpotential to highlight molecular mech- anisms underlying death processes and their regulation. Cell death research As a result of several years of research in this field, we identified common features between mitochondria and vacuolar/lysosomal death pathways in yeast and mammals, contributing to the recognition that RCD is highly con- served. Specifically, we found a novel process contributing to apoptotic cell death in yeast associated with the release of the vacuolar protease Pep4p, the yeast cathepsin D ortho- logue, and that we later validated in mammalian cells , leading to the pro- posal of a novel role for this protease in colorectal carcinoma. In another recent study, stemming from previous studies with yeast, we identified the plasmmalemal V-ATPase of highly metastatic cells as the molecular target of lactoferrin, which underlies its selec- tivity against highly metastatic cells, allowing a more rational use of this natural compound in cancer therapy. These are 2 major breakthroughs which illustrate the potential of the yeast model to unveil novel roles of a cell death regulator and the mechanism of action of an antitumoral compound, and which fuel innovation in the design of new therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with deficient cell death mechanisms, such as cancer.

The endeavour to pioneer change through scientic discovery is one that has existed all the way back to ancient times andshows little sign of abating. Today, research undoubtedly has a pivotal role to play in society. Thanks to the work of scientists there are cures for diseases that once killed thousands, mobile phones are more powerful than computers were 40years ago and cars are driving themselves. In the U.S., the National Science Foundation (NSF) has responsibility for research progression and supports basic research. As an independent federal agency, its mission is \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defence...\" Research has a vital part to play in U.S. society. It drivesthe economy and enhances the security of the nation.With a budget totalling $7.5bn during 2016, the NSF funds around 24% of all federally supported basic research carried out at high education facilities across the U.S. Driving innovation requires solid funding In an increasingly technological based society funding research remains vital to ensure advancement. Despite this fact the U.S. increased the overall amount of money for research during 2015, but reduced it for research and development (R&D). According to data published in April this year , R&D and R&D plant (facilities and xed equipment) funding reached a total of $131.4bn in 2015. The analysis, which was carried out by the National Center for Sci- ence and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), found that within the R&D total, the value of research obligations (described as orders placed, contracts awarded, andservices received) rose by 1% to $63.6bn, but develop- ment funding dropped by 4% to $64.9bn. There was also a 27% increase in R&D plant funding to $2.8bn. The report focused on the top federal agencies, among which was the NSF. The analysis revealed that the NSF's research obligations increased by 5% during 2015, reach- ing $5.7bn. A total of 88% of the NSF's research obliga- tions went towards supporting basic research. Furthermore, the analysis found that support for all science and engineering elds was more evenly distrib- uted by the NSF than any other agency. The datashowed 21% of NSF funding was spent on environmen- tal 18% went towards mathematics and com- engineering research; 16% for physical sciences; and 12% to advance life sciences. Support is key This year, U.S. Congress showed its support for science and research by announcing plans to increase federal spending on R&D by 5% as part of a new scal 2017 budget deal. The deal will see total spending on R&D rise to $155.8bn for the scal year that ends 30 Sep- tember. This news will undoubtedly be welcomed by all agencies, including the NSF. Supporting research remains imperative and organisa- tions such as the NSF have a pivotal role to play in this. However, the U.S. government must remain focused on the bigger picture and ensure they throw their supportbehind an area that has the potential to change the world as we know it. Open Access Government highlights the work of the National Science Foundation and reveals the importance of continued funding for research and development Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovThe system of non-wearable environ- ment sensors includes a bed sensor that captures heart rate, respiration rate, bed restlessness, and sleep patterns, while positioned discretely under the mattress2. For couples, a sensor is positioned under each side of the bed. In-home gait analysis is accomplished with a depth sensorthat extracts three-dimensional silhou- ettes of individuals moving through the home. Independent models of walking speed, stride time, and stride length are learnt for each resident of the home 3. Passive infrared motion sensors are positioned around the home to capture room-specificmotion, as well as an overall pattern of motion activity (activity density) 4. For each of these sensing systems, advanced machine learningapproaches are utilised to identify patterns that are tracked over time to establish typical patterns for each indi- vidual and recognise when the patterndeviates. The system of sensors and automated health alerts has been tested in several senior housing sites in the U.S. for over 5 years. Recent work is also testing the system in private homes. Examples of health changes detected automatically include urinary tract infections, respi- ratory infections, increasing conges- tive heart failure, pain post hospitalisation, depression, delirium, and low blood sugar. Studies show that the system of sensors and health alerts enables seniors to stay 1.7 years longer in independent housing, com- pared to a control group that did not have the technology 5. The key is that early treatment can be offered due toProactive healthcare is made possible through passive monitoring, which detects very early signs of health problemsTechnology for proactive healthcare 146PROFILE The traditional reactive healthcare model is well-known. Typically, patients initiate a doctor's visit when they feel sick (sometimes very sick). Although many people seek health check-ups periodically, often health changes are not caught until they become serious health problems. This particularly affects older adults with chronic health conditions. With delayed treatment, many health problems escalate, resulting in hospitalisations. The result is that older adults and others with chronic health conditions decline, losing functionality, which in turn may lead to a loss of independence and a move to a skilled nursing facility. Proactive healthcare using new vital signs For over 10 years, the Center for Elder- care and Rehabilitation Technology at the University of Missouri has been investigating technology solutions that facilitate proactive healthcare, espe- cially targeting our ageing population. We have developed an in-home sensor system that functions as a clinical deci- sion support system for recognising early signs of illness and functional decline. The system learns a person- alised model of each resident in the home and sends health alerts to clinical care coordinators when the pattern deviates, indicating a possible change in health status1. Clinicians receiving the health alerts are trained to interpret the alerts with the help of an interactive web interface for viewing information extracted from the sensors.very early detection of health changes, before the health condition escalates. The effect on the older adults is improved functional ability, thereby changing the trajectory of aging. A vision for the future Although the in-home sensor system has been shown to work well for clini- cal decision support, our vision for thefuture extends its use in several direc- tions. First, we envision its integration into the healthcare ecosystem that includes primary care clinics, hospitals, and electronic health records (EHRs). Health-relevant sensor data from the home should be used to inform diag- nosis and treatments in clinics and hospitals. Similarly, in-home sensor data can provide useful monitoring when the patient returns home from a hospitalisation, to help track recupera- tion. EHRs can aid in proactively moni-toring transitions into and out of the hospital. Existing EHRs should be linked to sensor databases, to provide context in the automated analysis of the sensor data. Clinicians should also be able to view new vital signs from the sensor data using electronic interfaces. Secondly, the data from this integrated system should be accessible for data mining. A large scale implementation would facilitate the learning of new population-based models that can be tailored to individuals, especially per- tinent for a variety of chronic health conditions. These models would help in the automated interpretation of tracked health trajectories to better inform health alerts. For example, imagine a system that recognises the specific trajectories of urinary tract infections or heart failure complica- tions. We envision the existing clinicaldecision support as an extended system. Currently, it prompts the care coordinator to take a closer look at an individual. An extended system would provide suggestions for possible health problems and what to do next. A validated system of this sophistica- tion would allow its use more broadly with clinicians who may have limited experience or training. \"With delayed treatment, many health problems escalate, resulting in hospitalisations. The result is that older adults and others with chronic health conditions decline, losing functionality, which in turn may lead to a loss of independence and a move to a skilled nursing facility.\" Third, our vision extends the use to con- sumers and their informal caregivers for improved self-management of chronic health conditions. This espe- cially opens significant challenges in how to convey the information for accu- rate and meaningful interpretation. Our interdisciplinary team has begun to work on parts of this vision. We have developed a prototype system for linking the sensor data with an EHR, for the purpose of improving the automated health alerts by bringing in contextual information on medica- tions and health status. The linkagealso facilitates automated data mining to learn more detailed health trajecto- ries related to specific health changes. We have begun to derive models of health trajectories for common ailments challenging older adults. Finally, we are also investigating meth- ods to summarise the large volume of data into easy-to-interpret linguistic forms 6. These new developmentsmove closer to our vision and offer the potential for significant impact in maintaining health and well-being. References 1 Skubic M, Guevara RD & Rantz M. (2015).

This is especially pertinent given the uncertain economic and politicaloutlook following the UK's decision to leave the EU. Accreditation is a tool for ensuring the competence of organisations to carry out one or more specied assessment tasks. Its raison d'etre is to provide con-dence for consumers, purchasers and regulators in thegoods and services they use. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is the Government appointed National Accreditation Body for the UK. Its role is to check that organisations providing conformity assessment services such as certication, testing,inspection and calibration services, are meeting a required international standard of performance. Maintaining standards There are hundreds of standards and disciplines that can be underpinned by accreditation, with perhapscertication being the most relevant to business operation. The most commonly used are ISO 9001 forQuality Management Systems and the EnvironmentalManagement Systems standard ISO 14001. There are many other aspects of business life that can be certied, including Products, Personnel, Information Security, IT Services and Occupational Health & Safety. Companies big and small use independent conformityassessment services either through choice (e.g. to reduce the risk of product failure) or as a consequenceof legal requirements (e.g. health and safety regulations). Beyond satisfying the legal requirements in certain industry sectors, accreditation also oers market dier- entiation and shows credible evidence of best practice. Lowering barriers to trade Accreditation is a global activity that delivers certaintyin uncertain times, creating trust on a world platform. Navigating dierent national regulatory regimes canbe a stumbling block for UK companies, especially when dealing with testing and inspection require- ments. From the outset we have been instrumental in the adoption of mutual recognition agreements that provide for the international acceptance of certicates issued by UKAS and accredited organisations in over 90 dierent economies. This \"accredited once accepted everywhere\" approach avoids unnecessary duplication of conformity assess- ment, saving an organisation time and money, thus making a major contribution to UK trade. It also helpsto develop international trade by facilitating the accept- ance of goods and services across national borders and lowering technical barriers to trade. Post Brexit trade Despite the result of the EU referendum, UKAS does not expect its international the status and the status of certicates issued by accredited organisations to change in the foreseeable future. Whilst the situation followingthe UK's exit from the EU will depend on the terms of anyagreements negotiated, we expect the international recognition of our certicates to continue through our membership of the European co-operation of Accredita- tion, the International Laboratory Accreditation Co-oper- ation and the International Accreditation Forum. Indeed, given the new trade agreements needed, accreditation is likely to assume even greater importance as we move forward to a post-Brexit world. Malcolm Hynd, External Affairs Manager, UKAS, considers how accreditation will assume greater significance for trade after the UK withdraws from the EU Malcolm Hynd External Service accredits testing, calibration, inspection and certification organisations against national and international standards. UKAS accreditation provides confidence in the competence, impartiality and performance capabilityof these evaluating organisations. Government and businesses rely on UKAS accredited organisations to provide confidence across a widerange of activities including food safety, quality andenvironmental management, energy efficiency, health and social care and building regulation. UKAS accreditation also facilitates trade. Certificates issued by UKAS and UKAS accredited organisations are recognised across Europe and internationally through a number of mutual recognition agreements. Goods and services covered by these certificates do not need to be retested, inspected and certified for each newexport market.

This objective will not be easy to reach, but we believe that it is possible to achieve by 2050. The challenge is particularly huge in the energy sector.Approximately 80% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Finland come from energy production and consump- tion, when energy used for transport is included. Much of this is due to the cold climate and long distances as is widely known. In addition to a carbon-neutral society, Finland's energy policy focuses equally on safeguarding energy supplies under all conditions and maintaining and improving the nation's ability to compete in international markets. All these 3 goals must be kept in balance on this journey. How to become carbon-neutral In 2014, a Parliamentary Committee on Energy and Climate Issues published an \"Energy and ClimateRoadmap 2050\". The roadmap focuses particularly on energy production and energy systems/infrastructures, energy consumption, other sectors, and cross-sectoral activities. In order to meet the targets set for reducing emissions, the energy system must be changed virtually emission-free by 2050. In working towards the goal ofreducing greenhouse gases by 80-95%, Finland must in any case increase the use of renewable energy sources - particularly domestic bioenergy - and capitalise on the potential of increasing energy eciency and developing cleantech solutions in all areas of industry. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change requires that during the latter half of the century the emissions andcarbon sinks must be in balance. Regarding in physicalterms, this balance can be reached even sooner, by2045, in Finland. This is when our forests would sequester all the fossil emissions generated in Finland.In the international context this would place Finland among the highly ambitious countries. Meeting the 2030 Energy and Climate targets The Finnish Government approved the National Energy and Climate Strategy to 2030 on 24 November 2016. The National Energy and Climate Strategy outlines the actions that will enable Finland to attain the targetsspecied in the Government Programme and adopted in the EU for 2030, and to systematically set the course for achieving an 8095% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. According to the guidelines, the share of renewable energy of nal energy consumption will rise to over 50% in the 2020s. The long-term goal is for the energy system to become carbon neutral and to be strongly based on renewable energy sources. In addition, the possibility to move into an economy completely based on renewably energy in 2050 has been assessed. Finland aims to phase out the use of coal for energy during the 2020s. New power plants or replacementRiku Huttunen, Director General, Energy Department at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment shares Finland's ambition to achieve carbon neutrality Riku HuttunenFINLAND FOCUS151investments that are based on burning coal must not be made. The complete discontinuation of using coal for energy will require strong tax steering or legally prohibiting the use of coal. During the current govern- ment term, a proposal will be prepared for an act onthe transition period of discontinuing the use of coal as an energy source by 2030, taking into account aspects related to the continuity and security of energysupply and emergencies. Measures to reduce emissions in transport involve mainly road transport, where there is the largest potential for emission reductions. The share of trans-port biofuels will be increased to 30%. The goal is for Finland to have a minimum total of 250,000 electric vehicles and a minimum of 50,000 gas fueled vehicles by 2030. The energy eciency of the transport systemwill be improved e.g. by developing new transport services, influencing modes of travel and transport and utilising intelligent transport methods. Domestic production of advanced transport biofuels using by- products of forest industry and forest chips will increase notably.The domestic use of imported oil will be halved during the 2020s, i.e. petrol, diesel, fuel oil as well as jet fuel and kerosene, compared to the total amount of energy in 2005. The greatest non-ETS sector reductions in emissions will be achieved in the transport sector.These operations will then directly reduce the energy use of oil. Also, measures proposed for the individual heating of buildings and for machinery are targeted to reducing the usage of oil. Riku Huttunen Director General of the Energy Department Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment www.tem.fi/en/frontpage www.twitter.com/tem_uutiset FINLAND FOCUSFusion energy is a CO2-free nuclear energy source with low environmental impact using ubiquitous fuels. Fusion electricity together with other energy sources could meet predicted energy supply shortages. On the basis of current research, fusion electricity using magnetically confined plasmas could be available in the second half of the century. ITER is the key facility in this strategy and the DEMO design, as well as the research and development (R&D) will benefit largely from the experience gained with ITER construc- tion and operation. EUROfusion Consortium is an organi- sation implementing the EURATOMfusion research programme in parallel to ITER construction. Finland joined the EURATOM fusion programme in 1995 when Finland became a member of the EU. Through participa- tion in the European fusion pro- gramme the national objective was to develop critical competence networks to major European organisations involved in developing fusion energy. As a small country Finland concen- trated its efforts on a small number of focus areas, plasma physics, material science, novel steel structures and remote handling. In 2004 Finland was chosen to host a remote handling laboratory, ITER Diverter Test Platform 2 (DTP2) in Tampere.FinnFusion Consortium During Horizon 2020, the FinnFusion Consortium was established in 2014 to replace Association Euratom-Tekes. VTTTechnical Research Centre of Finland Ltd is co-ordinator in the FinnFusion Consortium and science/technology universities and private companies are also members in the consortium. Finn- Fusion Consortium is linked to EURO- fusion Consortium via VTT. The roles of funding organisations and other key stakeholders are described in the FinnFusion organigram in Figure 1. The FinnFusion Consortium focuses on two centres of excellence, fusion power plant analysis and remote handling explains Dr Tuomas Tala. An essential objective of FinnFusion is the transfer of skills to industry. With this position, Finland remains strong in European fusion research and will take advan- tage of the synergy between fusion and fission expertise and their current separate networks. The main goal of the Power Plant Analyses and Materials and Remote Handling R&D Centres of Excellence within FinnFusion are the following: Foster the growth of expertise in fusion plant operation; know-how transfer to Finnish decision makers, industry involving SMEs, research units, universities and the public;Lead experiments in present fusion research facilities at ITER, JET (UK), ASDEX-U and US), US); Exploit the between fusion and fission R&D, such as require- ments and specifications for the ITER fusion plant simulator, radiation and reactor safety, the design phase of the so-called Early Neutron Source (for neutron resistant material project); Develop new technologies (e.g. surface processing techniques) and advanced materials (incl. steels) for fusion power plants; Develop systems engineering and remote handling skills. Systems engi- neering is a key method for upgrad- ing all kinds of industrial activity. The main achievements of the Finnish Fusion Programme (presently FinnFusion) in 1995 to 2016 can be summarised as follows: Starting from scratch in 1995, the R&D program has developed to the level of about 50 ppy/a, with around 150 internationally well-networked fusion experts involved in more than 30 companies and 6 research organisa- tions. This has enabled Finland to win ITER procurements, to learn and upgrade its competences, and toThe FinnFusion Consortium focuses on two centres of excellence, fusion power plant analysis and remote handling, explains Dr Tuomas Tala. An essential objective of FinnFusion is the transfer of skills to industryFinnFusion: Advancing fusion research in Finland 152PROFILEcreate networks both within industry and research organisations. After long-term investment in relevant R&D by various FinnFusion activities, Finnish companies and research organisations have gained access to several large international consortia responsible for ITER procurements. The characteristics and future of FinnFusion Finland is considered as a well- respected partner in the European fusion programme and therefore has committee members and leaders in many of the key positions. The peculiar and unique feature inFinnFusion, among the other Euro- pean fusion research units is the strong involvement of technology and industry in all fusion energy related activities. One example is the Diverter Test Platform 2 laboratory hosted by VTT and located in Tampere. In fact, there is knowledge and expertise on fusion technology in around 30 Finnish companies and FinnFusion is focusing more than half of its fusion research efforts on fusion technology and engineering related topics. In recent years, the fusion and fission research and existing industry around the fission infrastructure have been brought closer to each other and fruit- ful connections and synergy effects have been established. The other special feature in FinnFu- sion is the close collaboration of all participating members, including the research laboratories, funding agen- cies, authorities and private compa-nies. Therefore, as all bodies involved have a common goal in the organigram presented in Figure 1, the FinnFusion is an organisation functioning in an efficient way. ITER is a unique, and probably the most challenging scientific and tech- nological project ever accomplished on earth. Participation of FinnFusion in a very large international pro- gramme has major scientific, techno- logical and economic benefits. For Finnish industry and the researchunits, the ITER Project is an effective platform for developing expertise, networking and prestige. The level of new skills, technologies, expertise and networks are immeasurably high - FinnFusion must be proactive in exploiting all the benefits from the project. FinnFusion is well adapted to the ongoing change in the interna- tional trend from academic to project- oriented work. Strong connection to nuclear technology in line with theindustrialisation of fusion is being established right now. The future challenge is to further exploit these international networks and expertise to national benefits. In particular, the greatest challenge rightnow is to find national funding to complement the EU funded projects. FinnFusion is now at an all-time high of its life cycle in terms of the number of research activities, numbers of organisations involved and the mag- nitude of EU level funding - the future lies in the hands of national funding bodies and authorities on which level the national funding allows FinnFu- sion to harness the fruits of the hard work in future.

In the history of technological advancement of humankind, these are revolutionary technologies that have transformed - not only function- alities and efficiency of machines anddevices -but also structures and pro- cesses of local and global industrial production and delivery. Moreover, these technologies have transformed the everyday life of human beings, aswe have learnt from the internet,social media, intelligent traffic and digitalised welfare services that bene- fit from devices such as mobile phones, cars, computers, and refriger- ators, in everyday use of humans. This informs us about new methods of modern human life in a digital era. The ICT, clouds and digital technolo- gies have changed communication,information, and knowledge relations between all the economic, institu- tional and social actors, including indi- vidual humans. We argue that these technologies are relational and conse- quently structural by nature. They form a new relational infrastructure penetrating economic, social and human life. They also carry a strong potential of changing our perception of economic, social, and human structures, pro- cesses and relations. The World Eco- nomic Forum (2016) 1argues for the next industrial revolution that it builds on and benefits from digital plat-forms, and deals specifically with the information and knowledge of humans. This technological development may integrate physical, digital and biologi- cal spheres of life as it builds upon, develops and integrates digital tech- nologies with findings of social and human sciences, as well as with neu- roscience, bioinformatics, medicine, science of wellbeing, health analytics and other branches of sciences wherein the human information con- nection may be created with globally interactive and complex digital plat- form technologies. As we see, not only the economic and industrial structures, processes and relations are digitalised; the very same takes place deeply in relation to struc- tures, processes, and relations of social and human life. Both are under- going a strong 'technologisation'. The World Economic Forum foresees that this transformation will be unlike any- thing humankind has experienced before. Consequently, we argue that the issue is not only about economic or industrial efficiency and renewal; the issue is about the nature of the future of human life. We argue, however, that Europe has an opportunity to make a major con- tribution to a more human-centric social and economic development -even globally; Europe has a science, research and innovation policy for solving societal challenges through RDI (research, development and inno-vation, Horizon 2020, 3rd Pillar) in addition to science and technology (1st Pillar) and corporate RDI (2nd Pillar). By definition, Europe may be better positioned to address in a bal- anced way, the major societal chal- lenges of our time, many of them caused by overemphasising the role of finance and technology driven glob- alisation. Living Labs Europe has already gained encourag-ing experiences of human and user centric RDI related to ICT and digitali- sation. As early as 2006, during the Finnish EU Presidency and as a part of the official EU Presidency Programme, the European Network of Living Labs was launched on November 20th 2. By then, the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) included 20 actors from 16 European countries. The strategic goal of the network was to provide open innovation ecosys- tems in cities and regions where firms, academia, public agencies, developer communities and citizens could col- laborate in RDI for new ICT and digital services and business models. The collaboration included experi- mentation, piloting, validating and scaling up technologies, services and business models within thematic domains such as media, wellbeing services, energy efficiency, intelligent traffic, rural development and climate action. The network has even experi-Here, Seija Kulkki, of Aalto University School of Business discusses participative RDI for inclusive transformations and Europe's living labsIs this the second coming of living labs in Europe? 154PROFILEmented for inclusive collaboration where forms of participative RDI with people, developer communities, social networks, academia, cities, and public agencies take an initiative and even a drivers' seat for collaboration with firms for solving societal challenges. This has even taken the human life and nature as a 'centre for orientation', leading also towards more equalitarian value and wealth creation. Locally, the network has had a positive impact on participative democracy development. Today, the network includes over 400 open innovation ecosystems3in cities and regions; they are internationally networked and apply means of public and citizen engagement. This is a promising start, with the knowledge and experience of human-centric par- ticipative RDI between firms, academia, cities, regions, public agencies andpeople. Besides this network, there are a rich set of experiences of collab- orative RDI with citizens among others through smart cities, future cities and innovative regions' networks. However, we argue for a 'second coming' of human-centric and open innovation ecosystems such as the European Network of Living Labs(ENoLL). The 'second coming' should concentrate more on inclusive struc- tural transformations around health care and wellbeing services as a system, and around ageing popula- tions, social media, intelligent trafficand transportation, use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, climate action, participative democracy and even public and participative governance. However, this may imply that Europe may need to consider strengthening the institutional foundations for participative RDI and inclusive trans-formations; there may be a need for a new European-wide development fund and organisation which promotes and scales up human-centric and inclusive RDI concerning societal challenges in cities and regions. \"Europe has already gained encouraging experiences of human and user centric RDI related to ICT and digitalisation.

By then, the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) included 20 actors from 16 European countries.\" This also implies that cities and regions open their own RDI functions, and invest in related infrastructural, organisational and funding solutions. They also need to develop related skills and capabilities. Universities may reinterpret their perception and portfolio of sciences to include partic-ipative, open and citizen sciences and related innovations. This is a major change in an ongoing 'trajectory' within universities; we have seen social sciences and humanities to loose in the competition with natural sciences and technology. However, this also means that we interpret the content of social sci- ences and humanities to include open and citizen science and innovations, and even large-scale experimentation for piloting and validating with citizens and other stakeholders for new solutions of societal challenges. Uni- versities themselves may need to participate in social and economic development and learn to apply anddevelop participative methodologies, means of action research andmethodologies of societal challenge driven research designs and processes. Universities - perhaps with cities and regions - may even need to invest in new interactive, digital platform- based RDI infrastructures for interac- tion with citizens on a large scale for data collection, pattern building and even for discussion of RDI outcomes. We may need major transfer of resources and capabilities towards human-centric, as well as city and cit- izen driven collaborative RDI around societal challenges. This participative and all-inclusive RDI process may imply over time a new potential as major transformative process within societies - perhaps even for publicpolicy making. This may demonstrate how to substantiate the role and nature of human-centric participative democracy. 1 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution; what is means, how torespond: The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, Thursday 14, January 2016 2 Press release by Finland's EU Presidency: Helsinki Manifest: Launch of the European Network of LivingLabs in November 2006 3 EU: Conference on Open Innovation 2.0 in Amsterdam, May 23- 24, 2016 where the number of the European Networked Living Labs as regional or city -based open innovation ecosystems was announced Seija Kulkki Aalto University School of Business seija.kulkki@aalto.fi 155PROFILEEngineering and economics combined into one very specific profession are typically referred to as industrial management and engineering (IME). This article focuses specifically on the engineering degree in industrial management. There is ahuge difference between a business degree and an engineering degree in industrial management. Two very similar points of view for an IME degree are found from Germany (Wirtschaftinge- niur) and from Finland (Tuotanto- talous). These degrees are verydifferent to pure engineering degrees or pure business/economic degrees. IME graduates are engineers who have business, management, leadershipand communication studies integrated to their engineering studies. A pure engineering degree includes very few business and management studies, just as pure business or economic studies include very few engineering or natural sciences studies if any at all. Sales, procurement and production are key When simplifying, we found that sales, procurement, production and product development are the core operations in every business or public organisation. Without sales, there is no business done or no value created in a public organisation. All organisations need customers, and sales should be recog- nised to be the main operation when providing products or services to a customer. Production should be understood so that all organisationshave it. From an IME point of view, kindergartens, shipyards, a logistics company, machine workshops or hospitals all perform some sort of production. They produce value for the customers. No single company or organisation can produce value from nothing. Materials, energy, tools, machines, different accessories, sub- contractors and suppliers are all needed in their production. Therefore all organisations need procurement. All organisations provide products orservices. They are developed and they need to be further developed to stay competitive in future markets -to do this organisations need product development. When scrutinising anorganisa tion's situation and environ- ment more holistically, supply chains and value networks should be under- stood. These aspects and operationsare in the core of IME. Therefore, all of these subjects should be covered in IME education. Figure 1 illustrates crucial connections between these core operations: Sales and production have to synchronise their operations; when the orders can be delivered; and which batches are the most profitable are discussed, to name a few. Sales and product devel- opment are communicating all the time, as sales are giving market infor- mation to product development and the latter one is providing product knowledge and technical support to sales. In many cases the cost of the product or service consists of 60-80% outsourced materials and other pur- chased items or services, it is clear that sales and procurement should coordinate their operations tightly.The Business Competence and Process Management RDI-group outline how industrial management and engineering degrees could be valuable to many businesses throughout EuropeThe true value of industrial management and engineering 156PROFILE ProcurementCustomer's ManagementProcurement Management Product Development ManagementSupply Chain ManagementFigure 1 also shows that production and product development should cooperate constantly in order to keep developed products and services fea- sible to produce, and lead times as short as possible. Product develop-ment is also communication with pro- curement in order to keep products cost effective and ensuring short lead times. Product development is also probably the most crucial operation when thinking about the cost of the final product or service. Some studies have shown that 70% of the total cost is set in product development. As procurement has to ensure that pro- duction can run smoothly, withoutshortages from subcontractors or materials, these 2 operations should also coordinate their activities. As inmany cases, the majority of costs aregenerated in purchasing activities, procurement has a vital role in keep- ing organisation costs down. Aspects discussed above show that most ofthe efforts in IME education should be set to competencies including sales,procurement, production and product development. At the Turku University of Applied Sci- ences, in the industrial management and engineering degree programme students have compulsory basic stud- ies from all of the discussed subjects and they can choose 2 or 3 of these competence entities to study further. Every student also chooses which technical engineering they are focusing on. Possibilities vary from maritime engineering to bio and well-being technologies. This gives students the possibility to focus on very different competencies and positions. The value of European trade for IME engineers Despite the fact that all organisations should utilise IME engineers to develop their processes and operations, mostof the graduates go on to work for companies in the technology sector. When thinking about the value of European technical trade, it is easy to see the reason for this. The internal trade between the EU Member States had an annual value of over \u20ac3,063 billion in 2015. The EU's internal market mainly consisted of manufactured products. Their share was 80% of the total intra-EU goods export. Exports to regions outside the EU also consisted mainly of manufactured products. These products represented about 80% of the total annual EU exports. In 2013 the value of exported machin- ery, vehicles, and other manufactured goods reached \u20ac1,365 billion. Adding together the total value of technical intra-EU trade - more than \u20ac2,000 bil- lion (80% of total trade), and more than \u20ac1,300 billion extra EU-trade - gives a total of \u20ac3,300 billion of trade. These numbers are not counting sec- tors other than manufacturing and they are not counting member states internal trade. It is emerging that IME engineers are hired to hospitals and other non-technology industry organ- isations in growing numbers. This is because IME engineers are ideal for process development and other lead- ing positions in organisations. It is no coincidence that many Finnish pub- licly traded company CEO's have an M.Sc. in industrial management and engineering. When thinking about modern, com- plex value networks, at least in high- tech branches, but also in every public organisation it is quite clear that they need more professionals who are capable of communicating betweentechnology and business, as well as being able to manage these complex operations and coordinate their own. The European economy still needs many more hard-core engineers,economists and business profession-als, but this alone is not enough. There is a tremendous need for the interfaces between these profession- als and companies. At the same time, the number of interfaces is increasing exponentially when organisations are focusing on their core competencies i.e. more transactions are made, more organisations are developing their products and services and more organisations are producing their value. These trends require that more IME engineers are needed. They also need to ensure that all of the present students will have very promising career possibilities. As a conclusion, it can be stated that IME engineers are going to be the saviours of the Euro- pean economy.

Fol- lowing on from the meeting in Paris last Novem- ber, the Agreement that came into force will certainly be implemented in Finland. Minister of Agriculture and the Environment Kimmo Tilikainen believes that the country has every opportunity to serve as a model country in climate and energy policy. By 2050, the Finnish government aims to reduce emis- sions by 80 to 95% in comparison to the levels in 1990. According to their Energy and Climate Strategy, thereshould be 250,000 electric cars and 50,000 gas cars in use by 2030. As well as having at least a third of the road transport fuel coming from renewable sources bythe same period. Finland is by no means ambitious with their climate energy goals, and is making the most of available new solutions in order to achieve them, as well as boosting employment. \"In Finland this balance can be reached sooner, in 2045 at the latest,\" says Minister Tiilikainen. \"This is when our forests would sequester all the fossil emissionsgenerated in Finland. \"In the international context, this would place Finland among the highly ambitious countries. Of the other countries, Sweden for example, has set similar targets.\" A balancing act The Paris Agreement means that by the latter half of the century, emissions and carbon sinks must be in balance. Ambitious Finland is in no doubt this can be achieved. With regards to forest sinks, the country is one of the top countries in the EU. Their forests gener- ate around 30% of the annual emissions in Finland. Due to sustainable forest management, which pro-motes the growth of woodlands, the carbon sinks will remain high in years to come and the government is aiming for them to be back to the current level in 2035. \"About a decade ago, several paper and pulp mills wereclosed down in Finland,\" says Tiilikainen. \"Now new investments and increased use of wood are bringing signicant numbers of jobs and boosting our exports and national economy. \"Actions should be targeted to wood building, which sequesters carbon on a long-term basis, and new inno- vations. Together with the other Nordic countries, we can be the trailblazers of ambitious climate policy.\" Achieving climate goals Finland has a great commitment to sustainable development and achieving these climate goals. In 2015, the Minister placed great emphasis on water and its important role in the 2030 Sustainable Develop-ment Agenda. \"The conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity can provide solutions to a wide range of societal challenges,\" the Minister stressed. Speaking in New York in 2015, Minister Tiilkinainensaid: \"Water sustains life - it is essential for people and the planet. Therefore, water is a crucial element in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as aseparate goal and as a cross-cutting issue. \"Water aects poverty eradication and is a crore elementin healthy lives and well-being, as well as, in gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. Water is essential within the framework of sustainable manage- ment of natural resources and with regard to our ght against climate change.Editor Laura Evans outlines how Finnish Minister of Agriculture and the Environment Kimmo Tilikainen is taking on the fight against climate changeFINLAND FOCUS159\"Consequently, it is important for sustainable economic growth. In addition water has a strong security aspect.\" Declining biodiversity In Cancun last year, the Minister stressed the need for more to be done for the well-being of biodiversity. Speaking at a High Level Luncheon Event on Biodiversity and Sustainable Development in Mexico, Tiilikainen called for a wide approach to tackle the decline of bio- diversity. His address also concentrated on the role of sustainable management of commercial forests. \"The conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity can provide solutions to a wide range of societal challenges,\" the Minister stressed. \"In Finland, the outlines for targets and actions concen- trating the commercial forests are brought together in our National Forest Strategy 2025. It integrates all forest-related targets that come from dierent inter- national, EU and national strategies and programmes. \"They cover biodiversity, sustainable development, energy and climate, as well as rural and regional policies.\" Policies such as these are integral to ensure Finland continues on its goal for sustainable economic growth. As well as ghting against climate change, the country is showing its commitment to the surrounding environ- ment, such as biodiversity, forests and water. All three elements are key factors in Finland's objective to be a model country with regards to climate and energy. Laura EvansEditor Open Access at the University of Oulu combines versatile and cross-sectorial research expertise on treating arctic water and wastewater streams in a sustainable manner. The knowhow is adapted globally also to areas charac- terised by drought and high reser- voirs constitute 3% of the planet\u00b4s water deposits. The proportion is decreasing due to climate change effect, growing needs of human popu- lations, and frequently occurring soil and water contaminations. In the Northern hemisphere, freshwater is deposited as snow and ice layers in addition to surface and groundwater basins. Finland located in the Arctic Circle is known for the thousands of lakes and rivers which run into nearby seas, mainly the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Faculty of Technology, University of Oulu The University of Oulu is located in Northern Finland where mining, steel, and the forest industry are frequent. In addition, harsh climate and delicate nature set special requirements for the water treatment. Strong industry and geographical location with a relatively short distance to the Arctic Ocean have created innovative scientific research that pushes the boundaries of the well-known. Besides steel, automation and production research, the Faculty ofTechnology is recognised for its high quality clean technologies, environ- mental engineering, as well as circular and bio-economy competences. Close cooperation with national and interna- tional research partners, industry and end-users have promoted a multidisci- plinary approach to water research. We have gained excellent knowledge in hydrology, water resources, water and wastewater treatment, water supply, environmental engineering, modelling and management. We work with water protection and treating on mining, forestry and peat harvesting areas, as well as water management related to industry and communities. While working on global, European and national issues we also plan, facilitate, and conduct researchto help resolve regional and national water related problems. We strive for a strong societal impact. We promote technology transfer, the disseminationand application of research results to societal needs and stakeholders. Sustainability and the carbon footprint of water maintenance are researched as well. Novel wastewater treatment tech- niques with low-cost green materials and the role of a system and control engineering approach, and versatile water purification techniques are among our research focus areas. One of the main ideas is to use local wastes and by-products in the devel- opment of water treatment, materialsand chemicals, and to recover and utilise valuable compounds existing in aqueous streams. This includes e.g. studies around the following timely research topics in water and wastew- ater treatment: Local bio-based adsorption materials from agricultural and forestry residues for e.g. arsenic, heavy metals, organicsand pathogenic microbes' removal; Advanced oxidation processes, e.g. photocatalysis and wet air oxidation, for the degradation and utilisation (H 2production) of organic pollutants in wastewaters of e.g. pharmaceuti- cal industry and water purification plants; Membrane techniques including starch and micellar enhanced membrane technologies in the sep- aration of cations and anions, e.g. heavy metals, nitrates and sulphate from e.g. mining and industrial wastewaters; Hybrid materials and methods for water purification, e.g. combining adsorption, photocatalysis and membranes; Green water treatment chemicals and materials based on functionalised cel- luloses, and bionanochemicals based on sawdust, bark and peat; Electrochemical precipitation in the treatment of water impurities; andProfessor Riitta Keiski, Dean of the Faculty of Technology, University of Oulu talks about the importance of sustainable water treatment in Northern FinlandSustainable water treatment with Arctic attitude 160PROFILEPrevention of fouling of surfaces in aqueous environments, e.g. water treatment facilities, on-line sensors and heat exchanges. The automation research in water and wastewater management includes for example: Operation of water distribution systems (WDS) and practical applica- tions related to short-term manage- ment of hydrodynamic networks; On-line optical monitoring of pro- cesses to predict effluent quality in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant; Data analysis, simulation, and the development of predictive models, trend analysis and digital imaging of wastewaters in municipal and indus- trial environments; and Fast and accurate 3D laser scanning method at subsea applications such as monitoring of underwater structures. Visions for the future Water related research is becomingmore important due to the increasing world-wide clean water need, water pollution and tightening environmental legislation. Global scarcity of pure drinking water is a driving force in developing cheap and easy to use water purification systems. In future, sustainable, highly selective and advanced smart materials and chemi- cals are provided for water purification. Low cost, effective and environmental friendly materials are increasingly coming into use as water treatment technologies. Besides on-line analysis and automatic measures, as well as future applications in the digitalising world, via industrial internet-of-things and applications towards cyber-physi- cal systems in the industry and infras- tructure are needed.

SYKE forms part of Finland's national environmental administration. Natural Environment Centre is of SYKE's centers. It has mainly concentrated to work around the questions on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here Director of the Natural Environment Centre, Petri Ahlroth answers Open Access Government's questions with regards to protecting biodiversity in Finland. How important is it to protect biodiversity in Finland? The importance of protecting biodiversity in Finlanddoes not have major dierences compared to other European countries. In the most northern areas popula- tion density is low and land use is not intensive. Also, theproportion of protected areas is high compared to Southern parts of the country. Major threats for the biodiversity in the north are climate change and theovergrazing of oversized reindeer populations. Southern and central parts of the country are a mosaic of forest, mires and lakes. The use of forests (forestry) isvery intensive, and its influence can be seen outside pro- tected areas. Peat taking has destroyed huge areas of mires and at the same time polluted large numbers of lakes and rivers. The proportion of protected areas has been increasing slowly and large areas of forests and mires have been restored. However, current resources do not cover all needs of biodiversity (BD) protection. Other needs on BD protection are closely related to the needs of management activities at semi-natural habitats. Chances in the agriculture and lack of pasturing animals are strongly limiting the BD of fauna and flora of open habitats. At the moment it is not easy to nd enough resources for the management of open habitats. What challenges come with protecting natural environments and endangered ecosystems? There are almost always some conflicts of interests between BD protection and economical needs. Some of the conflicts can be also between dierent groups who are interested in the same resources, but have dif-ferent targets, for example hunters vs birdwatchers and photographers. How important is research for biodiversity and gaining more knowledge about how to protect our natural environment? Biological research has originally raised almost all environmental problems to public discussions. Scientic data and evidences are often the minimum requirement for any way out from the problem. However, at the moment political decision makers are trying to ignore scientic truth. This is a new and scary phenomena ofthis time. For the scientists, doing science alone is not the only way to try to have an impact on the protection of biodiversity. Scientists need to \"put themselves on re\"sometimes and do some rough popularisation of their knowledge. Scientic facts also need to be told in a language that everyone can understand. What can we learn from the natural environment in Finland in order to tackle major global problems, such as climate change? Finland and other Nordic countries demonstrate the selshness of people very well. Even if the standard of living is high, nothing is enough. There is this idea that, if I can get some extra benet I will, no matter what the consequences are - which is very strong. This is a primitive feature, which rises from the evolution of man. Those who have resources have better tness. There has never been such evolutionary pressurePetri Ahlroth, Director of the Natural Environment Centre, Finnish Environment Institute explains why it is important to protect biodiversity in FinlandFINLAND FOCUS163which would have created the thinking of moderation. Even if we think ourselves as clever beings, we are still slaves of our primitive needs. No matter how educatedpeople are in certain nations. This phenomenon is not only in Finland, but globally behind the ineptitude to solve the problems like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. How does the work you do go towards the protection of biodiversity in Finland? We can only do our best and try to renew our thinking to nd a new solution for the ever increasing problems. One way out is to nd new partners and start new types of co-operation between those new partners. Protectionof BD needs to be cross-cutting through the whole of society. This can happen only if markets - investors anddecision makers together - nd the benets of BD protection. We have tried to absorb learn this in Finland and some success already exists, but we are still in thevery early stages of such thinking at the national scale. How is biodiversity monitored? Some 10 years ago the EU nanced a project called(EUMON), which tried to collect all European BD monitoring together. However, this project was notcarried out very well, but it may provide some useful information. In Finland monitoring data comes from 10 dierent resources, as well as being produced by dierent authorities (research institutes, NGOs, scientic societies, citizen science, etc...). In Finland (as with most Northern European countries) species knowledge is at a very high level. The availabil- ity of literature is excellent and on social media there are several sites where people can nd help for the identication. Thanks to the availability of information, it is easy for everyone to bring small pieces of informa- tion for several citizen science systems. In Finland, the Ministry of Environment and SYKE have \"light\" coordination on specialist groups for the habitats and species. There are around 15 dierent species spe- cialist groups and around the same number of habitats specialist groups. In each group there are around 10 specialists. These groups are mainly working on vol- untary basis, but the Ministry of Environment provide some small support for the groups (meeting and some travel costs, nancing for some small projects). The groups are responsible for strengthening the data gathering and they also carry out the assessments for the red data books. The amount of work they do is amazing. For the environmental sector the nancing of these groups is very cost eective. How are natural habitats protected and monitored to gain further knowledge about them? The legislative system behind protected areas is com-plicated. There are several legal \"instruments\" which can be used for the protection of nature. Depending on these instruments, some areas are more strictlyprotected than others. One eld which could be mentioned are those invento- ries which \"Mets\u00e4hallitus\" (forest and park service) carries out in state owned forests. They maintain inven- tories and data from public protected areas. Those inventories cover several taxonomic groups and all habi- tat types. However, public resources for the inventories are limited and only around 4% of the species data is collected by public authorities, and 96% of species observations are based on citizen science. At the moment all resources which maintain species datatogether maintain around 50-70 million observations. Petri Ahlroth Director of the Natural Environment Centre Finnish Environment Institute Petri.Ahlroth@ymparisto.fi www.syke.fi/en-US www.twitter.com/SYKEinfo FINLAND FOCUS164Humankind is faced with great challenges. Stud- ies show that the rapidly growing population needs 50% more food, 45% more energy and 30% more freshwater by 2030. Diminishing land space and overexploitation of natural resources obviously lead to higher costs and increasing social conflicts. The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface but only 4% of the nutrition comes from the marine areas. However, the production potential of sh and aquatic plants is several times that of conventional land cultivation and meat production. For the past 2 decades sh farming has been the most rapidly grow- ing form of primary production and it has already passed the volume of beef production. Marine areas have the potential to sustainably produce 4 times more electricity than what humankind is usingnow. Currently marine renewable electricity production represents only around 0.2% of the total production. Meeting the growing need for energy is expected to lean strongly on renewable oshore solutions. We can already witness signicant oshore wind power growth in Europe. Oceans and seas will be viable responses to the global water crises. So far the main challenge in utilising these resources has been the energy cost and carbon foot- print of desalination. Combining marine renewable energy production and desalination would reduce CO2 emissions and enable the production and storage ofdrinking water when there is oversupply in energy. Most of the world's megacities are located on seashore.Floating buildings may be a solution to the housing shortage and other community planning challenges in Often seen as one of the most overstretched resources, the seas offer one of the best avenues for sustainable growth if utilised correctly The key to sustainable growth is in the oceansFINLAND FOCUS165these cities. Floating buildings are able to adapt to rising water levels, which may be important in cities that are preparing for the eects of climate change. Industrialisation of the oceans is already taking place. However, pace of the development in coming yearsmay surprise. The change involves great opportunities but also ecological risks. There are still huge gaps in the understanding of the impacts of human activities onthe marine ecosystems and their resilience and capac- ity to recover. There are also e.g. deciencies in under- standing long-term impacts of waves, sea currents orice loadings on the oshore structures. Enhancing marine knowledge requires investments in research and impact monitoring, as well as constant dialogueon the sustainability. Blue growth powered by digitalisation Blue growth is obviously driven by the needs on the market. However, it is strongly boosted by enabling technologies like digitalisation, articial intelligence and robotics, as well as the advancement of telecom- munications technology. At present, the amazingly rapid development of articial intelligence and robotics challenges almost all branches of industry. For the blue growth they mean substantialopportunities because work at sea and especially underthe surface is often dangerous and costly. In a few years nanosatellites and 5G networks will make it possible for vessels and robots - as well as people at sea - to be constantly connected to the internet. This will enable remote operations without delay and new kinds of automated and autonomous solutions, e.g. marine logistics in the future will likely be based on autonomous vessels that seamlessly connect the marine and terrestrial logistics networks. Drivers for change are also cheaper and more minia- turised sensors that enable us to collect enormous amounts of information from the marine areas in a very short time. At the same time, articial intelligence will enable rapid analysis of the big data produced by the sensor networks. Blue innovations fed by collaboration and a joint vision Grasping the opportunities in blue growth requires anew mind-set where the sustainable growth of the marine sector is viewed as a single entity. A comprehen- sive perspective helps researchers perceive shared development needs. It would also motivate companies to invest in the development of blue growth solutions. A joint vision would help to understand how the dierent sectors could benet from the collaboration. The current regulatory framework has not been designed with the needs of the modern blue economy. Legislation has to safeguard the sustainability but also enable and encourage the introduction of new, even disruptive innovations. Modern ocean governance, maritime spatial planning and macro-regional strate- gies are key tools to reconcile environmental and industrial objectives, as well as boosting sustainable blue growth at the international level. Opportunities for sustainable growth lie in the sea.Enhancing the multidisciplinary collaboration between sectors and strengthening the public-private partnership are key elements in creating favorable preconditions for innovations and growth. In this respect, the government of Finland is starting a new strategy process to build national coherent and integrated maritime policy. Furthermore, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation has invested via the Arctic Seas Programme in establishment of autonomous shipping ecosystem. We believe that the Baltic Sea region has excellent potential to become a world-class test area for blue growth innovations and modern ocean governance. Piia MoilanenArctic Seas Programme Manager Tekespiia.moilanen@tekes.fi Mr. Timo Halonen Senior Specialist Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry www.tekes.fiwww.twitter.com/TekesfiFINLAND FOCUS166A growth strategy for Finnish health research Finland has traditionally had strong expertise in health research and innovation. This concerns both basic and clinical research, as well as the utilisation of results in health innovations, better preventions and clinical care. The health sector has so far thrived and developed despite the fact that the public key actors (authorities like ministries, government regulatory agencies, research funders etc.), have worked without too much understanding of each other's strategies, actions and problems. This is probably the case in many other countries, too, but Finland is oneof those small countries that just cannot aord under- taking crucial actions incoherently and repeatedly. Recently this has become increasingly important, sincethe global competition is getting tougher and the eco- nomic situation is tight. Under these circumstances, the political decision makers are expecting prot from the public investments in health research and development (R&D). A growth strategy for health research To x the incoherence problem in the Finnish health sector, 3 relevant ministries (Ministry of Employmentand Economy, Ministry of Social Aairs and Health, and Ministry of Education and Culture) and 2 major govern- ment research funding organisations (Academy of Finland and Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation) initiated a major eort that resulted in aAcademy of Finland's Jarmo Wahlfors shares how key players have developed a growth strategy to ensure a coherent approach to Finnish health research and innovation FINLAND FOCUS167common strategy. After hearing all the relevant stake- holders, the Health Sector Growth Strategy for Research and Innovation Activities was published in 2014, followed by the implementation phase, where the 3 ministries and 2 research funders continued to work on one common goal. After 2 years of intense work and following most of the strategy recommendations, a roadmap for 2016-2018 \" Innovating together \" was published. Collaboration is key The roadmap was a milestone for the Finnish healthsector, not only because it revealed how successfulworking together can be: signicant progress in the implementation and clear guidelines for the futuredevelopment. Most importantly, the roadmap con-vinced the Finnish government about the importance of the health sector - health was adopted as one of the spearhead areas of the government programme, along with bio-economy, cleantech and digitalisation. This also involved additional investments to the healthsector - government decided to invest signicant amounts of money to the National Cancer Centre and the National Genome Centre, the major building blocksof the strategy. The growth strategy is based on the idea of innovation ecosystems that evolve around the university hospitals. The cornerstone of an ecosystem is basic and clinical research carried out at universities and university hospitals, covering both the expertise and the research infrastructures. These honey pots then attract other players, especially start-ups and SMEs to utilise the system and create economical value and jobs. Since these ecosystems are as strong as their weakest link, the strategy implementation has involved a number of dierent actions to enhance their viability. It is important to support the interplay of the ecosystem parts, enhance the research infrastructures and adjust the legislation to enable simple use of data resources like health registries and biobanks. Academy of Finland From the perspective of the Academy of Finland, the major public research funding organisation, the crucialpart of the ecosystem is basic scientic research carried out at the universities, university hospitals and state research institutes. Our role in the strategy work is to nurture this cornerstone and keep the building stable. During the strategy implementation, we have deep-ened our cooperation with the innovation funder Tekes for joint funding actions for health R&D, initiated map- ping of the university hospital research infrastructures, continued to support clinical research with a specialfunding instrument and initiated several new health- related research programs. It is clear now that we have found a way to go forward. These times are challenging and we truly need to worry about the future of clinical research in Finland, but we are not alone anymore. We are now working together with our colleagues in dierent public sector organisa- tions and we share the common goal: to keep these health ecosystems alive and developing, to bring well- being and economic value to Finland. It is relieving to know that our colleagues in the economy and health ministries also don't worry only about economic growth or healthcare reform (which are, of course, very important issues to the strategy), but they share our concerns about basic research and understand that the whole structure collapses if the foundationwears out. Jarmo WahlforsDirector - Health Research Unit Academy of Finland jarmo.wahlfors@aka.fiwww.aka.fi/en/ www.twitter.com/SuomenAkatemia FINLAND FOCUSThe Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) aims to advance new fundamental understanding of the molecular, cellular and etiological basis of human diseases. We are committed to pro- moting translational research and the adoption of personalised medicine in health care. FIMMwas founded in 2006 as a joint research institute of several Finnish partners. As of 2017 we joined the university's new life science research centre, Helsinki Institute of Life Sci- ence, as a scientifically and financially autonomous operational unit. FIMM is located at the Meilahti medical campus in Helsinki - Finland's leading hub of academic medical research and med- ical care. Cutting edge technology To reach our mission goals, we havecreated a new type of research insti- tute where we integrate molecular medicine research with cutting-edge technology platforms, and a biobank- ing infrastructure under one roof andfocus strongly on a few scientific grand challenges. The grand challenge programmes provide an opportunity to align our research on large and com- plexissues and draw our researchers, technology experts and clinical collab- orators together to achieve a common goal through collaboration. FIMM is characterised first and foremost by our partnership with the flagship ofEuropean biosciences research, the European Molecular Biology Labora- tory (EMBL ). As part of the Nordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine , we follow the EMBL opera- tional model and principles. This means aiming towards scientific excellence and establishing mechanisms forindependent, regular scientific evalu- ation of research activities, scientific integrity and good scientific practice, as well as commitment to international recruitment and significant levels ofstaff turnover. Another importantinternational network for us is EU-Life , comprising 13 top biomedical research institutes from Europe. FIMM has been a member of this network since 2013. There is a major global shift towards predictive, preventive, personalised, and participatory (P4) health care, anticipated to promote healthy aging and constrain healthcare costs. Our vision is to lead Finland into the era of P4 medicine by coordinating the integration, analysis and transla- tion of genomic, molecular and health data in Finland and beyond. Much of our research draws on the unique clinical and population-based samples collected from the Finnish founder population and on the closepartnerships we have with our clinicaland industrial collaborators. Through our high-quality science, we are uncov- eringthe underlying causes and drivers of disease, as well as translating med-ical molecular findings into public and individual health outcomes. Our research focuses on two main areas: Human Genomics and Preven- tive Healthcare & Systems Medicine and Precision Therapeutics. We believe that an important way to achieve the best scientific results is to focus strongly on a few grand challenges in society, and for the institute to work together towards these goals. This work requires unique resources. One such resource at FIMM is the Sequence Initiative Suomi (SISu ). Due to Finland's unique population history, the Finnish gene pool is rather excep- tional and thus a specific reference dataset of sequence variants in Finns is needed. SISu is a FIMM-coordinated international collaboration project aiming to build tools for genomic medicine by compiling information about the Finnish genetic variation. The freely available SISu search engine provides valuable summary data on variants from exomes of over 10,000 individuals sequenced in disease-specific and population-wide genetic studies. Other resources are the large population-based studies of general health, in particular of cardio- vascular health, associated genomics and large gwas samples deposited in Finnish Biobanks . Extensive register- based measures of health supplement these. The biobank data and samples are available for use not only by national and international academicDirector, Jaakko Kaprio shares the work that is being conducted to progress genomic epidemiology research and develop personalised medicineAdvancing genomic epidemiology at FIMM 168PROFILEresearchers, but also companies including the vibrant start-up cluster in Helsinki. These form an important part of Helsinki Health Capital alliance. A study in human genomics A large-scale human genomics study that utilises unique Finnish resourcesis the SUPER study on genetic mecha- nisms of psychotic disorders. It is part of the international Stanley Global Neuropsychiatric Genomics Initiative . The objective of the study is to better understand the genetic and biological background of psychotic disorders in order to provide more accurate infor- mation for the development of new therapeutics. Finland is the European pilot country and the aim is to collect a minimum of 10,000 genetic samplesfrom Finnish psychosis patients. The national study was launched in early 2016 and will continue for three years. FIMM is leading the study in collabo- ration with the National Institute for Health and Welfare, THL. One practical P4 example is our Digital Health Revolution (DHR ) Pilot Study.The DHR pilot study is FIMM's first next-generation health and wellness research project and part of a nationaland multidisciplinary Tekes-funded strategic opening. The study combines deep and comprehensive molecular health profiling, digital wellness mon- itoring and personalised coaching in about 100 volunteers, with multiple assessment waves and lab visits. The main aims are to facilitate preventive health care and personalised wellness and to devise and test strategies and technologies to integrate P4 medicine into current health care systems. The two-year field work has now been completed and it was very well accepted by the participants; first results are expected later this year. Complementary to the DHR is the cardiovascular study GeneRISK . Current heart disease prediction methodsbased on environmental and life-style factors are insufficient, failing to detect over half the high-risk individ- uals. KardioKompassi \u00ae was developed by researchers at FIMM to meet the need for better and more accurateprediction tools. This next-generation web-tool enables patients and doc- tors to use genomic data to predict and prevent cardiovascular disease. It uniquely combines traditional medical approaches with multiple recently discovered genetic risk factors. Kar- dioKompassi \u00aeis currently being used in the FIMM-led population-based GeneRISK-study, with ongoing recruit- ment of up to 10,000 adults Finnish participants.

Reducing rates of childhood obesity is something that requires both national and international actions. Throughout Europe the problem is prevalent; in the WHO European Region, it is estimated that 1 in 3 11-year-olds is overweight or obese. In Finland, more than half of all adults are reported to be overweight, and 1 in 5 are obese. In adults between the ages of 25-64, 66% are overweight and 20% obese, compared to 46% of women being overweight and 19% obese. In children and young people, 10% of boys and 15% of girls in pre-school age are reported to be overweight in Finland.1The Ministry of Social Aairs and Health in Finland has the responsibility of promoting healthy eating and exercise across the country. According to a survey produced by the European Commission in 2000, Finland is in the top 5 countries who are satis-ed with their healthcare. It reported that 88% of respondents were satised, compared to 41.3% - theEU average. Juha Rehula is the Minister responsible for family and social services. Public health comes under his remit. In March along with other EU health ministers, Rehula attended an informal meeting with regards to actionagainst children's obesity prevention, as well as action against HIV and AIDS. Childhood obesity can cause major health problems in later life. Open Access Government highlights how Finland is tackling the growing health challenge FINLAND FOCUS171At the meeting in Malta , prevention of childhood obe- sity was one of the key themes as part of the Malta Presidency of the EU. Ocials at the meeting attached great importance to reducing childhood obesity and developing action at both a national and an EU level. In Finland, children's obesity prevention includes a health clinic system, as well as organised day-care and school meals. Curbing obesity in childhood is important as it can help to reduce other major health problemslater in life, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. National Obesity Programme The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) works to promote health and wellbeing throughout the country. The main goal of THL is to ensure that people in Finland live good and healthy lives. In order to reduce the incidence of obesity throughout the nation, the THL coordinated the National Obesity Programme 2012-2018. The main targets of the pro- gramme are: Ensuring that fewer children and young people grow into obese adults; Ensuring fewer people gain weight as adults; Dierences in obesity prevalence among population groups become smaller; People at risk of obesity-related conditions lose weight or do not gain any more weight. The purpose of the National Obesity Programme is to encourage dierent actors from the various sectors of society to take part in the work. Key actors and part- ners of the programme include municipalities, health services, schools, child day care, sports, communityplanning, as well as employers and the food industry. Obesity and its relation to chronic diseases Linked to obesity are chronic diseases such as diabetesand cardiovascular diseases. In March, the THL hosted a meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO) expert network, which focusses on the risk assessment and development of the treatment of cardiovasculardiseases and type 2 diabetes in primary care.Research and specialist work on cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes conducted in Finland has earned an international reputation and recognition. WHO coordinates projects that are designed to build practices in primary healthcare worldwide to detect the early risk of people developing cardiovascular diseases ortype 2 diabetes, and reduce their risk through appro- priate drug therapies, lifestyle advice, and support for lifestyle changes. In Finland, unlike other EU countries, this is an already established operating model that has been used in primary healthcare for decades. \"Curbing obesity in childhood can help to reduce other major health problems later in life, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\" THL Research professor, Tiina Latikainen, who took part in the specialist work carried out in the WHO network, said: \"In Finland, primary healthcare has played a key role in identifying, providing treatment, and monitoring long-term illnesses. For us, it is self-evident and con- sidered the basis of cost-eective care that treatment is provided by multi-professional team, and that public health nurses and registered nurses are very much involved in the care and monitoring of patients.\" In order to reduce health problems in children, as well as preventing obesity, Finland is among the few countriesin the world who oer a free school lunch. There are also a number of Finnish innovations that are also aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles, which include functional foods, products marked with the Heart Symbol, the health eating plate and non-smoking workplaces and municipalities. 1 https://www.thl./en/web/thl-en/research-and-expertwork/projects- and-programmes/the-national-obesity-programme-2012-2015/sup- port-for-implementation Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov FINLAND FOCUSType 1 diabetes (T1D) is a serious chronic disease which results from the lack of a vital hormone, insulin, which is normally secreted from the pancreas. All patients with T1D need permanent, regular insulin replacement therapy from the diagnosis. There is currently no means to cure this disease, and in the course of time there are signifi- cant risks for the development of vascular complications, as well as early death from cardiovascular disease. - Patients or their guardians are educated to inject suitable doses of insulin subcutaneously by using insulin syringes or pens, or by using an insulin pump. Typically, the treat- ment requires 5 to 7 daily injections or boluses from the insulin pump. The individual insulin doses need to be adjusted according to the size of the meal, the actual level of blood glucoseand activities such as physical exer- cise. Therefore the blood glucose levels have to be carefully self-moni- tored by repeated fingertip measure- ments or using a subcutaneous sensor and continuous glucose moni- tor, in order to keep the blood glucose levels at the target 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The maintenance of good metabolic control is known to markedly decrease the risk of long- term micro and macrovascular com- plications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular dis- ease), which are threatening to the patient when the duration of the disease increases. The patients arealso at risk of severe acute complica- tions such as hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. The intensive nature of the treatment required is demanding for the patients and their families and increases the risk of psychosocial problems. All these complications have a severe adverse effect on the health and quality of life of the patients and also remarkably reduce life expectancy. Type 1 diabetes in Europe - adverse epidemiological trends T1D is one of the most common chronic diseases occurring in child- hood and adolescence. Furthermore, the disease is also commonly diag- nosed among young adults aged 15-30 years, but could actually occur at any age. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes approaches 1% among adolescents aged 15 years in the high-incidencecountries in northern Europe. In Fin- land the incidence of type 1 diabetes is the highest in the world reaching 64.2/100 000/year in 2005 in children younger than 15 years, which is almost 5 times higher than the incidence in the 1950's. Similar trends are observed in other European countries. It is also alarming that T1D is increasingly more frequently diagnosed in young children aged 0-4 years. This trend may also increase the life-time risk of vascular complications, which are known to be associated with long disease duration and insufficient metabolic control. The reasons for the changing incidence are not known, but the fast pace of thechange implies environmental causes. Epidemiological studies have indicatedthat there is a slight male excess in theincidence of T1D during childhood, and a sharp increase up to 1.8 in the male to female ratio in the incidence after puberty. \"More than 50 million people in Europe are affected with diabetes, with an estimated 5 million (10%) of themhaving type 1 diabetes. The economic burden per case of type 1 diabetes is higher than per case of type 2 diabetes, and the difference increases with age.\" T1D clusters in families T1D occurs more frequently in close relatives of patients with T1D than in the general population. The risk of progression to T1D by the age of 30 is 6% for siblings of diabetic children and increases to 10% by the age of 60. Several studies have reported that T1D is transmitted twice more often to the offspring of diabetic fathers than to those of diabetic mothers (6% vs 3%), the explanation for this difference remaining unclear. Familial clustering of Type 1 diabetes indicates genetic susceptibility for the disease. The strongest genetic risk factor for Type 1 diabetes is class II HLA geno- type on chromosome 6. This associa- tion was found already in the early1970's by a candidate gene approach. Class II HLA genes encode a special protein structure expressed on the surface of the human blood white cells, but the mechanisms of howUniversity of Oulu's Professor Riitta Veijola discusses the impact of Type 1 diabetes on society and the challenges associated with tackling the diseaseType 1 diabetes: A serious chronic disease 172PROFILEthese molecules mediate the increased risk for Type 1 diabetes have remained unknown. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed an additional more than 50 gene regions associated with T1D. Interestingly enough, the genetic factors identified so far appear to be related to the function of the immune system. This is in contrast to the observation that susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes (T2D) are genes,which encode proteins regulating the function of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells. Type 1 diabetes: A high burden in society More than 50 million people in Europe are affected with diabetes, with an estimated 5 million (10%) of them having type 1 diabetes. The economic burden per case of type 1 diabetes is higher than per case of type 2 dia- betes, and the difference increaseswith age. The reasons behind the high cost of treatment for type 1 diabetes are due to the fact that T1D is most often diagnosed early in life, all patients need intensive insulin ther- apy from diagnosis, as well as careful blood glucose monitoring to maintain good metabolic control and avoid life-threatening hyper and hypogly- caemia. In addition, good treatment requires regular contact with health care professionals, and in the paedi- atric age group the expertise of a mul- tidisciplinary team including various experts (pediatrician, diabetes nurse,diabetes educator, dietician, physio- therapist and psychologist). With longdisease duration the risk of vascular complications increases and emerg- ing complications cause additional contacts with the health care system.For the patient themselves type 1 diabetes is a devastating disease, andshe/he is at risk of depression, emo- tional stress and a feeling of discrimi-nation. It is of vital importance for the patient that she/he receives the best possible support from health care professionals but also from their family, day care staff, peers, teachers, and the surrounding society. Families of a child with type 1 diabetes experi- ence more anxiety and have more frequent days leave from work than the average family, and the healthy siblings may feel neglected. In day care and at school the staff has to be educated to take care of diabetes, especially in emergency situations like hypoglycaemia. In many schools personal assistants have to be hired for the young children with T1D, who need assistance with diabetes-related procedures during the schoolday. The cost of type 1 diabetes is estimated to be at least \u20ac18 billion per year inEurope. Any alleviation in this personal, societal and economical burden, such as prevention or delaying the onset of T1D in children would bring substantial 173PROFILE 174PROFILE economic savings and improve the quality of life of the children and their families. The pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes is still unknown The etiology and detailed pathomech- anisms of type 1 diabetes are not known. - The current concept is that type 1 diabetes develops as a result ofan autoimmune process, in which the immune system mediates a specific attack against the pancreatic insulin secreting beta cells, and this process finally leads to severe insulin deficiency. The development of type 1 diabetes is characterised by the presence of mul- tiple beta-cell specific autoantibodies in the sera of the subjects, which emerge months or years before the symptoms of type 1 diabetes are present (excessive thirst and urinating, weight loss and loss of energy). In long-term prospective studies, such as The Type 1 Diabetes Prediction andPrevention (DIPP) Study in Finland, the children at increased genetic risk are regularly followed from birth until the diagnosis of T1D. These studies have revealed that beta-cell autoantibodies most often appear very early in life, with a peak at 1-2 years of age. By com-bining the data from the Finnish DIPP study and other prospective studies, we have revealed that when multiple autoantibodies are persistently pre- sent the risk for progression to clinical diagnosis of T1D approaches almost 100% although the time to clinical diag- nosis varies. No effective treatment toprevent type 1 diabetes or a delay of the disease process have been identi-fied despite many clinical trials, which have mainly tested various immuno- logical treatments. In order to developstrategies to prevent and cure T1D in the future it is vital to obtain detailed understanding on the pathogenesis of T1D. The autoimmune process, which ultimately results in insulin deficiencyand the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, most often starts early, at the age of only 1-2 years. This discovery has led to the conclusion that possible exposure and events during the early develop- mental period of life are critical in the initiation of the disease process resulting in T1D and should be studied more in detail in the future.

Ten years ago, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted and ever since, the rights of people with disabilities have been gradually reinforced in all EU Member States. The rights of EU citizens have also been strengthened in cross-border situations. The 2011 Directive on the application of patients' rights in cross- border healthcare has facilitated the access to medical care for people with disabilities. Eight EU Member States are also developing a system of mutual recog- nition of disability statuses via the EU Disability Card, which will ensure equal access to specic benets, mainly in the areas of culture, leisure, sport and transport. The European Commission has also recentlyproposed to coordinate long-term care benetsbetween EU Member States. But despite these achievements, challenges remain. As the EU population is getting older, the number of Europeans with disabilities is rising signicantly, and their employment rate remains much lower than the one of people without disabilities (48.7% vs 72.5%). In addition, 30% of people with a disability are at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU, compared to21.5% of people without disabilities. Accessibility One of the main challenges relates to accessibility. In 2020, it is expected that 1 in 5 Europeans will experi- ence a degree of disability. Many everyday services and products have already become digital. They oer newEuropean Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, explains why accessibility is important for all citizens EDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 177opportunities for people with disabilities to take part in society and in the labour market on an equal basis with others. Indeed, technological innovation harbours a great potential of supporting social inclusion. But this will only happen if new products and services also have the necessary accessibility features. Otherwise, there is a real risk that technological innovation creates new inequalities between people. We need to act now and we need to act together. Accessibility is not an option. It is a right and a necessary investment in our future. But it does not happen overnight: it is an ongoing process which adapts as new products, services and infrastructures are developed. Crucially, it requires political will. The Commission hastherefore put the matter at the top of its agenda. The recently adopted European Web Accessibility Directive will nally bring accessible public websites and mobileapps. But more remains to be done and I have proposed the European Accessibility Act to step up accessibility beyond the public sector. The proposal has been identied as a priority le by the Council and the European Parliament and discussions are currently in full swing. The Accessibility Act makes use of the full potential of our single market to trigger real change in people's lives. It sets common European accessibility requirementsfor key products and services, in order to step up accessibility and prevent further market fragmentation. Take a practical example: automatic teller machines (ATMs) used in banks are regulated in some member states, for example as to their height. Did you know that a height considered accessible in France or in the UK is considered inaccessible in Austria? This is just one example of a product where a lack of common standards is acting as a brake to the internal market. How can we encourage SMEs to invest and create jobs in the face of 28 diverging rules? Can we really expect European research centres and universi-ties to pursue innovative solutions if they have to deal with dierent national and sectorial rules? The Accessibility Act will lead to a larger market foraccessible products and services at more competitive prices. That's good for business and for consumers. We can't aord to waste this opportunity to live up to our common commitment. The commitment of national, regional and local authorities, as well as businesses and civil societyorganisations will be essential to achieve decisive progress. It is only by pooling our eorts that we canmake the full and equal participation of people with disabilities a reality. Marianne ThyssenEuropean Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility European Commissionwww.ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/thyssen_en www.twitter.com/mariannethyssen Marianne Thyssen, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour MobilityEvidence-based health promo- tion at work is one of the new multidisciplinary projects that is receiving three-year funding from the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland from 2016 to 2019. Criteria for funding is high-qual- ity research that has a great societal impact. An important element of research is an active and ongoing collaboration between researchers who produce new knowledge and stakeholders and others who use it. The workplace is one of the priority settings for healthpromotion The evidence-based health promotion at work research effort focuses onworkplace health promotion (WHP), integrated with safety at work and occupational health care services. Optimal outcomes are difficult to achieve in workplace health promo- tion (WHP) (Rongen et al. 2014). Good health, including healthy lifestyles, forms the basis of workers' good work ability, productivity and safety at work, and thus health promotion is impor- tant for sustaining working careers. The workplace has an influence on the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of workers. Work- related factors such as shift work, low social support, long weekly working hours, and safety issues at work also affect employees' lifestyles. Neverthe-less, the workplace offers an ideal setting and infrastructure to support the health promotion of larger groups (WHO, 2014). The main approach of WHP has been the health education of individuals with a certain health risk, in order toprevent lifestyle diseases. However, these actions have not been tailored according to occupations. Obesity andunhealthy lifestyles are associated with decreased perceived work ability (Nevanper\u00e4 et al. 2015b,2015c) and sickness absence (Roos et al. 2015), as well as the adverse effect of lifestyle diseases being greater among those with physically strenuous work than among those with light work (Gould et 178PROFILE Evidence based health promotion at work Health promotion is the workplace is a key priority in the 21st Century, explains Jaana Laitinen of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Healthal. 2008). Shift work increases the risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and fatigue, which in turn is a risk factor for accidents. Healthy lifestyles are the key to min- imising the unhealthy effects of night shifts and are important for promoting safety at work. Some workers may be exposed to unhealthy lifestyles by having easy access to drugs or alcohol (health care, restaurants) or pastry and food (bakery and kitchen work). Thus,considering the occupational context may potentially provide meaning and motivation for healthy lifestyles, and the opportunity to develop new WHP activities. As unhealthy behaviours are too common among the working-age population and health care services resources are limited, persuasive technology might be one possibility for helping people make changes. Furthermore, WHP focus has tradition- ally been on larger enterprises and companies (Goetzel et al, 2008) that have occupational health and safety plans and actors, as well as OHS. At the same time, an increasing number of people are either becoming small entrepreneurs themselves or becom- ing employed by one (EU-OSHA, 2015), and in most cases, the WHP practices for large companies are not feasible for small ones. Small companies often lack occupational health services (OHS) and safety organisations that could help them to implement workplace health promotion. Every sick leave and uncompleted task is directly related to lower income among micro-entrepreneurs and self- employed people (P\u00e4rn\u00e4nen, Sutela 2014). In addition, as the economic growth of Finland, and also in many other countries, lies on the shoulders of micro-entrepreneurs, new ways in which to promote their health andwork ability are urgently needed.Our project will provide new ways in which to sustain the working careers of the working-age population, as well as vulnerable groups. As a general framework for health promotion we will use the principles of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (WHO 1986), according to which health promotion activities include building healthy public policy, creating sup- portive environments, strengthening community or workplace community actions, and developing personal skillsand reorienting health services. Advo- cating is also an important health promotion measure. Co-creation is a way in which to commit target groups to WHP and to tailor measures to suit them, as well as empowering target groups towards \"agency\" or advocacy. We aim to produce evidence based WHP guidelines that will be co-created with researchers, stakeholders andactors, and peer reviewed by researchers. Together with the scien- tific work interaction with different stakeholders and actors is performedfrom the start of the project. The aim of the interaction is to co-design, co- create, review and start to implement the results and WHP guidelines. Our aim is to integrate WHP plans with organisation's occupational safety and health plan and or with the operational plans of workplaces' occupational health services. About the author Jaana Laitinen, Docent in nutrition and in public health, is specialised in the intervention studies aimed to promote healthy lifestyles and work ability. Additionally, she has studied the devel- opment of unhealthy behaviours in an epidemiological prospective study of Northern Finland in 1966 and 1986, cohort studies. She has been involved in several development projects that aimed to transfer research results intopractice though interaction with work- place actors. The most prominent has been the WHP of professional drivers - Alert behind the Wheel - which had media coverage of 38 million and improved the nutritional quality of service station restaurants. \"Good health, including healthy lifestyles, forms the basis of workers' good work ability, productivity and safety at work, and thus health promotion is important for sustaining working careers.\" The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health is a specialist in well-being at work, which carries out research, and provides services and training.

Jaana Laitinen Docent 474 6006jaana.laitinen@ttl.fi https://www.ttl.fi/www.twitter.com/FIOH 179PROFILEEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 180Teachers are experts in driving social mobility Teachers are the experts who inspire the profes- sionals of the future. We shouldn't underesti- mate just how powerful that is - from architects to academics, geologists to graphic designers, techni-cians to translators - it is teachers who lay the founda-tions for the successful careers the young people who are growing up in our country today want and need. When I visit schools I talk to children and I wonder who they're going to be. What they can be. It is teachers who, on a day-to-day basis, understand and develop that potential to enable and shape those young people to - as it were - become themselves. Teaching deserves all the hallmarks of the other great professions - with a high bar to entry, high-quality initial training and a culture of ongoing self-improvement. It's crucial that, like other experts, you now have a professional body with a shared commitment to ever- improving standards, disseminating evidence on what works, and driving progress for the profession as a whole. I've been really clear that my dening goal as Education Secretary is improving social mobility across our country. So that it does not matter where you start, or whereyou grow up, you have the same opportunities to reach your potential. I know that I can't do that without you - a strong profession able to make it a reality. That is why setting out my vision, I placed building the right, long-term capacity in the system as 1 of the 3 core pillars of my approach for driving social mobility through education. This, above everything else, means investing in the people who work in our schools. Teachers are the great drivers of social mobility in our country. We know that the single biggest in-school influence on a child's life chances is the quality of teaching they receive - in fact, over a single school year, a strong teacher can help disadvantaged young people to gain as much as a whole extra years' worth oflearning, compared to those taught by a weaker one. Great teachers are the key to making sure that people can achieve their potential irrespective of where they start in life. I know that from my own personal experi- ence. Teachers are experts in levelling up opportunity for all our young people. That is why we've particularly got to do more to attract the best teachers to our more challenging schools, andto reward and invest in those currently working there. To me, education is about a child being ready and wanting to learn and a great teacher being able to engage and inspire them. Everything else is just an enabler. Across the country, teachers are doing an amazing job every single day of the week. We have flown around the world to try to ensure we have the best, most innovative teaching that is out there - I was recently in Shanghai to observe how theyteach maths. And they do it brilliantly. But it has really struck me what incredible expertise and practice there is right here on our doorstep. Part of our challenge is unlocking that best practice, understanding why it works, and disseminating it around other schools and teachers. It is important for us to be able to do that eectively, which is why Ibelieve the Chartered College of Teaching can be so important.In a speech, Secretary of State for Education Justine Greening highlights how teachers are inspiring the professionals of the futureEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 181It is important that all teachers are supported with the right framework that will allow them to become the best professionals they possibly can be. A framework of support that will allow the profession to flourish. Strong entry into the profession That support has to start when teachers begin their journey into the profession, with a real focus on evi- dence-based practice through the new ITT framework, recently developed by leading teachers and heads. We know that initial training is just the rst step. I want there to be an expectation of ongoing learning throughout a teacher's career - and the support neces- sary for that to happen. A mature profession like teaching also needs high- status qualications that reflect its standing. So I want to be really clear today about my views on qualied teacher status. Some people have suggested that QTS might be scrapped... or replaced with some vague notion of an 'accreditation' - let me be absolutely clear: not on my watch. Keeping and strengthening QTS is vital. This is not about removing school freedoms. But I believe that teachers should have the highest quality qualication and what I want to see is a QTS so well regarded, so strong that school leaders will naturally want all theirteaching sta to have it. QTS should be the foundation stone for the teaching profession to build on. I want to strengthen it as a rst step to ensuring that people entering teaching in the future join a profession that, as well as being truly valued, empowers them with access to the sustained high-quality training and development that every professional needs in the earlystages of their career. My aim is that from September 2019 we will introduce the newly strengthened QTS. I want to work closely with the profession. Meaningful professional development Of course professional development as a teacher doesn't stop once you qualify - it has to continue. The rst few years are crucial for new teachers to embed learningand also to nd their place in the classroom and the wider school community. Getting this right means making sure that a new generation of teachers have the support they need, not only within their school, but from a broader profession made up of experts, with a wealth of experience, knowledge and skills. \"Great teachers are the key to making sure that people can achieve their potential irrespective of where they start in life. I know that from my own personal experience. Teachers are experts in levelling up opportunity for all our young people.\" There is a growing culture and ethos within the teaching profession of constantly seeking to improve teaching methods, use evidence, to look at research and stay ahead of the curve - just like other professions like medicine, engineering or law. This culture of constantly pushing to do better - a hallmark of a great profession - will continue to be strengthened and embedded by teachers, with the support of the Chartered College of Teaching, as well as organisations like the Education EndowmentFoundation and ResearchED. This continued professional development also needs to happen within clear career development pathways - whether staying in the classroom as a subject expert, working elsewhere in the education system as part of a wider 'education career', or progressing into school leadership roles.Lots of schools and multi-academy trusts are already doing this brilliantly - but I want it to become the norm throughout the system, whatever type of school you teach in, wherever you are. I want to work with you - the profession - to make sure this happens, with a golden thread through every teacher's career from initial training and QTS through continuing professional development, especially inEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 182those early post-QTS years, through to specialism or leadership. We all know that for a culture of development to work, the highest quality, evidence-based CPD has to beavailable - particularly where it is needed, in our more challenging schools. So, I am opening the rst round of bidding for the \u00a375m Teaching and Leadership Innovation Fund. This rst round of funding will support programmes which will have an impact in the 12 opportunity areas I recently announced where we want to really galvanise social mobility to increase opportunity for young people, as well as in other areas throughout the country where it can make the biggest dierence. This fund will enable new, high-quality CPD provision to be delivered where it can make the most dierence and where it's needed most. \"I especially want to see a new generation of teachers becoming part of the Chartered College of Teaching - to help safeguard and shape the profession's future. You have as much to invest and are as invested in its success as anyone.\" I believe that, as much as anything, investing in home- grown talent in these more challenging areas where we want to see educational outcomes improve, is absolutely vital. That talent will be key to supporting disadvantaged pupils and driving forward social mobility. People are often most invested in improving the schools and pupil outcomes in their own communities. This was something I saw within the DfE when I launched the opportunity areas. Lots of ocials who had grown up in them came forward to oer help - they wanted to be involved. They know the areas like the backs of their hands, and now they are helping to champion change on the ground. The Teaching and Leadership Innovation Fund will also help to provide new evidence of what works, to add to the growing evidence base for the teaching profession, and enable approaches that are working locally to bescaled-up, so that teachers and leaders across the country can benet. I want to see us increasingly move from carrying out pilots to scaling up what works. We need to get into the phase of being able to spread that knowledge right across our school system so that all teachers and leaders, in all areas, can benet. I also think it's important that existing training is reviewed and reshaped - to make sure it keeps up with emerging practice and evidence. I can conrm that the new fully revised, gold-standard national professional qualications - developed in partnership with the teaching profession - will be implemented from September this year. There will be new high-quality qualications for middle and senior leaders, head teachers, and - for the rst time - executive leaders. I'd like to thank the expertworking group that has put so much work into this. The qualications build on the strong NPQ brand, witha revised content framework, to reflect the education system of today, and with an even stronger emphasis on the use of evidence and support for the pupils that need it most. Running through all this there is a recognition that we need to be conscious of the right approach for teachers working with children with special educational needs and disabilities. Every teacher is a teacher of children with SEN and disabilities, so it is important to ensure that this is mainstreamed within our NPQs, training and best practice. I think this needs to happen as they are being developed, rather than as an afterthought so that the professionals are properly equipped to support all pupils. I think the national professional qualications for school leaders should have the same kudos that MBAs do in business - recognised in and outside the profes- sion as qualications that empower individuals withhigh-quality leadership and management skills. I want to make sure that these new qualications are available to as many people as possible - particularly inEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 183the areas where they can make the biggest dierence. I want to support those working in chal- lenging schools by investing in theirdevelopment. That is why I have set aside up to \u00a310mfrom the Teaching and Leadership Inno- vation ofthese new gold-standard NPQs for high-potential professionals working in our most challenging schools. These people are key to raising standards and driving social mobility, and I want to supportthem however I can. Alongside this, I also want to do muchmore to attract the very best teachers and school lead- ers in the system to work in and transform our most challenging schools. I think we should be looking at how can use career progression routes to make that happen and I am directing my department to explore the available options. A self-condent profession When I look at the profession, I believe a lot of the key building blocks are already in place. Through organisations like the Education Endowment Foundation, evidence-based practice is really starting to take o, and the Chartered College of Teaching can be a real driver for that - collecting research and disseminating it for the benet of the system as a whole, and connecting the teaching profession more widely. Its establishment shows that the profession is stepping up to address the needs of today's young people and evolve to meet the challenges for future generations. I especially want to see a new generation of teachers becoming part of the Chartered College of Teaching - to help safeguard and shape the profession's future. You have as much to invest and are as invested in itssuccess as anyone.With evidence at the core of the way you deliver teaching for our children and young people, I believe the teaching profession can continue to assert itself as a truly high-status profession. Teachers are the experts on teaching, and so I want to see the teaching profession leading on raising stan dards in schools. To return to my core ambition as Education Secretary, I know it is great teachers and teaching that - morethan anything else - can level up opportunity and drive social mobility in this country. Great teaching transformed my life, and I want to make sure that happens for today's generation of children in our schools. This is an edited version of a speech from the Department for Education .

Whitehall has the task of overseeing and implementing Brexit, which seems to pres- ent new challenges on an almost daily basis. The NHS is at a critical juncture, local governments are trying to establish a new way of working with Whitehall, housing demand outstrips supply by a long way and almost every other sector is on the precipice of major reform. At the same time they are facing budget cuts or reductions in revenues. To be successful the public sector needs clear vision. It needs leaders who can guide it through a period ofgreat change. However, feedback from industry sug- gests there is a signicant skills shortage at a senior level. GatenbySanderson analysis of search and selec- tion executive roles, advertised across the publicsector, suggests that opportunities increased by 5% in 2016. The analysis also suggests the number of senior roles advertised has increased each year for the past 3 years. While part of this can be explained by the trend that the average tenure of a public sector leader is getting shorter, it also highlights how the sector is looking to bring in new skills. With the challenges the sector faces this year compe- tition for the best talent is only going to intensify. What can public sector organisations do to help overcome the skills challenge? Establish a clear framework for a new approach It is clear the next generation of leaders will need more diverse skills and backgrounds, rather than tting an established public sector mould. Our leaders must beIn these challenging times the public sector needs courageous, innovative and diverse leaders, says Martin Tucker, Chief Executive at GatenbySanderson Overcoming the talent shortage in the public sectorEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 187open to new ideas and way of working - from being open to new partnerships, to changing to more flexiblework practices to accommodate preferences of an upcoming millennial workforce. Experience beyond a single sector is a way to bring new life into public organisations, and an avenue to bring in those collab- orative, commercial and digital skills the sector craves. One hurdle that public sector organisations face is their rigid structure and processes, which can be detrimental to the search process. These rigid structures can suo- cate new approaches to nd and assess the best people to guide an organisation through periods of change. Boards and decision makers should dare to re-think their current process - from how they identify skills gaps, job descriptions, the application and selection process, and the criteria upon which candidates are being measured. As part of this we need to re-think how we assess and develop leaders, not just through the lens of organisational objectives, but specic behaviours. This extra level of detail will help deliver a leader that isnot only capable of bringing about change, but can also engage teams in the process. Understand that change isn't always smooth sailing New approaches need courage, however, and thatrequires new leaders who are brave enough to make decisions and take considered risks. Change has to bemore fundamental, embedded deep into the organisa- tion. This takes time and happens more by increments than large leaps. Those looking for more theatrical,supercial change are unlikely to cut it in the complex, challenging and highly regulated world of public services. New approaches may not succeed the rst time around. The measure of a good leader is how they learn and adapt their approach to bring about positive outcomes. If the sector is to thrive in this period of change, we all (both as consumers of public services and those work- ing in the sector) must applaud those who strive to improve our communities and accept that sometimesthings will not go exactly to plan. Running a public sector organisation is dierent to managing a football team. We cannot call for the manager's head at the rst sign of adversity. We must allow our leaders to learn from the challenges to create new iterations that will lead to success. Unlike the premier league, most organisations do not have multi-million pound budgets to invest; quitethe opposite, most need to innovate to cope with reduced levels of funding and increased demands. It's no surprise in 2017 that we are seeing an uplift in both 'transformation' roles and 'nance', as organisations need to balance the books while delivering more. This becomes increasingly dicult in the current media landscape. While increased scrutiny in the public eye is a positive move for transparency, it can also make attracting the best talent to lead public sector organisa- tion even more dicult. Leaders must certainly be held to account, but we must also allow room for innovation- because a new way of doing things is going to rue a few feathers. Final thoughts If we live in a brave new world, we need leaders that are capable of making brave decisions. Finding these people to lead the public sector, in what is shaping up to be an even more challenging year than the last, requires a new approach from all involved. If the search is to be successful in 2017, organisations need to be clear about the skills and behaviours they arelooking for and establish a framework that facilitates introducing greater talent and diversity. We must also understand that truly great leaders do not shy away from adversity or simply give up, they iterate and the overcome the challenges. However, to do this theymust be given a chance. Martin Tucker Chief Executive GatenbySanderson www.gatenbysanderson.com www.twitter.com/GatenbyS Martin Tucker, Chief ExecutiveLittle is known about tasks as competence-based learning opportunities in music lessons. Tasks are widely discussed in public under the aspect of audits and tests, due to the introduction of educational standards and competencies. In connection with the competence-ori- ented teaching, especially learning tasks began to capture the attention of empirical teaching research and theimprovement of teaching. Learning tasks are seen as the carrier of learn- ing opportunities and processes. As a result of important international comparative large scale studies like PISA and TIMSS , the discussion about relevant criteria of good tasks, as well as the analysis and constructionof domain-specific learning tasks increased in recent years. But thesenewer publications focused on learn- ing tasks and the subject of a didactic research with a musical-didactic perspective is still missing. Functions of learning tasks Tasks have a ubiquitous presence in class and play a central role in the engagement of the students with the learning subject matter, learningobjectives and cross-subject learning objectives. Depending on different phases of the lessons, they fulfil diverse didactic functions and appear as tasks for elaboration as well as for exercise, application or test. The design of learning tasks has a significant impact on the quality and complexity of learning process byinfluencing the choice of the learning paths and strategies, on the motiva- tion of the students, as well as on the depth of the resulting understanding and the acquired kind of knowledge. In summary, learning tasks have an effect on what and how something can be learnt. Their effectiveness depends essentially on the quality of the task design. Competence orientation and social-constructivist approach to learning and teaching Deep understanding as a basis for the use of knowledge and skills is an out- come expectation of the competence- oriented teaching and learning. Since TIMSS empirical teaching research shows that deep understanding of the subject matter results when character- istics of teaching quality like classroommanagement, supportive learning environment and cognitive activationare connected with an orientation for the depths structure of domain-spe- cific concepts. This includes concept- specific elements of understanding, the quality of domain-specific representations and structural clarity of conceptual structures (Reusser &Pauli 2013). From a social constructivist viewpoint learning and teaching ischaracterised by the orientation toward domain-specific relevant knowledge and meaningful represen- tations, as well as domain-specificways to acquire knowledge and domain-specific ways to think and act. Therefore the development of compe-tencies is made differently in diverse domains. For example, the concept of speed includes not the same learning and understanding in physics as in music. In summary, learning tasks have to represent the relevant core ideas, concepts and connections of a specific domain if they are aimed to foster students' deep conceptual understanding. Also, subject-didacticresearch on learning tasks requires as mandatory an analysis of the learning subject matter and the domain-specific core ideas. Music education research in German-speaking countries Music didactic in Switzerland is devel- oped in practice and traditionally not seen as a scientific discipline. Music education research only gradually emerged since the formation of the Universities of Teacher Education and Universities of the Arts of the last decade. There are currently very few existing empirical studies in music education. Little is known about the common music teaching practice, the quality of music teaching in public schools, as well as the ideas of teach- ers about good practice of musicteaching. The fact that about 20% of music lessons in primary schools are performed by teachers who are notqualified for music teaching (Huber & Camp 2013) is striking. Also in further German- speaking countries with a widespread music education research, there is a lack ofWhat does the learning culture of music lessons in Switzerland look like? New research at the University of Zurich aims to investigate how lessons could be improvedCompetence-oriented music lessons to improve teaching 188PROFILEempirically validated local theories on musical education and musical learn- ing processes or a discussion about relevant criteria of the application, the function and the quality of learning tasks in music teaching (Lehmann- Wermser 2008). It exists in a diversity of didactic concepts, but still no consensus about an aesthetic and expressive musical understanding or about domain-specific core ideas and their underlying representations which have to be acquired in music lessons. The necessity of a musical- didactic research on learning tasks The development of suitable teaching designs, learning tasks and learning material is seen as a main duty of teachers. This is due to the shift from a learning input to a learning outcome perspective in educational governance, as well as the implementation of a new competence-based curriculum over the next few years. Also, musical-didactic research must generate basic empirical knowledge and new evidence-based didactical approaches about how teachers can plan and implement their music lessons in public schools accord- ing to a competence-based curriculum. A planned research project wants to make a contribution in order to close this research gap. The primary objective of this video-based study is to investigate what the learning culture is looking like in music lessons at primary schools in Switzerland, but also to get first indications about how music teaching could be improved by the use of an educational reconstruc- tion, a framework for the design and evaluation of theory-based content specific interventions. By qualitative content analysis of learning tasks, learning material and planning documents, by stimulated recall inter- viewswith teachers and metaphor analysis of students' loud thinking during task solving, we hope to find answers to the following questions: Which tasks create teachers as competence-based learning opportu- nities in their music lessons? Which ideas of relevant knowledge, ele- ments of understanding, meaningful representations and students' pointsof view, lead teachers in creatinglearning tasks and supporting the learning process of students? Which pre-understanding and thinking patterns lead students in solving learning tasks?The generated data and answers of this first step should result in a follow up intervention study and the creation of teaching-learning settings for music education based on theoretical and empirical ideas of competence orien- tated good practice.

Apprenticeships are vital to the future of the industry and in recent years there has been a perceived skills gap in the re and security sectors, as such, these new apprenticeships developments couldn't have come at abetter time. The new Fire, Emergency and Security Systems Trail- blazer was developed after employers within the indus- try saw the need for better quality apprenticeships to help bridge the skills gap and ultimately improve businesses. As a result, 13 employers came together to form a Trailblazer Employer Group in order to create a uniformed standard for a re, emergency and security systems technician. The group consisted of: Abel Alarm Co Ltd, Christie Alarm, AAI Security, CSL, Kings Security,Chubb Fire & Security, Secom, Amalgamated Ltd, Wessex Fire and Security, Banham, BDS Fire, Pointer Ltd and Stanley Security Solutions. Throughout the devel-opment of the standard, employers from within the re and security sectors were encouraged to provide aninput on what they would like to see from apprenticesand the most eective ways for them to be assessed in order to ensure a high standard of training. Trailblazer apprenticeship The new Trailblazer is a Level 3 apprenticeship with a choice of pathways, including security, re, re and emergency lighting and re and security, as well as a core module and an end assessment. All pathways will include core modules as well as units relevant to the chosen discipline in order to create well rounded, high quality engineers. There will also be an opportunity to transfer Level 2 City and Guilds to the new apprentice-ship. Developed with the support of the BSIA, Fire Industry Association (FIA) and the Fire and Security Association (FSA), along with other industry stakehold- ers, the Trailblazer gained government approval lastyear and was ocially launched in February 2017. The development of the Trailblazer is a positive step for the re and security industries, with the standard enhancing the skills of apprentices as they learn to design, install, commission and maintain electronic systems. Being regularly assessed throughout the Trail- blazer, apprentices will develop an array of core knowl- edge and skills, including health and safety, electrical and electronic principles, practices and procedures, core systems, system technologies and environmental principles, along with customer service, communica-tion and commercial awareness. With such well- rounded training, through a combination of 'on the job' training, mentoring and knowledge based learning, high quality apprentices will serve to increase the overall value of a business and secure the future of our industry.James Kelly, Chief Executive of the British Security Industry Association looks at the value of apprenticeships and how they are shaping the industry James Kelly, Chief ExecutiveEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 191As well as the launch of this new Trailblazer, this spring will see the way the government funds apprenticeships in England change, with employers with a pay bill of over \u00a33m each year being required to contribute 0.5% of their payroll into their new apprenticeship levy pot. In an eort to get more businesses to invest in appren-ticeships, employers will then be given an allowance of \u00a315,000 to oset against their levy payment, which will be paid in monthly instalments through a new DigitalApprenticeship System. This allowance can be used to pay for quality apprenticeships, with the government contributing an additional 10% to the monthly funds. This new reform will come into eect as of 1st May2017 and hopes to increase employer demand for apprenticeships, as the employer will now have control of the content and assessment of the apprenticeship - through the Trailblazer scheme - as well as the funding available. When choosing training, however, it is impor- tant to select an apprenticeship that is delivered against an approved framework or standard with an approved training provider and assessment organisation. Apprenticeship policy Under the government's new apprenticeship policy, training providers must be on the Register of Appren- ticeship Training Providers (RoATP) in order to be eligi-ble to deliver apprenticeship training - either directly or as a subcontractor - to large, levy-paying employers. A full list of eligible providers was published in early March, with Skills for Security, the industry's sector skills body, making the grade. In order to be accepted onto the register, providers had to pass all elements of the application, which included due diligence checks on compliance, quality and nancial health, ensuring that that the organisation has the capabilities to deliver high-quality apprenticeship training. It is positive to see these new initiatives emerging, highlighting just how important apprenticeships are to our society. With the high quality training available, the skills of the younger generation can be enhanced and apprenticeships can provide a valuable pathway to a successful career that can benet the apprentice, the business and the industry as whole. James Kelly Chief Executive British Security Industry Association (BSIA) www.bsia.co.ukwww.twitter.com/thebsia In November 2016, a group of secondary students worked with individuals associated with the Mush Hole Project and the IntegratingKnowledges Summit and created a youtube video called Reconciliation: A Response that offers insight into how reconciliation might be defined. It is important to note that reconciliation needs to be defined within an institu- tional context and part of an instituteof higher education's mandate should be providing educational opportuni- ties that push students, staff, faculty and administrators at every level to define what reconciliation means for themselves at an individual level. The first national action of reconcilia- tion was the apology provided on June 11, 2008 by Stephen Harper in his role as Prime Minister. Associated with the apology was the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which released its final report in June 2015 and issued 94 calls to action. The challenge over the past few years has been how to address these calls to action in meaningful ways that will result in positivechanges. Many of the calls to action had implications for education. How have Canadian institution of higher education responded to the TRC's Calls to Action? The answer to this question is not always readily apparent and the vari- ous institutions across Canada are in different points along the journey toreconciliation. There is a lot of talking going on and some of that is translat- ing into action. As of yet there is no unified response and Canada's systems of education do not lend themselves to one. Unlike the U.S., Canadian edu- cation is not a Federal responsibility and therefore each province and ter- ritory govern how education will be funded and provided. The only excep- tion to this is First Nations education, which is the responsibility of the Fed- eral government, who must negotiate with the provincial and territorial governments to either purchase edu- cation or ensure that it is provided to the provincial/territorial standard. To make things even more complicated each province or territory is responsi- ble for how education is delivered at all levels. For example, in Ontario, elementary and secondary educationfall under the Ministry of Education but higher education falls under the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development, which administers related legislation such as the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Actand the Higher Education Quality Council Act . This makes it difficult to launch a unified response, which may not always be appropriate given the need to be responsive to histories and context of place. However, there have been several instances where institutions have consulted with each other or joined together to explore the common issues. Colleges and Institutions Canada (CICan) launched its 7 princi - ples of indigenous protocol for Colleges and Institutes in December 2014. CiCan invited its members toHow are Canadian higher education institutions responding to the truth and reconciliation commission's calls to action? Brock University's Dawn What strides have been made? 192PROFILE sign on to the protocol and adopt the 7 strategies. CiCan's membership rep- resents 137 colleges, institutes, poly- technics, and across Canada. According the CICan website, 49 insti- tutions are signatories to the protocol. In June 2015, Universities Canada launched its Principles on Indigenous Education. Universities Canada repre- sents 97 Canadian universities and the release of its principles indicates that \"the leaders of Canada's universi- ties\" have committed to them. The 13 principles call for the following: sup- port of opportunities for Indigenous students at all levels; student-centred strength-based approaches to student success; indigenise the curricula;recognise the importance of Indige- nous education leadership and ensure representation at governance, faculty, professional and administra- tive levels; build welcoming and respectful learning environments with Indigenous student spaces; support dialogue between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students; accessible learning environments off-campus; partnerships and collaborations among educational and local Indigenous communities; build on successful practice and initiatives while keeping context in mind; communication strategies to promote support and services for Indigenous students; intercultural engagement between indigenous and non-indigenous mem- bers at all levels throughout the university; be mindful of the role that universities play in creating learningenvironments K-12 for Indigenous students. The document also called for support from various levels of government to fund initiatives related to the principles. There are also other notable collabo- rations operating at various levels throughout Canada. Notable collabo- ration comes out of Saskatchewan.The University of Saskatchewan hosted a National Forum, Building Reconciliation: Universities Answering the TRC's Calls to Action , which was attended by over 200 individuals including 25 Indigenous leaders and 14 presidents from higher education institutions. At the conclusion of the forum, it was announced that all 24 Saskatchewan post-secondary institu- tions had signed an accord committed to Indigenous education and reconcil- iation. In September 2016, the Univer- sity of Alberta hosted the second Building Reconciliation National Forum. In May 2016 at the University of Calgary there were several sessions during the annual conference of the Canadian Society for the Study of Education that brought scholars and Deans from various institutions together to discuss the TRC and its implications for higher education. While the University of Saskatchewan is one of the institutions leading the way in transforming talk to action through its reconciliation initiatives , other institutions are also respondingin various ways to the TRC. Queen's University has established a Truth and Reconciliation task force that is exam- ining the 3 calls to action addressed directly to post-secondary institutions as well as the broader implications of the TRC. One of Trent University's responses to the TRC has been to launch a new Indigenous Bachelor of Educationdegree while the University of Waterloo has a Truth and Reconcili - ation Hubthat features truth and rec- onciliation projects, as well as other resources and supports. Among Lake- head University's responses is direct support of the TRC Recommendation 28 that all law students take a course focussing on Indigenous people and the law. This direct support comes in the form of weaving Indigenous con- tent throughout the law curriculum.The University of Toronto struck a university-wide steering committee to investigate how the university might best respond to the TRC calls to action, the report from the committee has included action items such as hiring more Indigenous faculty. Similarly, the University of Guelph has committed to hiring 5 new Indigenous faculty mem- bers and increasing graduate awards for Indigenous students. These are just a few examples of how institutions of higher education have begun to respond to the TRC. As a white Euro-Canadian faculty member, I am well aware of the chal- lenges and the work that lies ahead on the road to reconciliation. The chal- lenges faced by institutions of higher learning involve how they will have the challenging conversations around how to change the institutions to reconcili- ation, maintain forward momentum inmaking those changes, and commit funding to accomplishing and support- ing those changes. The question that remains is whether or not Canadian Universities will do the work to engage in reconciliation in meaningful ways. Dawn Zinga Associate Professor and Chair Department of Child and Youth Studies Brock University 194Apprenticeship reforms: The role of training providers It's strange how in some public services, governments willingly contract out delivery to commercial and charitable providers knowing that they will often receive excellent value for money in return whereas inothers, contracting out almost seems like an admission of failure. In the case of government funded skills pro- grammes in the UK, the approach towards independent training providers has appeared to be almost schizo- phrenic even though without them the impact of theseprogrammes would have been minimal. \"It would be tragic if ministers fail to address the weaknesses within the apprenticeship reforms because an expanded apprenticeship programme could make a huge difference to the British economy by improving workforce skills at all levels and in the key sectors identified by the government's new industrial strategy.\" Why do you need a training provider? The main reason why training providers are so vital is because they nd ways of engaging with employers which many other institutions nd dicult. They oercustomised and flexible solutions to employers' skills needs and they are very responsive to changing eco- nomic circumstances and government priorities. The Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP) estimates that its member providers engage with approximately 350,000 employers throughout the UK and hopefully the number is about to becomelarger with the start of the government's new appren- ticeship levy. Apprenticeship reforms Large employers in Britain will pay the levy and some of them will be oering apprenticeships for the rst time in order to claim their levy payments back. The levy has potentially 2 key advantages which trainingproviders are keen to exploit to the country's benet. The rst relates to the need to tackle skills shortages and to address the UK's lamentable track-record in productivity. In 2015, UK productivity was 18% below the average of the rest of the G7 countries and we lag way behind Germany, USA and France. Economic analy- sis mostly points to leadership and management being the historical factors behind the lag and we may be about to see the levy help rectify this weakness. When large businesses start reclaiming their levy in May 2017, many of their new apprenticeships will be used for management training. In fact we believe that half of the \u00a33bn raised by the levy by 2020 will be used for this purpose.Mark Dawe, Chief Executive, AELP says apprenticeship reforms can tackle poor productivity but the support of training providers is necessary to succeed Mark Dawe, Chief Executive, AELPEDUCATION, TRAINING & HR 195Improving social mobility However there is major concern surrounding the other potential key advantage which is that apprenticeships should continue to act as a driver for social mobility. In 2015-16, 16 to 18 year olds accounted for 131,000apprenticeship starts (26% of the total) in England. The vast majority of these young people who complete their programme will still be in a job with the same employer 6 months later and will be on their way to a successful career. Unfortunately the UK government has just removed the current incentives for employersto take on apprentices for this youngest age group and, for a government which talks about apprenticeships as a 'ladder of opportunity', this seems really bizarre. Young people aged between 16 and 24 are also heavily reliant on smaller businesses to oer them apprentice- ship opportunities across the country and yet within the next 2 years there is a real danger under the levy system that no little or no funding will be available for apprenticeships in SMEs. AELP is therefore pressing the UK government to nd a guaranteed minimum budget of \u00a31bn a year to make sure that this vital skills provision in smaller businesses continues. It would be tragic if ministers fail to address the weak-nesses within the apprenticeship reforms because anexpanded apprenticeship programme could make a huge dierence to the British economy by improving workforce skills at all levels, and in the key sectors identied by the government's new industrial strategy. Ministers also recognise that Brexit has underlined theneed for young people to have the skills to take jobs which hitherto have been largely lled by migrant workers. Furthermore they now appreciate that they cannot overcome these challenges without the support of high quality training providers. Mark DaweChief Executive Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP) markdawe@aelp.org.ukwww.aelp.org.uk CULTURE & HERITAGE 196European Capitals of Culture initiative benefits cities Let me nevertheless stress at the outset that culture can never be just a means to an economic end: culture plays too signicant a role in our lives and our society to be reduced to its mere economic function. Especially today, when our communities face so many challenges threatening our Union's core values. Now more than ever we need culture to better understand each other and to cement the bonds between our countries and people. But this does not mean that we should ignore culture's huge economic potential. The European Capitals of Culture are a great illustration of this. They are of course above all a cultural event. Holding the title enables cities to boost cultural activity and reach new audiences. Cultural operators acquirea more international outlook. The initiative also has a social impact, fostering cohesion and intercultural dialogue, for instance through outreach programmes. European Capitals of Culture have also repeatedly shown what a city and its surrounding region can achieve in terms of growth and job creation by integrating cul- ture and the arts in long-term development planning.One of the most obvious economic eects is the increase in the number of tourists. The average increase of overnight stays upon the previous year for a European Capital of Culture is 12%. But this can rise to more than 25%, as in Pilsen in 2015 or Pecs in 2010. In Mons, it is estimated that each euro of public money invested in the Capital of Culture programme gener- ated between \u20ac5.5 and \u20ac6 for the local economy. A central achievement of the year have been the newpartnerships created between the cultural sector and the local corporate sector, as well as the reinforced cooperation with the tourism sector. Being a European Culture Capital entails a process of transformation for a city, oering increased opportu- nities in terms of urban development. The 2013 European Capital of Culture in Marseille was part of an investment project in new cultural infrastructure of more than \u20ac600m - which was in turn integrated into a multi-billion euro eort to revitalise the city spanning several decades. Some cities have used the title to regenerate former industrial areas and to transform them into new cultural or creative quarters. For example, in Koice 2013, the private sector and local universitiesIn a speech, EU Commissioner for Culture, Tibor Navracsics shares how European Capitals of Culture are a driver for social and economic change Tibor Navracsics Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and SportCULTURE & HERITAGE 197worked together to transform the industrial city, high- lighting the city's creative potential. Of course, we sometimes see cities that do not reap the full benets of the title, often because of problems of governance, insucient long-term planning, anabsence of clear objectives, indicators, milestones and monitoring and a lack of experience in implementing an event of this scale and scope. That is where public strategies - at all levels of territorial governance - can be of help. To ensure a lasting positive impact, cities and their surrounding regions must embed the year's programme into their long-term development strategies. In other words, cities - and regions - must not just look at the short-term benets to be gained during the year itself. They need to look further to the future. National Initiatives also play a role That is also where national initiatives such as the Italian Capitals of Culture have a clear role to play. I know that in Italy the initiative came in the wake of the huge success of the Italian competition for the 2019 European Capital of Culture title, with a record number of 21 applicant cities (and Matera as the winner). Similar initiatives exist in Ireland, in the UK, in Lithuania. They are extremely useful. They can further illustrate the multi-faceted and central role culture plays in our cities and regions. And they reinforce the connection between culture, cultural heritage, tourism and socio-economic development. They also provide public authorities with an opportunity to implement an important change in the way they support culture. They also oer a space where all levels of territorial governance work together, with a common and shared goal, beyond political dierences. There is indeed a need for all public authorities to treat a European Capital of Culture or a national capital of culture as a non-partisan eort on behalf of the city.The role of the European Commission is to foster the exchange of experience and good practices between past, present and future capitals and facilitate exchanges and peer learning between cities and regions across Europe. We do this, for example, through an ongoing initiative funded under Creative Europe, called \"Culture for cities and regions\". Within this frame, we work directly with city and regional authorities, including some former European Capitals of Culture, to share experience and knowledge on culture and heritage as drivers for social inclusion, regeneration and growth. The initiative includes study visits and peer-learning activities for local authorities. Moreover, through our various funding programmes (Creative Europe, Structural Funds), we can support capacity building, cooperation and networking of cultural operators beyond national borders. Finally, I hope that we can use the European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018 to reinforce partnerships between our various levels of territorial governance. As we are just entering the New Year, I would also like to wish every success to Aarhus in Denmark and Pafos in Cyprus, the 2 European Capitals of Culture in 2017, as well as to Pistoia, the 2017 Italian Capital of Culture. I am condent that all 3 will be a great success and that they will invite us to reflect on our common European project.

Tibor Navracsics Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport European Commission www.ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/navracsics_enThe Art Museum of Estonia is Estonia's largest art museum. It is comprised of 5 separate branches, which house both a local and international art legacy, from the medieval St. Nicholas' Church, where sacral art is displayed (including one of the largest northern European late- medieval winged altarpiece and the unique 15th-century Danse Macabre Bernt Notke's workshop), to the11-year-old modern museum building Kumu, which was named the European Museum of the Year in 2008. The coming years of 2017 to 2019 are going to be truly special for the museum. In 2017 Estonia serves as the European Council presidency, in 2018 the Republic of Estonia celebrates its 100th anniversary, and in 2019 the Art Museum of Estonia will be 100 years old. To worthily celebrate the museum's and the state's centennials, we have decided to introduce Estonian art in other European countries. Highlighting Estonian art and culture Exchanging expositions and showing one's cultural heritage in other places is common in international practice, but as representatives of a small nation we have to try harder than many other countries or museums. We have many wonderful works ofart, a strong historical legacy and excellent contemporary artists, who are invited to display their oeuvre allover the globe. Still, a lot of work needs to be done to make othersaware of our culture and to keep it alive and thriving. The upcomingevents have motivated us to organise several major overview exhibitions of Estonian art in various European locations.Sirje Helme, Chief Executive Officer, Art Museum of Estonia shares how Estonian art will be brought to the forefront as the nation celebrates its centennialShowcasing 100 years of Estonian art and culture 198PROFILE In September 2017, we will open the exhibition Archaeology of the Screen at the BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels. The exhibition focuses on technological utopias that influenced our art in the 1960s and have now become significant parts of our coun- try's success story. Digital culture does not, however, mean only progress, as it has raised some serious issues in the arts arena and in connection with our whole way of life. It is significant that the first display in our series of events is dedicated to contemporary art, particularly art that examines the technology-centred world-view. A month later, we will open an exhibi- tion of the oeuvre of Konrad M\u00e4gi, a great classic modernist painter from the beginning of the previous century, in Rome in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna. M\u00e4gi's exceptional sense of colour and pantheistapproach to nature represent the connection to nature not in the sense of landscape painting, but rather in the sense of abstraction and universality. I am convinced that the nearly century - old paintings are as significant to the viewer as works that delve into our complicated current issues. \"To worthily celebrate the museum's and the state's centennials, we have decided to introduce Estonian art in other European countries.\" Joint exhibitions Estonia is not the only country celebrating 100 years of history: our neighbours Latvia and Lithuania, with whom we are linked via similar histor- ical experiences in the 20th century, also celebrate their centennials in 2018. On this occasion, we will open a joint exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris to show our art from the beginning of 20th century, when tumultuous times of World War I, which gave rise to many a nation- state. Paris was the dream destination of all artists in those days, as it was the heart of the artistic scene of the early 20th century. The exhibition to be displayed in the newly renovated wing of the Orsay Museum in April 2018 will also be shown at the Kumu Art Museum in Tallinn in the autumn of the same year. Being geographically close, it would be great for the Baltic countries to get to know each other's art history a bit better, so the cultural overview of the past century serves as an opportunity for comparison. Our most ambitious project will be the joint exhibition Estonian Painter at the Courts of Renaissance Europe, with theNational Gallery of Art in Washington, which will open in the States at the beginning of 2018, from June to September it can also be viewed at Kumu. The artist Michel Sittow, born in Tallinn in the 15th century, probably studied in Bruges under the guidance of Hans Memling, and became known for his extremely fine brushwork. Sittow received commissions from a number of important royal families. His fate and artistic talent led him tocome into contact with a number of persons who have played important roles in the history of Europe and the world as a whole, such as Isabella I of Castile, Philip the Fair, Margaret of Austria, Christian II of Denmark and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Working in different courts, he adopted influences from French and Spanishcourt art, synthesising techniques and styles of various schools. The true Renaissance travelling artist spent the last days of his life in the town of his birth, Tallinn. Sirje Helme Chief Executive Officer Art 6003helene.tedre@ekm.ee to Aarhus: The European Capital of Culture 2017 From the perspective of Aarhus, Denmark's second- largest city, 2017 is a wildly exciting year, because this year, we are European Capital of Culture. European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017 is the most monumental cultural project Denmark has ever hosted,with over 400 events throughout the year. The European Capital of Culture initiative is about transforming the arts and culture in the broadest sense into a catalyst for long-term benets, as exem- plied in Glasgow 1990, Lille 2004, Liverpool 2008 andMarseille 2013. European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Aarhus andthe region. It testies to our development into a truly European city - a city which is increasingly attractive to business, talent and tourists. Aarhus 2017 will give ourcitizens a sense of pride and belonging by positioning Aarhus more strongly on the European map, increas- ing our international visibility and prole. This is a project of enormous scope - unied by the theme 'Let's Rethink'. Aarhus 2017 spans the entire spectrum from great per- formances and exhibits - drama, concerts, dance, and literature - to major popular events and project centred on urban development, sustainability, gastronomy, architecture, nature and hygge. We have so much to oer in Denmark and so much to be proud of. Our guests from Denmark and abroad - England, Germany, the Netherlands - in fact, from all over the world - really have something to look forward to. We are expecting millions of guests of all ages, and in fact, many of them have already started arriving. Touristsare flocking to our region as never before. Travel journalists from all over the world are reporting theirenthusiasm about what they experience in Aarhus and central Jutland. You can read about us in major international media such as Monocle and National Geographic, and in prominent international newspapers such as The New York Times, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung andThe Independent. In 2016, the international travel guide Lonely Planet ranked Aarhus number 2 on its list of the summer'shottest European travel destinations. Only surpassed by the Peloponnese in Greece. It's easy to see why: the 'capital of Jutland' scores high onevery conceivable parameter for travel enjoyment. Lonely Planet, which has been scouring the planet for the best travel destinations for 40 years, highlights Aarhus' hip Latin Quarter, the city's culinary scene, including several Michelin-starred restaurants, and world-class museums,such as ARoS Aarhus Art Museum, Den Gamle By (TheMayor Jacob Bundsgaard explains why becoming the European Capital of Culture 2017 will bring long-term economic and social benefits to the city of Aarhus CULTURE & HERITAGE 201Old Town), and Moesgaard Museum. The travel guide also fell for the city's striking architecture. In recent years, Aarhus has changed dramatically. Today, we are a strong national growth centre with a signicant international prole, as well as a leading city of knowledge, culture and education. The city has grown substantially in size and importance, and playsa central role in the development of the entire region. And, with European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017, we are unveiling the true magnitude of our potential. The importance of culture In today's world, we need to understand the concept of culture in a very broad sense. Culture is a driving force and a key to resolving many of the challenges that cities and society face, now and in the future. At the same time, culture and creativity are also an impor- tant brand, not just for our own pride in living andworking here, but also for making our region attractive to new citizens and businesses. Fundamentally, the Capital of Culture project is about creating a city that oers a wealth of possibilities which will be available in years to come - to companies, employees, families and students. Because Aarhus oers them talent, security, quality and options. In other words, because Aarhus is a place where you can live a good life. \"In 2016, the international travel guide Lonely Planet ranked Aarhus number two on its list of the summer's hottest European travel destinations. Only surpassed by the Peloponnese in Greece.\" Our year as European Capital of Culture will leave a lasting legacy. It will change our city and our region for the better for years to come on the foundation of our core values; sustainability, diversity and democracy. Increased international visibility will attract many new and returning visitors, generating growth for our businesses, including the creative industries. But rst and foremost, our European Capital of Culture year willleave us with a new self-awareness. When 2018 arrives, we will have experienced what we can truly achieve when we create something extraordinary together. This joint experience is essential for the legacy we, asEuropean Capital Culture Aarhus 2017, will pass on to the region and to the rest of Denmark. We have reached a new level. We must sustain ourmomentum and use Aarhus 2017 - and culture in gen- eral - to drive further development. We must continue to set new ambitious goals we can achieve together. Aarhus 2017 has provided us with a catalyst and a new beginning - our work begins in earnest in 2018. Jacob Bundsgaard Mayor of AarhusThe City of Aarhus www.aarhus.dk Mayor Jacob BundsgaardFINANCE 202How does the pension world look in 2017? Fifty is the new 40, 60 is the new 50 and everyone is worried about funding retirement, or that is what the newspapers would have you think. For most people, the reality is somewhere in between. Weare living longer and people are increasingly aware that the State Pension alone will not provide them with theretirement they aspire to. At the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), we represent over 1,300 employee pension schemes with more than 20 million members - some of them local government schemes. This makes us the voice ofpensions and lifetime savings in Westminster, Whitehall and Brussels with our main focus being on getting more money into retirement savings, getting more value out of these savings and helping to build the condence and understanding of savers. What does the diverse pension's landscape look like at the moment? Firstly, today's pensioners are better o than any pre- vious generation. A 30% increase in average incomes over the past 15 years alone. As incomes of workingage people continue to stagnate, there is now some evidence to suggest they're better o than younger people for perhaps the rst time ever. What's behind this success story? Part of it is pensioners themselves. Increasing num- bers are choosing to work past retirement age, gener- ating extra income and making the label 'pensioner' misleading. Part of it is short-term government policy and the impact of the triple lock which has seen State Pensions rise by more than both inflation and earnings growth over the past decade. The biggest part though is the decisions employers made 50 or 60 years ago, introducing generous nal salary pension schemes to large parts of British industry. Pay-outs from thosepension schemes are just about reaching their peak and many - by no means all - pensioners are reaping the benets. These circumstances won't be repeated again. More and more people will, we think, continue to work well into retirement. But employers across the private sector have largely closed their nal salary schemes and the triple lock, as John Cridland's recent review of state pension age made clear, isn't aordable beyond this Parliament unless we want to see State Pension age rise well above 70.Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association's Graham Vidler shares his expectations for the pension world in 2017 and the next generation of pensioners Graham Vidler, Director External AffairsFINANCE 203What are the prospects for future generations? In 2008, the Pensions Act introduced automatic enrolment (AE) which meant that employers must put certain sta members into a pension scheme and make contributions to this scheme. Naturally, therewere caveats as - for example - a person needs to earn\u00a310,000 per year before being automatically enrolled into a scheme and the self-employed are currently exempt. There is also the option for a person to opt-out as the idea behind the scheme was to improve a person's retirement nances but not by drastically reducing their current standard of living. With around 7 million people enrolled into a workplace pension, low-opt out rates and high levels of compli- ance amongst SMEs, it is generally agreed that AE has been successful. The government has launched theirAutomatic Enrolment Review 2017 to review progress and determine the strategy going forward. One area that it is expected to tackle is contribution levels. Cur-rently, the employer contributes 1% of the employee's salary and the employee contributes a further 1%. This is due to rise to 2% (employee 3%) in April 2018 andthen 3% (employee 5%) in April 2019. However, while these increases are welcome, research suggests they may need to be higher. Challenges Our research suggests that 13.6 million workers are at risk of falling short of an adequate retirement income. Put simply, having too little saved to maintain theirlifestyle into retirement. Analysis suggests that in order to meet this target, people need to contribute 12% oftheir salary which may be dicult for lower income earners. Another challenge the pension system is facing is the varying expectations, advantages and approaches that the dierent generations have. The baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) have often ben- eted from dened benet pensions and signicant house price growth while Generation X (those born between 1961 and 1981) has found it harder to get onto the property ladder, see increases to the State Pension age and missed out on the roll-out of AE. The millennials who may well have been enrolled into an AE scheme at the start of their career are also facing the spectre of tuition fees and the impact of the house price growth that the baby boomers are enjoying. This is not a simple conundrum to manage but arguably the most important step is to encourage each generation to make proactive retirement provision. One issue that could undermine this essential engagement is if larger pension schemes fail or if we see similarheadlines to the BHS debacle. The UK has a long history of providing employees with a workplace pension, in fact there are 27.3 million people in the UK who are beneting, or will benet from a DB scheme 1. However, a combination of social, political and economic issues mean that members of schemes with the weakest employers* have just a50:50 chance of seeing their benets paid in full. To tackle this issue, the PLSA launched a Dened Benet Taskforce in March 2016. The aim was to get to the heart of the issues facing the DB system by seeking views and evidence from schemes of all sizes, as well as sponsors, regulators, government and intermediaries. The rst report - published in October 2016 - identied the scope of the problem while the second report - pub- lished in March 2017 - suggested potential solutions. Consolidation whether it be via shared services, asset pooling, a single governance structure or the creation of a superfund was mooted. The PLSA intends to publish a third report in the summer which looks at how this might work in practice. Arguably, it is impossible to outline all the challenges facing UK pensions in just 1,000 words but fundamen- tally, the most important point to take from this article is that action is needed by individuals, government and employers to ensure that it can provide people with the retirement they not only want but expect. * = schemes which hold 42% of liabilities of schemes in decit 1 Occupational Pension Scheme Survey, ONS September 2016.

In particular, the eects of the structural change from a coal and steel city \"to the third greenest city\" in Germany were highlighted in theexplanatory statement of the jury. This means that Essen plays a pioneering role for many cities in Europe that are now undergoing structural change. Essen's vision of the future is that of a prospering, sus- tainable, livable city that is resistant to climate changeand oers its citizens a healthy environment. Essen promotes green infrastructure with high quality of air and water, parks with a great recreational value, an innovative and environmentally friendly (green) econ- omy, integrative education and future-oriented mobility concepts. All of these aspects are part of the goals we want to achieve in the near future: a model split of 25% each by the year 2035 (25% public transport, 25% cartrac, 25% bicycle trac, 25% pedestrian), reduction of CO 2output by 40% by 2020, and 20,000 green jobs by 2025, to name just a few examples. Therefore the programme of the European Green Capital 2017 will address in total 12 \"green\" topics, from climate change, urban transport and air qualityto waste generation, water management and energy eciency. Our aim is to trigger sustainable processes and developments that will lastingly secure the quality of life in our city, or possibly even improve it further. Indoing so, we will use existing synergies with regional projects of the Ruhr Metropolis, but also with project partners at national, European and international level. Five key themes have been developed to prepare the content of our programme for this year, each involving a multitude of events, congresses, projects and activities:My paths: activities focusing on mobility aspects. My rivers: an exploration of the conversion of the Emscher system and of the project \"ESSEN - New Ways to the Water\". My green spaces: green areas in the city, citizenship, resilience, sustainable forestry and transformation. My shopping: sustainable behavior in daily life. My future: new jobs in the green economy, innovative developments and facets of environmental education. The various projects, actions and events proposed aspart of our Green Capital year are grouped under these headings. Through and through green One of the milestones of the year 2017 will undoubt- edly be the conversion and restoration of Emscher.The river, straightened and strapped into a concrete bed, still transports the sewage from the northernEssen was granted the prestigious title of European Green Capital 2017.

Not only the renaturation of streams, but also theformer industrial areas, can already be found in Essen in many places. The 23-hectare Krupp Park, which was built on the grounds of the former Krupp cast ironworks, is impressive. In the immediate vicinity of the ThyssenKrupp company center, which has been awarded the German Sustainable Building Association for its ecient energy supply concept, the use of sus-tainable technologies and building materials, as wellas an energy-ecient heating and cooling concept. Even a long-cherished wish of the Essenes is fullled, ifin the popular recreation area around Lake Baldeneysee in the south of the city bathing in the Ruhr due to the now very good water quality becomes possible.The \"Neues Wege zum Wasser\" (cycle paths), signposted cycle routes have been developed throughout the city, mostly on former railway routes connecting the Emscherand the Ruhr Valley with three North-South connections. In the Essen area, the \"Radschnellweg Ruhr\" (RS1) has already become a reality in a section that will lead more than 100 km through the metropolis. Park and greenery in the city About 1,600 hectares of the Essen city area are used as parks. Essen's oldest publicly accessible green areais the city garden. Today green spaces are spread over the entire city and oer visitors the opportunity to relax and make use of these green spaces which are on their doorstep.The Grugapark Essen is one of the most beautiful and largest folk-districts in Europe, with its botanical garden, an animal park, a game and sports paradise, a health and spa oer, the numerous meadows, playgrounds and the concert arena. It originated from the Great Ruhr Garden Exhibition 1929. Even on former industrial sites such as the Zollverein coal mine, which has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001, nature has recaptured vast areas, which can be discovered on the \"Route of the Industries\". The title \"Green Capital of Europe 2017\" puts the city of Essen in the European focus. Through the support of the European networks and EU funding, many planned measures for a viable and livable city will be even better implemented in the future. The main focus in 2017 will be on the citizens of Essen. Our aim is to awaken the curiosity to deal with the green topics in our city, encourage residents to join in, and create the future of our city together. Therefore our claim is: Green up your life. Thomas KufenLord MayorCity 206Harnessing data to transform city management In the UK and around the world, Smart City initiatives are providing innovative solutions to the key urban challenges we face. From population growth to energy consumption and the protection of our natural resources, these smart technology solutions are pointing towards a future in which we can use our assets more intelligently. From Milton Keynes, to Melbourne and Jaipur, new technology is being applied to improve trac flow, help communities optimise their fuel use and even maximise waste disposal eciency. The key to the success of these initiatives is data and building a bank of knowledge from the real world, based on the way humans interact with their environ- ment. Smart analysis of information from sensors within cities is the foundation from which we can plan for future developments and now, with more data at our disposal, we are starting to see exactly how this can transform the management of our cities. Informing decisions The overarching vision behind Smart Cities is to harness the latest technology to make better use of niteresources, to reduce consumption and manage costs. At a time when many cities have reached saturation point with over-stretched public services as well as, road and rail infrastructures which are struggling to meet demand, they are pointing the way to a future in which cities are cleaner, greener and more cost ecient. The rst step in this road to improvement is to under- stand exactly how we use our assets now. To this end,sensors located across many, diverse resources in the city systems are providing valuable information on everything from water consumption to pollution levels,trac volumes, public transport, parking and domestic energy use. New developments in low powered, low cost sensors and improvements in connectivity means that there is even more potential for this data to beData is being used in city management to overcome many urban challenges. Here, Upendra Dharmadhikary, Vice President at Tech Mahindra explains THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 207gathered from around cities. Thanks to the latest advancements in big data analytics, this information isnow becoming the driving force for developing smart solutions to urban challenges and informing how we can make real and lasting changes to city management. This is something we understand from rst-hand expe- rience; our own work as one of the technology partners in Milton Keynes and other smart cities globally, means we have developed a data hub which takes in informa- tion from central intelligence feeds, infrastructure net- works, such as energy, public transport and water, satellite, thermal imagery and even social media, to support planning and management decision-making. Practical resource management Applying this in practice means we can understand how key services are operating and where savings or improvements can be made. For example, sensors and videos from roads can feedback live transport and con- gestion information, or pinpoint specic locations where urgent road maintenance is needed. Collecting this information centrally avoids the need for wasted,routine journeys to be made. Similarly, smart sensors on waste bins can send alerts to a central dashboard when they're full, to maximise waste disposal eciency as the refuse-collection trucks are sent out on more fuel-ecient routes based on which bins need to be emptied. We can manage the luminosity of street lights more eciently to conserve energy use and even assess, more accurately, when there are flood risks in a city. A new initiative is also now helping citizens to take charge of their energy use. An online platform inMilton Keynes enables households to organise and manage their own community energy schemes, using building data as well as satellite and thermal imagery. The objective is to encourage local businesses to develop lasting installation and maintenance capabilities and for communities to have collective bargaining power. Armed with information on their home energy performance and heat dissipation, for instance, house- holds could join forces and even instigate crowd buying with a particular energy supplier to get volume discounts. In the future, we can also provide information on which energy usage is cheaper at a specic point in time by measuring and analysing dierent sources, whether it's traditional energy going into homes and buildings, wind, solar or battery power. This has the potential to deliver more dynamic forms of energy management for households. Harnessing data from dierent sources will not only inform the decisions made by local and central govern- ment, but can also give more control back to the citizens themselves. Through the intelligent analysis of data, we can improve the quality of services delivered and make real changes to the residents' quality of life. Upendra Dharmadhikary www.twitter.com/Tech_Mahindra Upendra Dharmadhikary, Vice PresidentVarberg takes responsibility - again For the coastal city of Varberg, Sweden, 2015 was the year when the community united in a joint effort to take responsibility for peace and human rights - just as they did at an international peace summit held there one hundred years before. The municipality has an active role to play and views the project as an extension of the work towards its vision of developing the city of Varberg as the Swedish West Coast's creative hotspot, with the help of local residents. As the 100th anniversary of a significant peace summit approached, here in Varberg we chose a different way to celebrate. The result was the VARBERG CALLING for Peace project, with the aim of engaging and involving residents in actively working for peace and a sustainable society. The basic idea is to draw attention to the local and international history of peace, and in doing so combine the forces of Varberg's administrative bodies, organisations, civil society and local residents to increase awareness of the important perspectives that are vital for peace and a sustainable future. It is also important to encourage participation in order to highlight issues of democracy, human rights, cultural understanding and sustainable environment, and to examinethem in greater detail. Also for there to be a legacy once the project has ended, which can be built on and will provide support for future development.Greater awareness of the age in which we are living and a common educational perspective on our history provide the conditions for future creativity, innovation and action. We believe that the big, universal human issues can unite many, both organisations and individuals. Thinking globally and taking into consideration situation analysis and environmental and resource perspectives cannot be restricted to municipal or national borders. VARBERG CALLING for Peace is an opportunity, therefore, for Varberg municipality to take a forward-looking, general approach to sustainable development in a project that involves local residents. Engagement on humanitarian issues and the all-pervading problems we now face in the world around us may also increase interest in important issues at local level. The project therefore represents a step towards the realisation of Varberg's plan: Vision 2025 \"Swedish West Coast's creative hotspot\" and a sustainable future. Christina Josefsson Head of the Culture and Leisure department The City of Varberg Photo: Mimmi Persson Come to Varberg. Share our vision.varberg.seInspiring people to create everyday peace The city's local education centre, Campus Varberg, is today the largest vocational college in the Halland region and is one of Sweden's leading providers of vocational education. The core values at Campus Varberg include knowledge, innovation and creativity, and it was not long before it became involved in the VARBERG CALLING for Peace project. At the college's events and management course a number of students are running their own projects as part of VARBERG CALLING for Peace. Here they tell us about the solid peace work they have done, which has given them valuable experiences. \"We are studying on a three-year events and management course and during February and March we studied a course in 'project-based development work',\" explains Lina Rundbom, one of the students. \"During the course, we had the opportunity to choose from a number of assignments to work on and we five chose 'VARBERG CALLING'. We had to examine and communicate the questions 'What do you stand for?' and 'How can you get strangers to talk to one another?' to the general public.\" The assignment came from the two process managers for VARBERG CALLING for Peace, Malin Bellman and Jon Liinason.\"They gave us some good advice before we started. 'Don't think - just do it and see what happens!' they said. So we did. We tried out our ideas on people using quick and easy prototype tests, with the results leading to new ideas.\" One of the prototype tests involved leaving a bicycle in the entrance to the city's galleria. The girls left the bicycle \"right in the way\" and stood a few metres away to see how people reacted. Contrary to what you might expect, most people did not seem particularly irritated. It gave some people something to talk about as they wondered why the bicycle was there. Another was the mobile \"everyday peace cycle caf\u00e9\". Loaded up with coffee and pastries, the bicycle was pushed around to various parts of the city, offering coffee and cakes for free.They asked the people they met how we can create everyday peace. Smile at someone you don't know, pick up litter, and hold open the door for someone were some of the suggestions. \"It really doesn't need to be any more difficult than that,\" says Lina. \"Everyone can do something. The cool thing was seeing how our own positive energy clearly spread to those people we were talking to.\" Annette Wenklo THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 210Integrating data lifecycles to enable circular economy in construction At PCSG we have for a while now been helping clients throughout the built environment to understand the potential benets of a circular economy for construction, enabled by digital processes. With the rapid growth of digital awareness and tech- nologies, solutions to many of the barriers to throughlifecycle thinking are emerging. \"A circular economy is one that is restorative and regenerative by design, and which aims to keep prod- ucts, components and materials at their highest utilityand value at all times, distinguishing between technical and biological cycles.\" - Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Through the CPA's recent report on the Future for Construction Product Manufacturing, we identied the need to consider digitally connected supply chains, and to link manufacturing, design and delivery of assets with performance in use. We need to consider how to deliver mass customisation of buildings (the ability to have unique, but economic and deliverable assets), along with construction flexibility and in-use adaptabil- ity if we are to optimise the lifecycle of a building. Construction flexibility enables the same building to be constructed in a number of ways using the same components, and also to cope with changes in user requirements during the design and delivery phase ofan asset. In-use adaptability enables the building to be re-con- gured or adapted, regarding layout or performance through its lifecycle. As John Turner said, \"an environ- ment is an environment by virtue of the life that it surrounds\". The way a building is used over time can change signicantly as occupant requirements change, whether a complete change of use from a home to an oce for example or a change driven by the inventionof new technologies, such as the invention of the refrig- erator eliminating the need for a larder. By enabling a building to be recongured, we can potentially extend its lifecycle to maintain its suitability. To achieve mass customisation, construction flexibility and in-use adaptability, we need to be able to share digital product information consistently all the way through the lifecycle of a project and an asset's lifecy-cle. To do so, and to enable a circular economy, we also need to consider the product lifecycle, and how prod- ucts can be designed, manufactured and installed ready to be re-used. Re-used not necessarily at the end of their useful life, but also the useful life in the context of the wider asset. Disparate lifecycles in construction To achieve a circular economy in construction, the 3 disparate lifecycles of building projects, built assets and construction products have to be integrated. All of these lifecycles currently include digital processes to some degree. A construction project delivered to Level 2 BIM - a digital twin of the physical asset - is created which then supports its management throughout the asset'soperational phase. The asset lifecycle entails the construction, maintenance, reconguration and eventual re-use or re-cycling of assembled products at the end of the asset's life. A range of digital tools are deployed to manage this process. A product lifecycle includes its design and develop- ment, procurement of materials, manufacture and then delivery and installation as part of a built asset. All of these require digital processes, which are not currently typically extended through the operationalPCSG Senior BIM Consultant, Steve Thompson, explains how digitalisation is opening up opportunities for a more circular economy approachTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 211phase of an asset. Within the current fragmented construction industry, it is common for manufacturers to lose track of their products past the point of sale, leaving a signicant gap in knowledge on where aproduct is, how it is performing in use and when it isready for replacement or re-use. This gap can be lled using the likes of the CPA's LEXiCON to consistently dene and share product information all the way through the product and asset lifecycle. Integration and optimisation of 3 life cycles The CPA report describes how these lifecycles can be optimised through integrating the virtual and physical environments, with the potential to deliver assets up to 40% quicker and 30% cheaper. Benets from a circular economy in construction through integrated data By following the circular economy approach, each of the 3 traditional lifecycles will benet in turn. The cre- ators of buildings, including designers, engineers and construction rms will be able to customise designsand optimise design options eliminating the risk of value engineering and compromising the original design intent. Advanced generative design technologies such as RST are enabling fully resolved digital models to link mass customisation of buildings all the way through to the manufacture and delivery of built assets. The nanciers and owners of buildings will be able to eliminate the as-designed and as-built performance gap, achieve delivery on time and budget while reduc- ing risk in their commercial models. The flexibility of an asset will be further enhanced, and the asset use cycle optimised, including the potential and value of reconguration and optimising (including potentially shortening) the lifecycle of a building. Manufacturers will fully understand the value and performance of their products in use, enabling new business models such as leasing products or selling performance rather than product. UK PLC can benet by reducing the need for raw materials and product imports while creating a new industry for reverse logis- tics of products and materials, enabled by collaborativedigital platforms to share and re-sell products and identify their value and where they can best re-enterthe supply chain. Therefore, a digitally-enabled supply chain deliversproducts and systems to be re-used, re-distributed, re-manufactured and recycled over an asset's life. The more standard this approach becomes, the easier it will be to re-use design assets, across the UK and inter-nationally and achieve carbon savings for one of the world's most resource-hungry industries. A recent report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation has suggested a potential benet for the EU of over \u20ac130bn by 2030through a circular economy within the built environment alone, largely enabled by the digital economy. So we need to begin sharing the digital product and process data to enable this to happen and to re-think traditional supply chain and industry boundaries to start to make this happen. If you would like to learn more about the digitisation of construction product data and its role in driving the circular economy, please contact Steve Thompson at enquiries@pcsg.co.uk . Steve Thompson PCSG Senior Steve Thompson, PCSG Senior ConsultantBuildings are often demolished due to a needed conversion or change of the architectural design, although the supporting struc- ture remains completely undamaged and fully intact. This leads to huge quantities of waste which need to be discharged on mining tips. Thus, the building sector is generating a large amount of CO2emissions, resource consumption and waste production. Given the high resource-intensity and CO2emissions of the sector, new eco- construction approaches are needed. Demountable construction Demountable building constructions are defined as structures which allow destruction-free dis- and re-assembly responding to changing structural demands, revitalisation or removal. This could only be reached by design- ing modular, flexible, adaptable and upgradable structural components with detachable connections. But it is not sufficient to consider only the erection phase of the elements, they must be optimised in terms of mate- rials ageing and energy consumption in an integrated situation within an overall building concept. The idea ofdeveloping construction systems which are demountable is not new. Although, many precast structures have been erected in the meantime, the reuse of complete structural ele- ments is still not practiced. The advan- tages of reuse, with a saving of energy consumption, raw material and CO 2 emissions are obvious. Furthermore, no waste is produced which is needed to be discharged on building rubble dump. So the question rises why the idea of demountable construction could not been pushed forward until now. \"The current research of INCEEN is driven by the aim to reduce energy and resource use throughout the entire life-cycle of buildings and their components.\" The raisons are manifold. One major reason is certainly that this kind of con- struction needs a change in philoso- phy: first of all, the architect is limited in his design as he has to align to a given grid. So the development of architectural typologies and adapted constructive principles are necessary to permit the reutilisation of whole ele- ments after one life cycle. Further- more, these architectural principles should also allow a reuse of the build- ing in case of conversion. Then new deconstruction methods have to be developed: e.g. renders, insulation, floor covers, screeds are fixed to the structure so that an easy disassembly is not anymore possible. Here, new techniques have to be developed which allow after the first live cycle of the building an easy disassembly and cleaning. Another major reason is cer- tainly that after the first life cycle of a building often the information about the load bearing structure and other performance criteria is not any more available. Retracing the informationabout one single load bearing element with its reinforcement position, grade, diameters, concrete cover and con- crete class etc. is difficult. Often the documents of the statics and the struc- tural design are not anymore available. Furthermore, a condition assessment of these elements must also take place to assess the remaining load bearing capacity. Another major aspect is that no circular economy market is yet installed which would provide schemes and solutions for the deconstruction, transport, condition assessments, temporary storage and reuse of whole structural elements. Thus, the systematic integration of large quantities of elements in new buildings needs new concepts on different levels and a change in thebuilding process without forgettingthe client who must accept to invest in a new building which load bearingstructure is a conglomerate of old structural elements. All these aspects are currently addressed in research projects of the Institute of Civil Engineering and Envi-ronment (INCEEN), a sub-structure regrouping the civil engineers of the research unit of engineering sciences at the University of Luxembourg. The overarching mission of INCEEN is to solve scientific questions and to develop new scientific and technical methods for sustainable buildings. By doing so, it aims to advance the level of scientific understanding in key-University of Luxembourg's Prof. Dr.-Ing. Dani\u00e8le Waldmann-Diederich explains how demountable construction responds to changing structural demandsDemountable construction enables structural diversity 212PROFILEdomains relevant to the next building generation, including modular con- struction, applying principles of the circular economy. Further INCEEN aims to catalyse interdisciplinary research collaborations in the areas of structural engineering and the envi-ronment, as well as contributing to solving sustainability challenges of the built environment sector responsible for a large amount of CO 2emissions and resource consumption. INCEEN has strong research experience in the design of reinforced/prestressed con- crete, steel and composite structures and structural health monitoring. The current research of INCEEN is driven by the aim to reduce energy and resource use throughout the entire life-cycle of buildings and their components. By showing how build- ings can be used as material and com- ponent banks, the research projects of INCEEN seeks to trigger a paradigm shift in the construction sector. Theresearch also analyses the possibility of business models based on loaning materials and components to cus-tomers. Therefore the applicability of monitoring systems in structural components by internal electronic chips (RFID) which are readable fromoutside guaranteeing a provision of allrelevant information for a reconstruc- tion or reutilisation in future reuses will be developed and tested. To sum up, the concepts to be devel- oped are based on the investigation of a wide spectrum of factors, taking into account different (often competing) technical, ecological and economic constraints imposed by planning,design, pre-fabrication, on-site opera- tions, as requirements forrefurbishment and demolition/recy- cling at the end of a building's life-cycle.Understanding sustainable construc- tion as an important componenttowards the reduction of the totalresources-related footprint of a build- ing, it is evident that only an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to such a multi-objective constrained optimisa- tion problem can be successful.

Add this together with a reduced need for applied nishes, and concrete is increasingly recognised and utilised by design teams in the delivery of the most sustainableprojects. Speaking at the Ecobuild event on 7 March, Elaine Toogood - Senior Architect at The Concrete Centre presented a seminar on Sustainable Concrete and pointed out that: \"The inherent benets of concrete mean it does not need any other treatment to make it perform, to make it reproof. This, and many of the other performance benets of concrete are often not discussed as sustain- ability benets, and they should be.\" The whole-life performance Sustainability is largely about getting the fabric right. Using the thermal mass of concrete within a natural ventilation strategy can reduce the amount of energy required for heating and cooling, therefore reducing the total amount of energy we use in a building. But that's not the whole story. Examining the whole-life performance is also a key part. Understanding the impact that dierent design choices have on the whole-life of a building is key. The emphasis is shifting between embodied and operational impacts, but the best answer needs to consider the lifecycle of the building's components and materials and their contribution to minimising the overall impact over the whole-life of a building.Concrete comes in a whole variety of forms includingo-the-shelf precast products, cast in situ concrete, bespoke precast or hybrid concrete solutions. If you're a specier you are able to assess the manufacturers product data and going forward this is more and more likely to be in the form of an EPD (Environmental Per- formance Declaration). Manufacturers will provide EPDs specic to their product range and the concrete industry is developing generic EPDs that are useful at the early stages of a project. Reducing carbon The industry is doing an enormous amount to reduce its carbon footprint, but speciers also have a role toplay here by stipulating they want lower carbon forms of concrete. Elaine Toogood, again speaking at Ecobuild this year commented: \"We as speciers can request concrete mixes with a lower carbon footprint, such as those using cementitu- ous materials that include fly ash or ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS).\"Concrete is increasingly recognised in the delivery of the most sustainable projects. Here, PBC Today outline the role of specifiers in this process Elaine Toogood, Senior Architect at The Concrete Centre speaking at Ecobuild 2017THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 215GGBS is a by-product recovered from the blast furnaces used in the production of iron, and fly ash is a by-product of coal-red power stations. By using these materials, the overall greenhouse gas emissionsassociated with the production of concrete is reduced, and you can make serious reductions in a project's embodied carbon footprint. New standards and guidance At present it is common practice in Britain to use cement combinations with either fly ash or GGBS (used with Portland cement). Other cement combinations are also allowed within BS 8500 including those usingsilica fume and limestone. The concrete industry is currently coordinating an inves- tigation on the use of nely ground limestone as part of ternary or three component cements, also including fly ash or GGBS. The aim is for this to be introduced intothe concrete standard for the UK (it is already permittedin Ireland and other European countries). There is a great deal of research going on in the back- ground for alternative types of cements. The standard produced last year: PAS 8820:2016 Construction mate - rials was developed allowing the use of alkali activated cements (AAC) in some concrete applications. Recycled aggregates In the drive to remain sustainable it is worth considering the use of recycled aggregate in the concrete specied for a project. When specifying recycled aggregate to reduce embodied carbon, it is important to check what is available locally to the site. Natural aggregates have such a low carbon footprint that a source of recycled aggregates traveling more than around 15km by road is likely to have higher embodied carbon than a local supply of natural aggregate. THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 216Another factor when using recycled aggregates is consistency of supply. There are strict protocols for the testing of aggregates for use in concrete, and there are permitted quantities of recycled aggregate, depending upon the type as well as the strength and exposure class of the concrete being designed. It's important to bear in mind that there are also various secondary aggregates, that are classed as a type of recycled aggregate for use in concrete. These are by-products of other industries and include chinaclay waste from the South West of England, often referred to as stent. Material eciency Elaine went on to explain how concrete oers theopportunity for material eciency, urging designers touse the performance benets of concrete and optimise its use by considering low waste solutions and ecient design as a way to reduce the amount of other materials needed in the construction. \"Unlike many other materials, a concrete structure can provide a good, robust nish without the need for additional coatings or linings to provide the necessary long life performance, re resistance or acoustic isola- tion necessary to meet building standards. The savings on resources to install and repair these nishes canadd up to signicant material savings over the lifetime of a building.\" \"This whole life perspective is crucial if we are to move towards a circular economy.\" explains Elaine. \"A good approach is to design a building that can be used and then reused, extending its usable life and thereby save resources. This can add up to a low whole-life carbon solution.\" Concrete is often designed to last for 100 years at no extra cost, oering plenty of opportunity for an extended service life of a building or structure. Furthermore, when the time eventually comes to demolish it, concrete can be crushed and reused. \"At the point it's crushed up, it actually starts absorbing CO 2due to the extra surface exposed to the air. This end of life carbonation is fairly new to our understanding, but can make an impact of the whole-life carbon proleof a building.\" Specify responsibly sourced concrete Responsible sourcing for construction materials is a similar concept to Fairtrade standards for food. Elaine Toogood told the audience at Ecobuild that: \"BES 6001 is a responsible sourcing standard available for all construction materials and is the one the concrete industry has embraced. Around 90% of all concrete produced in the UK is responsibly sourced to BES 6001. This is quite an achievement, but of course facilitated by the fact that unlike most other structural materials concrete is almost always made in the UK from UK sourced materials. This is a fundamental sustainability benet, underpinning the core social, economic and environmental credentials of concrete for use in a sustainable built environment.\" Further reading is available on the Concrete Centre website including the Whole-Life Carbon and Buildings and Specifying Sustainable Concrete documents.

Currently, the global food system is under pres- sure with stresses like climate change, socio-economicfluctuations and emerging diseases, conning our ability to eectively use resources such as land, fresh water and energy. At the same time, a growing global populationand the dietary shifts of a more auent society are creating an ever-increasing demand for food. These tensions are likely to lead to unpredictable disruptions to food production and supply globally and in the UK, as just under half of the UK food supply is imported. 1 In the face of these stresses, new knowledge is required to identify ways to build resilience of the food system at a national and international level. Achieving thiswhilst ensuring food remains safe and aordable and consumer trust is maintained is a complex objective and will require joined up approaches across the varied actors of the food supply chain, as well as a combination of knowledge from dierent research disciplines. Global Food Security The Global Food Security (GFS) programme, a partner- ship of the UK's main public research funders, coordi- nates collaboration across food security research areas, by bringing together funders, researchers, policy makers and practitioners to address key issues on global food security and agriculture. As a result of GFS' activity BBSRC , NERC , ESRC and the Scottish Govern - ment have committed \u00a314.5M to support interdiscipli- nary research to address the food system resilience challenge. The 'Resilience of the UK Food System in a Global Context' research programme aims to generate in-depth understanding of how the food system functions and how its many components interact. Theprogramme is designed to push researchers outside their comfort disciplinary zones. Projects will integrate natural and social sciences but also aim to drive inno- vation and research translation into policy and practice by involving end-users throughout the research process. The programme's main priorities focus around optimising food production systems, local and interna- tional supply chains, and influencing food choices for better health. The ambition is that research from this programme will provide the evidence base needed to underpin the UK's strategic approach to food securityand will inform how we monitor, manage and mitigate short and long-term risks to food production and supply. A changing world requires an interdisciplinary approach to research if we are to build a more resilient food system, says GFS's Evangelia Kougioumoutzi ENVIRONMENT 219Through the programme's rst Call 5 interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects tack- ling dierent aspects of the food system resilience have been funded. These projects vary from taking holistic approaches, developing models, food system shock scenarios or integrating knowledge across dierentfood system actors for better adaptation to change, to more focused approaches assessing the sustainabilityof specic supply chains or whole industry sectorsagainst a range of risks. A new set of proposals will be funded through the programme's 2nd call which will beannounced in August this year. The programme's research community is working closely with the programme coordinator, Dr John Ingram and his team from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. Researchers and the Programme Coordinator will work together to facil- itate knowledge exchange, build links between projects, researchers and end-users to integrate research outputs which could inform policy and practise. Thisway, the programme aspires to build a legacy by using the research outputs to feed into the development of a UK strategic approach to food security.

Bananas are the most popular fruit in the world by production. More than five billion bananas are purchased in Britain each year, and the UK accounts for around 7% of the global export market. Bananas are so impor- tant to the global economy that the EU and USA have fought trade wars over them. Now, the impacts of climate change, emerging plant diseases, and economic uncertainty threaten the banana supply chain, potentially impacting diet and nutrition in importing nations, as well as the livelihoods of producers in the developing world. The University of Exeter project brings together biolo- gists, ecologists, economists and social scientists with the UN FAO, NGOs and businesses to address the resilience of the banana supply chain from planta- tion to fruit bowl. Bananas serve as an example of a major, wholly-imported commodity to the UK. Whatever the long-term result, the immediate impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU has seen a rapid drop in the value of the pound, leading to concerns over the costs of imports to the British consumer. The Consumer Price Index, stable from 2014 to the beginning of 2016, has risen sharply since the beginning of the year. Food price rises are of particular con- cern because of the impact they can have on poorer families. Consumers have benefited from food price defla- tion since the summer of 2014, but this could well change. Justin King, former CEO of Sainsbury's, has suggested that supermarket prices will rise by at least 5% over the next six months, as retail- ers eventually pass on price rises. As pointed out by Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's current chief executive, we live in a globalised world from which cheaper alternatives can be sourced. Hence, the shock of our reduced purchasing power could reverberate through our trade networks. Global Food Security: Bananas on the agenda Economic resilience refers to the abil- ity of an economy to absorb sudden changes, or shocks, and quickly return to normal. Resilience of the food system has been high on the policy agenda since the global financial crisis of 2008, which doubled food prices in the space of a few weeks. Global food prices declined again at the beginning of 2016, but have since increased. The danger of rapid price fluctuations is that planning becomes difficult; either producers are impoverished by unex- pectedly low revenues, or consumers are faced with expensive food. The negative impacts of non-resilientfood systems are so severe that the UK government has launched a major research initiative, the Global FoodSecurity programme, to tackle the issue. The programme is funding projects that bring together academics, non-govern- mental organisations, businesses and policymakers, to provide the knowledge and guidance needed to strengthenfood supply chains against future shocks. Recognising the interconnected nature of food supply, the programmewill address the resilience of the UK food system in a global context. \"Our team of ecologists, biologists, economists, and social scientists will work closely with the United Nations World Banana Forum, the UK charity Bananalink, and major retailers, to address diverse threats facing bananas. Our aim is to determine how emerging diseases and other factors like changing climate will affect banana production, and to test new methods for disease control.\" My colleagues and I at the University of Exeter are fortunate in leading one of the first projects within the GlobalFood Security programme. We have decided to look at a food that, while being incredibly popular, bears all thesigns of being highly vulnerable to production shocks: the banana. The UK is highly dependent upon imported fruit and vegetables, which make up 80% of the market. This compares with half of cereals and one sixth of meat and dairy produce. Fruit and vegetables are a key componentof a healthy diet, yet are often over-The future of the UK's favourite fruit hangs in the balance, but researchers from Exeter University are tackling the threat to the banana supply chainExeter University tackles banana supply chain threat 220PROFILElooked in studies of global food secu- rity, where the focus is on the major grains. Reliance on imported fruit and vegetables makes the UK vulnerable to instabilities in international produc-tion and supply, so jeopardising the resilience of the UK food system. A cheap and healthy snack This vulnerability is epitomised by the banana, the most popular fruit in the UK by consumption, and the most important fruit in the world by produc- tion. Bananas have significant health benefits, particularly in comparisonwith alternative 'snack' foods, such as cereal bars containing refined sugars, salt and fat. Bananas have a low glycaemic index and contain resistant starches rather than the 'free sugars' that contribute to diabetes, obesity and tooth decay. Bananas promote a healthy gut flora and consumption islinked to reduced tooth decay in children compared with more acidic fruit like apples and citrus. The banana is a cheap, healthy snack enjoyed by millions of Britons every day. However, scientists are increasingly concerned for the future of the banana. Recent expansion of the virulent fungal disease Fusarium wilt, also known as Panama Disease, has highlighted the extreme risk facing the global banana trade. Though many varieties are grown around the world for domestic consumption, the inter- national trade relies on a single sus- ceptible variety, Cavendish. Fusarium wilt destroyed the previous export variety 'Gros Michel' in the 1950s, but now there is no alternative resistant variety waiting in the wings, nor any known control for the disease. This strain of the disease emerged in Taiwan, covering Southeast Asia in the 1990s and spreading recently to Aus- tralia, Mozambique, and the Middle East. If this new strain of wilt reachesLatin America and the Caribbean, from where the EU (and US) purchase the vast majority of bananas, the most popular fruit in the UK could disappear from supermarkets. Not only would this dramatically alter UK diets, but producers and developing economies would be impacted with potentially farreaching consequences. Other pests and diseases are also emerging, many of which also lack viable controls. Banana supply chain particularly vulnerable The UK retail trade increases vulnera- bility in the system. The Fairtrade Foundation estimates that the con- sumer price of bananas has halved over the past decade, while produc- tion costs have doubled. Today, the wholesale import price of bananas matches the retail price: the margin is zero. Concern over social and environ- mental impacts of banana production has led to a significant market for Fair- trade and Organic-certified bananas. However, UK supermarkets have been engaged in a \"banana price war\", resulting in prices that are insufficient to adequately support producers, and reduce investment in improved production methods, development of new varieties, and social and environ-mental sustainability. If bananas are to remain a key component of the UK food system, analysis of these threats and mechanisms to counter them must be developed. Our team of ecologists, biologists,economists, and social scientists will work closely with the United Nations World Banana Forum, the UK charity Bananalink, and major retailers, to address diverse threats facing bananas. Our aim is to determine how emerging diseases and other factors like changing climate will affect bananaproduction, and to test new methods for disease control. Our research will complement devel- opment of new resistant tradable vari- eties and fundamental disease biology ongoing around the world. We will analyse how production shocks will affect the UK market, how the UK retail sector and consumers might respond, and how those responses could feed back to producers in the developing world. Through the World Banana Forum we will work with retailers, pro-ducer groups, and other stakeholders to produce strategies to increase the resilience of the banana trade to production shocks, and secure the future of the UK's favourite fruit. 221PROFILE Dr Daniel Bebber Senior Lecturer in Microbial Ecology Department Exeter Tel: +44 1392 725851d.bebber@exeter.ac.uk http://danbebber.org/ www.twitter.com/DanBebber Foods are produced by living organisms which, in order to deliver sufficient and whole- some products, need to thrive in a healthy environment. This is one basic assumption of the European White Paper on Food Safety, issued in 2000, that sets the conceptual bases for a food safety strategy \"from farm to fork\". Hence, the safety and quality of vegetable foods largely depend on the characteristics of water, soil and fer- tilisers; the safety and quality of foods of animal origin, in its turn, largely depends on those of feeding stuffs. A pillar of animal husbandry, feed, or specific feed ingredients, can be also a risk factor as well as a vehicle of con- taminants posing hazards to animal health and to consumer safety. Once again, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) deserve a special attentionbecause of multi-faceted potentials for exposure, pleiotropic effects and scientific uncertainties making it diffi- cult to establish \"safe\" levels. The risks associated to EDC in feeds present different scenarios. In some cases, EDC pose serious hazards to animal health and productivity, with- out posing significant concerns to consumer' health. A major example is zearalenone, a mycotoxin (i.e., a toxic by-product of microscopic moulds) contaminating grains. Zearalenone is a potent oestrogen-active ED which, even at low concentrations can jeop- ardise the reproductive capacity of aherd; pigs are especially sensitive. However, a significant hazard for animal health, zearalenone does not bio-accumulate and is readily metabolised; thus, foods of animal origin are just a minor source of zearalenone residues. Positive endocrine-active chemicals In some cases, endocrine-active chem- icals have positive effects on animal health, but usage levels must consider the carry-over to consumers. A tellingexample is the supplementation with iodine of feeding stuffs. Iodine is essential for thyroid function, a key component of the endocrine network; yet, an excessive assumption can hyper-stimulate and damage thyroid. Iodine is not deposited in tissues to any large extent, but is actively excreted in milk and, to a lesser extent, in eggs. Accordingly, in 2005 the Euro-pean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended the reduction of the maximum iodine levels authorised in feeds, upon the assessment of carry- over in milk and eggs and of the poten- tial exposure of consumers to excess iodine levels. In the meanwhile, EFSA assessed that the proposed reduction would not adversely affect animal nutrition. Upon some debate (indeed,risk managers were somewhat taken apart by an essential nutrient raising concern), the EFSA recommendation was accepted by the European Union. The major and most evident aspect of ED presence in feeds is the environ- ment-feed-food chain; under this respect, the EDC of top concern are those able to persist in the environ- ment and to bio-accumulate as lipophylic compounds: dioxins and other brominatedAlberto Mantovani and Chiara Frazzoli, scientists of the Italian National Health Institute, discuss the role of endocrine disrupting chemicals in feed-food chainsEndocrine disrupting chemicals: insecti- cides (DDT, hexachlorobenzene, etc.). A further addition to this list are the non-lipophylic but highly persistent perfluorinated chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, albeit the patterns of feed-food contamination have still to be characterised. \"The risks associated to EDC in feeds present different scenarios. In some cases, EDC pose serious hazards to animal health and productivity, without posing significant concerns to consumer' health.\" Persistent and bio-accumulating EDC are ubiquitous in feeds, but general two scenarios are highly liable toexposure. First, feeds or feed ingredi- ents of animal origin. Following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis, the use of feeds of animal origin in animal production is mostly limited to aquaculture. Conventional feeds for farmed fish are largely made withfats and proteins from small fishes or marine organisms: the highly-prized salmonids (salmon, trout, etc.) are particularly high-consumers of feedsof animal origin. In practice, aquacul- ture feeds reproduce the \"big fish eats small fish\" bioaccumulation chain of wildlife ecosystems. The levels of EDC in fatty fishes and/or large fishes have created serious concerns for con- sumer health, in particular for the pro- tection of the next generation, as well as jeopardizing the nutritional value of fish food. A workable solution, which was increasingly adopted in the last years, is the use of feed ingredients of vegetable origin which are definitelyless liable to bioaccumulation . Environmental influences The other critical scenario is when feed ingredients are highly exposed to envi-ronmental emissions: these include pastures or feeding plants harvested in polluted areas. Emission sources may be most various: fall-out from indus- trial or combustion processes (typical of dioxins), illicit burial of toxic waste eventually being taken by the roots of pasture plants, or contaminated water or fertilizers being spread on vegeta- bles intended to be used as feeds. The animals most critical for consumersexposure are dairy ruminants (not just cattle, but also goats and ewes, impor-tant dairy species in Southern Europe; also water buffaloes can be locally important and should not be over- looked). Dairy ruminants live much longer than meat-producing animals, thus have more time to bio-accumu- late, and use excretion in milk to reduce the body burden of lipophyllic EDC. Laying hens kept on ground and allowed to forage on ground, are also definitely more exposed to pollutants than other poultry. In order to manage environmental exposures in dairy ani-mals kept on pastures, it is importantto use animal biomonitoring in order to have early and timely flags that allow actions to be taken. For example the Italian project ALERT investigates the use of a patent developed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, in order to monitor and assess anomalies in a simultaneous panel of biochemical parameters in milk: the daily monitor- ing of these biomarkers is expected to identify early signals related to the contamination of animal feed, water for drinking, or farm premises. Overall, safe animal feed is useful to support a safe human diet in a \"one health\" conceptual framework, where protection of environment, farm ani- mals and human well-being mutually support each other. Regulations and controls should be enforced and, whenappropriate, updated: however, modi- fications of technologies and use of validated early markers in modernised self-monitoring plans are especiallyeffective approaches toward preven-tion.

One of many enemies standing at the gate: thousands of dierent insect species. Left unchecked, they competefor the food we eat and represent threats that could decimate our natural, agricultural, and urban land- scapes. If not for today's pest control measures, insects would ruin many of the crops grown in the U.S. Scientic research has provided a palette of measures and strategies to help farmers and ranchers, as well as gardeners, homeowners, and the general public, con- trol these insect pests. Many of these innovative tools and techniques are the direct result of the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). Thanks to ARS scientists, many large-scale insect-related problems - like screwworm infestations of livestock - are no longer on America's \"need-to-worry-about\" list. Ifnot for the sterile-male insect release technique pioneered by ARS researchers Drs. Edward F. Knipling and Raymond C. Bushland more than 6 decades ago, the flesh-eating screwworm would have decimated U.S. livestock production - just as it does today for many of our Central and South American neighbours. Unfortunately, science can't rest on past successes.That's because insects continue to invade, which researchers often learn about by comparing specimens to those maintained in the hundreds of ARS scientic col- lections. These collections provide a denitive resources for agricultural research to include the identication of invasive insects. Pests also evolve and are quite adept at developing countermeasures to overcome control meth- ods designed for them. In turn, that requires ARS scien- tists to nd newer and better approaches for controlling insects, a few of which are mentioned here. Don't let the harlequin bug's red and black clown suit fool you. There is nothing funny about the way this pest can destroy a whole eld of broccoli, Brusselssprouts, cauliflower, and other vegetables popular with urban and organic growers, as well as conventional farmers. ARS researchers are supercharging harlequinbug control. It all involves a synthetic version of the insect's own aggregation pheromone to use as a lure to either trap the bug directly or make so-called \"trap crops\" work eciently. Pheromones are chemicals that trigger social responses in others of the same species. In this case, when a male harlequin bug nds food, hereleases a pheromone to alert others to gather and feast - much like ringing a dinner bell. When researchers tested a synthetic version of thepheromone on plants under conditions similar to farm elds, harlequin bugs - old and young, male and female - came crawling and flying from many yards away. The technique allows growers to make trap crops - a lower-value alternative grown to lure pests away from higher-value crops - even more attractive.Chris Bentley, Agricultural Research Service - U.S. Department of Agriculture, explains why research must continue to protect crops from pests and insects Clown-colored harlequin bugs are no joke - H3ARS scientists developed a synthetic version of a harlequin bug pheromone to lure the bugs to trapsImage: \u00a9 Steve AusmusENVIRONMENT 225Protecting cotton from stink bugs Forget for a minute about the invasive brown mar- morated stink bug that has become such a common pest in homes, backyards, and farms in recent years.Cotton growers in the U.S. are concerned about native stink bugs that have attacked cotton and other crops for decades. ARS scientists have found environmentally friendly alternatives to insecticides for the 3 native stink bugs - namely, green (Chinavia hilaris), southern green(Nezara viridula), and brown (Euschistus servus) stink bugs - that continue to threaten U.S. cotton. Thanks to ARS research, growers are now planting trap crops such as grain sorghum to lure stink bugs awayfrom cotton. They're using pheromone-baited traps to capture and kill stink bugs, and are planting nectar-pro- ducing plants - such as milkweed and buckwheat - tofeed the stink bugs' Applying benecial nematodes to trees Peach facing a formidable insect foe: the lesser Peachtree borer, a native insect rst reported in 1868 in Pennsylvania. ARS scientists have developedsustainable and cost-eective ways to combat this destructive pest. Enter Steinernema carpocapsae, a tiny benecial roundworm (or nematode) that can protect peach and other stone fruit trees by attacking borer pests. They are \"benecial\" in that they control insect pests in an environmentally friendly way. But the sun's ultravioletrays and heat can dry and kill the roundworms afterthey've been applied. To survive the sun's rays and do their job, these nematodes need protection. ARS entomologists developed a way to protect the nematodes by using the type of \"re gel\" that prevents the spread of re in residential and commercial struc- tures. In tests, they rst sprayed nematodes onto tree limbs infested with lesser Peachtree borers and then applied the re gel over them. An initial drawback to that approach was overcome when one application (containing both nematode and protective gel) was developed. The treatment has proven as eective as the standard chemical approachto combating the problem. These are but a few exam- ples of the many ways ARS researchers across the country are working to stay one step ahead of insects - all while tackling other issues that aect the produc- tivity and wellbeing of our agricultural and naturalresources. As the sterile-male insect release technique mentioned earlier illustrates, a good piece of innovation can go a long, long way. This will become especially important as the world population swells to an estimated 8.5 billion by 2030. Fortunately, the spirit of scientic and techno- logical excellence of ARS pioneers like Dr. Knipling and Dr. Bushland continues to burn brightly in today's ARS researchers. Christopher S.

The two regions dier widely, but there are also many similarities. Cooperation in polar management and research will be increasingly important in the years to come, and Norway will do its best to contribute. The northern part of the globe has always been part of Norwegian identity. Seamen and hunters haveexplored and exploited the seas northwards toward the ice and pole. Their experience provided the basis for Norwegians to venture into the southern PolarRegions. Famous polar explorers like Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen were pioneers. The Arctic has warmed substantially quicker than the rest of the world. We see widespread changes inphysical and ecological systems. Over the last decades the sea ice thickness and extent, land ice volume, and spring snow cover have decreased. Near-surface per- mafrost has continued to warm. People and societies in the north see and feel these changes. Addressing a global challenge Climate change in the Arctic is a global problem. The feedbacks are increasing global sea levels, aecting global climate and precipitation patterns in southern latitudes. Over the past couple of decades, signicant warming was registered in some parts of Antarctica. On March 24,2015, a temperature of 17.5\u00b0 C was measured at Esper- anza Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, the highest temperature ever observed on the Antarctic continent. Most species inhabiting the Southern Ocean are likely to be sensitive to climate change. Growth of microalgae, the base of the food web, depends critically on sea-icecover. Predicted sea-ice reduction will have cascadingeects. Organisms living in the ice, krill, sh, penguins, seals, and whales will need to nd new habitats or feed- ing grounds. However, thresholds of climatic conditions for population or community collapse are largely unknown. Ocean acidication is an additional stressor. The Southern Ocean contains more CO 2than other oceans because cooler water absorbs more CO2than warmer water. Thus, the impacts of ocean acidication will appear here rst. We need more knowledge to understand the impacts of climate change and ocean acidication in Antarctica.Vidar Helgesen, Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, explains how the government is helping to address climate change in the Polar regions Vidar Helgesen, Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment Image: \u00a9 Bjorn H StuedalENVIRONMENT 227Norway's research and monitoring activities in the Antarctic aims to provide such knowledge. Utilising and building on our bipolar opportunities gives Norway a unique opportunity to contribute to an extensive knowledge exchange between the Arctic and Antarctica. Climate change together with increased human activity makes it wise to monitor developments and evaluate the consequences of such activity against the goal of conserving the Antarctic environment. Safeguarding polar environments The Norwegian Government will work to ensure that the unique natural and cultural environmental values in the Antarctic are safeguarded and impacted as little as possible by local activity. We will impose stringent environmental requirements on all Norwegian activity in the Antarctic. We will as well work to ensure that Norway can make a signicant contribution towards increasing environ- mental knowledge as a basis for environmental man- agement. With our research station Troll in DronningMaud Land and our new icebreaker research vessel Kronprins Haakon we can now strengthen Norwegianresearch in Antarctica. Troll stands on bare ground 1270 m above sea level on the Jutulsessen nunatak, entirely surrounded by the vast Antarctic ice cap. Kronprins Haakon is one of the world's most advanced research vessels. Programmes on marine and terrestrial biology, glaciology and physics are run. Meteorological observations and measurements of radiation, including UV radiation, are undertaken. I am proud of Norwegian polar traditions and will do my best to ensure continued research of high quality in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. Vidar Helgesen Minister of Climate and EnvironmentNorwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/kld/id668/ It is a fact that no region of the planet is experiencing more dramatic climate change than the Arctic. In recent years, this has resulted in melt- ing glaciers, rapid ecosystem changes, diminishing sea ice, and changes in the atmospheric circulation and ocean properties. Ocean temperatures are increasing due to global warming. The Arctic is undergoing changes unknown to have occurred during the last 1,450 years (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2013). Climate models project that the most pro- nounced warming in the future will happen in the Arctic. In a business-as- usual scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures may increase by 8 to 10 degrees Celsius. Even in IPCC's most aggressive scenario for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the Arctic will warm with several degreesand in turn fundamentally change this region as we know it today. Global impact The Earth's regions are connected by circulation in the atmospheric, ocean, climate and weather patterns. Arctic climate change therefore has profound global consequences and affects global conditions such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, permafrost thawing (which releases potent greenhouse gases) and changing weather patterns, such as the monsoon. Arctic climate change is therefore arguably relevant to the weather and climate in regions distantly located from the Arctic.Although the development is disturb- ing, climate change also provides some advantages. Increased biomass production in the northern waters - not at least in the highly productive Barents Sea - may become an impor- tant resource for the world's ever- increasing need for food and proteins. Furthermore, the Arctic's special role in global change makes it a potential laboratory for developing new green technology and new solutions that may be utilised in a global context, under the idea that: What works in the Arctic will work elsewhere. The opportunities in an Arctic with much less summertime sea ice are numerous. New shipping lanes, increased commercial fishing, newbioprospecting activities and harvest- ing marine ingredients for bio-produc- tion (including organisms at lower trophic levels in the food web and at greater depths,) are among the main gains from the situation. Oil, gas and minerals are other resources that may be possible to exploit increasingly further north in the near future. A call for knowledge However, today's rapidly changing climate and the major ecosystem changes that go with it, impose a fundamental challenge for manage- ment: the system is highly dynamic with large seasonal changes. We must avoid making decisions and invest- ments for the future based on yester-day's situation. This calls for aNorwegian Polar Institute's Director Jan-Gunnar Winther highlights the challenges associated with climate change in the Arctic and its global impactAssessing climate change in the Arctic 228PROFILE The lipid-rich zooplankton Calanus Glacialis is an important source of nutrition for seabirds and fish in the Arctic Photo: Allison Bailey/Norwegian Polar Institutecontinuously updated knowledge base and sophisticated earth system models to project future changes. Also, we experience a northward expansion of marine species from the south. The fishing fleet has recentlytaken advantage of this development and fishing grounds are relocated northwards into the shelves of theArctic Ocean, especially in the North Atlantic region. This raises the question whether we may experience commercially viablefisheries in the Arctic Ocean in the future. The area of the Arctic Oceanbeyond 200 nautical miles of Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Norway, Russia and the U.S is 2.8 million square kilo- meters. Up to now, scientists have documented an increase in zooplank-ton biomass over some areas of the continental shelf. However, scientists raise doubts about whether the samewill happen over deep water in the central Arctic Ocean. An important limiting factor for increased produc- tion is available nutrients, which are much lower in abundance in deep water than over the shelves. When the Arctic marine systems become warmer, expanding pelagic fish stocks will likely migrate into the Arctic Ocean to utilise the short peaks in production there, but will likely retreat to the more productive shelves when the peaks decline. Thus, most of the fisheries in the Arctic Ocean may be confined to the shelves. As a pre- cautionary action to avoid illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) in areas beyond national juris- diction, the 5 Arctic coastal states signed an agreement in July 2015 where they agree to not fish in this area. Furthermore, a scientific research and monitoring programme was established in order to obtain more knowledge in support for future management. The longer-term goal is that other countries also commit to withstand from IUU-fishing in this area.

With the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, we stand together to demonstrate our support for climate-resilient green growth, and for sustainable development and solidarity. While the headlines on world politics may give a dierent impression at times, I believe that something very positive has been set in motion. We, thought, for example, that it would take years for the Paris Agreement to enter into force. In fact, it was only a matter of months. At the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development this summer, 44 countries are willing to report voluntarily on their rst steps towards implementing the 2030Agenda. This is testimony to the shift in attitudes we are witness- ing and proves that we are moving forward. The global community as a whole is increasingly recognising that climate action and sustainability represent a very fruit- ful modernisation programme for national economies, with positive impacts on growth, employment, educa- tion, social equity and political stability. There is increas- ing awareness that human prosperity and well-being, peace and security, can only be achieved if we makefundamental changes to our economic practices. We have to learn to respect the Earth's planetary boundaries and not live beyond our means. We have to ensure that economic growth benets everyone. Environment organisations, development organisationsand trade unions have contributed worldwide ensuringthese issues get the attention they deserve. I believe that if we want to achieve this transformation, we need a broad alliance across all regions of the world and from all sections of society. This conference is a good example of this. G20 Action Plan The very fact that you are meeting here in Berlin lends momentum to Germany's G20 presidency - I am grateful to you all. We have set ourselves an ambitious agenda. We want the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg to send a strong message. The G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda, adopted during China's presidency, is to be supplemented with a Hamburg update. This update will list joint commit- ments by G20 countries on implementing the UN Sus- tainable Development Goals. Additionally, the summitaims to adopt a G20 climate and energy action plan. To this end, we have to present long-term strategies well before 2020, and we have to ensure that global nance flows are geared towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. Steering major nance flows towards sus- tainable investments, particularly in infrastructure projects, plays a key role. I am very grateful to the Chinese government for making green nance a focal issue for the nance ministers during its G20 presidency. Initial recommendations have now been made for improving the private sector's capac- ity to invest in sustainable green projects. Examples of this include common standards for green bonds and greater openness in the nance world towards climateand environmental projects. We want to make further progress in this area during our G20 presidency. Parts of the private sector are already leading the way. An increasing number of companies are moving awayIn a speech, German Federal Minister for the Environment Barbara Hendricks explains why support for climate-resilient green growth is imperativeENVIRONMENT 231from carbon-intensive investments. Many companies are already taking responsibility voluntarily. Policymak- ers have to support them in this. Investors, companiesand informed consumers are rightly demanding moreinformation - for example about protecting human rights throughout the supply chain, preventing corruption and respecting workers' interests. Companies that are more transparent than the legally prescribed minimum thus create competitive advantages for themselves and enhance their reputation. It is very encouraging to see that more countries are committing to the transforma- tion to sustainable economies and societies. The positive momentum from New York and Paris is continuing. We want to foster this momentum: It is with that in mind that Germany and Morocco launched the NDC Partnership at the last ClimateChange Conference in Marrakech. The Partnership is a forum for the important North-South-South exchangethat helps emerging economies and developing coun- tries in their climate action eorts.It is the reason that my ministry and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development jointly launched the transnational network \"Partners for Review\". This network supports the follow-up and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. And nally, it is also why my ministry will make a further \u20ac2 million available for the work of PAGE. We rmly believe that PAGE has become a key player for structural change towards socially sound and green growth. This is an edited version of the speech that was given by the Minister at the conference in Berlin in March. Barbara Hendricks German Federal Minister for Environment Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety www.bmub.bund.de How many years can a moun- tain exist before it's washed to the sea? More than 50 years after Bob Dylan asked this simple question it can finally be answered with some confidence. Modern tech- niques in Earth surface sciences allow us to determine rates of change and decay of the Earth's surface with an unprecedented accuracy. Amongst these techniques, the application of cosmogenic nuclides has acquired a unique position. \"Motivation to conduct this research is the realisation that all terrestrial life ultimately depends on soil. We need to know about the rates and processes soils are naturally removed and replenished, and how human activity alters this critical zone for life, and we have now the tools to perform this research.\" Cosmogenic nuclides are continuously produced in the Earth's surface by high-energy cosmic particles. Since the production of these nuclides decreases rapidly with depth below the surface, their cumulative concentration in any surface material is sensitive to its ero- sion history. In those cases where significant erosion is absent, the cumu- lative concentration is a function of the duration of exposure to cosmic rays. It is this unique sensitivity that is used for many Earth science applications: eitherfor determination of mass-loss in thecase of eroding surfaces (e.g. Bob Dylan's mountain), or exposure dating in the case of stable surfaces.Critical information on the state and evolution of the Earth's surface can be obtained utilising cosmogenic nuclides: Rates of soil production and erosion; Natural base level of soil-erosion; as benchmark for anthropogenic erosion; Sediment storage between sources and sinks; Timing and magnitude of mode-shifts; Delineation between climatic and other causes as drivers of change; Geo-hazard assessment (e.g. paleo- seismology); Reconstruction of climate change (e.g. extent and change of ice-sheets). The exceedingly low abundance of cosmogenic nuclides in the Earth surface (typically several thousand toa few million atoms per gram of mate- rial; for illustration: one gram of rock contains in the order of 1022atoms of any kind) requires specialised, large- scale research infrastructure to deter- mine their concentration accurately. The majority of measurements are conducted by accelerator mass spec- trometry (AMS), a subset by noble-gas mass to choose the most suitable nuclide for a specific scientific task is therefore important. In practice, how- ever, this choice is commonly limited by availability or access. Only analysesof 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl are routinely accessible to non-specialists, limiting the scope of the methodology. The German research agency DFG recognised this shortcoming, fundingWhat can cosmogenic nuclides tell us about the earth's surface? Prof. Dr. Dunai of The Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, University of Cologne explainsCosmogenic nuclides: A unique position for earth science 232PROFILE an AMS dedicated to Earth Science applications at the University of Cologne (CologneAMS; operational since 2012), later joined by a state of the art multi-collector NG-MS (2017).Alongside the University of Cologne invested in dedicated state-of-the-art clean room facilities. The Helmholtz centre GFZ-Potsdam collaborates closely with CologneAMS, having contributed significantly towards its research infrastructure. Since 2014, the methodology and research devel- opment associated with CologneAMS are boosted by institutional strategy funds of the federal Exzellenzinitiative at the University of Cologne. As a result of this substantial joint investment and the unique collabora-tion between geoscientists and nuclear physicists at Cologne, and at international partner institutions (ANU-Canberra, ETH-Z\u00fcrich;, PSI-Villin- gen, SUERC and East Kilbride), the full range of cosmogenic nuclides will soon be available for Earth surface sciences at one point of access. Perti- nent science no longer will be limited to what is accessible but can rely on what is best suited. Many collabora- tive international research projects already rely on our facilities. My working group at the University of Cologne engages in both methodolog- ical research and applications of cos-mogenic nuclides and fallout nuclides(the latter are a legacy of nuclear weapon testing era of the 1950s and 1960s; the methodology is related to that of cosmogenic nuclides and also relies on AMS).Ongoing applied projects mostly centre on the question of how does the pres- ence or absence of vegetation - as a result of climatic conditions or human interference - affect soil erosion. Weapproach this complex subject overdecadal (utilising fall-out plutonium in agricultural areas), millennial to million year time-scales (cosmogenic nuclides in natural environments). \"Modern techniques in Earth surface sciences allow us to determine rates of change and decay of the Earth's surface with an unprecedented accuracy. Amongst these techniques, the application of cosmogenic nuclides has acquired a unique position.\" On the short time-scales we study the effects of turning semi-arid savanna (in South Africa) or pampa (in Argentina) into cropland. On one side our results show that these fresh agricultural areas are prone to significant erosion by wind (up to 50% loss of the fertile soil size-fraction in less than 20 years). On the other side they indicate that adaptive agricultural methods (such as no-till farming) can largely reduce the impact of wind erosion, providing valuable informing on improved landmanagement practices. On the long to very long time scales our research currently focuses on semi-arid to hyper-arid environments of the Atacama Desert and adjacentareas in Chile. In the framework of the DFG-funded coordinated research center 'Earth - Evolution at the dry limit' (SFB/CRC 1211, first funding phase 7/2016 - 6/2020), we quantifyerosion in the absence of macroscopic plant cover, and the long-term response of the landscape on the emergence of ephemeral/permanent vegetation. Early results indicate that permanent vegetation cover, or theepisodic removal of it, has quantifiable and profound long-term effects on landscape evolution. Motivation to conduct this research is the realisation that all terrestrial life ultimately depends on soil. We need toknow about the rates and processes soils are naturally removed and replenished, and how human activity alters this critical zone for life, and we have now the tools to perform this research.

Today, the strategy hasbecome an established component of the Federal Gov- ernment's combined activities to meet Germany'srequirements for climate change adaptation. By the time the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, it was already clear that climate change and climate adaptation are ongoing societal tasks which must con- cern all, both now and in the future. Ambitious climate protection aims to avoid and minimise adverse climate impacts worldwide and in Germany. However, there is no denying that climate change is already in full swing. Any responsible government must consider how soci- eties and regions can adapt to climate change rightnow and Germany is no exception. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of scien- tic ndings on climate change and its impacts such as extreme weather events, both with regard to the status quo, and looking ahead to the future. The data situa-tion and methodology in Germany provide a good basis for transitioning from knowledge to action. After the publication of initial reports in 2015 the Germangovernment will regularly provide monitoring reports of climate impacts and Germany's adaptation to them, as well as regular reports assessing the future vulner - ability by 2100. The impacts of climate change are so wide-ranging that almost no segment of social, political and economic life will remain untouched over the next few years. Progress report Which measures has the Federal Government implemented in recent years, and which are currently ongoing? Which priorities has it set itself? The 2015Strategy's Progress Report investigates these questions, subdivided into 4 pillars: Pillar 1: Providing knowledge, informing, enabling and involving. Pillar 2: Framework-setting by the German Federal Government. Pillar 3: Activities for which the Federal Government is directly responsible. Pillar 4: International responsibilities.German Environment Agency's Petra Mahrenholz provides insight into Germany's Adaptation Strategy and how it is assisting in the fight against climate change Image: \u00a9 Andreas Depping / pixelio.deENVIRONMENT 235Internationally, Germany is a key provider of funding for climate change adaptation. In recent years, Ger- many's expenditure on climate change adaptation in developing countries has increased continuously, from \u20ac335m in 2010 to \u20ac1,124m in 2014. German Chancellor Dr. Merkel has announced Germany's intention of dou-bling its international climate funding by 2020 against the 2014 baseline. In its 2015 Progress Report the German government states that consequences of climate change are con- tinuing to escalate, and will impact all elds of life. A permanent, reliable supply of data and tools is needed in order to implement activities in all elds of action, and strengthen politicians and decision-makers with their own programmes and action concepts. A quick look at the current raft of measures in the Adaptation Action Plan indicates that the German government is further dierentiating its activities to provide optimum support for this task. Its creative and regulatory competencies will be dened in greater detail. However, the greatest challenge will lie inreshaping the infrastructures to transform them intoresilient, robust systems. All this requires further technical regulations, e.g. correct dimensioning of infrastructure, heat health action plans or risk maps for heavy rain, adaptation of legal instruments, e.g.adapting the building code in line with climate risks, qualication across a wide range of professions, andthe development of suitable funding and incentive mechanisms, e.g. adaptation funding programmes supporting regional and local stakeholders in their capacity to adapt. The aim is to get all actors involved in climate change adaptation. The earlier we start to incorporate climate change into our plans and activities, the less harm it will cause to society and our regions in future.

Meanwhile there is a growing number of players active in this field, ranging from publicly funded service providers to fully privately financed consulting agencies; from actors with a strong scientific back- ground to users with a profound knowledge of the business needs; from national and international donors to small communities that are seeking sound information for their local adaptation activities. Given this large variety of actors, it is important to facilitate communication, to transfer knowledge and to share experiences on success and failure related to the development and sup- port of climate service products. An open and intensive dialog based on partnership is key for the generation of new product ideas. A close exchange ensures that the community can learn from mistakes and avoid common pitfalls in the future. This culture of cooperation will boost the spirit of innovation which is critical for the development and operationalisationof new products and services. In that light, it is essential to provideplatforms that enable and maintain an open-minded conversation between the different climate service actors but which are also open for ideasbeyond the climate services world. The Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS), an innovation hub for pro- totypeclimate service products, acts also as initiator and facilitator of multilateral networks. GERICS recently designed and organised -in cooperation with different partners -2 outstanding events that provided a venue for knowledge sharing and experience exchange between the various climate service actors. The 5th International Conference on Climate Services (ICCS5), took place inCape Town, South Africa, from 28 February to 2 March 2017. The meet- ing is part of a series of conferences organised by the international Climate Service Partnership (CSP), a platform for knowledge sharing and collabora- tion to promote resilience and advancing climate services worldwide. This year's conference was organised by GERICS jointly with the University of Cape Town (UCT). The ICCS5 was held within the broad frame of the notion \"Innovation in Climate Services and Capacity Building\". Both issues, innovation and capacity building, are pivotal when it comes to addressing the evolving climate information needs and the develop- ment of responsible and effective climate services. More than 200 participants from all over the world came together on thisoccasion to share their latest findings and experiences. They represented all players active in the climate services arena. The ICCS5 provided a potpourri of different formats including regular talks, market place booths, poster discussions and interactive sessionsto connect participants and stimulate discussions. Central topics were \"Learning from Success and Failure\", \"Climate Services Business Models\" and \"Mutual Learning\". As a result, thecommunity gained new inspiration to foster ideas towards future climate service development. Although climate services have matured substantially by now, a central finding of the ICCS5 was that they still have a long way to go. Important steps are still missing until climate services can be considered operational. In this respect, the identification and imple- mentation of stringent and transparent evaluation procedures are important, as well as quality assurance mecha- nisms within the community. If a business case for climate services is to be developed, it is also necessary to define and assign specific monetary values to the various kinds of services. The second event was the \"Climateurope Festival 2017\" in Valencia, Spain, from 5 to 7 April 2017. The festival was con- ceptualised by GERICS as part of the ongoing EU project \"Climateurope\". As primary objectives the project coordi- nates on-going and future EuropeanClimate services is a growing sector where market opportunities and ways towards operationalisation are being explored. Prof Dr Daniela Jacob of the Climate Service Center Germany outlines recent developments 236PROFILE Climate services - shaping a growing marketclimate modelling and observations initiatives, develops a Europe-wide framework for climate service activi- ties, identifies gaps, challenges and emerging needs and enhances com- munication activities with stakeholders. The festival was an innovative activity in order to facilitate a dialogue among European climate science communi- ties, funding bodies, climate service providers and users. Inspired by the motto \"Climate information at your service\", the participants discussed the advantages and challenges that climate services face in the sectors water, ecosystem, and agriculture and food production. Shining the light on the way to operationalisation, innova- tive small and medium enterprises (SME), as well as start-ups in the field of climate services presented their business-cases. Throughout the meeting, discussions centred around improving ways to deliver better and more efficient climate services in order to enhance market development. There was a clear spirit during the festival that sharing knowledge and expertise is key for the creation of a successful climate service market. Moreover, it became apparent that private providers of climate services are already pushing the climate services market and that businesses are ready to use climate services, because they profit from cost savings, business continuity, competitive advantage and a stronger reputation. Common for both events was the clear statement that innovation needs failure. This is a crucial message to providers and users of climate services and for the donors as well. Only if we are open-minded enough to test new ideas -which implies that they might not work - we create chances andopportunities to generate exceptional climate service products. Furthermore, the need to keep up the dialogue between the various climate service actors was expressed during both events. This is of particular importance so as to ensure transparency in the process of climate service development and to build coordination amongst the different players. As the needs for climate services are diverse and complex, there is no single institution that can deliver such services on its own. Only coordinated activities within the community can ensure the more orderly and produc- tive development of climate services to facilitate the implementation of operational services. Equally important is an approachable climate service community that continues to grow and brings aboard new players from different backgrounds and cultures in order to broaden the collective expertise and to stimulate new developments. In this context, the International Conferences on Climate Services and the Climateurope Festival are central pillars in widening the community and defining the road ahead. Now is the chance to get involved in guiding the field of climate services through adolescence andtowards adulthood.

It is an informal, interdisciplinary network of climate information users, providers, donors and researchers who share an interest in climate services and are actively involved in the climate services community. Members of the CSP recognize that their collaborative efforts have the potential to exceed those of any single institu tion acting alone. GERICS was founding member of CSP in 2010. The CSP is managed by its secretariat, which is led by GERICS since 2015. www.climate-services.org ClimateEurope The five-year project is funded by the European Union under Horizon 2020 (project ref. 689029) and started in 2015. It contributes to the implementation of the \"European research and innovation Roadmap for Climate Services\", developed by the European Commission. The project links different European research projects and initiatives. Among them are, for example, the Coperni- cus Climate Change Service, the European Research Area Network for climate services, the European Network of Earth System Modelling, and the Climate- KIC. www.climateurope.euENVIRONMENT 238Climate protection: Investing in a low-carbon Europe Our climate is changing. We must reduce green- house gas emissions to limit the rate of climatechange, and at the same time, take measures that help us prepare for current and future impacts.Both of these strands of action require unprecedented redirection of investments. This was acknowledged bythe climate conferences in Paris and recently in Mar-rakesh. The nance sector can and will play an instru- mental role in supporting Europe's transition towards a low- carbon, climate-resilient society. Europe needs to invest substantially in climate changemitigation and adaptation. Estimates of the actual amounts needed vary signicantly and, depending on the scope, scale or methodology, can amount up to hundreds of billions of Euros per year. Compared to theoverall nancing capacity of the nance system, these investments needs are relatively small. Yet, despite its extensive capacity, the nance system currently meets only a fraction of the investment need. The main challenges for boosting climate-friendly investments include, among others, overcoming exist- ing barriers and lock-ins in the nance system which prolong and promote unsustainable activities; and redirecting funds towards initiatives that boost climate resilience and reduce carbon emissions. For coherent and eective measures on the ground, investment needs should be addressed in a systematic way at all levels - European, national and local. Coherent and complete disclosure of climate risks by companies is a pre-requisite for making informed investment deci- sions. In addition to improving transparency on climate risks, long-term planning and commitment also sendclear signals to investors. Clear policy signals facilitate long-term investments The 2015 Paris agreement has set the global objectiveto 'make all nancial flows consistent with a pathway towards low-emissions, climate-resilient development'. This objective was also conrmed by the 2016 climate change conference in Marrakesh. The clean energy package, recently proposed by the European Commission, conrms the EU's commitment to a low-carbon and climate-resilient transition. The package expounds the target of at least a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions and proposes the targets of at least 30% for energy eciency and at least 27% for renewable energy by 2030. It also highlights the impor- tant role that investments in clean energy transition and their economic co-benets. According to the European Commission, by mobilising up to \u20ac177 billion of public and private investment per year from 2021, the proposed package can generate up to a 1% increase in GDP over the next decade and create 900, 000 new jobs. The EU policy framework and targets are in general implemented through strategies and concrete actions inthe countries, including the national Low Carbon Devel- opment Strategies. A preliminary assessment of these strategies by the EEA shows that they vary considerably in scope and depth as well as ambition level. Theyinclude very limited information on nancing needs and plans to redirect investments. Moreover, a long-term vision at national level in line with EU's decarbonisationtargets is often lacking. Similarly, many countries have also adopted national adaptation strategies and action plans, but details on nancing these are often not available. To strengthen investors' condence, the Low Carbon Development Strategies and national adaptation plans should be complemented with national climate nancing strategies. Public sector investments will not be enough for nanc- ing the transition but can help mobilise and leverage private capital, which is indispensable for redirectingInvestment in climate protection is vital to overcome environmental challenges. Hans Bruyninckx, Executive Director, European Environment Agency explainsENVIRONMENT 239investment at the scale needed. At least 20% of the EU's 2014-2020 budget is earmarked to climate-related action. The EU's recent decision to extend and increase the European Funds for Strategic Investments and therecently established high level group on sustainable nance are also important steps towards building a nance system fostering sustainability in Europe. Finance system to oer innovative solutions Climate nancing strategies require the involvement of dierent stakeholders - public and private - at all levels, including the local level. The nance system also needs to evolve to cater to dierent types of needs anddierent sources. Some European municipalities have already come up with innovative ways to fund their actions by combining dierent funding sources or developing new ones such as crowdfunding of climate bonds. According to our upcoming assessment, however, many municipalities still face diculties to nd nance for their climate adaptation actions. The lack of capacity and expertise in nding sources and applying for the most suitable type of nance poses an important barrier among others.Moreover, in many cases, climate adaptation measuresare not yet considered as 'protable investments' by nancial decision-makers.Increasing awareness of climate risks and of the addi- tional benets of adaptation measures (e.g. boosting quality of life and the attractiveness of the place bene- tting from such measures) might result in a dierent assessment of what constitutes a good investment. EEA and climate nance Given the vital role of climate nance in making the nec- essary transition happen in Europe, the EEA is working towards assessing the connections between current and future actions for mitigation and adaptation on the one hand, and the nance and scal systems on the other. A greater understanding of these connections is a prerequisite for removing barriers to climate nance and redirecting funds to support low-carbon climate- resilient transition. We will be sharing our ndingsthroughout 2017. This article originally appeared on the EEA website and is available in 26 European languages.

This somehow romantic and idealistic view of earlier decades of glaciers is starting to be more and more replaced by a view showing us fast-changing landscapes represented by dark-grey rock and debris domi- nated mountain ranges. Sometimes this change is so dramatic that many mountaineers, who are familiar with acertain glacier landscape, are stunned if they return in intervals of a few years to the same location and notice the strong changes. Several studies document that the coverage with debris, as well as a general darkeningof the glacier ice surfaces take place today. From a scientific point of view,glacier surfaces do not only contain snow and ice but are heterogeneous mixtures of different kinds of surfacematerials. These materials vary greatly in their distribution and particularly in their thickness. Thick debris coverage consisting of small stones and large boulders released by steep rock walls surrounding the glaciers can occur both in the accumulation and ablationzones. Rocks falling in the accumula- tion zones of glaciers are generallycovered by snow and transported downwards by the glacier flow. In theablation area, the debris is emerging to the surface due to the upwards directed flow of a glacier. In the abla-tion zone, falling rocks accumulated directly on the bare-ice. Thus, debris originating from rock walls surround- ing either the accumulation or abla- tion zone can reach several meters ofthickness. Melt beneath such thick debris layers is decreasing exponen- tially with increasing debris thickness, as a result of the insulation of the underlying glacier ice from the atmo- sphere above. Hence, the existence of debris on the glacier surface also alters the energy balance, by allowing surface temperatures to rise above the melting point compared to a bare-ice surface, and by changing heat and moisture exchanges with the atmosphere. Debris thickness and its impact However, ice melt is strongly enhanced when the debris thickness is less than a few centimetres because of anincreased absorption of shortwave radiation and therefore, a rapid trans- fer of energy from the atmosphere to the underlying ice. The ratio between outgoing and incoming shortwave radiation is called albedo, which in turn is a direct measure of the ability of a surface to absorb or reflect radiation. In recent years, many studies concen- trated on the influence of thick debris on melt rates of the underlying ice. Only a few studies looked into the complex processes of fine, dispersed materials present on glacier surfaces and its influence on ice melt. However, these processes occur to be very important as they represent one of thestrongest feedback mechanisms asso- ciated to the current warming of the atmosphere and its consequences ofglacier mass loss, the ice-albedo feedback. If one would like to estimatefuture melt rates based on climate model outputs, it is therefore essentialto have a better process understand- ing of the influence of these fine materials covering large parts of glacier ice in the ablation areas. Glacier surface albedo The absorption of solar energy at theglacier surface is governed by the presence of different snow and ice characteristics. These are dependent on the crystal size and shape, the pres- ence of light-absorbing impurities like mineral dust, soot, organic materials, and site-specific properties such as ice surface roughness or the availability of a water film. Remote sensing tech- niques, based on both airborne and satellite sensors, allow us to obtain information about the ability of the icesurfaces of mountain glaciers to absorb solar radiation. Typical albedovalues in the ablation areas of some investigated glaciers in the western and southern Swiss Alps are around 20%, meaning that the glacier surfaces at these places are absorbing 80% of the incoming solar radiation. In the frame of the project called Swiss Earth Observatory Network (SEON), we used 3 different sensors to derive and com- pare the applicability of varying albedo retrieval approaches. A hyperspectral sensor, called Airborne Prism EXperi-Martin Hoelzle and Kathrin Naegeli, Department of Geosciences, University of Fribourg share how glaciers are altering in fast-changing landscapesFrom bright white glaciers to dark and dusty ice 240PROFILEment (APEX), having more than 280 spectral bands in the wavelength range of 400-2500 nm and a ground resolution of around 2 m was com- pared to 2 satellite sensors, Sentinel-2 with 11 spectral bands and a ground resolution of 20 m and Landsat 8 with 7 spectral bands and a ground resolu- tion of 30 m. We could identify that all sensors deliver robust results, show- ing the great potential of satellite data to monitor glacier surface albedo. However, the comparison was limited in the sense that only a snap-shot of one particular point in time of the glacier surface was monitored. To include the temporal component, wetherefore investigated how ice albedo varies over different time-scales such as seasonal changes, which are mainly determined by the variable presence of the snow cover. For longer time periods such as decades, we looked into the considerable inter-annual variability that is however strongly influenced by the uncertainty of the overflight time of the airplane or satel- lite. For the 2 decades 1999 to 2016, acontinuous darkening of glacier ice could be detected in restricted areas such as the glacier tongues or along lateral margins. However, no signifi- cant negative trend was found if the entire ablation area was averaged for individual glaciers. This finding emphasises the importance of a clear distinction of the spatial scale (regional, glacier-wide, bare-ice, point) when analysing and comparing albedo trends. Albedo impact on melt Moreover, we investigated how the albedo of ice influences glacier melt rates. Based on spatially distributed ice albedo derived from Landsat 8 and a wealth of measured point mass balance data from 12 Swiss glaciers, a mass balance sensitivity of -0.14 mwater equivalent (w.e.) per year and10% albedo decrease was revealed.Moreover, larger glaciers exhibited a stronger sensitivity compared to small glaciers, due to their low elevation areas that are affected by the ice-albedo feedback for a longer timeperiod. However, independent of the size and elevation range of an individ- ual glacier, local climatic conditions, in particular the amount and timing of snowfall events, strongly impacts on the mass balance sensitivity to changes in ice albedo. Using a mass balance model, we were able to quan- tify that spatially explicit ice albedo enhances local ablation rates by up to 50%, depending mainly on the abun- dance of light-absorbing impurities in some areas of a glacier. These studies clearly revealed that to improve mass balance modelling approaches, besides direct in-situ mass balance measurements collected in international monitoring activities coor- dinated by the World Glacier Monitoring Service, glacier-specific albedo values for different surface zones are crucial to obtain better results. Particularly for modelling future melt behaviour of glaciers, a better understanding and representation of the spatio-temporal variability of ice albedo is therefore needed, as the complex interplay of varying feedback mechanisms may amplify the influencing effect of ice albedo on glacier melt rates.

The inset in the lower right corner shows the location of Findelen glacier (blue circle) in the southern Swiss Alps at the border to Italy.In many environmental and civil engineering areas, such as geo- physics, engineering applications and industrial processes, the interac- tion between soils, water and struc- tures is of great interest. In particular, sudden catastrophic landslides, flowslides, avalanches and debris flows can cause a lot of damage in many parts of the world, due to their rapid move- ment and large travel distances. Simi- larly, failures of man-made structures (i.e., levees, dykes, and embankments) that can occur during intense rainfall, storm surges or tsunamis can result in severe damage. Modelling framework Modelling soil and water, however, causes conflicts in many existingnumerical frameworks. Soil is a natu- ral material with heterogeneous and varied properties - from organic peats in the fens to sands and gravels at beaches and rivers. Soil remembers its past. So it is history-dependent, and its material behaviour is non- linear. Water can flow. It can be very dynamic, turbulent and can move across large distances. Concepts of both fields - solid and fluid mechanics - are adopted and combined in the material point method (MPM). Based on this unified numerical framework, a computational software tool is being developed, aiming to model the inter- action of soil, water and structures. International collaboration Six universities (Barcelona, Berkeley, Cambridge, Delft, Hamburg andPadova), as well as the Dutch research institute Deltares, are joined together in a research initiative (Anura3D MPM Research Community)1to further develop advanced scientific methodswhich are implemented for engineer- ing use in freely accessible and open source software. In the scope of the European research project MPM- DREDGE 2(grant agreement PIAP-GA- 2012-324522), the first international conference on the material point method for \"Modelling Large Defor- mation and Soil-Water-Structure Interaction\" (MPM2017)3has been held to share the developments. What have we learned about soils, waters and structures? Six international keynote speakers emphasised the relevance of the research efforts from theoretical background to practical applications: Pieter A.

MPM is being demonstrated as a numerical tool to model seabed ploughing to enable predictions for tow force and speed needed for real- ising an expected trenching profile within given ground conditions. Monopiles are used as foundations for offshore wind turbines, and are usually constructed using impact driven installation techniques. Vibra- tory installation is expected to be less harmful for the environment and 242PROFILE The interaction between soils, waters and structures are of great interest in the engineering sector, here Alexander Rohe from Deltares outlines whyAssessing soils, waters and structuresmore cost efficient. MPM is shown to be capable of exploring if vibratory installation techniques can provide sufficient pile capacity which extends the possibilities of using conventional design tools. Bridges represent a key part of infrastructure, playing a critical role in emergency response and post-event reconstruction after tsunami impact. MPM is used to numerically modelbridge loading due to tsunamis, including the influence of debris carried by the tsunami, to evaluate demands on bridge superstructures. These problems involve complex contact interactions between solids and fluids that are not easily accom- modated using typical fluid-oriented or solids-oriented numerical flowslides are the main geohazard for subaqueous slopes composed of loose sand, and form a major thread to the safety of coastlinesin the Netherlands and elsewhere. During a liquefaction flowslide the sand instantly transforms from solid- like material to a liquid-like behaving material. Often large volumes of sand are displaced over vast distances in a short time. MPM is used as a numerical modelling framework and encom- passes both pre- and post-failurebehaviour. This enables the quantifica- tion of consequences of flowslides and thereby a better estimation of risks. What is next? The scientific results of the MPM2017 conference are published in the Proce- dia Engineering series (volume 175)4. A selection of the most relevant papers is included as featured articles in a special column of the Journal of Hydro- dynamics5. The second conference, MPM2019, will be held in Cambridge,UK in January 2019. In regular training courses practitioners are being trained in the application of Anura3D MPM software, to develop advanced solu-tions for daily engineering http://www.anura3d.com 2 http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105988_en.html 3 http://www.mpm2017.eu 4 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/18777058/175 and the global energy landscape? Since 1970, global energy consumption has more than doubled. Conventional resources, in partic- ular oil, natural gas and coal, had a dominant share in supply and also covered most of the growth indemand in the past. Even in 2015, these fossil fuels still accounted for more than 80% of global energy con- sumption. The contribution of renewables, including non-commercial biomass, was 14%, with nuclear energy supplying 5% in 2015. Developments in decades to come will dier substan- tially. However, total energy consumption will rise at a much more moderate pace than in the past, i.e. by up to one third by 2060. Electricity consumption will double during this period. But even this is a considerable slow-down in growth compared with the ve-fold increase in electricity consumption seen between 1970 and 2015.Unlike in the past, the emerging rise in consumption will essentially be covered by renewable energy sources.This is true especially of the electricity sector. Above all it is this sector that is experiencing an unprecedented change in supply structure. The globalcapacity of renewable power generating installations for example, more than doubled from 1,037 gigawatts at the end of 2006, with average annual rates of more than 7%, to 2,100 gigawatts by late 2016. This means that renewable resources now account for about onethird of global power generation capacity. Their share in global electricity output increased from 18 to 24% during the same period. This growth by sixpercentage-points is mainly attributable to develop- ments in wind and solar power. The combined share of these two renewable energy sources that still amounted to less than 1% in 2006 grew to more than 5% in 2016. The contribution made by hydro remained at a constant 16%. Other power sources like biomassor geothermal energy have been able to increase theirshare in global electricity generation from a total of 1.5% in 2006 to 2% in 2016. These rapid developments recorded during recent years for wind and solar, in particular, are mainly due to strong nancial support granted to renewables, especially in the form of state-guaranteed feed-in taristhat are valid for many years. This has led to low-risk and, at the same time, nancially attractive investment in renewable energy. A transition to larger plants for wind power, continued technological progress and the achieved massive cost cuts above all for solar modules have also improved the attractiveness of investment inwind and solar capacities. \"An important key to reducing carbon emissions in the heat market and the mobility sector as well is an increased input of electricity. This requires these sectors to be linked as far as possible. Further strategies involve a boost in energy efficiency and the implementation of carbon capture and utilisation and/or storage (CC(U)S).\" Renewable energy to play an important role The World Energy Council published \"World Energy Scenarios to 2060\" at the 24th World Energy Congress.The result of the three Hard Rock, Modern Jazz and Unnished Symphony scenarios explored by the Coun- cil is that, depending on the scenario concerned, the share of renewables in global power generation willrise to 40 - 63% by 2060. While, still at 23%, the share of renewables in global power generation was not higher in 2015 than in 1970. Renewables are expected to play a much more important role in the decadesahead. This comparison with developments in the past shows the extent of the transformation that may be expected in future.Dr Hans-Wilhelm Schiffer, Executive Chair World Energy Resources, World Energy Council highlights how renewables have transformed the global energy supplyENERGY 245The expansion of renewables use for power supply in itself, however, will not be sucient to achieve thetarget of limiting the temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels that was agreed by the international community ofstates in Paris at the end of 2015. \"Above all it is this sector that is experiencing an unprecedented change in supply structure.

This requires these sectors to be linked as far as possible. Further strategies involve a boost in energy eciency and the implementation of carbon capture and utilisation and/or storage (CC(U)S). Regarding energy eciency, there is still huge untappedpotential that could be exploited with suitable measuresin the future. The overall CC(U)S technology chain, i.e. capture, transport and utilisation and/or storage, is inplace. For its broad implementation, however, appropri- ate national framework conditions are indispensable. This applies not only to the development of infrastruc-ture but also to nancial support for this technology,which has already been a successful approach in the case of renewables. Policy parity in the implementation of sustainability goals, especially the ambitious climate plans, ensures that the transformation of energy supply will be cost- ecient - a prerequisite for its success. Dr Hans-Wilhelm Schiffer Executive Chair World Energy Resources World Energy Council www.worldenergy.org www.twitter.com/WECouncil With heating accounting for 40% of the UK's carbon emissions and over 2 mil- lion UK households in fuel poverty, the challenge to provide sustainable, affordable and secure energy supplies has never been greater.

What is district energy? District energy reduces total carbon emissions and creates more afford- able energy for all. Most importantly,it provides the opportunity to drive down fuel poverty. District energy networks allow different sources of low-carbon heating such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP), heat pumps,energy from Waste (EfW) or fuel cellsDom Barton, of Metropolitan Infrastructure Limited explores the national challenge to deliver sustainable, affordable and secure energy solutions Delivering flexible and secure energy solutions 246PROFILE ApartmentsCommercial Energy Centre Onsite Generated Electricity to Local Distribution Network Warm water Hot water HomesHeat substationto supply heating through a network of insulated underground pipes to individual properties. Scalable solutions We provide solutions that are flexible,scalable and designed to evolve with the needs of the development serving the growing number of people living and working there. Once the initial part of a district energy network is opera- tional, there are often opportunities toextend it into adjacent areas as a retrofit solution. This brings improved carbon performance to an entire area. Transforming communities Alongside energy networks, we deliver other enabling infrastructures, such as electric and fibre networks. These networks ensure that the provision and usage of energy are as efficient as possible while ultrafast Fibre-to-the- Home (FTTH) networks bring life- changing benefits to consumers' personal and professional lives. Heat Trust guarantee Metropolitan was one of the first to register a scheme with the Heat Trust, and as members, we commit to abide by the scheme which serves to protect and safeguard the interests of all heat customers. We are committed to obtaining Heat Trust status for all our networks, to offer independent reassurance to res- idents that our heat tariffs are always fair. Customers connected to our elec- tric or fibre networks have complete freedom to choose their supplier and service package. Public sector funding Both the UK and Scottish governments have active strategies to promote the decarbonisation of heating for buildings, and have dedicated funding availableto enable district energy projects.Funding is not limited to just local authorities and could be used to connect new loads to existing heat networks within other public sector organisations, such as NHS buildings and universities. We can incorporate such funding within our solution. Models to reduce energy costs Public sector organisations can choose to progress schemes themselves or look for partners in the private sector to realise their objectives. Metropoli-tan have proven and flexible Energy Services Company (ESCo) solutionsand partnership models which allow for the separating of supply and dis- tribution. We will also ensure scheme delivery is phased to match overall development investment timelines. An ESCo is a commercial operation providing efficient and cost-effective energy to the development.

Ingenuity Lab is a research organisation that focuses on the development and deployment of effective solutions to seemingly intractable challenges. It works using a formal connect-and- develop process which involves building teams from members of government, industry, and academia. Central to this process is problem identification and the visualisation of the ideal solution.Often the identified problem is not the problem, but a symptom. Symptomstend to be obvious, but quite often pro- vide little insight into the most effective solution. With the recent intense discus- sion surrounding the newly imposed carbon tax in Canada, I think that it is time to extract ourselves from the emo- tion of the issue surrounding climate change, examine the impact of human- ity on our environment, and identify the salient challenges needed to ensure global sustainability. The unassailable fact is that the Earth's climate is changing. But the Earth's climate has been changing since its creation. The Earth's atmosphere, gov- erned by complex, non-linear physicalprocesses is easily perturbed. Changes in solar radiation, volcanic activity, deforestation, construction of cities and roads, large-scale irrigation and, yes, the release of CO 2into the atmosphere, can all impact the Earth's climate. Thechallenge is teasing out the climate vari- ations caused by natural phenomena which we cannot manage from the impacts caused by anthropomorphic activities. Firstly, we need to understand the impact of human activity versus natural processes on the climate. Then, isolate the impact of different human activities to further identify the effect that each activity has on the environment, especially when many of the activities occur simultaneously. For example, the change in albedo - the amount of solar energy absorbed/reflected - caused by the expansion of population centres is usually accompanied by an increase in CO 2emissions. Which of the two impacts is more important? Are theircollective impacts additive or multi- plicative? There are many questions yet unanswered. If we cannot clearly define and quantify the \"cause\", howcan we craft an effective solution? Disagreeing with Malthus The bottom line is that human activity has impacted the Earth's environment since our society transitioned from hunter-gatherers. In 1798, Thomas Malthus postulated that humans were quickly going to exceed the carrying capacity of the Earth and that the posi-tive population checks of starvation, disease, and war were necessary. Healso dismissed the idea that technolog- ical advances in agriculture would pro- vide the solution to the Earth's resource limits. I hear echoes of Malthus in muchof the dialogue surrounding climate change. While no one is proposing eugenic behaviour for addressing man's impact on the environment, there is a distinct tenor in the dialogue that humankind must accept a lower quality of life and reduced opportunity for future generations. There is also the implied truth that the human race cannot address the challenges associ- ated with man's impact on the environ- ment through advances in technology. I soundly reject both premises. When I was growing up one of my favorite TV shows was Get Smart. I always waited for the moment in the show when Maxwell Smart would use his shoe phone. It was hilarious because most people perceived it as ridiculous. The concept of portable communication was outlandish. Nine years ago when Apple introduced the iPhone, it revolutionised global com- munication. In just 30 years, the tech- nologies of science fiction fantasy transformed the way we engage in commerce, deliver healthcare, and interact as people. It effectivelyshrunk the world, making the Earth asingle village where virtually every voice can be heard.

Culturally, Canadians have an intense connection to the environ- ment. I believe that it is fair to say that the wonder of nature is strongly woven into the fabric of Canadian society. This is why Canadians feel compelled to lead the charge against global warming and why Canada has acted to impose a significant tax on the use of carbon. The question that many are asking, both inside and outside of Canada is, is this an effective path for addressing the global warming challenge? Canada is currently responsible for releasing approximately 1.6% of all of the global CO2emissions. The Euro- pean Union, China, India, Russia, Japan, and the United States are collectively responsible for releasing over 70% of the global CO2emissions. It is doubtful that even a 50% reduction of Canadian CO2emissions would have any material impact on global warming. To have any real effect on global warming, CO2 emission reductions must occur in con- cert with all six of the major emitters. Even with over 10 years of significant effort, it has not been possible toachieve a meaningful coordinated global response to CO 2emissions. Acting in isolation will only stress the Canadian economy and place an unnecessary burden on Canadians without achieving the desired goal of reducing man's impact on global warm- ing. There is a better path forward. We must recognise that humankind has impacted and will continue to impact the Earth. It is our responsibil- ity to access the Earth's bounty in a sustainable way. Our ultimate goal should be to consume each of Earth'sresources within cyclic processes to maximise the utility of all of theresources that we harvest. The eco- nomic reusing of resources would ensure their continued availability for future generations. Achieving this vision can only be accomplished through technological innovation. Examining the challenge of CO 2emis- sions you find opportunity. Let's flip our perspective; instead of labeling CO2as a waste product we should recognise it as a valuable raw material. Carbon is the foundation, the building block of all living organisms. At the very core of the global ecosystem, nature uses the Sun's energy to assemble all living organisms from CO2. Visioning the solu- tion to CO2atmospheric emissions, suppose we can generically insert our industrial processes within the web of nature's carbon cycle. We take the CO2 which would normally be emitted into the atmosphere, such as from an elec- trical power generating plant, and instead, using light, repurpose the CO2 into valuable products. Effectively we insert the carbon that would have been wasted and transform it into the fabricof our society. Ingenuity Lab is currently commercialising this new technology. Using the power of N - inspiration from nature to guide the manipula- tion of matter using nanotechnology to build networks - Ingenuity Lab succeeded in replicating the natural process of carbon assembly and translated it into an industrial process. The process required learning how to convert light into the various chemical fuels of life and the ability to cheaply fabricate nano-compartmented sys- tems to assemble an artificial metabolism that fixes and transforms CO2into valuable products. While not the total solution to the global climate warming challenge, it does pull back the curtain to display the possible. It shows that the potential for techno- logical achievement is boundless.Advancing sustainability through technology We must consider the past technolog- ical achievements of modern man as governments assess the optimum strategy for addressing global sustain-ability challenges. These achievements speak loudly about the human poten- tial for creative innovation. Canada needs to occupy the position of a lead-ing global steward of the environment, but must achieve it as a champion of sustainability through technology. It isthe path forward. Set the stage for a bright future for coming generations by embracing the potential of the possible, as well as understanding that technological achievement can drive market forces that lead to a more sustainable world. World leaders need to focus on provid- ing an environment that supports the crafting of solutions to the global warming challenge and not at regula- tory instruments as the primaryweapon of choice. This strategy will accelerate economic and societal pros-perity and has a much higher likelihood of long-term success. Canada, believe in the inventiveness and creativity of your citizenry. Provide the needed envi-ronment, and the people will deliver. The future belongs to the bold. 249PROFILE Carlo Montemagno, PhD Director Ingenuity Lab Tel: 1 780 641 1617 montemag@ingenuitylab.ca www.ingenuitylab.cawww.twitter.com/MontemagNANO ENERGY 250Fusion energy could be the future of power production Modern society loves energy. Whether it is lighting our oces, heating our homes or delivering our goods, it all takes energy. But delivering the energy we need is becoming a prob-lem. Fossil fuels have been the backbone of our devel- opment but we now realise burning fossil fuels is unsustainable and we must wean ourselves o them assoon as possible. There are alternatives but each comes with its own advantages, disadvantages and limitations.Nuclear ssion has been delivering cost-eective power for decades but has barriers to entry that can restrict its application. Renewables, such as wind and solar have alarge physical footprint, but are often not close to where the energy is needed and are intermittent. Biomass locks up large quantities of land, is hard to transport and still leads to the release of greenhouse gases. Lots ofnew energy models have been tried but none have been an unqualied success and none can be freely and sustainably replicated. Fusion could change that. \"It may well have taken time to get where we are today but with few constraints on deployment and a massive demand for what it delivers, fusion could easily be the next great step in mankind's development. And it may come sooner than you think.\" Fusion as a source of energy Fusion would be a high-density energy source entirely under mankind's control with an aordable, easily available fuel. It could be easily replicated in almost anyjurisdiction and doesn't have environment damaging carbon emissions. That is why economic fusion is the holy grail of the energy industry. When matter condensed out of energy after the big bang, an electron combined with a proton to form our simplest element, hydrogen. That is why it is by far the most common element in our universe. But it is not the lowest energy atom. That title belongs to Iron 56. If the repulsive forces that keep light nuclei apart can be overcome they will fuse and give out energy, and lots of it. This is where the energy of the Sun comes from. Every day when the Sun rises we are reminded that fusion works. The issue of creating power from fusion is then, not one of its fundamental science, but rather one of engi- neering, materials science and control. The Sun uses its massive gravity to conne the fuel and the energy produced just dissipates into space. Controlled fusion,here on earth, requires us to nd another way to contain fuel at a hundred million degrees Celsius andthen to collect the energy and convert it into some- thing useful. The Sun is self-sustaining. We begin with a cold fuel that we need to heat before the reaction can start by putting massive amounts of energy veryquickly into a very small target. Mankind has risen to the challenge, imagining manyways in which this might be done and then proving that it can. Historically the experiments have been large, as magnetic connement has been used to hold a hot plasma (a state of matter where electrons have been stripped from the atoms) or powerful lasers have been used to create shock waves in solid fuel pellets.Notable experimental facilities include the Joint Euro- pean Torus (JET) in the UK, National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the U.S. or more recently the Wendelstein 7-XNeil Alexander for the Canadian Nuclear Association shares why society should be looking to fusion energy to power homes and businesses in the futureENERGY 251stellarator in Germany. Thirty-ve countries have come together to support the next phase of the Tokamak development known as the International ThermonuclearExperimental Reactor (ITER) in France. Construction of this large and complex facility will take some time and is expected to cost in excess of $20billion. It has been a hard slog for fusion as it has had to overcome many challenges at the very edges of our knowledge and capability. Without the benet of theSun's gravity the temperatures needed for ignition are6 times higher than the Sun's core and at the moment, Tritium and Deuterium (isotopes of hydrogen) have to be used rather than much more available hydrogen itself. The fusion process kicks out a lot of radiation and the materials used must be able to tolerate that radiation. At times people have joked that commercial fusion power was 30 years away when it was rst considered and it is still 30 years away. But there is powerful evidence to suggest that technologies develop expo- nentially and that fusion is now lifting o that initial flat part of the curve so that from here on in progress could accelerate away. Certainly, this can be seen in the announcements of technological progress on the bigprojects, but just as importantly it can be seen in the surge of spin-o commercial concepts such as Vancou- ver's General Fusion or First Light Fusion in the UK. Even ex Google executives are getting in on the game, with Mike Cassidy recently announcing the creation of Apollo Fusion. It may well have taken time to get where we are today but with few constraints on deployment and a massive demand for what it delivers, fusion could easily be the next great step in mankind's development. And it may come sooner than you think.

Dr. Neil AlexanderEngaged member Canadian Nuclear Association info@cna.ca https://cna.ca/ www.twitter.com/talknuclear Modern society loves energy but delivering that energy is becoming a problemENERGY 252Fusion energy: Unlocking the zero-emission grid Acornerstone of any realistic path to overcoming climate change is developing sources of energy that are emission-free, on-demand and econom- ically viable. Such sources would sustain the world'sgrowing population and broaden the opportunity foreconomic prosperity. The need for these sources is urgent: global electricity demand is forecast to increase by 69% in the next 20 years, and while renewables are growing rapidly, the majority of this demand nonetheless looks set to be fullled by fossil fuels. 1 The clean energy grid will need a mix of generatingtechnologies to supply the diverse needs of consumers. When it comes to sectors with high energy intensity, such as industry or dense urban areas, fusion energy is a very attractive option. Fusion has the potential to provide clean, safe and on-demand power worldwide. It also has the potential to demonstrate the best energy payback ratio (EPR) and lowest carbon life cycle foot- print of any source, making it a powerful tool to tackle climate change. Fusion: a national priority The potential of fusion has long been recognised by the scientic community. Over 30 years of investment by governments in research and development has brought tremendous scientic advancements, and a number of countries now consider further development of fusion to be a national priority. In addition to their involvement in the 35-nation ITER fusion project, China also plans to train 2,000 new fusion scientists by the end of this decade, and South Korea is investing heavily in the eld.2, 3These projects are demonstrating the scientic understanding that is enabling fusion to move from lab experiments toapplied engineering projects.Now is an innovative time in fusion, both in government and the private sector. New ideas are springing up: pro- posals for fusion system designs that are more practical to implement, at lower capital cost, and which will lead us to commercially viable power plants sooner than theearlier concepts. This renewed wave of enthusiasm is the result of acombination of factors. The scientic knowledge gained through decades of research has provided us with an excellent understanding of the principles underpinning fusion. Fields such as plasma physics, key to achieving the extreme temperatures needed to fuse the hydrogen nuclei fuel, have been intensively studied and the parameter space we must work withinhas been established. In parallel, substantial technological advances have taken place in elds complementary to fusion. Comput- ing power and electronics, simulation, and materials science have progressed dramatically since the early days of fusion research in the 1960's. Previously only feasible on the most powerful of national laboratory supercomputers, simulation of the behaviour of fusion plasmas is now possible on commercially available cloud computing platforms. These advances provoked a vanguard of private fusion companies such as General Fusion, Tri Alpha Energy and Lockheed Martin to enter the space, capitalising onnew technologies to push forward the development of innovative new approaches. With parallels to the emer- gence of companies such as Blue Origin and SpaceX in the aerospace industry, serious private sector investors are funding sophisticated eorts to pursue practical solutions with the goal of advancing the timeline for a commercial solution to fusion by decades.The opportunities provided by fusion should not be overlooked. Here, Michael Delage, of General Fusion Inc. explains the potential of the energy sourceENERGY 253Backed by venture capital, these rms are developing new, power plant-focused approaches at a pace not previously seen. In the coming years we will see the rst demonstration prototypes emerge, which will marshal the energy industry to drive fusion's commersialisation. These advances come not a moment too soon. Thelatest gures show that while the deployment of cleanenergy infrastructure is growing rapidly, it is being outpaced by the staggering level of new demand. Some perspective: In 2015, China alone was responsi-ble for 40% of global renewable power growth, but that represented only half of the country's electricity demand increase 4. Much as we see a mix of technologies supplying our energy needs today, de-carbonising the world's electrical networks will require a new mix of generating technologies incorporating distributed renewables, large scale storage, and high output, on-demand sources. Energy companies, corporate partners and governments around the world are recognising the ability of fusion to make a signicant contribution tothis mix, and are investing to unlock the full potential of the zero-emission grid. 1 US Energy Information Agency, May 11, 2016.

The Danish government, which is composed of Venstre, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party, is pursuing an ambitious green transition which will maintain Denmark's position as a green pioneer with a market-based, cost-ecient climate and energy policy.Denmark must achieve as much as it can in terms of renewable energy and climate gains for the money it invests, and the green transition must support growth,competition and employment. Objectives of the government's manifesto:By 2050 Denmark is going to be a low emission society which is independent of fossil fuels and living up to theEU target of an 80-95% reduction in greenhouse gasses compared with 1990 levels. By 2030 at least 50% of Denmark's total energy needs should be covered by renewable energy. Denmark is going to be a world leader in oshore wind and the rst country in the world to build new oshore wind turbines subsidy-free. Denmark will have the most integrated, market-based and flexible energy system in Europe which will be able to handle an increasing amount of renewable energy in a cost-ecient way. At the same time we must maintain one of Europe's highest levels of security of supply andlowest wholesale market prices for electricity. There must be an integration of energy systems across coun- tries and sectors (electricity, heating, gas, transport and supply) and an ecient use of resources. Denmark will work towards executing structural reforms of the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) which can reduce quota numbers so that in the future there are clear price signals both inside and outside the quota sector for the benet of the green transition. In the autumn of 2017 the government will present a proposal for a new energy agreement for the period after 2020. The Paris Agreement was the rst step the global green transition, and now the whole world will have to deliver on the promises that were made in Paris. As a member of the EU, Denmark will be at the forefront in fulllingLars Christian Lilleholt, Minister for Energy, Utilities and Climate, reveals how Denmark will fight climate change and emissions via a new energy policy Image: \u00a9 Steen BrogaardENERGY 255its obligations, pushing towards new and ambitious goals while at the same time contributing experience and solutions for the benet of other countries. With the government's new ambitious targets for climate and energy policy, we set-out a clear direction for Denmark's green transition which will continue our unique growth model, where since 1990 we have managed to increaseour GDP by close to 80%, keep energy consumption at a constant level and at the same time signicantly reduce CO 2emissions. An integrated, market-based and flexible energy system Overall, the total consumption met by renewable energy (RE) in the EU today stands at 16%, with the target being to increase this gure to 27% by 2030. Today, 29% of Denmark's energy comes from renew- ables and the government aims to realise 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2030. Such a signicant target will secure Denmark's leading position in the development and implementation of new green technologies. Denmark must be a world leader in the development of an integrated, market- based and flexible energy system which can integrate large amounts of renewable energy.We need to be independent of fossil fuels by 2050 In autumn 2017, the government will publish a proposal for a comprehensive new Energy Agreement for the period after 2020 which will be partly based on theEnergy Commission's work. This new Energy Agreement will have the primary aim of ensuring the continued transformation of the energy system. At the same time, Denmark has ambitious 2030 targets for reducing emissions outside the quota system. The government will prepare a cost-eective strategy for meeting the Danish reduction targets in 2030 which will be ready before the end of 2017. Together, these 2 measures will ensure that Denmark'sgreenhouse gas emissions will fall signicantly and thatDenmark keeps the green transition running at a high tempo. The 2 measures will be important milestones on the journey towards the long term goal in 2050 of Denmark as a low-emission society that is independent of fossil fuels. Lars Chr. Lilleholt, Danish Minister for Energy, Utilities and Climate Danish Ministry of Energy, Utilities and Climate http://old.efkm.dk/en Reducing residential energy con- sumption is an important part of the wider goal of improving energy efficiency, but it's not always easy to change long-established habits. \"We aim to take this research and the knowledge that we've gained in termsof understanding the kinds of messages that people respond to, and try to apply that to help reduce household energy consumption.\" Many different methods have been tried over recent years to engage with energy consumers, with the wider goal of improving energy efficiency and sustainability. Previous efforts have been very much focused on price, as the key motivator to encourage people to change their energy consumption patterns, but now researchers in the Natconsumers project are taking a new approach. We thought we needed to start a conversation with the end cus- tomer. It's not about dictating to them and ordering people to do things, it's about creating a conversation. This will be a more effective way of engaging with consumers. It's about being rele- vant and understanding the situations where you can talk about energy, whichare not always related just to moneyand potential cost savings. The approach is further elaborated by fellow partner, Alberto Cuetos in men- tioning, that \"this could be something as simple as talking to end customersabout how weather patterns affecttheir energy consumption. For example, if a consumer lives in an area which has been experiencing a lot of rainfall, or a prolonged cold snap, then that will affect consumption patterns, and can provide a starting point for more effective, emotionally intelligent and relevant communication\". \"Basically very simple measures - but all the more powerful, as they interact with our daily life by asking relevant questions like: Do you know what the cold weather means for your energy consumption? Did you know you can do x to change y? Or a consumer may be getting married or having a child. Many things could trigger a discussionabout their energy consumption,\" out- lines Alberto. The starting point in terms of identify- ing these triggers is a user-centered framework, which the project is devel-oping to segment consumers. We develop communication by asking questions and getting feedback. User-centred framework The goal is to build a kind of self-learn- ing tool that will constantly developand evolve to reflect consumer priori- ties. Researchers gathered data from across Europe, and while energy consumption patterns of course vary significantly across different regions. There are similarities in terms of behavior and communication prefer- ences, which will inform the ongoing development of the framework. We've been trying to categorise communica- tion in terms of both what is more static and what is more dynamic. But this is only a starting point - as the machine starts learning, we find that people respond more as we become better at understanding their specific priorities and circumstances.Thomas N. Mikkelsen highlights how Natconsumers has developed a methodology to communicate more effectively with consumers to reduce energy consumptionReducing energy consumption requires communication 256PROFILE Image: \u00a9 Visualisation by Strategic Design ScenariosFrom these foundations, researchers can then look to communicate with consumers in a way that's relevant to them, and develop personalised actions aimed at reducing energy consumption. This information onconsumer priorities could also be highly relevant for utilities and energy companies, something which the project could explore in future. \"What came out of this project is basi- cally a process, and by going through that process, you can identify the priorities of the customers that you are talking to,\" says Alberto. \"We aimto take this research and the knowl- edge that we've gained in terms of understanding the kinds of messages that people respond to, and try to apply that to help reduce household energy consumption.\" Thomas N.

In Sweden it is estimated that air pollution contributes to around 5,500 premature deaths each year. In February the Swedish government adopted a historic climate reform. The cli- mate act and new climate goals aim to help Sweden reach an ambitious, long-term and stable climate policy. Speaking about the historic act, Sweden's Prime Min- ister, Stefan L\u00f6fven said: \"The climate act is historic and represents an epochal shift for Sweden. Just as wekeep our scal house in order, we must also put ourhouse in order regarding climate policy. \"This is the most important reform that our generation of politicians will carry out for Sweden's young people, our children and grandchildren. Sweden will be one ofthe world's rst fossil-free welfare nations.\" Sweden aims to be carbon neutral by 2045, reducing emissions by 63%, by 2030. Sweden leads the way between all 28 EU Member States with regards to renew- able energy use by share. By 2014, over half of the coun-try's energy consumption was provided by renewables, including electricity, heating and cooling as well as trans- port. By 2020 Sweden hopes to achieve a 49% share of renewable energy in gross nal consumption of energy. The country aims to have no net emissions of green- house gases at all by 2045, as outlined in their current Energy Policy. In the 2017 Budget Bill , the government aims to strengthen eorts towards a toxin-free every day environment, a fossil-free welfare society and renewable energy. In order to reach the target of 100% renewable energy by 2040, the government aims to encourage the expansion of solar energy. Within the budget, the funds that are allocated to investment forsolar power this year are 8 times higher than in 2015. In order to reach these targets and reduce the eects of climate change, not only in Sweden but worldwide, Minister for the Environment Karolina Skog believes that cities have a major role to play. She recently attended the COP22 Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, and highlighted how cities are crucial for tackling climate change and how urban development is a key focus for municipalities and regions in imple-menting the Paris climate agreement. Speaking at the conference, Skog said: \"Social inclu- sion, gender equality and access to good quality public transport are key in the work on urban development. As the minister responsible for urban development, I have a vision of sustainable cities for everyone, and to get there we need to tackle several challenges at thesame time.\" The Minister highlighted in her speech that cities have a big responsibility in climate transition, and that gov- ernment and states must support their work throughpolitical visions and funding. Open Access Government's Editor Laura Evans examines how Sweden is tackling climate change and the targets in place to help the nation become carbon neutral Swedish Minister for the Environment, Karolina Skog Image: \u00a9 Kristian Pohl/RegeringskanslietENERGY 259\"I have high hopes that the strong willingness we see in cities and businesses the world over will carry climate eorts forward,\" Skog added. Minister Skog also spoke with regards to climate change and its impact on the health of the people of Finland. During this particular seminar at the confer-ence, organised by the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that 6.5 million people arealready dying each year due to air pollution. With sucha high number already suering the spread of illnesses is expected to increase in line with the increased number of global emissions expected. \"We must make sure that the climate action we take is also good for the air we breathe. For example, if weburn biomass in the wrong way it can signicantlyworsen air quality. This must be avoided at all costs - poor air quality is the greatest and most acute environ- mental problem we face,\" said Skog. Goals for urban development necessary The government's budget bill for 2017 is said to be the largest environment and climate budget ever presented in Sweden. Investments in climate action reach a totalof SEK 12.9 billion for the period 2017 to 2020. The urban environment agreements will be reinforced with an additional SEK 750 million for 2017 to 2018. Speaking at the conference, Minister Skog commented on how the development of cities is integral to these goals. \"Over the next 35 years, we will build cities for 3.5 million people. This places enormous demands on infrastructure. From the point of view of policy, we need to set goals for the development of these cities and make sure to steer investment flows in a sustainable direction. This is something I will do back home in Sweden over the coming year.\" Laura Evans Editor Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.orgwww.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov The Swedish Surplus Energy Collaboration (SSEC) takes the form of a cohesive research and development programme based at the Swedish University of Agricul- tural Sciences (SLU). SSEC operates in close co-operation with a large number of partners and stakeholders all over Sweden, 8 subprograms and more than 50 collaborators. Using untapped resources It is well known that plants and fish growth is stimulated by moderate increases in temperature and that con- trolled and acclimatised environments also provide a healthier and safer lifefor human beings as well. The SLU, together with its partners demon-strates in practice the possibilities of how to utilise the very large amounts of low-grade heat and other unused resources that depart from various industrial processes. These resources are used to create a new land basedindustry for fish, greenhouse and open land-based production of fruit and vegetables, all in an industrial scale. Putting these resources in use also makes the industry more efficient andmore environmentally friendly. The district heating systems is a crucial part of the new production systems at many places. On 17 December 2012, a unique part- nership was signed between SLU, ESS the European Spallation Source AB,E.ON Sweden AB, Malm\u00f6 City and the Municipality of Oskarshamn.

Even if only 15 partners are working together many more businesses, official authorities and academia are involved all over Sweden. SSEC operates with 2 concepts or subprograms, namely Urban Food and Urban Health. The question is: how can we econom- ically exploit the very large residualheat that is cooled off today? The heat in different processes lost in Sweden amounts to at least 150 TWh. This is as much energy as the total Swedish electricity use, but the benefits have so far been non-existent due to the off-cooled heat consists largely of low temperatures. New technology is developed in order to benefit these low grade heat. Today the visions also include how we can use other unused resources, such as food waste, waste of other organic material, industrial infrastructure, carbon dioxide etc. Currently over 40% of all food produced and consumed in Sweden becomes food waste. The cooperation agreement covers areas as diverse as the production of vegetables and fish, to creating healthy and attractive living environments for people, to contribute to local and regional development, and well as strengthening cooperation between academia and business. The impact on regional development is very positive since the project results in innovation, new businesses and many new jobs all over Sweden.

In the last decades, Sweden has made substantial reductions in its CO2emissions, while maintaining high and sustainable economic growth. Sweden is also known for recycling waste. Less than 1% of the waste is landll, the rest is reused and recycled, to new products or to energy. So what is the secret behind the Swedish success, so far? The main reason for this success in climate politics is the nation-wide expansion of ecient district heating, supplied by non-fossil energy sources. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has pointed out dis- trict heating as one of the reasons behind the success. Accounting for half of Swedish heating, district heating has gone from being almost exclusively powered byfossil fuels in the 1980s, to now, 2017, being about 90% renewable and recycled heat. District heating network District heating is an intelligent, environmentally friendly way to heat homes, schools and other prem- ises, etc. As the name implies, district heating comes from somewhere within the district. Instead of everybuilding having its own boiler, district heating is sup- plied by a central plant which can use advanced meth- ods to run on many dierent fuels or recover heatfrom other sectors, for the benet of households, industry and the environment. They say that the district heating plant is the heart of a district, spreading warmth right the way around it. InAnnika Johannesson, Communications Manager, Swedenergy explores how the Swedish district heating network is helping to lower emissions ENERGY 263many processes large parts of energy are set free in the form of surplus heat. The fundamental idea behind modern district heating is to recycle this surplus heat which otherwise would be wasted - from electricity production, from fuel- and biofuel-rening, and fromdierent industrial processes. Furthermore district heating can make use of many kinds of renewables(biomass, geothermal, solar thermal). The main reason to invest in district heating in Sweden was to create a healthy environment in Sweden's cities. While changing the fuels from oil to renewables, the climate benets came as an extra bonus. In Sweden biofuels, largely residues from forestry, account for more than 40% of the energy supplied. District heating also uses waste (around 20%), as well as waste energyfrom industries (8%) - partly by taking advantage of this excess heat and power. A big part of the district heating comes from combined heat and power plants (CHP) where electricity and heat are produced at the same place. It's really an energy ecient way to use the fuels. In a CHP plant more than 90% of the energy in the fuels is utilised, compared to condensing power plants or only district heating plants with lower eciency. The 1991 carbon dioxide tax, consistent political sup- port for renewable energy and a strong forestry sector have all led to the growth of the bioenergy sector. Butmost important for the increase of district heating in Sweden is probably the strong local governments as key actors in the national climate strategy and theendorsement of energy system eciency. District energy is an ecient, environmentally respon- sible method of heating and cooling buildings. A third of the energy consumption in Sweden is related to heating. But, compared to other EU member states it's not much. In Europe in general, the energy use for heating stands for around 45%. Heat Roadmap Europe The European research project Heat Roadmap Europe has studied the heat sector in Europe and pointed out district heating and cooling as a solution for EU to reach the goals for climate, energy eciency, and security. Decarbonising the heating and cooling sector requiresenergy eciency on both the demand and supply side. The heat savings can cost-eectively reduce the total heat demand in Europe by approximately 30-50%. Dis- trict heating can capture excess heat, which is currently being wasted, and can replace fossil energy sources to heat EU cities. Based on cost and energy considerations,district heating should increase from today's level of 10% in the EU up to 50% by 2050. District heating is an opportunity also for the Great Britain. The interest is rising and Swedish actors are happy to share their experiences to help on the way to an energy ecient heat sector. Swedenergy (Energif\u00f6retagen Sverige) is a non-prot industry and special interest association for companies involved in generation, distribution and retail of electricity, heating and cooling in Sweden. Swedenergy has about 400 individual member companies including state-owned, municipal and private sector companies as well as associate members of dierent types.

This proposal will seek to combine \u20ac1 billion of grants to help achieve the \"twin objectives boosting investment to fund innovative, sustainable transport infrastructure upgrades, while supporting jobs needed to put that infrastructure in place.\" European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport, Violeta Bulc, commented on the proposal , stating that: \"Achieving our vision for seamless, intelligent and sustainable mobility in Europe requires investments that public funds alone cannot provide. That is why we are launching an innovative solution to make the best of our resources, and unlock untapped private invest- ments, with particular focus on Cohesion countries. Today's action is a sign of solidarity on the move.\" This investment highlights the importance of transport innovations through Europe, while also supporting the upcoming road mobility initiatives to be launched later this year. Roads Road transport provides jobs for 10.6 million people across Europe, and carries more passengers than all other methods of transport combined. The 2017 Road Transport Strategy outlines 4 main initiatives: A well-functioning internal market (A more cost-ecient road transport network will make EUrms more competitive globally, thus encouraging job creation). Fair competition and workers' rights (Simplifying rules and improving cooperation between memberM F Warrender, Open Access Government, highlights EU Commissioner Violeta Bulc's innovative plan to finance sustainable transport and infrastructure projects A sustainable transport strategy for EuropeTRANSPORT 267states will ensure better working conditions for transport workers and operators through ensuring enforcement of social rules). Decarbonisation (CO2emissions from heavy goods vehicles represent around 30% of all road transport emissions. With renewed political momentum following the Paris COP21 agreement, road transport will begin to play its part in ghting climate change. Encouraging new charging solutions, with the possibility of providing additional value-added services will cut costs for busi-nesses and people, while better controlling emissions and optimising the use of energy and infrastructure). Digital technologies (Facilitating the use of digital technologies by proposing common standards and platforms will contribute to improving road safety, theenforcement of road transport rules, and ensure digital technologies will be used to their full potential). Bulc, who has been a European Commissioner since November 2014, commented that \"We need the sector to be more competitive and, at the same time, sociallyand environmentally responsible.\" Aviation Another transport sector that is undergoing immense improvement and renovation is Air; in December 2015 the European Commission launched an Aviation Strategy for Europe, allowing all elements of the aviation ecosystem to come together. In her speech in January last year, Time for Delivery , Bulc stated rmly that, \"A competitive and sustainableair transport sector will allow Europe to maintain its global leadership position beneting citizens, industry, and driving jobs and growth. In 2015, we outlined an ambitious vision for the aviation sector. In 2016, it is time for delivery.\" This aviation strategy aims to contribute directly to the Commission priorities of jobs and growth, digital single market, energy union and the EU as a global actor through a series of proposals: An ambitious external aviation policy.Tackling limits to growth both in the air and on the ground. Maintaining high EU standards. Innovation, investments and digital technologies. These proposals will boost Europe's overall economy,as global air transport over the long term is expectedto grow by around 5% annually, until 2030 when there will be 16.9 million flights per year - despite the current economic crisis. The aviation sector also contributes \u20ac110 billion to EU GDP, it ensures that remote areas of the Union can stay connected, and benet from indus- tries such as tourism, which in some regions would be non-existent without aviation. Connectivity is also acore driver for jobs and growth. Innovation is a vital ingredient to maintaining high standards within Europe. The technology required is provided through the airtrac management research programme SESAR, (the joint initiative between the European Commission, Europe Control and the entire Aviation sector) which aims to modernise infrastructure and raise eciency by optimising capacity - and so enable these innova- tions to become a reality. Overall, the European transport systems are becoming more and more vital every day, and Bulc has recognised this. She said, \"I am condent, that - together - with understanding, cooperation and collaboration, we will get to our destination - a Single European Transport Area that serves the needs of people, businesses (big and small) and our planet.\" M F Warrender Open Access Government editorial@adjacentopenaccess.org www.adjacentopenaccess.orgThe ROADART (Research on Alternative Diversity Aspects for Trucks) project aims to evaluate diversity techniques and antenna con- cepts, in order to develop an in-vehicle platform for cooperative intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for trucks and heavy duty vehicles in the Horizon 2020 call MG-3.5a-2014, \"Cooperative ITS for safe, congestion-free and sustainable mobility\". Highlighting large vehicles for road safety Most of the previous and ongoing ITS projects addressed mainly issues regarding passenger cars. Trucks have not been thoroughly considered and investigated yet. ROADART aims to fill this gap with the development of an in-vehicle platform for cooperative ITS. More particularly, requirements for large vehicles are considered initiating the need for new system architectures, e.g. in terms of system partitioning, diversity and antenna concepts. This will lead to new system architectures and antenna configura- tions in order to ensure satisfactory quality of service (QoS). An example of a dedicated use case under critical conditions for road safety applications is the platooning of several trucks driving close behind each other through tunnels with walls close to the antennas that support the com- munication systems. Due to the importance of tunnel safety, signifi- cant research effort is needed in orderto check the behavior of the antennapattern, diversity algorithms and ray tracing models especially for trucks passing through tunnels. Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), a safety-critical application, will be implemented on a truck, to evaluate the theoretical results and to support the planned measurements. Herewith, a safety approach for increasing robustness w.r.t. wireless communica- tion impairments on the application layer will be developed and imple- mented. \"It is clear that the number of crashes can be reduced if the driver of a truck or heavy duty vehicle is warned in time or informed about upcoming situations or dangers.\" The ROADART Project The ROADART project focuses on multi-antenna wireless transmission systems and all possible diversity configurations for Truck-to-Truck (T2T) and Truck-to-Infrastructure (T2I) communications. The performance of these techniques will be also evalu- ated with respect to reliability, avail- ability, throughput etc. taking into account all the peculiar parameters for T2T/T2I wireless networking. After this evaluation step, the optimal antenna diversity technique will be proposed and implemented. ROADART also introduces novel beam formers in vehicular communications with the use of compact electronically controlled parasitic arrays. ROADARTwill develop geometric stochastic channel models based on T2T multi- antenna radio channel measurements. These models will apply to environ- ments of highways and tunnels. ROADART also looks into proposing an efficient and operational coopera- tive framework to increase robust- ness and reliability of T2T and T2I links. The development of the frame- work will be based on mathematical and simulation analysis that will lead to the design of novel relaying proto- cols and optimised power allocation and relay placement schemes. Specialattention will be given to specific applications like tunnel crossing and platooning. Within the ROADART project the partners will design, implement and evaluate a safety framework for time-critical coopera- tive-driving applications, focusing on the application layer, in order toobtain robustness against wireless communication impairments, in par- ticular packet loss and (time-varying) latency. To this end, CACC is chosen as the cooperative driving application of interest, being both time and safety critical. The main use cases of Day 1 V2V appli- cations are road safety applications. ROADART aims to provide reliable communications for trucks with cars or infrastructure as a basis for all road safety applications. More specifically, the use cases which can benefit from this project are: Christos Oikonomopoulos-Zachos, IMST GmbH details how advanced communication techniques can be used for road safety applicationsEnhancing road safety applications for truck drivers 268PROFILEIn-Vehicle signage (simplex); Road work warning (T2I application); Probe traffic data; Hazardous location warning. It is clear that the number of crashes can be reduced if the driver of a truck or heavy duty vehicle is warned in time or informed about upcoming situations or dangers. Moreover, the number of accidents during truck platooning with the transmission of immediate warning signals though the reliable T2T wireless links could also be minimised. Additionally, several applications in the vehicle or truck may benefit fromthe information gained via T2T communications. For example, the Probe traffic data collected by the road operators may be used for traffic optimisation and then used as feed- back for the truck navigation systems. Therefore, the route calculations can take into account highly accurate and up to date traffic information. Further- more, efficient and effective truck platooning leads to a reduction of gas emissions for the following vehicles. Through reliable wireless communica- tion links, an application that can ensure safe platooning with small inter-vehicle distance and relatively high speeds can be proposed. This would take into account not only the cost-effectiveness of transportation services but also the adaption of the platoon in traffic conditions and minimisation of gas emissions. The envisaged platform of the ROAD- ART project targets high quality, low latency, and high throughput T2T and T2I efficient communication links. The ability to transfer reliable and duly-delivered traffic information contentamong trucks will allow the adapta- tion of the platooning conditions on real-time traffic disruptions. Moreover, it will ensure the uninterrupted and safe transportation provided by heavy-duty vehicles. Not only the advanced communication techniques and antenna concepts, but also the localisation capabilities provided by this platform in hostile environments, e.g. in tunnels, will allow for safe platooning. The aforementioned highly accurateand up to date traffic information generated from the data collected bythe In-Vehicle ITS Platform also allows for the detection of traffic disruptions and take them into account for routecalculations of navigation systems. Moreover, the trucks will operate as a \"traffic condition sensor\" and through T2I communication, it will be possible to continuously update information and inform drivers and vehicles in the area. Finally, due to traffic optimisation and reduction of traffic jams the green- house gas emissions (GHG) may be significantly reduced. This can be achieved through reliable and uninter- rupted communication T2I links. As mentioned before, platooning can also lead to significant reduction of GHG emissions, as long as the requirements for safe platooning are met. Although trucks are in the focus of the project, other V2V communication systems may benefit from the results. Some passenger cars will omit the shark fin antenna on the roof top in the future. Therefore, the best position for V2V antennas will not be available anymore, and alternative system archi- tectures should be considered. A diver- sity-based approach, e.g. by exploiting antennas in the side mirrors, could be a viable and effective solution and benefit from the investigations of thisproject. With the application of robust diversity and beamforming techniques the resulting ROADART platform will assure a sustainable and holistic approach for corporative ITS systems in a way that state-of-the-art systems cannot provide. Dr. Christos Oikonomopoulos-Zachos Project leader Automotive Oikonomopoulos-Zachos was born in Volos Greece in 1976. He studied electrical engineering at the RWTH Aachen University (Dipl.-Ing. 02, Dr.-Ing. 2010). In 2009 he started working at IMST in the department of Antennas & EM-Modelling. Since 2011 he is project leader in the field of automotive antennasThere is much current effort in the aerospace industry, supported by university research, which is funded by the likes of the European Community Clean Sky and Flightpath 2050 initiatives, to develop aircraft that are more fuel efficient and environ- mentally friendly. The main design strategies that can be used to achieve these goals are: better aerodynamics, less structural weight and improved engines. It is likely that in the not too distant future the traditional civil jet aircraft configuration, of passengers sitting in a cylindrical fuselage with engines attached to swept-back wings via pylons, that we have known for the past 50 years will change. Improving aerodynamic performance Considerable research has been devoted worldwide towards improving aerodynamic performance through the reduction in the aerodynamic drag that occurs in-flight; one of the sim- plest ways to do this is to decrease the so-called \"induced drag\" by making the wings longer. However, this is not straightforward as a greater wing span leads to an increase in the aerody- namic loads, which in turn leads to heavier aircraft. Perhaps the major limitation to such a design concept is the maximum wing size that is allowed at airports; airlines have to pay increased fees to use larger airport gates, and consequently this has led to a restriction on the size of today's typical aircraft designs. A possible solution to the airport gate size issue is to make use of folding wings, which can be employed on the ground in a similar way as the retractable wings used by planes on aircraft carriers. Such an approach would enable larger wing spans to be achieved, giving improved aerody- namics, without the financial gate size penalties. This technology is currently very relevant to civil aircraft designs; an option on the latest version of the Boeing 777X has a folding wing capa- bility that can be activated during taxing to and from the airport gates. The possibility of including a folding wing design has opened up the possi- bility of using such a device in-flight to reduce the loads resulting from straight and level flight, and also from gusts and turbulence; potentially removing the weight penalty incurred by extending the wings. Research at the University of Bristol, funded by theEU Marie Curie ALPES (Aircraft Loads Prediction using Enhanced Simulation) Initial Training Network and also theUK's Aerospace Technology Institute, has demonstrated that it is possible to achieving a significant wing-tip exten- sion with a limited or even minimal impact on wing weight. \"Considerable research has been devoted worldwide towards improving aerodynamic performance through the reduction in the aerodynamic drag that occurs in-flight; one of the simplest ways to do this is to decrease the so-called \"induced drag\" by making the wings longer.\" The main idea consists of positioning the hinge on the wing so that it is not parallel to the free-stream (the direc- tion that the aircraft is flying in); it can be shown that the orientation of the hinge line relative to the airflow is a key parameter to enable successful loadsImproving aerodynamic performance could be achieved using folding wing tips. The University of Bristol's Professor Jonathan Cooper explains Folding wing tips could improve aircraft performance 270PROFILE Experimental wind tunnel prototype of folding wing tipalleviation. When an upwards gust of air hits the wing, the wing-tip will fold upwards, thus reducing the angle of the wing-tip relative to the airflow and hence, decreasing the aerodynamicloads acting on the wing. Similar decreases in loads can be achieved in straight and level flight. Simulated studies 1using representative flexible civil jet aircraft computational models have explored the effect of wing-tip hinge position and orientation, attach- ment stiffness and damping, and also wing-tip weight on the static and dynamic response of an aircraft. It has been shown that significant reductions in the loads were possible without causing any problems to the aircraft's stability. Further investigations2have involved the development of an initial prototype experimental demonstrator created in order to validate the folding wing con- cept. The rig consists of a model wingwith a hinged wing-tip placed in an open jet wind tunnel to replicate the airflow experienced by an aircraft. Fur- thermore, it was possible to mimic a turbulent airflow using a gust genera- tor placed upstream of the test struc- ture. Initial studies have considered the effect of hinge angle, hinge stiffness and airspeed on the loads reduction capability of the wing-tip device, and results have confirmed the loads reduction potential of the concept predicted by the simulations. Work is continuing to evaluate the benefits of the folding wing concepts and also to determine how they mightbe implemented and operated on full-size aircraft. However, despite the considerable promise, there aremany hurdles such as complexity of the mechanism, extra weight, safetyissues and the cost that will have to be overcome before we see foldingwingtips on aircraft in the future. 1 A.

Many pieces of equipment today have sensors, supplying us with all kinds of information. Obviously we have internet access on mobile devices such as smart phones, and our mobile devices can make use of this data to tell us, for example, what movements we made today and how that may affect our health. With the growing popularity of health apps, we are rapidly getting used to this. That a similar \"health device\" also exists in trains - in bogies, to be very precise - is probably not known tomost people. However, with the huge number of passengers using rail transport today (1.65 billion on fran- chised rail services in the UK in 2015,according to the UK Office of Rail Reg- ulation, and well over 547 million in the Netherlands), we all experience the result of the improved technology. As I wrote in an earlier article , trains are equipped with many devices, giving us a lot of information about the train's health and performance. Sensors inside doors indicate theirlevel of wear and tear, and whether they are still able to close safely within the expected amount of time. Sensorsin the water basins of toilets indicate if they can still be flushed and hence are clean to be used. This goes on and on. An important part of the train is the bogie, containing amongst other com- ponents the wheels that are in contact with the tracks. It is because of the wheels on the track that trains have a lower resistance and run more efficiently than any other form of transport. However, the wheels of rail vehicles are exposed to high wear and tear. This leads to \"flattened wheels\". One can imagine that even the small- est flat surface on a wheel can lead to problems. First it causes the wheel toParticularly for bogies with flattened wheels, the Internet of Trains can bring all-round benefits, writes ZNAPZ CEO Marcel Van Velthoven The Internet of Trains: For safety, efficiency and comfort273PROFILE hit the track instead of rolling across the track, causing track and wheel to endure a higher force and resulting in damage to both elements. But where is this happening, at what speed, with what force, and what are the conse- quences, short and longer term? Rail infrastructure companies have extended the track with sensors. These sensors indicate the temperature and pressure of the wheels passing by. This is combined with the load of the train and the temperature of the air. With this set of data, it is possible to identify which wheel on which bogie of which train is flattened and rela-tively how much. The combination of this data supports the maintenance ofthe trains and the tracks. Automatically, via the 'Internet ofTrains', a signal can be sent to the train operator, informing them thata specific train has wheels that have a deviation (roundness) that is beyond an acceptable tolerance. This information can be fed back to the maintenance department who cannow quickly plan and execute a wheel correction. This prevents fur- ther deterioration of the wheels, and because the deviation is detected early, the wheel repair effort is signif- icantly less than if the flattened area had increased. If for any reason a wheel or wheels flatten quickly thetrain operator can be informed to reduce the speed of this train, less- ening further damage to the wheels and the track. Wheel flattening is identified earlierthan it would be with regular inspec- tions, and this leads to longer life for the track. Also, in severe cases with limited inspection routines, flat wheels can lead to the track breaking, which could ultimately lead to a train derail- ment with very severe consequences. An additional benefit is increased comfort for passengers. A flat wheel leads to an uncomfortable ride. There are also lower noise levels for the environment as flat wheels cause significantly more noise than round wheels. This is all because with theInternet of Trains we are able to assess the asset health of the train in real time and take corrective actions early. Identifying asset behaviour and what is required to make assets behave the optimal way is one of the core compe- tences of ZNAPZ. Identifying which data is required to perform optimal Asset Management and making this data and the required analysis and models available to the asset owner and/or operator is our core business, in which we support rail organisations across the world. Marcel Van for business Bike2Work is a project aiming to encourage a signicant modal shift from motorised com- muting to cycling. Bike2Work uses a two-fold approach to target both employees' behaviour throughcampaigns, and employers to meet the needs of cyclists. Funded by the European Commission in the framework of the Intelligent Energy Europe, the project focused both on implementing bike-to-work schemesin partners' countries and on involving employers toimplement bike-friendly measures in the workplaces. After 3 years across all of Europe, half a million com- muters selected cycling over any other transport mode to reach their workplace and with over 148 million kmcycled - approximately 3620 times the equator - the Bike2Work project contributed, only in 1 year, to save a total of 20,916 tons of CO 2emissions. The two-fold approach Given certain conditions, cycling to work is one of the most natural and spontaneous behaviours, especially in cities where private transport causes a lot of congestion and time is wasted sitting in the car. In order to break the barriers that hinder cycle commuting, people need to be persuaded but companies also need to be con- vinced that employees that cycle to work are a benet for them. The project connects Bike2Work campaigns and employer bicycle-friendliness and achieves a mutual reinforcement of eects. A Bike2Work campaign usu- ally lasts between 4 weeks to 4 months and encourages participants to use the bicycle to get to work. Gamica- tion, competition and rewards are key elements in every successful Bike2Work campaign. To achieve high visibility and participant' engagement it is important to keep track of basic statistics like the number of participants, kilometres/days cycled, CO2saved etc., especially online real-time display of statistics encourages competition, boosts motivation (specially by keeping personal track records), as well as helping to identify winners and give away prizes. Convincing employers to increase their cycle-friendli- ness was not and is not an easy process. Besides oer- ing consultations on how to become more cycle-friendly, many other tools have been developed and shared with companies, like the 'Guidebook for Bicycle-Friendly Employers', a manual addressed to company coordina- tors, CSR, environmental and mobility agents that helped SMEs to promote cycling in operation and to build an in-house cycling culture. Why should companies become cycle-friendly? Improving the situation for employees that cycle to work will lead to a reduction of illness costs, employees that cycle to work throughout the whole year have onethird less sick days than those who travel by car. Fur- thermore, bicycles require less space and less complex infrastructure: production costs and maintenance for bike storage facilities are far lower for companies thanMarco Ciarrocchi, Bike2work Project Manager at the European Cyclists' Federation highlights how cycle-friendly employers can benefit European businesses TRANSPORT 275car parking. Studies estimate that up to 7 bikes can be parked on one single car parking space (12 m\u00b2). Employ-ees traveling by bike have better accessibility to their company, they have less problems nding a parking space and therefore also tend to arrive at work earlier. Cyclists decompress the entire transport system and thereby reduce costs of trac jams and delays, a cycle- friendly workplace contributes in climate protection, energy and CO 2saving. In order to give European companies a special incentive to increasingly focus on bicycle friendliness, Bike2Work developed an EU-wide certication framework for bicycle-friendly companies, based on 6 main criteria. Each bicycle-friendly measure would contribute to dene the CFE level of a company. A minimum number of measures must be achieved per action eld in order for employers to receive the certication. The Bike2Work project may be over, but due to the popularity of the campaigns, the national Bike2Work campaigns are still growing and convincing people all over Europe to shift to a more sustainable commute.The campaigns that took place during the Bike2Work project were hugely successful and garnered support from over half a million commuters around Europe. National contexts dier and each campaign had unique characteristics but all of them eective and ambitious. Around 150 million km were cycled in one year only and 20,916 tons of CO2emissions were saved. Further info can can we fight cybercrime in a digital age? The rst thing that I did this morning was to check if I had any pending updates to install on mysmartphone. I recommend to everybody, without apology, this mildly annoying start to the day. The publication by WikiLeaks, of documents which purport to show that the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) has been developing its abilities to exploit vulner- abilities in everyday 'smart' devices in order to gather information, will inevitably increase our anxiety aboutthe Internet of Things - the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. We appear to be entering a new and darker phase in our relationship with technology - in particular the 'smart' variety which is rapidly altering our interactions with everything from our laptops to fridges, cars and, yes, televisions. When machines that we watch for our entertainment become smart enough to watch us back it is time to pause for thought about where this journeyfrom the analogue to the digital world is leading us. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Technology's promise was to make our lives easier but, reading the latest headlines on the capability of intelligence agencies to reach inside our smart devices, you could be forgiven for believing that the utopian future is being trans- formed into a dystopian present that was predicted with chilling accuracy by George Orwell in his novel '1984'. Exploitation of data by criminals There is a legitimate debate going on about access to data by national intelligence agencies for specic law enforcement purposes. But, as Europol's Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2017 reveals, the activities of national intelligence and law enforcementagencies are being met and matched by highly sophis- ticated crime syndicates.For almost all types of organised crime, criminals aredeploying and adapting technology with ever greater skill and to ever greater eect. This is now, perhaps, the greatest challenge facing law enforcement authorities around the world. Cryptoware - ransomware using encryption - has become the leading malware in terms of threat and impact. It encrypts victims' user-generated les, denying them access unless the victim pays a fee to have their les decrypted. Europol points out that the online trade in illicit goods and services is an engine of organised crime. Online fraud is now the most common crime in the UK, with almost one in 10 people falling victim. Half of all companies in Europe have experienced at least one cyber security incident. Globally, the cost to society of cyber-attacks and cyber hacking in 2015 was estimated to be around $315 billion.In an increasingly connected world tackling cybercrime must be a consideration for everyone, says EU Commissioner for the Security Union, Julian King Image: \u00a9 EU Julian King, Commissioner for the Security UnionCYBERSECURITY 277The dark web, a collection of websites operating on an encrypted network hiddenfrom traditional search engines and browsers, is the criminals' bazaar where, subject to theright introductions, I am reli- ably informed that I can rent a botnet for a modest sum which I could use to launch a Distrib- uted Denial of Service attack against anyone I felt like. As the Internet of Things grows we are inadvertently lowering the threshold both in terms of cost and availability for these attacks. My smart fridge and TV have factory-set security codes, which is insecu- rity by design. This needs to change. Increasing security Working with colleagues across the European Commis- sion, I am determined to implement a plan for reducingour vulnerability to cyber threats by increasing our resilience to attacks, stepping up the ght againstcybercrime, investing in cyber security (a public-private partnership launched last year is expected to trigger\u20ac1.8 billion of investment by 2020) and strengthening international cooperation. The NIS Directive (NIS) on the security of networks and critical information aims to ensure that all EU Member States have a national Cyber Security Strategy, a national authority responsible for network and informa- tion security, and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in place by the time the Directive entersfully into eect next year. Implementation of this directive by all Member States is the most important step we can take to ensure greater protection of our key infrastructure, and a greater shared understanding and cooperation between all the main actors. But it's of course not enough. We also need law enforcement and judicial authorities to have the necessary means to nd and punish cyber-criminals. The European Cybercrime Centre at Europol has a key role to play in that respect. Setting up an appropriate legal framework at an EU level is also necessary. We need to continue to work together with the private sector, as a key partner in the ght against cybercrime and cyber security threats. The interconnected world oers many opportunities for citizens, governments and public and private enterprises to make a positive contribution to society. But it also oers unprecedented opportunities to criminals, terror- ists, and hostile states. We must be better prepared for whatever the future holds. Julian KingCommissioner for the Security Union European Commission https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/king_en www.twitter.com/JKingEU CYBERSECURITY 278Tackling cybercrime is a major challenge for Europe In an ever changing digital world, cybercrime has become one of the major challenges for organisa- tions throughout Europe. Set up in 2013 by Europol, the European Cybercrime Centre aims to strengthen the law enforcement responses to cybercrime. Costing EU Member States an estimated \u20ac265 billion a year , pro- tecting European citizens, businesses and governmentsfrom online crime is essential for the economy. Head of the Europol Cybercrime Centre, Steve Wilson answers Open Access Government's questions about tackling the worldwide problem and the challengesthat come along with it. What are the main challenges with tackling cybercrime? One of the greatest challenges for investigating cyber-crime has always been attribution. You may nd an online nickname associated with some form of crimi- nality, or perhaps obtain an IP address, but determiningwho is behind that alias or IP address has always been the greatest obstacle. What we call the loss of location is a big issue for law enforcement agencies. This is linked to the increasing criminal use of encryption, as well as anonymisation tools, virtual currencies and Darknets such as TOR 1, which have led to a situation where establishing the physical location of a perpetrator, the criminal infra- structure that is being used to facilitate cybercriminality or the relevant electronic evidence has become increas- ingly dicult. In these situations, it is often unclear which country has jurisdiction and what legal frame- work regulates the collection of evidence or the use of special investigative powers. However, undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges we face now is related to the loss of data or the inability toaccess relevant intelligence and evidence, often because of encryption. A growing number of manufacturers and electronic service providers implement default encryp- tion of their services and devices. At the same time, tools that enable personal encryption of communications and other data are widely available. While this counts as a positive development to increase cybersecurity in gen- eral, traditional investigative techniques like wiretapping are becoming less eective, and the possibilities of digi- tal forensic analysis are severely hampered as criminals are also protecting their data with encryption. It is impor- tant to note that the criminal use of encryption is a threat that cuts across all crime areas, not just cybercrime. The widening criminal use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin2and the increased use of tumbler/mixer serv- ices3, eectively prevent law enforcement from 'following the money' and signicantly complicate the possibilities for asset recovery and the prevention of fraudulent transactions. The constantly evolving nature of cybercrime requires law enforcement to continuously update their skills and expertise. This requires up-to-date, relevant andstandardised training. While we currently do not have EU-wide standards for training and certication, we are actively involved with other stakeholders such as the EU Commission, CEPOL, the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group (ECTEG) and Eurojust to establish a Training Governance Model at EU level, which aims to address these points. This is based on a Training Com- petency Framework that we helped develop, which iden- ties the main roles in law enforcement and the judiciary involved in combatting cybercrime and the correspon- ding required skill sets. The Training of Trainers (TOT) Project and the training activities under the EMPACT policy framework are already paving the way towards addressing the expertise gap at EU.Head of the Europol Cybercrime Centre, Steve Wilson shares how his organisation is tackling cybercrime and explains why a collaborative approach is neededCYBERSECURITY 279How important are partnerships such as, with Europol and the Global Cyber Alliance to help tackle the problem worldwide? Tackling cybercrime is not a responsibility that law enforcement can, or should, shoulder alone. Cybercrime and cybersecurity are cross-cutting issues so it is very important to align and cooperate with the relevant players in this area such as GCA and others if we wantto be on the forefront of the ght against cybercrime. Cybercrime in particular requires close cooperation and working trust-based partnerships with industry, the nancial sector, the CERT/CSIRT community, aca- demia and other stakeholders as they all hold parts of the puzzle that are required to eectively and e- ciently tackle cybercrime. We have dierent advisory groups representing dierent stakeholder communi-ties that oer a great platform to establish and develop our partnerships. For us this of course also includes close cooperation with the EU institutions and other EU agencies such as ENISA, CERT-EU, Eurojust or CEPOL. By sharing best practices, lessons learned and tools we are building and further expanding a resilient network better prepared to face cybercrime and cybersecurity risks, thereby contributing to a safer and more secure cyberspace. Why is the EU a particular threat for cybercrime? The internet penetration rate for Europe is now close to 77%. This has a direct impact on the life of EU citizens and businesses alike since most aspects of our daily life now have a digital component. Many EU countriesmaintain fast, resilient internet infrastructure which attracts not only industry but also cybercriminals who use it to carry out their attacks. Moreover, the EU has a well-established, internet facing nancial sector and e-commerce industry, which are key targets for cybercriminals. These factors, together with the relative economic auence of the region, make Europe an attractive target for cybercrime. CYBERSECURITY 280How much does cybercrime cost victims throughout Europe each year? And, how much of a problem has cybercrime become? One of the measurable costs of cybercrime is the con- tinued increase in the global investments made on cybersecurity. It is however very dicult to obtain accu- rate gures on the costs of cybercrime due to underre-porting, lack of common denitions and diculties inassessing the damages caused by cybercrime. While it is possible to estimate some costs, direct nancial costsfor example, other damages are harder to evaluate, such as the nancial damage to a company's reputation or the loss of intellectual property. There are some studies which forecast that global cybercrime costs will be in excess of $6 trillion annually by 2021 4. Cybercrime has become increasingly nancial moti-vated, banks and the nancial sector are a key target for cybercriminals, with some of the main threats being banking Trojans, ATM malware, DDoS attacks, card-present and card-not-present fraud, CEO or Busi- ness E-Mail Compromise (BEC) fraud and ransomware.The crime-as-a-service business model which under- pins cybercrime provides access to cybercrime tools and services that allow even entry-level cybercriminals to conduct attacks hugely disproportionate their skill level, often for negligible costs. Couple this with theincreased digitisation or citizens' lives, businesses, and public services and we have a substantial problem indeed. What are the key challenges and threats with regards to cybercrime? The term cybercrime covers a wide range of criminality. Some of the main threats we highlighted in the 2016 IOCTA were the aforementioned crime-as-a-service business model that promotes the connection between specialist providers of cybercrime services and tools and real-world organised crime groups. Ransomware, particularly that which uses encryption, is the leading malware threat and is likely to remain so in the near future. In the area of payment fraud, we have seen the development of logical and malware attacks against ATMs and the compromise of contactless (NFC) cards. When it comes to Child Sexual Exploitation, the live streaming of abuse is becoming a bigger issue with the use of end-to-end encrypted platforms for sharing media, coupled with the use of largely anonymous payment systems. One of the cross-cutting challenges we are facing in the ght against cybercrime is theabuse of Darknets and encryption. Some of the other challenges we face are related to legislation, despite the existence of international legislative instruments, dierences in domestic legal frameworks in the EU Member States and international instruments often prove to be a serious impediment to international criminal investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. This is partly due to an incomplete transposition of international instruments to domestic legislation. The main dierences regard the criminalisa- tion of conduct and provisions to investigate cybercrimeand gather e-evidence. \"By sharing best practices, lessons learned and tools we are building and further expanding a resilient network better prepared to face cybercrime and cybersecurity risks, thereby contributing to a safer and more secure cyberspace.\" The complex transnational nature of cyber investigations require a strong cooperation eort, not only from Law Enforcement Agencies across Member States, but alsoin third countries and with private organisations, but Europol has been proven to have a leading role in facili- tating this articulation, being an exceptional information hub, providing expertise and operational support. As technology continues to evolve, how do you think cybercrime will evolve with it? Are we ready to tackle this? Cybercriminals are very flexible and quick to adopt,abuse or exploit any new technology which can enhance their criminal lifestyles. We need to invest in training and capacity building and keep the pace with technological developments to beat cybercriminals intheir own game. Relevant alliances and Public-Private Partnership initiatives are fundamental to achieve this, law enforcement cannot ght this ght alone: it takesa network to defeat a network. It is also essential to raise awareness of cybercrime threats, not just within industry, but with the public, who are regularly the victims of cybercrime. Every person adequately equipped to defend themselves is another person prevented from becoming a victim. ToCYBERSECURITY 281some degree cybercrime may even be a generational problem. Just as sanitation and personal hygiene has led to a reduction in diseases and infection, similarly, the new generation of internet users should have digitalhygiene engrained into them from an early age whichwill be a critical defense against cybercriminals. Since it was established in 2013, how has the Cybercrime Centre helped to reduce the amount of cybercrime in the EU? One of the most recent examples I can provide is the dismantling of the Avalanche network which was used as a delivery platform to launch and manage mass global malware and money mule recruiting campaigns. Europol hosted the command post during the action day and supported Germany in close cooperation with the United States Attorney's Oce for the Western Dis- trict of Pennsylvania, the Department of Justice and theFBI, Eurojust and global other global partners duringthe course of the investigation. The operation marks the largest ever use of sinkholing to combat botnet infrastructures and is unprecedented in its scale, withover 800,000 domains seized, sinkholed or blocked. Another good example of how EC3 has not only helped to reduce the amount of cybercrime, but also helped to identify and save child victims from abuse was throughthe third Victim Identication Task Force (VIDTF). VIDTF saw 25 experts in victim identication from 16 countries and 22 agencies coming together to work on sharedmaterials at Europol's headquarters over 12 days. They were supported by Europol sta, all specialists and analysts in this crime area, and together we were able tosuccessfully identify several victims of child sexual exploitation and save them from further abuse. Through our innovative and collaborative approach we have also have a big impact in the area of fraud. For example, in the last Global Airline Action Day 193 indi- viduals suspected of traveling with airline ticketsbought using stolen, compromised or fake credit card details were detained. Furthermore, EC3 plays a key role not only on the oper- ational side but also on the strategic and prevention aspect. Since 2013, we have produced a yearly InternetOrganised Crime Threat Assessment 5which provides a number of key recommendations to address the issuesand challenges of cybercrime, and identies several pri- ority topics to inform the denition of operational actions for EU law enforcement in the framework of the EU Policy Cycle. On the prevention side, we have launched several campaigns, including the No More Ransomware initiative6, which is not only an awareness campaign for victims of ransomware but also a place to go to when you fall victim of this crime. As such, it is also an excellent example of what we can achieve collectively together with industry and other law enforcement part- ners in countering one of the main cybercrime threats. Overall, I would say we have been having quite a rele- vant role in helping to reduce cybercrime. We aim to continue doing it, always improving, in cooperation with other relevant stakeholders. 1 According to the IOCTA 2015 and 2016, cybercriminals make increas- ing use of Darknets and other similar areas oering a high degree of anonymity. These environments are also increasingly hosting hidden services and marketplaces devoted to traditional types of crime, such as the drug trade, selling stolen goods, rearms, compromised credit card details, forged documents, fake IDs, and the tracking of human beings. 2 Unlike centralised virtual currencies such as WebMoney or Perfect- Money, decentralised virtual currencies such as Bitcoin do not have a single administrating authority that controls the currency. 3 A tumbler or a mixer is a service that attempts to break the links be- tween the original and the nal address by using several intermediary wallets. The service may also randomise transaction fees and add time delays to transactions. 4 https://www.herjavecgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ Hackerpocalypse.pdf 5 https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/ internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2016 6 https://www.nomoreransom.org/ Europol www.europol.europa.eu www.twitter.com/EuropolThe development of transporta- tion and information technology has advanced the interconnect- edness of global markets. With this global economic integration, new trade partners, shipping and transport routes emerge. The weight of goods carried by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) to or from the UK alone amounted to 1.63 billion tonnes between October 2014 and September 2015 (UK Depart- ment for Transport, 2016). The number of main freight units handled by major ports rose to 12.8 million units (UK Department for Transport, 2015). Similar growths in freight units are being reported by other European transport hubs. The growing cargo traffic requires effi- cient inspection procedures. Hence, shipments passing checkpoints are risk profiled by the Customs Adminis- trations to identify inconsistencies between declared and transported goods, illegal material, and threats to society. For this reason, the Center for Adap- tive Security Research and Applications (CASRA) has developed a new plat- form for cargo X-ray image interpreta- tion training, called the Customs X-Ray Simulator. This test and training system was specifically designed for cargo X-ray screening officers by computer scientists, psychologists and security experts of CASRA in close collaboration with customs organisa-tions funded by the EU 7thFramework project ACXIS. This article explores aspects of the daily work routines of cargo X-ray screeners, identifies the challenges in the process and explains how training with the Customs X-Ray Simulator may improve the screening competency of customs officers. Besides the practicalimplications, the subchapters ahead also provide an inside look into the scientific research behind computer- based training, the ACXIS project and the Customs X-Ray Simulator. The customs X-ray screening process Most borders and ports now use X-ray screening for unit load devices (ULDs) and containers to identify smuggled items and security threats. This tech- nology is particularly useful as it pro- vides an image of the shipped content without the need for physical interfer- ence. The truck is being sent through an X-ray scanner, after which the scanned image is analysed by the operator. Only if a further investigation is needed, the shipment is put aside for manual inspection. Taking the deci- sion whether the freight carrier is clear or not is a difficult task since the inspected ULD can be rather large in scale while the prohibited items can be comparably small (e.g. pills, bricks of cocaine and (chemical) precursors todrugs). Adding to the matter of differ- ences in scale, there are additional elements that need to be taken into consideration: The variety in texture and composition of the goods them- selves, the packaging of the products, the types of vehicles used to transport the freight. Each of the following freight categories poses these unique challenges to the screening process: Liquid bulk: Such as oil and liquefied gas. Dry bulk: Such as agricultural products, minerals and coal. General cargo: Includes common trade goods as well as forestry, ironand steel products. Ro-Ro traffic: A term for roll-on, roll-off cargo which is driven on and off the vessel by a motorised vehicle. Lo-Lo traffic: A term for lift-on, lift-off shipping containers, craned on and off the vessel. Another key aspect in the screeningprocess is identifying whether the load matches the information on the waybill. Differences in the types of goods, as well as the amount of goodslisted must be compared to the actual shipment, as inconsistencies may have an impact on the taxation. For all these reasons, investigating cargo goods may take anywhere from minutes to a few hours. On thatA new platform for cargo X-ray image interpretation trainingThe Customs X-Ray Simulator 282PROFILEaccount, how do customs officers cope when faced with such challeng- ing tasks? What influences their screening performance? Two important detection performance factors Knowledge-based and image-based factors have a large impact on human detection performance (Schwaninger, Hardmeier and Hofer, 2005). Knowl- edge based factors relate to knowing which items are prohibited or not and/or match the waybill, what they look like in X-ray images and how they can be distinguished visually. They are especially relevant for objects that are rarely seen in everyday life and that look quite different in an X-ray image (e.g. contraband goods and Improvised Explosive Devises, so called IEDs). Image-based factors refer to charac- teristics of X-ray images. Objects are more difficult to recognise if depicted from an unusual viewpoint, when superimposed by other objects or if the load is heterogeneous and complex. Mastering cargo X-ray screening by adopting airport security training Adaptive, computer-based training (CBT), which contains training levels based on the user's individual detection performance and learning progress, has shown to be very effective in strengthening X-ray image interpretation performance in cabin and hold baggage screening at air- ports. The abilities to cope with effects of viewpoint, superposition and image complexity are also important in cargo X-ray screening and may betaken into account when recruiting officers. A study on the competency of cargo X-ray screeners As an example of training evaluation in the domain of cargo X-ray screening, a study investigated whether a cus- tomised CBT can improve the X-ray image interpretation competency of cargo screeners (Michel, Mendes, de Ruiter, Koomer and Schwanninger, 2014). The X-Ray Tutor (XRT) training system, developed by CASRA, wasadapted to fit the needs of cargo X-ray screening for the study. The results ofthe study revealed significant increasesin detection performance for screeners having trained weekly using the C-XRT (a test version of the Customs X-Ray Simulator). In addition, a decrease in the average inspection time per image was revealed for the second measure-ment of the C-XRT group as a result of training. The EU funded ACXIS project As important as frequent training, is the creation of a platform where information can be shared nationwide with other customs sites. Because of that, standardising X-ray images recorded from different models of X- ray machines is crucial. ACXIS (Automated Comparison of X-ray images for cargo scanning) is a research project funded by the Euro- pean Union, under the 7thframework Program. The aim of the project is to promote scientific research and devel- opment by combining different part-ners with complementary expertisefor improving cargo X-ray screening. ACXIS researchers, including CASRA, work on establishing a unified X-ray image standard. X-ray data that has been converted into a standardisedformat can be stored in a database which may be shared with other sites. This manufacturer independent refer-ence database is filled with over 30,000 X-ray scans from a large variety of containers and trucks provided by custom organisations and processedby CASRA. ACXIS also develops Assisted Target Recognition (ATR) methods to auto- matically detect regular and illicit goods through dedicated algorithms. The impact of the ATR method, as well as the impact of a systematic computer-based training for cargo officers on their performance, is assessed through a validation study. Final results and publications are expected by early 2017. The Customs X-Ray Simulator Combining scientific results from the CBT studies and the algorithms used to unify X-ray images for ACXIS, CASRA has developed a training system called the Customs X-Ray Simulator. This new platform can be used for training purposes and/or evaluating the X-ray image interpretation compe- tency of cargo customs officers by simulating operational reality. The navigation on the software suite requires no prior knowledge. Due to the high degree of individualisation, new procedures may be integrated into test units quickly and comfortably. 283PROFILE284PROFILE Creation of own content The Customs X-Ray Simulator is divided into libraries, modules and series. The content manager is able to create customised image libraries by uploading their own material, e.g. X-ray images, scans of waybills and/or manually added information from the waybill. These libraries may be used to create test and training modules that can be bundled into series and assigned to certain persons or groups of personnel, with the option to allow access for a designated period of time. For example, series A contains objects hidden between pallets in the con- tainer, whereas series B contains objects attached to the walls and the cooler of the ULD (Fig. 1). If an increase in frequency of one of the two smug- gling methods is being registered at a specific border, series A or B can be assigned to the staff of the affected checkpoint for training purposes. New cases can also be uploaded to the library and allocated to the correspond- ing module. The images and case spe- cific information may be exchanged with other national customs agencies on a centralised database. Furthermore, it is possible to create individual information slides or slideblocks to launch or conclude a simu- lation and provide theoretical back- ground knowledge (Fig. 2). Simulator for computer-based training During training, it is important to expose users to a broad variety of X-ray images depicting prohibited objects from different angles in order to improve their image interpretation competency and object recognition. The interface of the Customs X-Ray Simulator features a variety of supportive functions. In addition to the zoom function, the object-specific assist frame (Fig. 2) is designed todraw attention to possible smuggling goods inside the cargo. Also available to the test user is the button \"Waybill\", which displays a list of additional information and/or a scanned copy of the waybill documents. Along withthis, integrated are following image enhancements to mimic real-work- conditions: Creates a the image in grey scales; PSEUDO COLOURS: Colours the image, 4 available colour schemes.

If an incorrect answer has been given, the responseis categorised as a false alarm. The customs screening officer is presented with trial feedback after each image and a block feedback after he or shecompletes a training session. In the trial feedback window the photo-graph, X-ray image, the training time and further details of the simulated scenario can be examined (Fig. 3). Administration and reporting functions Thanks to the administration functions, users can be monitored and managed easily. New user accounts can be swiftly imported via templates and organised in user groups. The reporting functions provide the administrator withoverviews of each user's training, test behaviour, and results. Reports may be exported for further data analysis. Centralised database X-ray images, information from the waybill, registration documents, and customised tags can be uploaded on to the shared database. The applica- tion architecture supports fully web-based clients by using HTML5 and AngularJS. The software can be used on-premises, by installing it on a server, located on the customs admin- istration's premises. In this case, theconfiguration data and the user's results are stored on a local cen- tralised database. This option enablesthe nationwide review and exchange of images and information between different customs sites. In the future, Customs Administrations from different nations will be able to extend their knowledge worldwide by operating on a shared database of valid, standardised, high quality images. As shown throughout this article, scientific results have demonstrated that there is large potential for improvement in cargo X-ray screen- ing. The use of a computer-based training, such as the Customs X-Ray Simulator, can significantly improve the detection performance of customs screening officers. Not only allows this new platform the exchange of knowl-edge, experiences and informationrelevant for successful image interpre- tation, but it also positively impacts the real, day-to-day work of customsofficers by enhancing their visual knowledge of X-ray images.

But while the economy has picked up and the UK's employment gures arestrong, many key technical industries are still struggling to nd recruits with the skills they need. A survey last year of 90,000 UK businesses by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, indicated that the skills gap is widening. The research found that rms were struggling to ll one in 4 vacancies because of a lack of suitable candidates - the highest propor- tion in 10 years. Technical jobs drawing on STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills are the most impacted, including crucial elds such as energy, transport and manufacturing. Among the worst aected is the cyber security industry- a situation that could lead to a number of potentialnegative consequences. Aside from its role as a key element of our high-growth tech sector, a strong cyber- security sector is contributor to national security. Research from the job listings site Indeed found thatthe UK has the second worst cyber skills gap in the world, behind only Israel, reflecting both the level ofactivity within the sectors as well as available resource. The report noted that the number of people searching for cyber roles was just 31.6% of the number of job postings, meaning there were 3 times as many jobs available as workers to ll them. Can the skills gap be closed? Central to narrowing the skills gap is ensuring there is a steady flow of newcomers entering the industry. Some of these new entrants will be crossing over from other elds, but increasingly they will be entering into cybersecurity as their career of choice after nishing education. As with many other tech-based sectors, How can the cyber skills gap be closed? Dr Bernard Parsons, Co-Founder and CEO at Becrypt, says the cyber skills gap can be addressed through education and trainingCYBERSECURITY 287cybersecurity has suered from a lack visibility, leading to students forgoing it for other elds which appear to be more exciting or rewarding. The government has taken several steps to try and rec- tify this issue, most recently with its CyberFirst scheme, launched under the National Centre for Cyber Security. The scheme aims to create a more positive image of the industry for the crucial 14-18-year-old age range, who will be making decisions that will dene the next several years of their education and career. More than 2,500 residential courses are being run around the UK, with the goal of not only encouraging more young people to consider the eld, but to support them through their degree and into their rst job. The scheme is also working closely with the cyber indus- try itself, which is vitally important for giving young people insight into how the sector actually works. Becrypt is one of several companies that have signed upto oer their support, which ranges from nancial inputto providing training and work experience for students and graduates. \"Research from the job listings site Indeed found that the UK has the second worst cyber skills gap in the world, behind only Israel, reflecting both the level of activity within the sectors as well as available resource. The report noted that the number of people searching for cyber roles was just 31.6% of the number of job postings, meaning there were 3 times as many jobs available as workers to fill them.\" Beyond supporting education, rms can oer more advanced opportunities for newcomers to the industry by creating internships and apprenticeships. These deliver invaluable hands-on experience within the day- to-day work of cybersecurity, something that can be dicult to impart in school or even university. Provid- ing these opportunities also gives the host company achance to work with the best and brightest new talent, and if things go well, enabling them to take them ondirectly once the apprenticeship is complete. If the level of response to Becrypt's own apprenticeshippositions is any indication, the good news is that there is no shortage of young people eager to join the indus- try. However, closing the skills gap requires a sustained eort with both governmental support and funding, andgrassroots involvement from security specialists.

ICT 290To govern is to serve - that principle is in question. As the Prime Minister has reflected, what occurred last June represented a direct challenge to the way that government operates and interacts with its citizens. Our collective faith in democracy and the relationship between the citizen and the state has faltered. The referendum vote was a message not only to leave the European Union, but to address that gap that has come to separate those who govern and those whom we seek to serve. If governing is to serve the people, it is the consistent delivery of eective and ecient public services for the citizen that underpins everything we do as a govern- ment. But while the vital work to improve and reform our everyday public services will continue throughout this Parliament - building upon fantastic achievements by my predecessors - there remains the question notsimply of how public services work better for the user, but what public service actually means to the individ-ual citizen. Indeed, this is a question that transcends the profes- sionalism and dedication of the thousands of commit- ted civil servants I have the privilege of working with every day. They go to work wanting to do things for the better and for the public good. Yet that genuine spirit of public service is lost in the opaque interface that currently exists between the citizen and the state. In too many of their interactions with government, thepublic is made to feel as though they are the servants of the government, rather than the other way around. And it is not simply the user who is disadvantaged by this relationship. Public servants are not able to full their vocation. We have asked them to work in poor The relationship between the citizen and the state is sacrosanct. Cabinet Minister Ben Gummer explains how the government will work for the people Citizen and the state: The government at your serviceICT 291buildings, to antiquated working patterns, in excessively hierarchical organisation structures, and with sub-opti- mal technology. By reducing the ability of our public ser- vants to work productively, we are compromising theirability to serve the public. Relationship between citizen and the state It is my simple ambition to reverse that relationship. I want to see a revolution in the way we deliver public services - so that people up and down our country feel that government is at their service, at every single stage in the journey and at every single moment of every interaction. The public has a right to expect the same quality of service from the government as they do from private providers. Whether it is lling in a tax return online, paying council tax, claiming Universal Credit , applying for a grant of probate, visiting a government building or applying for a driving licence , the citizen's journey must be as ecient and smooth as possible - all while maximising value for money for the taxpayer and delivering our commitment to be the most transparent government in the world. Key areas of change That is why I am today announcing four areas in which we will deliver the profound transformational shift that is necessary to restore faith in our democracy. First, we will drive forward a renewed focus on digital government as the means to deliver services for the taxpayer. Today we are publishing our Government Transformation Strategy, outlining our commitment to utilise the virtues of technology to reshape governmentby ensuring millions of people are able to access online the services they need, whenever they need. As well as moving as many services online as possible,we must harness the value of open data as a means to innovate and improve the range of services available to the public and enhance the transparency of government. We will appoint a new Chief Data Ocer - alongside the assembly of a Data Advisory Board - in order to best align our eorts to make the best use of data across government and drive our open data and data transformation policies. Third, we will work to ensure that our Civil Service has anequality of representation around the United Kingdom, so that public servants have a depth of experience of the public they serve. The Cabinet Oce is currently reviewing the location of government agencies and arms-lengthbodies, and will consider relocating them where they could generate local areas of expertise, support privatesector growth and enable a fairer distribution of CivilService expertise, especially at a senior level. And fourth, we will deliver all of these changes - andmore - while maintaining this Government's constant drive to identify and drive eciencies in government, root out fraud and error wherever possible, and make considerable savings for the hard-working taxpayer. Every single member of the public deserves a govern- ment that is responsive, accountable and eective - twenty-four hours a day, every day of the week. As I hope I am able to convey to you this morning, we will deliver our commitment to transform the relationship between the citizen and the state so that the latter serves the former - not the other way round. Only by doing so will we deliver the Prime Minister's commitment to build a country that truly works for everyone.

Some enterprise software i.e. CMS for the corporate web site, CRM for customer services, electronic forms for online data capture and GIS for mapping have all made contributions to an enterprise wide solution. The short-term plug and play solution of putting a web front end on every directorate legacy system and provid- ing separate web portals for say plan- ning, payments, benefits and housing, can often result in several web portals with different branding, disjointed customer journeys, and a multitude of different log ins, where no considera- tion is given towards personalisation. Digital transformation at the direc-torate level fails to address many age-old problems. Directorates can be left vulnerable to small pockets of expertise leading to challenging conti- nuity issues. Reduction of duplicated administration tasks is essentiallyimpossible. Cross channel communi-cations can be complex and labour intensive. The majority of directorates require dedicated resourcing and attempts to share those resources can be challenging. Around the clock communication The relationship between the citizen and the local authority has changed inthe light of technology and social changes. The customer now expects to communicate with their local authority via multiple channels 24/7 as they would with any other organisation. In addition, they expect a high level of service and personalisation whether they are communicating via telephone,web site, social media, or in person. All Portals require a degree of admin- istration, much of the administration function is replicated from one direc- torate to another but when dealing with legacy and disparate platforms, reducing replicated functionality can be daunting. Attempting cross channel fertilisation can lead to an almost bewil- dering and quite often costly relianceon API/connector development. A philosophy for change Digital transformation at directorate level can only take an organisation so far where more and more resource has to be allocated for increasingly incremental returns, (the law of dimin- ishing returns). In today's customer service society this is just not good enough and can only make peripheral contributions towards a cohesive, enterprise wide, digital by default strategy that can be planned and implemented over the next half a decade, leading to single sign on, one citizen portal/website, as well as a reduction in cost of administration and improved and personalised customer centric service. At director level a portal or directorate management philosophy has to be replaced with an enterprise manage- ment philosophy, a utopian view of enterprise management would be 2020 vision across all directorates, shared administration and resources, straight through to the processing of citizen, authority, and contractor communications. Controlled access to all portals from a single point and shared administra- tion across all directorates. When enterprise vision has become enter- prise reality then development can start to focus on break out develop- ments and multi enterprise or cross enterprise solutions such as healthand social care, local government and local SME relationships. Budgets that were previously employed for incre- mental improvements in directorate performance can now be re-allocated to multi-enterprise programmes and potentially initiatives that add value. The London Borough of Southwark The London Borough of Southwark has come a long way over the recent years, replacing brochure web siteswith fully transactional and responsive web portals. Unnecessary administra- tion effort between the client and the back office legacy systems and all of re-keying of data between systems is being replaced by utilising an integra- tion engine within the Web Labs Digital Transformation Platform (The Bridge). The evolving relationship between citizens and local authorities creates challenges when managing digital transformation. Web Labs' Garry Lander explainsManaging digital transformation: The bridge to enterprise 292PROFILEThe London Borough of Southwark now has 175,000 registered users, who signed up out of a potential population of 288,000, as well as new registrations that are accruing at a rate of 3,000 per month. There are 80,000 online Revs and Bens transactions per year and landlords licensing revenue has seen revenue increases of \u00a3110,000 in thefirst 6 months. The success of the LB Southwark citi - zens portal has led to an approach by the NHS (Southwark Clinical Commis- sioning Group) to incorporate their online services into the MySouthwark portal so that citizens, besides locating NHS services and accessing health advice will be able to register with a GP, book and manage their appoint- ments via the local government portal. At Southwark much of the directorate thinking and planning has been replaced with an enterprise solutionapproach which utilises re-usable code, shared administration and a dramatic reduction of task replication. \"The Bridge is a unique development tool that has allowed LB Southwark to accelerate Digital by Design Initiatives in a structured and economically viable progression. The Bridge enables non IT personnel to perform and manage crossdirectorate tasks and functions without compromising either the integrity or security of the directorates\" Dave Dixon, Service Improvement Manager LB Southwark.

Garry Lander Web Labs garry@web-labs.co.uk www.web-labs.co.uk 293PROFILE In publishing its transformation agenda , the government has boldly and publicly committed to change the way it does business to \"deliver public services effectively and at speed\", in response to people's expectations. While noting \"the UK government is one of the most digitally advanced in the world\", Ben Gummer MP , Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, who is spearheading the transformation programme admits that, \"government has been slow to use the transformative potential ofdigital technology to change the way it does business.\" The strategy document outlines how government intends to change that through a sweeping programme of digital transformation, which it explains is, \"in essence a change of working, of culture and of disposition - changes that are made possible by digital tech- nology. That technology is not change itself; it enables the change that is so transformative.\" Finding they lack the resources or specialist expertise in-house, some central government departments and local authorities are turning to Sungard Availability Services , (Sungard AS) a leading provider of custom production and recovery IT services, to help them meet the technology aspect of this transformation challenge. Sungard AS partners with government departments,local authorities, housing associations and other public sector organisations to successfully transform the IT infras- tructure on which their public services depend. IT transformation in practice Local authorities are starting to reap the benefits of switching to a more flexible, agile and resilient IT infras- tructure, and embarking on digitaltransformation programmes towards the end of their outsourcing or managed IT services contracts. One forward- thinking local authority saw it as an opportunity to grasp the flexibilityand cost-savings achievable through exploiting cloud technologies across the entire IT operation. Providing vital services to the borough's 400,000 citizens, this council relies heavily on its IT infrastructure and therefore needed a seamless transition, with no degradation of services. The council turned to Sungard AS to guide it through a phased transforma- tion programme with aggressive timescales. With many streams of activity, the complex programme to transition the council's solutions into the Microsoft Azure cloud was com-Sungard Availability Services provides technical knowhow and support to meet the transformation agenda and help organisations achieve their cloud ambitionsHow can your organisation meet the transformation agenda? 294PROFILE pleted, with some legacy systems hosted in a secure, resilient environ- ment. The migration was successfully executed on time, within budget and so seamlessly that many council employees and supporting agencies were unaware it had even taken place. The council is now benefiting from highly available and secure infrastruc- ture - many environments with SLA- backed levels of uptime -considerably lower IT running costs and greatlyenhanced IT flexibility and scalability. This is in addition to more predictable IT infrastructure spend as costs have moved from the CapEx to OpEx budget, and greater cost-effectiveness as the council pays only for services used. Control without the headaches Sungard AS works many central government departments, supporting them to achieve 'cloud first' ambitions with tailored, government-approvedsecure cloud services. One such department needed a cloud partner it could depend on to host 4 important applications and provide a disaster recovery service to minimisedowntime. It contracts Secure Govern - ment Cloud Services from Sungard AS via the digital marketplace. Under G-Cloud contracts, Sungard AS provide enterprise class, multi-tenancy, scalable IT infrastructure from a secure hosted environment, resiliently connected. Departments retain control over their all-important applications without the burden of owning and managing underlying infrastructure. Although this comes with the assurance of 99.99% uptime, many departments also contract additional cloud-basedrecovery to cover their hardware and operating system. In this age of high profile cyberattacks and platform outages, keeping datasecure and IT infrastructure up-and- running has never been more impor- tant. OFFICIAL data is hosted within 2 UK-based data centres, supported around-the-clock by a dedicated, security-cleared operations team. Inaddition, solutions need to scale up quickly and easily according to demand. Whatever the IT environment, Sungard AS works with it In a very short period of time, cloud adoption has moved from experimen- tation to mainstream production workloads. But, as many organisations have found, migrating applications to a cloud environment is not easy, con- trary to the hype. To start with, one size does not fit all. The needs of the applications are what determine the right infrastructure and cloud choices and, consequently, some 85%1of organisations are adopting a 'multi- cloud strategy' - choosing different clouds for different applications. However, some legacy systems are not suitable for cloud so Sungard AS works with whatever infrastructure the organisation has, including the most complex Hybrid IT environments . Hybrid IT is a reality for most with almost 3 out of 4 organisations forcedto rely on legacy systems that are not suitable for cloud, adding to the com- plexity of their IT environment. Rapid technological advances married with the history of procurement strategies across the public sector has resulted in a mix of legacy hardware,complex data inter-dependencies and contract restrictions. Consequently, many public sector clients value Sun- gard AS' comprehensive consultancy support to avoid making costly mistakes. This starts with listening to their busi- ness requirements. We then work with the department or council con- cerned to identify which applications are cloud-ready, which are best served in a physical environment and build a plan to migrate. We then help architect and manage the right environment for the all-important applications and even provide the resources - skilled subject matter experts - to deliver thetechnology transformation as part of the delivery team, thus avoiding the potential pitfalls that many of these programmes experience.

This includes architectural and engineering blueprints and renderings, and folded and finished bid sets containing all the drawings and construction sets needed to complete a project. Although traditionally a high number of AEC technical documents are produced in black and white, coloured prints are increasingly becoming a pre-requisite. The move into colour can be attributed to the belief that it improves communication, readiness and indirectly saves time and costs throughout the bid, design and construction process. Eliminating complex workflows Many repro houses use an LED printer for monochrome print runs and an inkjet printer for colour. Managing both monochrome and colour printing, along with bid sets that consist of a mixture of small format and large format pages, means having to rely on a wide range of printing hardware and software. This has often led to inefficient processes, where costs are greater and workflows can contain an increase in the number of stages needed. As AEC clients face tighter project completion times, repro houses are also under increasing pressure to deliver high-quality short-run print runs with quick turn-around capabilities. Automation is one of the key factors of a smoother and faster print process. Technology including end-to-end workflow software, combined with peripherals such as on-line folders, makes print management more efficient. Additionally, automatic detection and correction of corrupted PDFs, automatic selection of small and large format pages and on-screen soft-proofing can all help reduce job preparation time by up to 50 per cent. This frees up time to take on more jobs. Easy-to-use workflow software like HP SmartStream can also make a repro house better able to weather workforce turn-over, as it minimises the need to train new workers in complex operations.When speed matters Streamlining workflows is one way to speed up turn-around times but increasing the speed of printers is also critical. In 2015 HP was bringing the record-breaking speed of HP's PageWide Technology to large-format printing. HP PageWide Technology uses tens of thousands of tiny nozzles on a stationary print bar rather than a scanning print-head. This results in print speeds of up to 30 A1 pages/minute. Instead of using two separate devices, one printer can be installed for both monochrome and colour, and colour prints can be produced at the same cost as black-and-white. In addition, new graphic applications such as retail temporary posters and maps can be added to the offering. Based on proven HP Thermal Inkjet technology, HP PageWide print heads are designed to have a long life. The reliable drop ejection process reduces print quality defects from 'nozzle outs'. Automated print head servicing and calibration, including nozzle compensation, ensure consistent operation and minimal service intervention. Costs under control For print service providers looking to meet the demands of AEC clients, gone are the days of the LED and inkjet printer sitting side-by-side. Both colour and black & white printing will be able to be produced at much lower costs than ever before. This will make it easier to meet clients' increasingly high expectations whilst having a much needed positive effect on the bottom line.

In order to protect against ever-changing vulnerabilities, we must rethink how we approach securing complex government systems. Existing regulations, such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), represent a static approach to security, requiring voluminous documen- tation of systems to achieve an ocial Authority to Operate (ATO) but having no real-time monitoring orverication that the system matches the documenta- tion. This is the antithesis of an agile process, providing no incentive for continuous improvement. Fortunately, government is working to improve this ineective approach with the recent mandate for Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring (CDM) by theDepartment of Homeland Security. CDM is an attempt to identify risks on an ongoing basis, but it doesn't solve all security challenges for government (and in some ways, it adds new ones). Ultimately, agencies themselves must adopt a more agile cultural mind-set when it comes to security. As agencies work to implement CDM requirements, they can also work to pivot away from slow-moving, risk-averse attitudes and embrace more agile, eectivesecurity. Here are some ways to start: Have the courage to iterate While CDM will enable better real-time review of sys- tems and faster response to threats, agencies must start thinking beyond temporary xes and demonstrate agility by iterating to new systems more frequently. Government tends to cling to old systems that havebeen deemed \"secure\", applying security patches and nauseum instead of updating to new systems. This makes it dicult for innovative vendors (who are using the latest versions of everything) to safely providebeautiful solutions that work. Agencies must understand that rapid iteration and fastresponse to problems is LESS risky than using an old system that was once deemed \"secure\" after a battery of tests, but is now 7 years out of date. Instead of fearing new systems, governments should embrace updates with an agile mind-set, realising that newertechnology provides a more stable foundation that is far more secure (even with bugs) than an old system that is full of holes and patches. Keep metrics flexible and responsive One of the goals of CDM is to track metrics and standards of agency IT security (strong passwords, up- to-date patches, etc). But agility is lost when documen- tation of metrics takes priority over new learnings. For example, two-factor authentication might be shown to be more eective than a strong password, but agencies and vendors are still forced to comply with requirements based on outdated information. Government should be open to changes in the way security is measured, just as an agile process demands changes in project direction when a better path is dis- covered. Adhering to outdated metrics because they arein the documentation is like traveling an old, rutty roadeven when a clear path is within sight, simply because the old road is the only one shown on your map. Learn from failure In an agile development process, there is intense focus on what can be learned from the customer or users. An agile security process applies that same intensity ofFen Labalme and Robert L. Read of Agile Government Leadership, explain the role of an agile security process in highlighting and preventing security risksICT 299focus to what can be learned from adversaries. Agencies should continually retrospect on any failings in security - not just applying patches, but embracing innovativeways to avoid the problem in the future. Being agile means having the courage to diverge from the status quo in an eort to achieve the highest performancepossible. Embrace open source Agile technologists and vendors in the open source community are eager to provide solutions to govern- ment, but are hindered by the fact that the CDM requirements are behind closed source code. If the Department of Homeland Security would publish theAPIs and data formats required for collecting and transmitting the required metrics, agencies could more easily benet from the collective knowledge of open source innovators, gaining access to solutions that reflect the most recent learnings. Security is never \"done\" Agencies shouldn't ask \"Are our systems secure?\" Secu- rity is not a destination to be reached or a project to be checked o a list. Rather, agencies should ask \"Howhave we recently improved our security?\" That is an agile question that will prompt a re-examination of static approaches and lead agencies on a journey of continu- ous improvement towards better, faster security.

Read, PhD Presidential Innovation Fellow Founder, Public InventionAgile Government Leadership info@agilegovleaders.org www.agilegovleaders.org The UK is recognised as a world leader in digital government, topping the UN E-Government Survey index for both development and e-participation1. This has been led by the UK's Government Digital Service (GDS) with its tenacious focus on user needs, common design principles, and openness, balancing the needs of citi- zens and government, as well as Agility. In the UK, unlike almost anywhere else in the world, government appears to be ahead of the private sector in the adoption of Agile methods in service development. Agile is mandated by GDS for central government digital services, and both the National Health Service and local government are developing their own related digital standards with Agile at their heart. Despite this, government is struggling to adapt the way it leads and manages change to get the most out of the speed and flexibility that Agile promises. As Daniel Thornton from the Institute of Government observed earlier this year, \"Agile development involves decision- making which is swift, and as close to the user as possible. This is not how decisions are made in government, with its overlapping layers of control from the centre and within departments and agencies. Public servants need to learn the specialist skills to do this....\" Agile Business Consortium, a globalnot-for-profit organisation which pro- vides advice, guidance and training toAgile practitioners working in all sectors, believes it's time for the wider Agile community to step up the cross-sector Agile learning, to the benefit of both government and the private sector. What is Agile service development? Agile is built on simple principles which were radical when they first emerged 20 years ago, and still remain relevant today. Yet they are challenging to put into practice in large, complex and hierarchical organisations like govern- ment departments. These ideas are articulated in many different lists - here's a short one: Agile is collaborative - we have users, technologists, front-line staff and managers working together, often in the same room, throughout the design and delivery of a new service.Agile is flexible - we know that requirements will change throughout a project, and welcome the improved understanding of user needs that this change represents... we don't hate \"scope creep\" but embrace change and aim to make decisions quickly and asclose to the problem as possible. Agile is about people, not tech- nology or other \"stuff\" - we focus on what users and businesses need, and how the people who deliver services can meet those needs - sometimes, but not always, with the help of technology. Agile is transparent - we prefer showing models, prototypes and the actual product, rather than producing reports, spreadsheets and presenta- tions. We also prefer sharing our challenges to hiding them. 300PROFILE Agile Business Consortium's Geof Ellingham outlines the benefits of Agile methods in digital service development and how it can help public servicesReaping the full rewards of Agile in governmentWhat special challenges does Agile face within government? Agile's first big success in government was the creation of the very first version of GOV.UK (the single website for all central government services), which was built in an Agile way by a small team in a mere 10 weeks. Although this was a huge achievement, this was a very different challenge to the one facing e-government. In some ways, it was more like a modern tech start-up company - flat, lean, co-located and flexible. The challenge with scaling Agile to work across government is that the environment is the opposite of a start- up. The need for ministerial account- ability to the public tends to create a risk-averse atmosphere in which decisions are made far away from (and sometime after) the problems towhich they are responding. This creates a disconnection between the rapid design and evolution of a service, and the decision-making hierarchy, exacerbated by the fact that many of the technical staff are ITcontractors, not full-time civil servants. In response to the special complexity of government, GDS has created the GOV.UK Service Standard and Sup- porting Service Manual, which defines a development lifecycle for digital ser- vices (Discovery-Alpha-Beta-Live) and provides a set of design standards and a host of supporting guidance. This has produced some excellent results in the design of citizen facing services (e.g. Tax your Vehicle). However, thereis often the need to deliver more com- plex and far-reaching changes through projects and programmes, and this is where challenges emerge. There is currently no Agile method which effec- tively addresses the Agile develop-ment of Digital Services within a pro- ject or programme structure. For this reason, the Agile Business Consortium have been developing a new version of their widely recognised Agile Project Management (AgilePM\u00ae) framework and qualification, which is specifically targeted at digital service development. This has been devel- oped taking into account the needs of many other organisations such as the NHS, local government and private sector organisations who are also looking to develop new and improved digital services. This will enable any organisation to develop a consistent approach, a common language and a skilled work- force (with appropriate accreditation opportunities) for the successful design and delivery of digital services whether through evolving improve-ments or step-change transformation. Agile Business Consortium has adapted the AgilePM qualification to explain how the concepts can be easily aligned to the GDS lifecycle and roles, to provide a flexible governance struc-ture to use alongside Scrum, Kanban or any other IT development methodol- ogy. The new course, AgilePM and Dig- ital Services, will also cover some of the distinctive elements that GDS has injected into Agile discourse, such as citizen over government and assisted digital and it will also include the tried and tested concepts of alpha, private beta and public beta within the project lifecycle. How are we doing this and when will it be available? The course is in alpha at the moment (meaning we're trialling a prototype with real people to see how it works), and we'll be sharing those experiences and launching our public beta programme inGeof Ellingham Director Agile Business 301PROFILE May 2017.

In a post-referendum, pre-Brexit world of economic uncertainty, what are the prospects for public sector suppliers in 2017? Theresa May and Phillip Hammond may have signalled the end of the era labelled 'austerity',but the country's budget decit is still a millstone. Although control of public nances will be kept under tight rein, there is denite scope for optimism. The Cabinet Oce, through its Crown Commercial Service (CCS) and Government Digital Service (GDS) arms, has recently reiterated its intent to expand its business with SMEs, but has also indicated it is opento new propositions from suppliers of all shapes and sizes. In local government and other areas of public service delivery, transformation remains a vital, if thorny, issue. In addition to transformation, cloud platforms and data exploitation will be priorities. These may seem familiar to established observers of public sector ICT, but thereare denite indications that the next year will see a confluence of these three strands that accelerates realadoption, resulting in a buoyant market. A new way of thinking for public bodies True transformation involves consideration of technol- ogy, processes and people - the latter necessitating culture change. What has passed for digital transforma- tion to date has mostly been a neater user interface and digitisation of forms. To eect the required step changein ecient service delivery, public bodies must genuinely invert their thinking in redesigning end-to-end processes to reflect a citizen's needs using techniques such as cus-tomer journey mapping and robotic process automa-tion. It's taken some time to pervade, but the message on Liam Maxwell's iPhone case exclaiming \"What is the user need?\" is nally coming of age, evidenced by a pro-liferation of job openings such as Business ManagementAnalyst, Head of User Research, Business Change Strategy Lead, and UX Designer. Cloud computing is now an inevitable by-product of transformation as the availability of lower cost stan- dards-based (open or de facto) platforms and superfast broadband tips the balance against the continuation of multiple iterations of on premise infrastructure. G-Cloud has been much vaunted as the key driver in the move to the cloud, and will continue to evolve, with contract lengths likely to be extended to the delight of customers and suppliers alike. 2017 will bring greater acceleration of cloud usage due to the arrival of UK data centres from three giants of technology: Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Serv- ices. Data sovereignty has been an oft-quoted though much-abused barrier to cloud service uptake which willdisappear at a stroke. With partner ecosystems for all three delivering a plethora of as-a-service solutions to meet all manner of application requirements, the last vestiges of all-encompassing IT outsourcing arrange- ments will tumble as they reach their contract end dates. The third area oering hope to IT providers is data exploitation. The government remains committed to delivering open data sets that facilitate re-use and innovation in public service delivery. Aggregated data opportunities Undoubtedly it faces challenges in getting necessary data sharing legislation passed by Parliament, though this is in no small part due to a lack of clarity in categorising dierent types of data. Of course there will be a public backlash against citizens' personal data being openly shared and consequently put at risk of misuse. But the unfettered availability of operational data, performance data and aggregated anonymisedRob Anderson, analyst in the public sector team at GlobalData, predicts a buoyant market for public sector ICT this year and in the longer term...iCt 303data on individuals oers tremendous opportunities for more timely service delivery, more and better con-nected services, reduced losses due to fraud and error, and ultimately a much improved user experience. \"Cloud computing is now an inevitable by-product of transformation as the availability of lower cost standards-based (open or de facto) platforms and superfast broadband tips the balance against the continuation of multiple iterations of on premise infrastructure.\" In terms of routes to market, CCS continues to strive to corral departments, agencies and authorities from all parts of the public sector to use its services and frameworks, and a healthy pipeline of market-centricframeworks is being built. Brexit will almost certainly have no immediate impact on procurement regula- tions, and is unlikely to over the longer term either, given the UK's position in driving such legislation. So, the rules of the game remain the same. Yet there is no substitute for good old-fashioned selling: Getting to know your customer - either directly or through part-ners - and building a relationship that delivers value and addresses their individual needs. Opportunities abound for those organisations that clearly understand the public service market, its challenges and drivers, and can deliver agile dynamic and innovative solutions which satisfy the key needs. Furthermore, the skills gap in the public sector is well documented. Supporting clients with knowledgeable, well-trained sta pays dividends. Investments in rela- tionships will always trump investments in products. Rob AndersonAnalyst - Public Sector Team GlobalData (formerly Kable) www.globaldata.com ICT 304Critical communications and the Internet of Things The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest growing and highest prole trends in technology. According to Juniper Research, by 2020 there will be 38 billion IoT devices in the world. IoT is often consid- ered from a consumer standpoint - think smart thermo- stats and fridges. However, governments can signicantly benet from IoT compatible critical communications. The power of multi-modal, two-way communication Critical communications platforms are already deployed by businesses, local authorities and national govern- ments around the world to warn and advise people in the event of a crisis. These incidents can range from sourcing a relevantly-skilled IT technician to repairing a broken server, and engaging with the public during a terror threat. Central to the success of critical communications plat- forms are 2 key functions. The rst is the capability to deliver messages using a variety of dierent methods - this is known as multi-modal communications. No communications channel can never be 100% reliable,100% of the time, so multi-modality transforms the speed at which people receive the message. Multi- modality facilitates communication via multiple com- munication devices and contact paths including email, SMS, VoIP calls, social media alerts and mobile app notications, amongst many others. Multi-modality ensures that it is easier to receive a message. Two-way communication makes it simpler to conrm a response. In a critical emergency every second counts, so organisations can use communica-tions platforms to create and deliver bespoke templates that require a simple push of a button to respond. In doing so, the level of response to critical notications can increase signicantly.What does this have to do with IoT? Combining data from IoT devices with a critical commu- nications platform oers a new emergency alertingplatform for automated decision making and sophisti- cated communications. This provides businesses with the ability to add context to critical alerts, connecting the right people to physical devices, at the right time, to take the appropriate action. IoT also enables physicaldevices to respond to situations and act accordingly. \"A leading coffee shop brand uses a critical communications platform to manage brand reputation and crises. The platform allows the business to send quality assurance and emergency product recall alerts directly to store POS systems so that store managers receive the alerts before opening.\" IoT - 'things' thinking for themselves The most eective way to take action during a criticalevent is often not people communicating with other people. An increasing number of devices connected to the internet rely on embedded intelligence to communi- cate critical information. These devices not only provide constant monitoring services, but have the ability to apply real time control as needed. In many cases, these automated, intelligent devices can respond faster than a human. The power of human interaction remains Automated device to device communication is power- ful, however, the need for human interaction does not disappear. For crises that require the involvement of government, engineers or emergency services, IoT can speed up the delivery of critical information and ensure a timely response. As IoT systems become increasingly intelligent and automated, the need for expert human interventionNigel Hawkins, Managing Director EMEA, Everbridge highlights how critical communications can utilise technology developed in the Internet of Things sectorICT 305becomes more important. Firstly, as machines get smarter the decisions people need to make get harder. Secondly, in an automated environment, decisions can fuel chain reactions of unintended consequences. These require human interaction to ensure hysteria does not occur. IoT crisis management in the real world A state government operated dam may have sensorsplaced inside the stone & metal walls to automaticallyalert engineers and local authorities if water levels rise too high, tailoring the communications based on severitylevel and the roles and responsibilities of appropriateworkers. In the medical industry, pacemakers can be tted with sensors that relay information to a team of doctors and notify them via email, text and/or phone if anything requiring their attention arises. They can also send messages to the patient to let them know if they are exerting too much energy and should rest. This protects the individual but also manages the increasing pressure on A&E departments. By pre-empting severe changes in heart palpitations, the patient can be treated before their condition worsens and they need to visit the hospital. A leading coee shop brand uses a critical communi- cations platform to manage brand reputation and crises. The platform allows the business to send quality assurance and emergency product recall alerts directlyto store POS systems so that store managers receive the alerts before opening. Critical communications technology is widely used in the US. Eight of the 10 largest cities use Everbridge, the critical event communications platform, to communi- cate with citizens if an emergency arises. For example, the State of Florida used the platform to manage public safety in Hurricane Matthew. As residents were forced to evacuate their homes and counter unprece- dented rainfall, wind, power outages, road closuresand other incidents, The State of Florida encouraged citizens to sign up for evacuation instructions and critical information sent via the platform. \"According to Juniper Research, by 2020 there will be 38 billion IoT devices in the world. IoT is often considered from a consumer standpoint - think smart thermostats and fridges. However, governments can significantly benefit from IoT compatible critical communications.\" The States of Guernsey is the rst UK roll out of direct government to citizen mass notication. It uses theEverbridge communications platform to co-ordinate itsemergency response teams and enables residents to sign up to various communication threads such as re-work display information for dog owners. With today's unpredictable terror landscape, it is more important than ever that the UK Government considers the benets of mass notication and the opportunities crisis communications platforms can provide when they are IoT compatible. No government or organisation can eectively prepare for every eventuality, so the ability to quickly and eectively communicate with key stakehold- ers in any circumstance is essential in eective crisis responses. Nigel Hawkins Managing Director EMEAEverbridge www.everbridge.com ICT 306Taking advantage of container technology Container technology has been discussed with excitement for quite some time. More and more enterprises are seeking to familiarise themselves with a burgeoning IT trend that promises so much, supposedly oering improved eciency, optimisation, and security. Such benets should also be music to the ears of the government IT professional, especially as networksgrow. A lack of clarity over what container technology actually is and does is inhibiting its adoption. However, there are signs that the public sector is set to embracecontainer-based technology. For example, the UK Government Digital Service is turning to containers to develop Gov.UK Pay . In this article, we will take a closer look at container tech- nology and explore how your government organisation could make the most of its potential, ensuring that when the time is right, you'll be ready to reap the benets. What are containers? \"Container\" seems like an improbably vague term foran IT solution, though it is actually an accurate descrip- tion of what it does: it keeps a piece of software in a complete le system that contains everything needed to ensure the software always runs the same, regard- less of the environment. Essentially, it keeps everything within a container, undisturbed by outside influence. This containerisation of a \"whole system\" could be for a specic application and infrastructure service or the entire application. As an example, let's imagine you're building an application to support online transactions. Users will log in, click on the item they so desire, and then go through the familiar checkout process before nishing the transaction. What containers will allow you to do for such an appli- cation is to ensure that, if any one of these dierent sections fail, the application does not. By isolating each service into \"microservices\" across dierent containers, you can be comfortable in the knowledge that the application won't be disrupted. Instead, if there is a fail- ure of a container or the system running it, the serviceswill simply revert to alternative systems, where the job will be completed. Legacy technology, on the other hand, would see this as a tiered application, with a failure in one of these tiers resulting in a degraded application or worse, downtime. By separating each section into its own package, a con- tainer is more reliable and safe. This approach ensures each container is responsible for its own unique task. You've heard the phrase \"jack of all trades, master of none\"? Well, containers ensure that each task is carriedout by a master of one, rather than a jack of all. Reasons to adopt Now, given the example I provided is more suited to the enterprise IT pro, you may be wondering how your gov- ernment organisation could benet from containers'functionality. Look closer, however, and their attributes prove to be a wonderful t for the public sector. First, containers are lightweight, with their individual nature meaning that they focus solely on one task,using very few resources. Coupled with the fact that they are based on open source technology, this means they can be run anywhere, regardless of the environ- ment, oering government IT pros a low-maintenancesolution that's cost eective and easy to set up. Also, their individuality makes containers more secure. Due to containers being isolated from other tasks andJoe Kim, SVP and Global CTO at SolarWinds says government organisations can improve efficiency, optimisation and security by using container technologyICT 307processes, they can remain untouched by outside influences and, as a result, are more secure than non- containerised solutions. Indeed, the majority of benets that containers represent are due to their small size and stand-alonenature. For these reasons, they are extremely scalable, using a minimal amount of memory or disk resources,while their flexibility enables you to scale across distributed providers. Getting started So, how do you get started? As much as we'd like to think this article provides a one-stop shop for all your container needs, the reality is that some due diligence is required before jumping in with both feet. Due to the fact that containers are open source, it's very easy to access an enormous amount of information on how they work, and how you can reap these benets for your own government agency. Once you've educated yourself and understand what you're looking for, resources should be set aside to train government IT pros in the intricacies of containers and\"microservices.\" While they are simple to use in theory, overcondence can be the downfall of IT pros, whoshould familiarise themselves with these services and understand where to best implement them to improve eciency. Essentially, you need to prepare for containers' arrival. By educating yourself and the rest of the government agency's IT team, you can be sure that when containers do arrive, you're not wasting time guring out how to apply them to your own environment. Instead, you canbegin devising a strategy to make the most of what could be an extraordinarily useful addition to your organisation. Joe Kim SVP and Global CTO SolarWinds www.solarwinds.com www.twitter.com/solarwinds ICT 308Rapid response: Using mobile technology to tackle disasters When disaster strikes, time is of the essence. Whether it is a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, the emergency services must be able to respond quickly and eectively. To do this, they need detailed insight into a situation as it develops, as well as the ability to coordinate their response with the general public. Faced with limited resources and personnel, it's a challenge for the emergency services to be rst-on-the- scene when a disaster strikes. Traditionally, it has fallen to the public to notify the emergency services and to provide the rst-hand intelligence needed to coordinate an eective response. In the UK, this has traditionally taken the form of citizens phoning 999 and relaying as much as they can to an operator. This operator then keys the intelligence into a computerised incident response system that feeds the data to the relevant service (police, re, ambulance, mountain rescue etc.), before instructing the caller on what to do next. While this system has proved its worth down the years, the process is labour-intensive and the utility of the information provided depends upon the witness' ability to recall details. Fortunately, in today's always-connected, app-powered age a civilian with a smartphone can open a two-way channel between the public and the authorities andJessica Gibson, Project Manager, West Yorkshire for Innovation at West Yorkshire Police shares how mobile technology can help services during an emergency ICT 309oer a plethora of data to be used in the event of a crisis. However, two important barriers remain: how are emergency services going to access this information and, how can they turn the weight of available data into coherent and actionable insight? Protection through collaboration In Project ATHENA , West Yorkshire Police, SAS and other partners have developed a mobile app and con- trol platform. It allows emergency services to collabo-rate with the public to gain insight into developing crises. Using the app, citizens alert emergency servicesto ongoing incidents and provide invaluable informa-tion by submitting written reports, video recordings and pictures from the convenience of their phones.Equipped with this insight, the police distribute advice en masse to those in jeopardy by sending targeted warnings to app users in the vicinity, coordinatingpublic and police activity for a better response. The advantages of the mobile platform are clear. Com- pared to relayed information communicated over the phone by an operator, the app facilitates a direct and instantaneous dialogue. Video footage and photogra- phy, unlike details that have to be remembered and then clearly explained, is similarly unaected by time or the memory of the civilian, providing instant and accurate information. If appropriate, police can evenask citizens to report any sightings of suspects or vulnerable people - engaging in a productive two- way dialogue with the public to foster closer collaboration. However, beneath any successful mobile app such as this resides a strong core of data analytics. In the ATHENA app, submitted reports and recordings are auto- matically analysed by SAS Text Miner to determine the urgency and severity of the situation. The SAS Information Retrieval Studio then allows the police to scan massive amounts of social mediadata for more insight into the situation. As new reports flow inafter the initial crisis, SAS Content Categorisation detects whether the information con-cerns a new or existing crisis before categorising it. These processes speed-up and automate what would otherwise be a series of laborious tasks for personnel, and buy precious time to formulate strategy and save lives. Rapid response Though still in their infancy, prototype solutions such as ATHENA could radically improve disaster responseand the quality of collaboration between the authori- ties and public. Using smartphone technology anddata analytics, these applications can lay the founda- tions for superior intelligence gathering and response synchronisation. Most importantly, this approach saves time and could be the dierence between life and death.

CONTACTeditorial@adjacentopenaccess.orgNEWS, VIEWS AND OPINION www.adjacentopenaccess.orgGOVERNMENTOPEN ACCESS ICT 312Brexit should not impact the disaggregation of IT services The recent reports that Brexit will lead to govern- ment organisations rolling-over on existing IT contracts and simply renewing, is hugely disap- pointing as it could signicantly impact the govern- ment's digital and innovation agenda. In the last few years, the Government's Digital Strategy (GDS) has made great strides by invigorating the skills and desire of government IT organisations to enable change and do things dierently. This is apparent within the new Government Transfor - mation Strategy 2017 to 2020 policy paper: \"The imperative is to change, therefore - and to do so at pace and at scale. This is the meaning of transfor- mation. It is in essence a change of working, of culture and of disposition - changes that are made possible by digital technology. That technology is not change itself;it enables the change that is so transformative,\" saidthe Rt Hon Ben Gummer MP, Minister for the Cabinet Oce and Paymaster General. The key here being transformation, not transition.Now more so than ever with the advent of Brexit (and also the snap General Election), government departments should carry on regardless and continue to lead the charge on transformation. One of the key enablers to transformation is making sure your own house is in order. That means securing a solid, agile, disaggregated IT service, enabled through the supply chain with transition to new, enthusiastic, flexible, and specialist service providers. Equally, with the well-documented skills gap in the public sector and the new IR35 legislation that impairs transformation, there is also a need for governmentusers of technology to continue to eectively deal with its supply chain to deliver best value whilst at the same time introducing the agility and innovation that will drive the transformation required. A disaggregated approach At the heart of this transition is Service Integration, and the Service Desk. The Government IT Strategy of 2012 stated that Service Integration and Management (SIAM) would help break the stranglehold the large out- sourcers had on government and the wider industry.That was until Alex Holmes, the then Deputy Director and Chief of Sta in the Oce to the CTO, announced in a blog in February 2015 that the SIAM tower model was no longer an acceptable approach to procurementfor Whitehall departments. But many government departments had already started with the SIAM approach and were well on the way to disaggregating the large outsourced contracts, with some success. Now, the terminology has moved on, but disaggregation, multi-sourcing and service inte-Littlefish's Dave Aspindle explains why it is important the disaggregation of IT services should continue, irrespective of the political landscape ICT 313gration remains an accepted approach, with tangible benets to the status quo. We are witnessing a plethora of government organisa- tions starting to deliver the agility required to enable the transformational change mandated to them. Multi- sourcing or disaggregation achieves the combined goals of insourcing control, lowering cost and enabling change. Historic England is a recent prime exemplar of this. \"Now more so than ever with the advent of Brexit (and also the snap General Election), government departments should carry on regardless and continue to lead the charge on transformation.\" Today, there are a multitude of procurement frame- works - such as technology services (RM1058) and the Digital Marketplace - that support the disaggregated approach. Users can now procure the component serv-ices that used to make up the monolithic, inflexible, expensive, energy sapping, single-source IT service contracts. With a small hint of oversimplication, youcan relocate your legacy equipment into the Crown Hosting Service, buy the managed infrastructure andapplication support services through Technology Serv- ices, whilst providing end user services as either two components, Service Desk and End-User-Compute or as a single service, procured again through technology services or G-Cloud. The take-on or onboarding is then simply a matter of transition, within a few weeks or at most months. 'Quick wins', immediate improvements, and more user-aligned services are now the norm, when it comes to transition outputs. The overall out- come is a set of building blocks that can flex and change as the digital transformation agenda gathers momentum and builds the new services from similarly procured standard components. Service integration and the service desk remain pivotal to eective disaggregation and the government's transition agenda here. With recent focus on a new business-led, accreditation scheme , Service Integration should be regarded as a set of common sense man- agement practices, much as we regard PRINCE2/PMP, ITIL and ITSM.There are many practicing organisations with real experience of delivery, and whilst the government strategy in the long-term is to insource service man- agement and control, departments and users can procure consultancy and delivery services from the Digital Marketplace to assist and enable this journey. Not often seen as a commodity service, the service desk can also be procured as a separate component of your IT service operation, with specialist providers oering 24/7, agile capabilities with a focus on quality and userexperience in line with the transformation strategy. Transition is easy and the immediate benet on user productivity and morale should not be underestimated. We have seen this for government customers such as the National Audit Oce, Parliamentary Digital Services, The Pensions Advisory Service and Historic England. Brexit should not stop progress In summary, often, in uncertain times, the default response of government departments is to 'stick with what they know' and take the easy road. However, the current Government Transformation Strategy provides this generation with an opportunity to build upon the progress the sector has made in transforming and transitioning from large single-sourced monolithic relationships. The service desk is at the heart of thisdigital transformation agenda and will cushion theimpact changes will have on users, whilst enabling organisations to insource key service managementresponsibilities with condence. Brexit is not an excuse for not getting the best value from your supply chain. Disaggregation or multi-sourc- ing is truly delivering agility, flexibility and innovation in IT service delivery - the benets and ease, far outweigh the risk of simply rolling-over on existing IT contracts. Dave Aspindle Head of Public Sector Littlefish https://www.littlefish.co.uk www.twitter.com/littlefishukComputer systems are every- where in our society and their integration with most parts of our lives is constantly increasing. This wide scale integration of comput- erised systems is accompanied by an increasing need to deal with their cor- rectness in not only safety critical sys- tems, such as those in cars, airplanes, missiles, and hospital equipment, but also general infrastructure systems such as financial databases, powergrids, and telecommunication. Even in the area of consumer electronics there are growing concerns about many aspects of their correctness. For example, years ago, establishing the correctness of, say, desktop PCs, music players, and telephones was not urgent since rebooting such systems to recover from errors or bugs was mostly just a nuisance. But today, these same devices are tightlyintegrated into networks and, hence, must deal correctly and securely with their user's confidential information. Security As it is painfully clear today, connect- ing your computer to the internet is similar to submerging a submarine into the depth of the sea: if there is a crack in your system, it will be exploited quickly and with serious consequences. Attempting to estab- lish some formal guarantees about software systems is no longer an aca- demic curiosity. If we cannot provide basic guarantees of the correctness and security of our computer systems,our future could resemble William Gibson's world in his novel Virtual Light, where network security was so bad that important data was trans- ferred by bikers carrying hard-disks. In such a world, the development of allthe new features and services arising from networking and sharing, and the concomitant increases in efficiency and productivity, that we all hope to see unfold would be greatly delayed. Whilst it is possible to increase one's trust in software by employing various management techniques during the construction and maintenance of computer systems or by making use of standard, open source systems, current experience with these approaches still results in insecuresoftware. There is, however, a growing interest in taking the extreme position of treating computer systems as mathematical structures and formally proving some correctness and secu- rity properties for them. While achiev- ing mathematical certainty about some aspects of computer systems can go a long way to increasing trust in the correctness of such systems, obtaining formal proofs is a complex and difficult process with many moving parts, some of which must also be trusted. For example, pro- gramming languages, compilers, and machine architectures all need to have mathematical descriptions. One may need to prove properties (invari- ants) about the execution of any program. One needs to prove that acompiler transforms a program in a high-level language to a block of machine code in such a way that the meaning of the original program ispreserved. A number of other compo- nents of a programming environment may also need to be trusted, including, for example, parsers, printers, type checkers, verification condition gener- ators, and linkers. Then, of course, there is also the infrastructure needed to support the activity of building formal proofs. While the world of proofs in mathematics are usually produced by humans for other humans to read and to learn from, the world of formal proofs involving com- puter systems are tedious, detailed, and long. Such proofs can only bechecked by other computer systems called proof checkers. If we are not careful, we might have replaced the problem of trusting one's original computer system by a long chain of tools that all need to be trusted. Researchers are, in fact, working on many different parts of this chain of tools in order to increase our trust inthose tools. In the end, if one can really construct a formal proof that clearly proves some property holds of a computer system, then one does not need to trust the reputation of a particular compiler or some team of programmers. Instead, we can invoke the bedrock of trust that arises from the scientific method reproducibility by enabling any number of sceptics to implement LIX, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and CNRS highlights the role formal proofs can have in ensuring trust in computer systemsImproving trust in computer systems using formal proofs 314PROFILEthe claim that a given formal proof does, in fact, prove the theorem claimed. If different programmers working with different programming languages at different times on differ- ent computer hardware are all capa- ble of verifying a formal proof, then we can trust the theorems established by such proofs as strongly as we trust anything established by the scientific method. \"As it is painfully clear today, connecting your computer to the internet is similar to submerging a submarine into the depth of the sea: if there is a crack in your system, it will be exploited quickly and with serious consequences.\" While formal proofs and reproducible proof checking can provide a trustable framework for the development of trustable computer systems, state-of- the-art theorem provers, the major source of formal proofs, do not con- tribute to this framework for at least 2 reasons. First, there is a large number of different provers and they collec- tively build proofs in a wide array ofdifferent formats. Such formats range from ad hoc designs used in spe- cialised situations, to proof scripts that describe how to lead a particular inter- active theorem prover to a proof, to any of the multitude of textbook for- mats such as resolution refutations, natural deduction, bi-simulations, etc. Second, in the case that a prover is willing to export their proofs, the actual format of their output is usually idiosyncratic and ill-defined. ProofCert Project Within the ProofCert project, which I have been leading for the past 5 years, we have turned to proof theory, a topic of mathematical logic that began in the 1930s and has been slowly evolving since then. Using prooftheory, we have developed the foun- dational proof certificates frameworkfor providing formal definitions of a wide range of proof systems. Given itsroots in logic, this framework is both technology-independent and involves implementation techniques that have been well studied and analysed for the past few decades. Anyone interested in implementing a checker of proofsdefined using this framework can easily understand exactly what needs to be implemented, as well as find a rich literature describing all the neces- sary algorithms. The framework pro- vided by the ProofCert project can now be exploited to make formal proofs universal and as trustworthy as needed. With this method of minting the basic coins of trust, the formal methods community can continue building the infrastructure that allows us to trust more aspects of more of our computer systems. Dale Miller Inria, 316Blockchain will have the biggest impact on the public sector Blockchain seems to be everywhere and nowhere all at once. It is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) - also known as a shared database or a shared ledger, and allows many participants in a network to see the system of record. This has the potential to radically change multiple industries especially the public sector. But while there are many blockchain 'proof of concepts' being floated, there are few concrete, industrial strength applicationsto draw on from any sector. It's by looking outside of the public sector where we can see applications which showcase blockchain's strengths best. In the diamond industry for instance, the location of a stone can be tracked by this technology to help battle blood diamonds, or synthetic ones, from entering the system. Once a transaction is made, it can be addedto the diamond's history and cannot be edited without multiple checks. In this way, blockchain can also help reduce diamond fraud and safeguards the diamond supply chain against counterfeit goods, enabling trust, transparency and the security of the diamond business. It is such properties and the high level of transparency that appeals to public sector institutions. Governments are already exploring ways of using the system to pro- vide useful services. For example, the Isle of Man is using the digital proof of identity required for blockchain to make the gaming industry more resilient to fraud and money laundering. In this instance, the asset being tracked is a person, and this creates a people prove- nance and lineage capability for any government. Up to date tracking This ability to track a person's status is particularly useful for public sector departments who need to securely deal with a person's identity or status, per- haps for a process such as tax collection. Sweden is anexcellent example of a country currently using this, where everyone is given a personal identity number at birth. The system works so well that departments in the Swedish government now ask for a person's number instead of their name. \"Organisations are still working out how to benefit from blockchain technology. What is clear, however, is that with its powerful ability to address fundamental issues such as fraud and identity, there are many applications for the public sector.\" In the UK the National Insurance number is currently used to identify someone's status. This is now an out- dated system, and we're still a way behind getting this to an ecient state - there are approximately 20% more numbers than there are people. Blockchain could prove to be an excellent solution for managing this process, removing duplication, giving people a provenance and making the process much more ecient. This may soon change as the UK government has thrown its support behind blockchain technology research. In 2015, the Alan Turing Institute was opened to research how data science can change the world for the better. The UK's Chief Scientic Advisor published a ministerial-approved study examining the range of benets that DLT can have for public and private sectororganisations. In the non-governmental sector, organ- isations like the Open Data Institute are actively supporting the development of policy frameworks toenable technology to increase competition and protect the information from distortion. Overcoming fraud Fraud in the public sector remains a signicant chal- lenge. With benet and tax credit fraud costing the UK \u00a32.4 billion a year and grant fraud estimated at \u00a32.7John Bertrand, Digital Value Engineer at SAP talks about the value of blockchain and how it can benefit government as well as local authoritiesICT 317billion a year , applying DLT could have a substantial impact. The current system is vulnerable to breaches - information is often stored as a paper le and is accessible by only a few people. Blockchain wouldchange that, automatically reconciling itself and flag- ging any adjustments with a full audit trail, providing forensic ngerprints should malpractice and deception have taken place. \"This ability to track a person's status is particularly useful for public sector departments who need to securely deal with a person's identity or status, perhaps for a process such as tax collection.\" Long term benets of blockchain Importantly, the technology isn't necessarily a replace- ment for existing infrastructure. Instead it can sit alongside and strengthen the process. For example, general ledgers are already in place and blockchain can be used without distorting the books or giving away private information. This makes blockchain easier to implement, regardless of market sector. It is like a sidecar with a motorbike.Organisations are still working out how to benet from blockchain technology. What is clear, however, is that with its powerful ability to address fundamental issues such as fraud and identity, there are many applications for the public sector. With the onus to protect citizen's personal data and ensuring taxpayers' money is being responsibly and eectively used, the public sector would certainly feel the greatest impact of this technology.

Notwithstanding Brexit, GDPR will still apply to the UK. The GDPR is updated and upgraded data protection legislation to replace current 20-year-old EU data pro- tection laws. It aims to future-proof laws against tech- nological developments and new uses of personal data and hopes to help harmonise data privacy laws across the EU. A key goal is to rebalance the relationship between bodies using personal details and aected individuals, to be achieved through greater trans- parency and accountability obligations, supported by enhanced individual rights. Compliance will be backed by EU data protection regulators, like the UK's current Information Commissioner's Oce, each having a pow-erful new range of enforcement powers. These include the ability to ne those in breach up to the higher of \u20ac20m, or 4% annual global turnover. What eect will it have on organisations? Regulators are adopting an enforcement regime similarto the competition law model and in many countries, including the UK, GDPR triggers a substantial increase in potential risk from non-compliance with data protec- tion legislation. Many clients are addressing the issueat board level and including GDPR compliance on grouprisk registers. The GDPR net is also spread more widely than under current laws, imposing direct compliance obligations and liabilities on service providers as well as their customers when handling personal information. In addition, its impact is not limited to those operating within the member states in the EU but has certain extra territorial reach. This will be particularly impor- tant for providers servicing customers and end usersin the EU, or organisations oering goods and services to individuals in the EU, or monitoring their behaviour in the EU, by on-line tracking or proling for example. Risk assessment and compliance planning should factor in that nes may be calculated at total group turnover level and could be triggered by a range ofbreaches, such as failing to provide an individual with a copy of their personal data when required, so nes are not restricted to security breach scenarios. There is no materiality threshold for breaches and the high-est level of nes are reserved for breaches of individual rights. In addition, each aected individual can sue for compensation for breach - even if there is no nancial loss. More practically, regulators can block the flow of data from Europe to other countries or prevent theongoing use of an IT system, such as a CRM database. GDPR will introduce new mandatory security breach reporting obligations and even if organisations andbusinesses do not report, they may be mentioned in third party reports. Regulators will make proactive spot checks (which may start remotely online) and there is also the risk of individual, union or works council com- plaints and whistleblowing, which should not be under-estimated. Class actions are starting to be seen and media and privacy campaign groups are very active. For the rst time, organisations will be expected to know what personal data they are collecting and using, why it is needed, what it is used for, why that is lawful, how long it will be kept for and where it goes around the world. There will be a new legal obligation to have appropriate policies and to keep records to evidence how use of personal data by the organisation complieswith GDPR requirements. Use of personal data willneed to comply with mandatory privacy by design and default obligations and the outcome is that privacyHow can your business prepare for changes to GDPR? Liz Fitzsimons, Partner, Privacy and Information Law, Eversheds Sutherland (International) explainsICT 319compliance will need to be front of mind, rather than an afterthought, with an appropriate privacy compli-ance culture embedded in your organisation. How should organisations ensure they prepare for GDPR? What you need to do will depend on the complexity of your organisation and use of personal details, as well as how compliant you are currently. The key thing is to start now. The following plan should help. Reconsider what you use personal details for and whether you use more details than you really need, or keep them for longer than needed. Challenge yourself. Securely delete or destroy unnecessary details as soon as possible. Find out where you interact with people, how you collect their personal details and what you tell them when you do. Make sure you can deal with all these interfaces and update your privacy notices and consents, unbundling them from contract terms. Make sure that you are aware of individuals' rights, that your sta are aware of them and that they and yoursystems are able to recognise and properly deal with such requests within the set deadlines. Ensure when entering contracts now for systems and services which you will use after May 2018, you have made sure they comply with new GDPR rules on privacy by design and default and new obligations when using service providers (on both parties). \"The GDPR net is also spread more widely than under current laws, imposing direct compliance obligations and liabilities on service providers as well as their customers when handling personal information.\" We are supporting many clients with their GDPR compliance strategies and implementation.
