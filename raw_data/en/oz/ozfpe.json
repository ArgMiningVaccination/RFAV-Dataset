Vol. 18-1PREFACE The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online m o n t h l y p u b l i c a t i o n o f t h e O f f i c e o f t h e Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rulem aking notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative do cuments affecting rules that ar e statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-rel ated documents an agency may wa nt to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to p rovide public notice of all rul emaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedu res through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in author ized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate w hen a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rul emaking - Proposed Rule\" for ea ch proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislati ve review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when t he agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar year and issue numbe r. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin p ublished in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online compilation of all final and enf orceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full for ce and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislati ve session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are co dified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enforceab le, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Admi nistrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions . At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as tempora ry rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the pr ocess begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 January 3, 2018 - Vol. 18-11. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested pers ons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct ne gotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Int ent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if i nterested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the for mulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that re gular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKINGA proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the age ncy is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agen cy must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice mus t include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory au thority occasioning the rulemaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated costs, gu idance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislaitve format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds tha t it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or f ederal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, and with t he Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately e ffective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a fina l rule, or expires under its o wn terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency und er regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforc eable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when the rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and ide ntification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pending rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies i n content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending ru le change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that member s of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pen ding rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 January 3, 2018 - Vol. 18-1HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published i n the Idaho Administrative Bulletin a r e organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/nume rical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text i s divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as foll ows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrativ e Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. 1. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05 , which is the Department of Admi nistration's Division of Purch asing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket numbe r is a series of separated by a hyphen \"-\", r (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakd own of a typical rule docket \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05 ), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being publ ished; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501-1402 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.)

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is her eby given this agency has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 67 -2901(6), Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: This rule is being amended to update the incorporation by refer ence. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) updated the conforming products list (CP L) on November 2, 2017. Idaho State Police has no notification when these updates will occur in the federal re gister. This new CPL posting in the federal register updates the former incorporation by reference in the IDAPA 11.03.01 document and clearly delineates that all the evidentiary breath testing instruments in Idaho are approved fo r use on the NHTSA CPL. A question has been raised by the courts in Idaho if the Lifeloc FC20 and FC20BT instrumen ts are materially the same instrument. There is no difference in the instruments other than the Bluetooth ability. Idaho performed a validation of the FC20BT model to ensure that nothing impacted the quality of testing done in Ida ho. The Lifeloc FC20 is listed by name on the 2010 CPL and the FC20BT does not formally appear by name on the list until the 2017 federal register posting. While ISPFS has all the documentation from NHTSA, DOT, V olpe, and Lif eloc Corporation (and our own validation study) to show that there was no change to the instrument to give it B luetooth capability, and that the instrument was considered still on the CPL by NHTSA, the new incorporation by reference document makes it abundantly clear to the Idaho courts in a federal register document. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Go vernor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate fo r the following reasons: Necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare and t o conform to changes in the federal regulatory code. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that th e fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary rule, contact Matthew Gam ette, (208) 884-7217.

The pending rule becomes final and effective July 1, 2018, unless the rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent reso lution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specifie d in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 3 9-605, 39-906, 39-1603, 39-4502, and 56-1003, 56- 1005, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: Most of the larger hospitals in Idaho perform universal Critica l Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening as part of the newborn screening panel. However, some of the small er, more rural hospitals and birthing centers do not. Idaho is the only state that does not have rules that cover the requirements for CCHD screening. This rule change adds CCHD to the uniform screening panel for all newborns in Id aho. Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect and impact approximately 8 out of every 1,000 infa nts born. Of these, approximately 25% (2.4 per 1,000) are considered critical and require immediate detection and int ervention. In Idaho, it is estimated that approximately 55 infants are born each year with CCHD. The goal of CCHD scree ning is to identify and treat newborns with structural heart defects utilizin g a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive screening test where oxygen saturation is assessed after the first 24 hours of life. Without this intervention, the rates of mortality and survival with significant disability are extremely high among infants with CCHD. This proposed rule change adds CCHD as a required screening and mandates that all newborns receive a CCHD screening shortly after birth. If the proposed rules are approv ed, the Department will add CCHD screening information to their birth certificate system in Vital Records. This would allow the Idaho Newborn Screening Program to monitor screening compliance and provide assistance to families including referrals for follow-up care on positive screens. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance wit h Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text a re printed in this bulletin. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the September 6, 2017, Idaho Adm inistrative Bulletin, Vol. 17-9, pages 111-116 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Federal funds will be used to cover the costs associated with implementation of these rules.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The Department's Infant Toddler and Medicaid programs are both required by federal law (Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act) to pro vide access and reimbursement fo r early intervention services. Early intervention service requirements are being removed from IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Me dicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits\" and added as a new Section in this chapter. The rule text is being updated to support program eligibility, service coverage, limitations, provider, and reimbursement requirements. These ch anges will allow the Department more flexibility for collaboration within IDHW Divisions and ensure all Medicaid-eli gible infants and toddlers receive the right preventive services, at the right time, through the best financ ial means for the State. Updates to references or other minor technical corrections are being made as needed. Companion Docket No. 16-0310-1703 is publishing in this bulletin.

FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: This proposed change impacts the Division of Medicaid and the D ivision of Family and Community Services. Currently both divisions support these services for children wi th special healthcare needs ages 0-3 through a combination of a federal grant a nd Medicaid benefits payments. This rule will enable additional Medicaid coverage for these se rvices, which will allow leveraging federal funds to support better services for Idaho. There is no overall impac t to the general fund; however, a transfer of general funds between divisions will be necessary. In addition, the FAC S division will require an increase of $1,129,800 in federal spending authority and will revert $1,126,700 in receip t spending authority. The net impact will increase federal expenditures for these ser vices but will not increase the general fund needs. This will allow us to increase services to children and use sta te general funds more efficiently.

EPA approved this action in 2010. In June 2016, Northwest Environmental Advocates challenged EPA's 2010 a pproval. Court remanded action back to EPA. On September 15, 2016 EPA disapproved Idaho's adoption of 10 \u00b5g/L. Until new criteria are adopted, EPA will use criteria of 6.2 \u00b5g/L for exposure through fish consumption only and 0.02 \u00b5g/L for exposure through both drinking water + consumption of fish in its NPDES permitting actions. Th ese criteria are published in 1996 Idaho Administra- tive Code (Subsections 250.01.c, 3 Beryllium 7440417 h h 4 Cadmium 7440439 1.3 i 0.6 i h h 5a Chromium III 16065831 570 i 74 i h h 5b Chromium VI 18540299 16 e 11 e h h 6 Copper 7440508 17 i 11 i 1,300 q 7 Lead 7439921 65 i 2.5 i h h 8a Mercury 7439976 g g Note: In 2005, Idaho adopted EPA's recommended methylmercury fi sh tissue criterion for protection of human health (docket 58-0102-0302). The decision was made to remove the old tissue-based aquatic life criteria and rely on the fish tissue criterion to provide protection for aquatic life as well as human health. Thus, current Idaho water quality standards do not have mercury water column criteria for the pro tection of aquatic life. While EPA approved Idaho's adoption of the fish tissue criterion in September 2005, it had withheld judgment on Idaho's removal of aquatic life cri - teria. On December 12, 2008, EPA disapproved Idaho's removal of the old aquatic life criteria. The water column cri - teria for total recoverable mercury published in 2004 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes.

CCC = column B2 valu e X WER. f. Criterion expressed as total recoverable (unfiltered) concentrations. g. No aquatic life criterion is adopted for inorganic mercury. How ever, the narrative criteria for toxics in Section 200 of these rules applies. The Department believes application of the human health criterion for methylmercury will be protective of aquatic life in most situations. h. No numeric human health criteria has been established for this contaminant. However, permit authorities should address this contaminant in NPDES permit actions using the narrative criteria for toxics from Section 200 of these rules.AB Aquatic lifeC Human health for consumption (\u00b5g/L) C2DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1701 Water Quality Standards Adoption of Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 229 January 3, 2018 - Vol. 18- 1i. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 2 10.03.c.iii. and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purposes only, the example values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0). j. Criteria are expressed as weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide. k. Total chlorine residual concentrations. l. EPA guidance allows states to choose from a range of 10 -4 to 10-6 for the incremental increase in cancer risk used in human health criteria calculation. Idaho has chosen to base this criterion on carcinogenicity of 10-5 risk. m. Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the table correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830)CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) n. PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 125 4, 1221, 11096 825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. o. This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all cong ener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses). p. This fish tissue residue criterion (TRC) for methylmercury is b ased on a human health reference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (R SC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general population, summed from trophic level (TL) breakdown of TL2 = 0.0038 + TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion that is protective of the general population. A site-specific criterion or a criterion for a particular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or re gional data, rather than the above default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {RfD - (RSCxRfD)}] / TL. In waters inh abited by species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as th eir critical habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion for methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis. q. This criterion is based on the drinking water Maximum Contamina nt Level (MCL). r.

[Section 007 is reprinted in its entirety] 007. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES. 01.Alaska Rule . Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. The process for revising the Idaho water quality standards subject to EPA review and approval, while also retaining the rules effective for CWA purposes, is set out in Subsections 007.02 and 007.03. ( ) 02.Existing Rule Retained for Clean Water Act Purposes Until EPA Approval of Rule Revisions . ( ) a. When proposing revisions, the Department will make the proposed revisions using legislative format and, in the same rule docket, retain the existing rule that continues to be effective for CW A purposes until the date EPA issues written notification that the rule revisions ha ve been approved. ( ) b. Notations explaining the effectiveness of both versions of the rule will be included along with the rule text. ( ) c. Upon the date EPA issues written notification that the rule rev isions have been approved, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code. ( ) d. In the event EPA issues written notification that the rule revisions have been disapproved, the existing rule effective for CWA purposes will continue to apply. The disapproved rule revisions and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code. ( ) 03.Previously Approved Rules .
