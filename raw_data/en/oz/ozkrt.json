Associ Ation From the President: Changing the industry's medication culture By Jeffrey T. Berk, VMD, MRCVS The AAEP faces many challenges communicating the many initiatives the associa-tion is pursuing at any given time. From designing more innovative ways to present continuing education to studying and influencing a multitude of equine industry and public policy issues, the association's plate often overflows with worthy endeavors. The need is greater now more than ever to com- municate with you, our members, about the many oppor- tunities and challenges the AAEP is involved with. Often a little bit of background information can be helpful to better understand a direction that the AAEP may be heading. There are a couple of issues that have recently risen to a level of increased focus: medication and ethics. In February 2018, the AAEP Welfare & Public Policy Advisory Council, along with the association's officers and staff, conducted a planning meeting to strategically discuss the many important equine welfare issues and narrow the Council's focus to a short list of key issues for which the association has a chance to make an impact during the next three to four years. In this facilitated meeting, using membership surveys as a guide and incorporating comments from previous work, the group individually ranked a myriad of issues using four metrics: Impact to the horse Impact on membership (veterinarian) Impact to the public (real or perceived) Realistic ability to make a difference on this issue Based on this discussion and rankings, the overuse and/or misuse of therapeutic medication emerged as the highest-ranked issue.Historically, the topic of what constitutes appropriate therapeutic medication has been studied and debated extensively within the AAEP in the Performance Horse, Racing, and Professional Conduct & Ethics committee meetings, as well as in forums pertaining to horse sales. As the result of the Welfare & Public Policy Council's meeting, medication is now ranked as the primary issue of concern regarding equine welfare. A task force has been assembled to study the issue from all angles, with the goal being to promote the appropriate use and discourage the overuse and misuse of medications. There is an obvious overlap between medication use and the ethical considerations and ramifications of said use. Because of the chronicity of the issues surrounding medication use, the AAEP has at times been criticized for not doing enough. It has to be remembered that the AAEP is a member association and not a regulatory or governing body, and as such has no power of enforce- ment. The tactics used by this Medication Task Force will include the review and expansion of existing guidelines and then partnering with the various breed- and discipline- specific organizations and other industry stakeholders that have the power of enforcement. Other pieces will include education of veterinarians and mentoring of younger associate veterinarians. To frame the discussion properly, some key points are readily found in the AAEP Resource Guide: Regarding the medication of horses, the welfare of the horse is the primary consideration. It is in the best interest of horses to, when appropri- ate, therapeutically address any health concerns of the horse based upon a veterinary examination and any diagnostic means necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. Rest is an important component of addressing health concerns for horses and should always be discussed when therapeutic medication is being employed. The culture of inappropriate use of medication is a culture which veterinarians, trainers and their employees, judges, owners, consignors and sales companies have contributed to and participated in over a long period of time, and it will require time and effort to create a healthier culture. Having received many phone calls and letters from equine veterinarians in every discipline who are frustrated by frequent pressure to overmedicate or inappropriately medicate horses and the subsequent undermining of ethical equine practice, it's evident that the time has come for the AAEP to focus on medication and to reverse an unhealthy trend with the help of all stakeholders.Dr. Jeff Berk on use of vesicants and thermocautery At its January meeting, the AAEP board of directors approved recommenda- tions from the Racing Committee revising the AAEP's positions on the use of vesicants and the use of thermocautery or pin firing. The AAEP, which previously supported conditional use of both therapies, no longer supports the use of either practice. Following are the revised position statements: Position on the Use of Vesicants The AAEP does not support the use of vesicants in the management of musculoskeletal disorders and finds no scientific evidence to validate their use in the horse. Position on Thermocautery or Pin Firing When applied judiciously and in conjunction with appropriate analgesia and aftercare, thermocautery or pin firing has been considered an acceptable thera- peutic modality for specific conditions in the horse. With the advent of current science-based procedures to treat specific musculoskeletal conditions in the horse, the AAEP no longer supports the use of thermocautery or pin firing. These and all other AAEP position statements are accessible through the \"Ethical and Professional Guidelines\" drop-down menu at aaep.org/guidelines. 1.

If in years past you received the AAEP's annual Resource Guide and Membership Directory bundled with your March issue of EVE, you probably noticed something amiss when this issue arrived in your mailbox: the AAEP has discontinued its print membership directory.The directory has traditionally been published at a sub-stantial expense, both financial and in terms of the staff resources and man-hours necessary to compile, edit and proof the 400-page publication. Moreover, the accuracy of the membership listings diminished as members updated their contact information throughout the year. If you relied on the directory to look up fellow members, you can visit aaep.org to access a membership search that is continually updated so that you are always looking at the most current information. Just click the orange \"My Member Profile/Benefits\" button at the top of the home page and then select \"Membership Directory\" in the navigation bar on the ensuing page. Member lookup is also available through the AAEP Publications App.Ethical and professional guidelines, council and committee listings, and most other membership directory content can be found on the AAEP's website. Students and new grads: Submit case study for chance at convention trip PowerPoint submissions due May 1 AAEP student members and recent graduates in their first year of practice or internship can win complimentary registration and a $500 travel stipend to attend the AAEP's 2019 Annual Convention in Denver, Colo., by submitting a case presentation to be featured as an educational resource on the AAEP's website. Presentations must be submitted in PowerPoint. There is no limit to the number of case studies that may be submitted; however, a primary student or first-year graduate author must be identified for each submission. Submissions will be evaluated by members of the Educational Programs Committee and selected based on quality and educational merit. Participants are encouraged to work with mentors in the preparation and review of their submissions. Past case studies are available through the \"Case Studies\" button at aaep.org/students. Instructions and a case study template may be requested from Carey Ross, scientific publications coordinator, at cross@aaep.org. Submissions are due May 1, and winners will be announced by Sept. 6.

Dr. Specht moved to Butte County, Calif., last May to start her own large animal mobile practice while also working part time at a small animal clinic to help fund her business. As her client roster expanded, the Camp Fire ignited in early November in what would become the most destruc-tive wildfire in the state's history.When hearing that horses were being evacuated to the Butte County Fairgrounds, just four miles from her residence, Dr. Specht drove to the fairgrounds to examine its new residents. The fairgrounds soon became a major evacuation center for animals in peril and remained in that capacity until January. To the potential detriment of her growing solo practice, Dr. Specht suspended her business to shoulder a full-time volunteer role triaging and caring for evacuated animals, which numbered hundreds of horses, chickens, goats and sheep, as well llamas, alpacas, pigs and water fowl. \"It was hard,\" she said. \"I canceled all my appointments and pretty much let my business just tank. There was a time when I thought I made a huge mistake moving here and doing this. I had already bought all my equipment to set up my practice and I just let it go until I started back up in January when I could take appointments.\" Working around her schedule at the small animal clinic, Dr. Specht checked the evacuated animals in the mornings before returning in early afternoon and often working late into the evening treating facial and foot burns, trauma wounds, colic and dehydration. Severe cases were triaged and sent to UC Davis for treatment before returning to the fairgrounds for recovery. She even rehomed a severely burned goat for owners who lost everything in the fire.\"It was wonderful to meet the owners of these animals when we were able to reunite everybody,\" she said. \"Hearing these people's stories, it really touches you. They've lost everything else but for them to find their animal, it means so much to them. I think it gave the community a sense that plenty of people care for them.\" Beyond providing compassionate care, Dr. Specht also worked with local home improvement stores to donate plywood, gates and other necessities; persuaded several farmers to donate their utility vehicles so volunteers could move around the fairgrounds faster; and established a GoFundMe that raised more than $2,000 for a gasoline generator. She distributed remaining funds to several families who needed money for a place to stay. Dr. Specht is quick to acknowledge those who ran the evacuation site; her many fellow volunteers; veterinary companies that donated medication and supplies; and the Northern California Association of Equine Practitioners, which established a volunteer schedule to relieve the heavy burden on Dr. Specht and another veterinarian who had been working at the fairgrounds every day the first few weeks of the disaster.\"Many of us volunteered at various times, but Dr. Specht gave generously of her time when others, including myself, could not,\" said Dr. Sarah McCarthy, who nominated Dr. Specht for the Good Works honor. \"When others did not come for their shifts, she filled in. If there were emergencies when no one else was there, she was available.\" Throughout 2019, the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign will spotlight AAEP-member practitioners whose volunteer efforts are improving the health and welfare of horses.

Following regulatory changes in 2018, AVMA will resume offering health insurance for AVMA members, their families and employees. The rollout will be implemented on a state-by-state basis, with coverage available in at least 10 states beginning in July. The Veterinary Information Forum focused on utilization of credentialed technicians. Discussion included recruit- ment, development and education as well as challenges facing these key members of the veterinary healthcare team. A motion was approved to recommend a working group to further investigate opportunities for enhancing the role of credentialed technicians and their ability to support the veterinarian. Veterinary technicians face compassion fatigue, burnout and many of the other challenges common to a career in veterinary care. This working group may provide insight into how the entire veterinary healthcare team can succeed and thrive.Meanwhile, the HoD passed a bylaws amendment that will increase AVMA dues effective with the 2020 dues statement. Reduced dues for recent graduates and other eligible parties will be adjusted to 50% of the new full dues mount. The dues increase is needed to fund additional programming, including several well-being resources. Elsewhere, AVMA continues to advocate in Washington, D.C., and beyond on issues such as student debt relief and the bipartisan Prevent All Soring Tactics Act recently reintroduced in Congress.

Prior to induction, horses were sedated with i.v. and sedation quality was assessed 5 minutes later. Horses were randomly allocated one of the two ketamine doses and induced with i.v. ketamine and diazepam (30 lg/kg). Induction quality, surgical conditions and recovery were assessed using subjective and objective measures. Horses that received the higher dose of ketamine became relaxed more rapidly after induction, and surgical conditions were better; however, recovery quality was subjectively worse. Five horses that received the lower dose of ketamine required additional ketamine doses during anaesthesia compared to only two that received the higher dose. The authors concluded that a ketamine dose of 5 mg/kg i.v. may result in better surgical conditions but adversely affects recovery quality for eld surgery. Outcome of puncture wounds of the hoof This retrospective study by Stefano Schiavo and colleagues in the UK described low- eld magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ndings and long-term outcome for a group of 11 horses with solar foot penetration, deep digital flexor tendon injury and absence of concurrent sepsis in all adjacent synovial structures (distal interphalangeal joint, navicular bursa and digital flexor sheath). In three horses, the deep digital flexor tendon injury was only visible in the T2 fast spin echo sequence and contrast radiography improved diagnostic certainty. The most commonly affected area was between the distal border of the distal sesamoid bone and the facies of the distal phalanx (6/11, 55%). Six horses (60%) had an excellent outcome and returned to full athletic function (5 showjumping; 1 general purpose). Five horses (40%) were sound but had not yet resumed full work at the time of follow-up. The ndings of this study indicate that the prognosis for return to soundness can be good for horses with solar penetration, deep digital flexor injury and absence of synovial sepsis. Equine coronavirus In this study, Emily Schaefer and colleagues in the USA investigated the clinical, haematological, molecular and serological features of adult horses experimentally infected with equine coronavirus (ECoV). Eight healthy adult horses were included in this study. Four horses were intragastrically infected with faecal material containing 109genome equivalents of ECoV and four horses were exposed daily to the faeces from the experimentallyinfected horses. Monitoring included physical examinations, as well as daily nasal swab, whole-blood and faecal collection for molecular detection of ECoV. Blood was collected every other day for haematological analysis and weekly for serological analysis. All eight horses shed ECoV in faeces. Six of the eight horses (75%) exhibited mild, clinical disease with soft, formed manure; one horse exhibited transient pyrexia. All horses maintained total white cell counts within normal limits, but three horses developed transient lymphopenia. No statistically signi cant differences were observed in quantity of faecal shedding of ECoV between the two groups. Experimental infection of adult horses with ECoV was associated with mild and self-limiting clinical signs, transient lymphopenia and faecal shedding of ECoV, which mimics natural infection. No differences between experimentally infected horses and horses exposed to ECoV-containing faeces were identi ed. Results of this study support a faecal- oral route of transmission. Umbilical cord blood sampling in neonatal foals This clinical technique article by Sunita Jeawon and colleagues in Ireland and the UK describes in detail the procedure for collecting paired blood samples from the umbilical artery and vein in newborn foals to enable stall-side blood gas analysis. Thirty- ve Thoroughbred foals >320 days 'gestation from mares at one stud farm were sampled. Paired umbilical arterial and venous whole-blood samples were obtained in 30 foals, umbilical artery samples alone obtained in three foals, and umbilical vein samples alone obtained in two foals. There were no adverse events or clinical outcomes associated with the sampling protocol described. The authors found that umbilical cord blood collection for blood gas analysis was a practical clinical technique that potentially could be used as a stall-side method for assessing the in utero oxygenation and acid -base status of newborn foals. Impact of table position in anaesthetised horses This study by Anna Binetti and colleagues in Belgium and Switzerland describes the impact of the Trendelenburg (head down; HD) and reverse Trendelenburg (head up: HU) position on respiratory and cardiovascular function in anaesthetised horses. Six adult horses were anaesthetised twice in dorsal recumbency. They were either placed in the Trendelenburg position (HD) followed by reverse Trendelenburg position (HU) or in reverse order. Every position was maintained for 90 minutes. The order of positions was randomly assigned at initial anaesthesia. Extensive cardiorespiratory monitoring was performed. Statistical analysis consisted of a mixed model with horses as random effect and time, position, section of anaesthesia and interaction between those as xed effects. When HU was applied during the rst section of anaesthesia, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2), oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and oxygen content (CaO 2) were signi atrial and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were lower than in HD. After changing from HU to HD, PaO 2and SaO 2 remained higher and venous admixture lower compared to the inverse order. Independent of the order, in the HD position venous admixture increased while PaO 2, SaO 2, CaO 2, venous PO 2, venous prevalence of bone marrow lesions in the distal condyles of saturation and venous oxygen content decreased over time. No signi cant differences were found for cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and dobutamine requirement between the two positions. The authors concluded that gas exchange is better preserved in HU compared to HD, especially if applied from the start of the anaesthesia. Spermatic cord stump infection In this retrospective study, Elaine Claffey and colleagues in the USA reported the surgical management and the short- and long-term follow-up of post-castration spermatic cord infection in 23 client-owned horses. Medical records of horses that had been surgically treated for spermatic cord stump infection after castration were reviewed. Time from castration to presentation, diagnostic procedures, surgical complications, bacterial culture and ancillary testing, and survival to discharge were collected. Long-term follow-up was obtained by owner survey when possible. Descriptive statistics were used to report results. Horses were aged 2 -14 years (mean 4.1 years) and presented a median 33 days after castration (range 12 - 3561 days). Five of 23 horses required revision surgery; two because of haemorrhage and three for persistent infection. All horses survived to discharge. Long-term follow-up was available for 16 horses at a mean time of 27.4 months post- surgery (range 6 -135 months). Complete resolution of clinical signs and return to previous use was documented in 14/16 horses; one horse had persistent purulent drainage and the second horse was retired because he did not return to adequate performance. Post-castration infection of the spermatic cord had a favourable prognosis for short- and long-term survival in this population, although complications included post-operative haemorrhage and persistent infection. Bone marrow lesions of the distal condyles In this study, C /C19ecile De Guio and colleagues in France evaluated the prevalence of bone marrow lesions in the distal condyles of the third metacarpal bone, described the anatomic distribution and correlated lesions with the presence of lameness and the level and type of activity. All sports and pleasure horses undergoing standing low- eld magnetic resonance imaging of the front fetlock region over an 8-year period were included and divided into three lameness groups according to the results of diagnostic analgesia. Bone marrow lesions were analysed and graded. Grades were compared between anatomical locations and between lameness groups. A total of 166 horses were sampled. The prevalence of bone marrow lesions was 76.5% (127/166). The most commonly affected locations were the dorsal aspects of the medial condyle(31%, 39/127) and of the sagittal ridge (28%, 36/127). There was no signi cant difference between both forelimbs (lame and non-lame limb) of the same horse. Lesion severity was neither signi cantly associated with the lameness group nor with the type or level of activity. The third metacarpal bone is high in this population and the clinical signi cance is not always clear. Further studies are required to elucidate the clinical signi cance of this nding in sports and pleasure horses. Dynamic testing for PPID in donkeys This prospective study by S. Mejia-Pereira and colleagues in Spain and the USA aimed to evaluate dynamic testing for pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in donkeys. Six donkeys with clinical signs consistent with PPID and a basal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration >50 pg/mL were included in the study. A dexamethasone suppression test (DST), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and combined DST-TRH challenge were performed in all animals during the summer months with a 1- week washout period between tests. The TRH stimulation test identi ed all six donkeys as having PPID, whereas the DST and the DST-TRH identi ed 3/6 and 4/6 donkeys respectively. Agreement between the DST and the DST-TRH tests was poor. The authors recommend the TRH stimulation test as a dynamic test for the diagnosis of PPID in donkeys. S.

There are limited accounts in domestic species, mainly following vaccination, and thymic hyperplasia has not been a recognised condition in the horse to date. This report details a case of true thymic hyperplasia in a 10-week-old Arabian colt diagnosed by histopathology of core biopsy samples. The colt developed pulmonary stenosis caused by compression due to a space occupying lesion in the cranial mediastinum following a 3-month history of hospitalisation for tre atment of traumatic oesophageal rupture with perioesophageal abscess formation. Diagnostic imaging of the cranial mediast inum was indicative of a thymic mass, and histopathology con rmed the mass was normal (hyperplastic) thymic tissue. The colt was tr eated with a tapering dose of corticosteroids, which led to involution of the hyperplastic tissue and resolution of pulmona ry artery compression. Thymic hyperplasia may be an unrecognised sequela to chronic inflammation in horses and was only identi ed in this case when the size was suf cient to compress right cardiac out flow. Introduction Thymic hyperplasia is a rare condition reported in man, with limited reports presented in nonexperimental animals. To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report of thymic hyperplasia in the horse. The thymus in the horse forms at Day 60 of gestation, developing the thymic reticulum from endodermal tissue and the thymic capsule from mesenchymal tissue, both derived from the third pharyngeal pouch. The thymus is populated by haematopoietic stem cells originating from the aorta -gonad -mesonephros region and becomes the site of T lymphocyte maturation. In some domestic species, the thymus forms a Y shaped structure; however, in the horse the left and right cervical sections do not develop (Vejlsted 2010). The thymus begins to involute around adolescence, although, in man, it has been shown to retain partial ability to generate T lymphocytes (Naylor et al. 2005). Histopathological examination of the equine thymus shows evidence of involution by age 3 years. Involution is characterised by progressive atrophy and reorganisation of the cortex and medulla with reduction in cortical thymocytes,and increase in the extraparenchymal compartment, particularly increases in adipose tissue and extracellular matrix (Contreiras et al. 2004). There are no published studies documenting the chronology of thymic involution using ultrasound or radiography in the horse, however it has been suggested that it appears radiographically largest around age 2 months and regresses by age 1 -2 years (Lester and Lester 2001). In man, two forms of thymic hyperplasia have been recognised. True thymic hyperplasia in which the overall tissue mass is increased, with preservation of the normal histological appearance, is a rebound phenomenon observed after physiological stress. True thymic hyperplasia has been reported following chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroid treatment, thermal burns and surgery (Goldstein et al. 2015). In nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin 's disease patients treated with immunotherapy in their rst peak of disease, true thymic hyperplasia is considered a favourable sign of immune recovery (Shin and Ho 1983; Scheinp fluget al. 2003). True thymic hyperplasia in calves, rabbits and birds has been reported in association with repeated immunisation; however, it has not been reported in horses (Valli 2007). The second form, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, is characterised by enlarged lymphoid germinal centres within the medulla and has been associated with in flammatory and autoimmune disorders including myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (Berrih-Aknin and Le Panse 2014; Goldstein et al. 2015). Human patients with hyperthyroidism experience both true thymic hyperplasia caused by increased thyroxine, and lymphoid follicular hyperplasia attributed to the autoimmune disorder underlying the syndrome (Judd and Bueso-Ramos 1990). The case presented in this report developed true thymic hyperplasia based on the histopathology and history of chronic inflammation. History A 5-week-old Arabian colt presented to the University of Queensland for evaluation of dyspnoea and swelling of the ventral neck after running into a fence. On physical examination, the colt had marked stertorous breathing. There was profound swelling and crepitus of the entire ventral neck \u00a92017 from thehead tothelevel ofthethoracic inlet. An oesophageal tear was suspected inthemid cervical region. Emergency tracheostomy was performed routinely. Medical management forthe subcutaneous infection was initiated, comprising systemic antimicrobial 13). Endoscopy was performed the following day once the colt was stable, and con rmed a10cm long dorsal oesophageal tear general anaesthesia, the super cial abscess was incised and the oesophagus was approached through this incision. The necrotic tissue surrounding the oesophageal tear was debrided, an oesophagostomy tube was secured in the aboral oesophagus, and apenrose drain was placed inthewound, which was left open and dressed. Antibiotic therapy was changed totrimethoprim 7ofhospitalisation, the tracheotomy tube was removed. The colt was fed mare 'smilk via the oesophagostomy tube. The oesophageal wound granulated sufciently fortheoesophagostomy tube toberemoved on Day byaband ofoesophageal mucosa. Both compartments communicated with theoesophagus oesophageal stulae. The stulae via standing oesophageal endoscopy under sedation and eventually healed. Diagnosis Antimicrobial treatment had been discontinued for22days, and the colt remained clinically stable therefore discharge from hospital was being valve was noted onroutine physical examination. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry were diameter heteroechoic pulmonary (PA; Fig2).Itwas not possible todetermine with ultrasound whether thecontent of the mass was heteroechoic fluid orsoft tissue. There was turbulent flowinthe PAoncolour Doppler. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation withiohexol administered per osshowed no communication between described (Underwood etal.2011). There increased focal radiopharmaceutical uptake inthe region ofthe cranial butwas with would be anabscess (Underwood etal.2011). Due tothedifculty and invasiveness ofperforming further diagnostic inthisregion, made totreat the cranial abscess seeded into the mediastinum viathe oesophageal tear. The colt was treated empirically rstwith doxycycline mass containing cmindiameter. bwt per osq.i.d. for20days. Weekly ultrasound the mass increased insize from 6.8cm onday 56to10.79 cm in increasingly turbulent and amount of tricuspid regurgitation had increased (Fig5,Supplementary Items 1-3). Repeat examination onDay 94showed that the mass measured approximately thesame diameter (10.5 cm). Slight right ventricular enlargement was detected onM-mode through the right parasternal short axis view ofthe left ventricle, asthe right inthemurmur throughout theperiod ofinvestigation. Antibiotics were discontinued on Day 100 and ultrasound-guided aspiration ofthe mass with an18gauge 8.9cm spinal needle was attempted under general anaesthesia onDay 101. The colt was placed inleftlateral recumbency with the limbs pulled cranially, and the skin region around the third intercostal space was aseptically prepared. Ultrasound again revealed nochange inthe size and appearance ofthe mass (approximately 10.5 cm diameter). Ultrasound-guided aspiration failed toproduce a fluid sample, subsequently (De Clercq etal.2004). Asmall stab incision was made inthe skin and the biopsy needle was inserted along the cranial border ofthe fourth riband into the mass using ultrasound guidance. Two rmtissue core samples were taken from different locations within themass. Histopathology con rmed the biopsied tissue to be consistent with morphologically normal thymic tissue with a distinct corticomedullary junction and normal insome types ofthymic hyperplasia and can resemble thymoma, was not seen in this case. Anunderlying neoplastic process was ruled out based onthe normal histopathological ofthe tissue and lack ofatypical features. Adiagnosis ofthymic hyperplasia was reached based on the histopathology results and recent history ofseptic inflammation due to perioesophageal abscessation. Interventions Considering the histopathological of thymic hyperplasia, toaprotracted course of antimicrobials and gradual worsening ofcardiac outflowtract compression and right sided cardiac enlargement, trial treatment with systemic corticosteroids was initiated inan themurmur had reduced tograde I-II/VI inintensity. Ultrasound ofthecranial mediastinum at revealed that the thymic parenchyma had similar sonographic appearance to previous scans but now measured *DORSAL VENTRALC R AN I A LC A U L Fig3:Left thoracic technetium-99 m-labelled view ofthe right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery on Day 97 demonstrating turbulent, high velocity flowwithin thepulmonary artery (arrow). \u00a92017 EVJLtd118 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 20195.8cm in diameter (reduced in size by approximately 50%) and was partially obscured bylung onthe right when viewed through the triceps muscle. Tricuspid regurgitation had resolved; however, mild pulmonary regurgitation and right sided enlargement remained present. Thecolt was discharged bwt (2.5 mg) i.m. every other day for 7 days. Outcome The colt returned forfollow-up examination 8months after discharge (Day 365). On presentation, the colt was bright and alert and clinically normal. Theventral neck intheregion oftheoriginal oesophageal lesion was rmonpalpation had healed with minimal scarring. No murmur was noted on cardiac auscultation. Lateral inprevious a small soft tissue opacity cranial tothe cardiac silhouette consistent with anormal thymus/thymic remnant of appropriate size forthe age ofthe colt (Fig7).Ultrasound from the right third intercostal space revealed a sonographically normal hyperechoic line pulmonary (Fig8).There was a2+(small to medium) pulmonary regurgitation jet;theremainder oftheechocardiogram performed 2years and 2months after the initial presentation: the owner indicated that the(now) gelding appeared normal running in the paddock with itspeers, with apparently normal growth and exercise tolerance, and that theplan was tocommence endurance training asa3-year-old perusual farm practice.Discussion We hypothesise that the thymic hyperplasia diagnosed in this colt was attributable toprolonged immune stimulation, ashas been documented inhuman cases (Shin and Ho 1983; Scheinp flugetal.2003; Goldstein etal.2015). Inthis case the immune perioesophageal infection initiated by traumatic oesophageal perforation. and clinical course are indicative oftrue thymic hyperplasia, which is best described asover-activation ofthe cell mediated immune system due tochronic inflammation. The cardiac abnormalities that developed and led torecognition and diagnosis ofthymic hyperplasia were caused bythe mediastinum opacity appropriate (Day 383) showing a hyperechoic line consistent with the normal pleural surface of intheimage. \u00a92017 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2019thymic hyperplasia, has been reported in the human literature (Lee et al. 1979; Lamesch 1983; Kobayashi et al. 1986; Linegar et al. 1993; Tan et al. 2010). The criteria for massive thymic hyperplasia are that the thymus is greater in size than the cardiac silhouette on radiographs, weighs several times the expected weight for the patient 's age, and represents >2% of the patient 's body mass (Linegar et al. 1993). The current case does not meet these criteria, and does not appear to be idiopathic in nature. The majority of human massive thymic hyperplasia patients are neonates presenting for respiratory distress, and the majority of symptomatic cases of thymic enlargement are managed by surgical excision of the thymus. However, a recent report demonstrated a very high rate (44%) of unnecessary thymectomy in human patients with thymic enlargement, to of the chest (Ackman et al. 2015). It has been suggested that corticosteroids may be effective clinically to 'shrink 'a hyperplastic thymus (Steger et al. 2011), and thymic atrophy has been documented as a side effect of corticosteroid treatment in human infants (Caffey and Di Liberti 1959; Caffey and Silbey 1960). There are three reported cases of paediatric massive thymic hyperplasia treated with corticosteroids; however, only one had reduction in size of the thymus following treatment (Kobayashi et al. 1986). Other case reports observed no response to corticosteroid treatment (Lee et al. 1979; Lamesch 1983; Tan et al. 2010). In a case of true thymic hyperplasia causing laryngotracheal displacement in an infant, treatment with a 4-week course of methylprednisolone was associated with partial thymic involution and resolution of clinical signs (Wolff et al. 2011). In the horse, cranial mediastinal masses have been identi ed with causes ranging from abscessation to primary neoplasms including lymphosarcoma, liposarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma, thymoma also various metastatic pulmonary neoplasms (Hovda et al. 1990; Garber et al. 1994; De Clercq et al. 2004; Kondo et al. 2012). Cranial mediastinal abscesses secondary to pneumonia have been reported to cause compression of the PA and caudal displacement of the heart (Byars et al. 1991; Grifn Sleeper et al. 2016). Abscessation of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes has been reported to cause compression of the trachea (Rigg et al. 1985). Cranial mediastinal abscesses et al. 2016). Cranial mediastinal neoplasms have variable based on the aetiology; pleural effusion and ventral oedema are commonly reported (De Clercq et al. 2004; Kondo et al. 2012). Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve causing recurrent laryngeal neuropathy was noted in one case of cranial appears homogenously hypoechoic except when necrosis is present within the mass (Garber et al. 1994; De Clercq et al. 2004). Cranial mediastinal masses present a diagnostic and treatment challenge in horses due to their location as they can be dif cult to image and biopsy (or drain in the case of an abscess) and surgical resection of lesions has not been documented in horses.In the current case, the mass identi ed was due to hyperplasia of a normal structure and corticosteroid treatment was successful in reducing its size and abolishing the cardiac murmur and out flow obstruction. As the colt responded well to corticosteroid treatment the prognosis was good, whereas most cranial mediastinal neoplastic processes have a poor prognosis due to the dif culty of surgical access and limited practicality of chemotherapeutic therapy in the horse. The ongoing pulmonary regurgitation was considered unlikely to have an effect on the colt 's future athletic performance as an endurance horse (Marr 2010). Considering the alternative treatment was thymectomy via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy, corticosteroid treatment to reduce organ size is a rational rst line therapy as thymectomy has not been demonstrated in the horse. The technetium-IgG scan proved to be a helpful supportive diagnostic tool and retrospectively strengthened the diagnosis as the area of interest was immunologically active but the uptake was not as marked as would be expected with an abscess (Underwood et al. 2011). Chest CT may have been useful to help characterise the origin and boundaries of the mass; however, biopsy and histopathology would still have been required to rule out cranial mediastinal abscess or neoplasia, as is the case in human patients (Goldstein et al. 2015). It should be noted that the use of CT in the horse is limited by the size of the patient and available facilities, therefore would generally only be practical in young horses at referral or university hospitals. Thymic hyperplasia should be considered a differential diagnosis in horses after chronic in flammation if clinical signs referable to cardiac out flow or tracheal compression develop and can be diagnosed readily with histopathology of core biopsy samples. Treatment with corticosteroids resulted in rapid reduction in the size of the thymus and resolution of right sided cardiac out flow obstruction in this case. It is possible that true thymic hyperplasia may be more common than previously thought in horses, as it will remain subclinical in cases without compressive sequelae.

Borges, G. W. Sybrechtand G. von Samson-Himmelstjerna\u00a7* Universidade Federal de with warble fly larvae was observed in a mare in Lower Saxony, Germany. From a herd of 20 horses, only a single mare accidently escaped the routine treatment with macrocyclic lactone in autumn and showed the myiasis infestation next year in January. Eighteen subcutaneous nodules were found on the back (n =2), ribs (n =3),flank (n=5) and croup (n =8). Deer, speci c hosts of the warble flyHypoderma diana , was abundant on this farm and some other risk factors for the hypodermiosis are discussed herein. This is the rst report of myiasis caused by H. diana in horses in Germany. This massive warble fly infestation in a horse in Germany reported here is important to alert equine health professionals concerning the prevention of this disease in the routine parasite control programme. Introduction Hypodermosis, an obligate parasitic furuncular myiasis caused by the host tissue invasion by Hypodermatinae larvae, was one of the most important parasitic problems in cattle in Europe during the last century (Boulard 2002), affecting weight gain, welfare, bovine immune defence mechanisms (Boulard 1989) and the leather industry (Boulard et al. 2008). For this reason, coordinated control programmes in several European countries, compulsory or not, resulted in a considerable reduction of this parasitic problem in several western European countries, or even eradication, and it became a noti able disease in France (Boulard et al. 2008). Despite the success in cattle hypodermosis control, there have been a number of recent cases of oral (Faber and Hendrikx 2006), dermal (Logar and /C19an bovis and Hypoderma lineatum in people, which indicates the increasing risk of zoonotic transmission. Accordingly, the problems caused by the hypodermosis involve both domestic and wild animals and man, and thus its control needs to be considered under the One Health approach. There are only few sporadic reports of hypodermosis in horses. An intracranial migration of a rst-stage larva of the same aetiological agent of the cattle grub, H. bovis , was described in a horse in Montana, USA, causing an acute neurological disease (Hadlow et al. 1977). Two other H. bovis- associated myiasis cases were previously reported in horses (Anthony 1948; Rastegaev 1973). Hypoderma lineatum , another cattle warble fly, was also described causing a brain myiasis in a horse (Olander 1967). Horses are also reported asan unusual host for Hypoderma diana , the cervidae /C19a/C20cov /C19aet al. 2014). This is the rst report of a myiasis caused by H. diana in horses in Germany. Case history Eighteen nodules (warbles) were palpated in a 5-year-old Thoroughbred mare. Nodules were found on the back (n=2), ribs (n =3), flank (n =5) and croup (n =8) (Fig 1 ). These nodules instar larvae as con rmed by digital expulsion ( Fig 2 ). Half of the nodules were manipulated and Fig 1: Multiple Hypoderma warbles on a mare in Germany. \u00a92017 The warbles presented themselves as approximately 1-2cm indiameter large and only slightly elevated warbles with atypical central opening. The warbles were not painful and they disappeared within the next 6weeks. Subsequently, the horse did not show any clinical signs and continued tobecome aninternationally successful racing horse. Noother horses onthepremises were affected. The farm isaprivate horse farm and there are nocattle onthefarm. However, thepasture extends into anarea with alotofgrassland and some patches offorest.

A. Husby*, M. J. Huber, I. Phillipsand J. R. Heidel Department of Clinical Sciences,Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, Horse mare presented for a mass within the vestibule and vagina resulting in external compression and incomplete occlusion at the external urethral opening with subsequent dif culty urinating. Examination revealed an approximately 15 310 cm lobulated mass within the vestibule and caudal vagina attached via a broad base dorsally. Histopathology of the mass identi ed a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. Complete resection was not possible, and surgical debulking of the mass was performed during standing sedation using a vessel- sealing and dividing device. The mare was discharged 3 days post-operatively without any complications. Recheck examinations performed at 1 month and 8 months 'post- surgery revealed excellent healing of the surgical site and no apparent tumour regrowth. Introduction Neoplasia of the reproductive tract in the mare typically involves the ovaries or external genitalia, while tumours affecting the uterus, cervix and vagina are rare. One survey found that ovarian neoplasms comprised the vast majority of reproductive tract tumours in the mare at 88.6% (McCue 1998). There are few reports in the literature of neoplasia affecting the vagina or vestibule in the mare (McCue 1998; Cooper and Valentine 2002). Leiomyomas are tumours of smooth muscle origin which are benign in nature and may interfere with reproductive function or cause luminal obstruction when located within the urogenital tract (Cooper and Valentine 2002). In contrast, leiomyosarcomas are malignant smooth muscle neoplasms which are generally considered slow to metastasise (Cooper and Valentine 2002). Both leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas have been described in horses affecting the gastrointestinal and urogenital systems most commonly, however leiomyosarcomas are rare with only three reported cases involving the mare reproductive tract (Lofstedt et al. 1987; Hinojosa et al. 2003; Hurcombe et al. 2008). This case report describes a leiomyosarcoma within the vestibule and vagina of a 14-year-old Quarter Horse mare that was surgically debulked under standing sedation using a vessel-sealing and dividing device (LigasureTM) without gross recurrence at 8 months 'post-surgery. Case history A 14-year-old Quarter Horse mare was presented to Oregon State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of a mass within the vestibule and vagina. The mare was evaluated by the referring veterinarian approximately 1 hprior to admission for mild signs of colic and decreased appetite. The mare reportedly did not nish her feed that morning and was displaying minor signs of abdominal discomfort by laying down more than usual. Examination by the referring veterinarian revealed that vital parameters were within normal limits; however, transrectal palpation identi ed a large mass within the vaginal vault and a distended bladder. Brief vaginal examination revealed the mass was lling the entire vestibule and mechanically occluding the external urethral opening which was inhibiting the mare 's ability to urinate. There was no history of dysuria or haematuria, but the mare had not been noted to urinate that morning. A urinary catheter was passed to empty the bladder prior to referral to the university. Clinical ndings On presentation to the referral centre, the mare was bright and alert and vital parameters were within normal limits. Complete blood count and serum chemistry performed at the time of admission were within normal limits. The mare was sedated i.v. with detomidine1(Dormosedan; 0.01 mg/kg), and transrectal palpation identi ed a large cylindrical mass, measuring approximately 15 cm in length and 10 cm in width, present within the vagina and vestibule. No abnormalities of the uterus or ovaries were palpable, but the mare did have a moderately distended bladder. Transrectal ultrasound of the mass was performed which revealed a discrete, highly loculated, heterogeneous structure without an identi able capsule ( Fig 1 ). A facilitate vaginal examination and hysteroscopy. Vaginal examination revealed a large, partially lobulated, mass within the vestibule that extended just beyond the vestibulovaginal junction into the most caudal aspect of the vagina. The mass was attached dorsally via a broad base with slight involvement of the right vaginal wall. Vaginoscopy was performed using a 1 m flexible videoendoscope (Fujinon; 11 mm) and con rmed the presence of a mass of pink tissue lling the lumen of the vestibule and the caudal vagina (Fig 2 ). No abnormalities or additional masses were noted within the cervix, uterus, urethra or urinary bladder. A wedge biopsy, measuring 2 92 cm, was obtained by sharp dissection after everting the mass through the vulva. The sample was placed in 10% formalin and submitted for histopathology. Due to concerns that the mare had dif culty urinating due to the mass occluding the urethral opening, a 30 French Foley catheter was placed into the urethra and the bulb was in flated to secure it in place. The mare was \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd126 next several days while awaiting biopsy results. Themare was known tobedifcult for administration oforal medications, and ceftiofur free crystalline3(Excede) was used inthis case toprevent ascending infection due tothe presence ofaurinary catheter. During hospitalisation, the mare 'svital parameters remained within normal limits, and nosigns ofcolic or anorexia were observed. Diagnosis Histologically, the nonencapsulated mass was comprised of neoplastic spindle cells arranged both ininterweaving bundles and random patterns. The cells had elongate, blunt-ended nuclei with evenly distributed chromatin and nely brillary oflow-grade was presentation themare underwent standing surgical debulking oftheleiomyosarcoma. She was placed in and sedated bolus ofdetomidine1 (Dormsedan; the tail was secured outofthesurgical eld. Theperineum and vulva were prepared with Betadine solution and warm water. Doyen hand held retractors were used toretract thevulvar surrounding thetumour, and a combination ofblunt and sharp dissection was used to separate thetissue planes that attached thebase ofmass to theroof made throughout thesurgical procedure toavoid deep penetration oftheperineal body and potential penetration ofthe adjacent rectum.

Her vital parameters were within normal limits, and she was reported to have been doing well at home without signs of discomfort. Vaginoscopy revealed an area of hyperaemic mucosa present on the dorsal aspect of the vestibule that extended along the right wall to the 3 o 'clock position, corresponding to the previous location of the mass. She was allowed to return to her usual routine with instructions to return for a re-evaluation within the year. The mare was re-evaluated once more at 8 months ' post-surgery. The mare had returned to regular exercise without difculty, and the owner had no concerns regarding her health. No abnormalities were identi ed at her physical examination. Transrectal palpation revealed a palpably normal diestrus uterus and ovaries. identi ed healthy mucosa within the vestibule and vagina with a small area of scar tissue located at the 3 o 'clock position. No samples were taken for biopsy and, although there was no observable evidence of tumour recurrence, the owner was advised to have annual vaginal examinations performed on the mare. The mare was sold approximately 1-year post-surgery at which time she appeared in good health, and no further follow-up was available. Discussion Primary neoplasms of the vestibule and vagina in the horse are rare, with benign leiomyomas being most common (McCue 1998). One retrospective analysis evaluated the occurrence of histopathologically con rmed leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas over a 20-year period and identi ed 3/27 leiomyomas and 0/2 leiomyosarcomas of the vagina/cervix in mares (Cooper and Valentine 2002). As a result of infrequent occurrence of neoplasms in this location, there is little information available about clinical signs, treatment, biological behaviour, and expected outcomes. The case reported here describes the successful debulking of a low-grade leiomyosarcoma within the vestibule and vagina of a mare without macroscopic recurrence at 8 months 'post- operatively. Leiomyosarcomas have been reported in the horse involving the oesophagus (Boy et al. 1992), stomach (Boy et al. 1992), duodenum (Mair et al. 1990), jejunum (Livesey et al. 1986), rectum (Clem et al. 1987), and Moeller 1999), et al. 1987; Hinojosa et al. 2003), vagina (Hurcombe et al. 2008) and bladder (Hurcombe et al. 2008). One case report identi ed a multicentric leiomyosarcoma of the mandible and frontal bone in a young horse that was suspected to originate from the vascular smooth muscle (MacGillivray et al. 2003). Typically, these tumours are locally invasive, and slow to metastasise with only one reported occurrence of metastasis in the horse (Cooper and Valentine 2002). Clinical signs are often related to luminal obstruction of the affected organ, and as such these neoplasms may go undetected for an undetermined length of time and may be incidental ndings on necropsy examinations (Cooper and Valentine 2002). In the case reported here, the initial colic signs observed in this horse were thought to be the result of a distended bladder secondary to incomplete occlusion of the external urethral opening by the mass. A gastrointestinal lesion was excluded based on physical examination ndings,transrectal palpation, and no recurrence of colic signs during hospitalisation after placement of a urinary catheter. Additional diagnostic tests including abdominal ultrasound, abdominocentesis with fluid analysis, and gastroscopy could have been performed to further evaluate the gastrointestinal tract. Since leiomyosarcoma has been reported to involve gastrointestinal smooth muscle, these tests could have also been used to assess for possible involvement of leiomyosarcoma in the abdomen, although no de nitive exclusion of gastrointestinal involvement could have been made without exploratory celiotomy. In the case reported here, a wedge biopsy of the mass was obtained on admission which displayed typical characteristics of a leiomyosarcoma, which included the presence of spindle- shaped cells arranged in interwoven fascicles with an oblong to bullet-shaped nucleus and the presence of mitoses (Cooper and Valentine 2002). Several stains are available to assist in diagnosis of smooth muscle tumours, including those for desmin, muscle actin and vimentin. Stains were not considered necessary in this case due to the histological appearance being characteristic of a smooth muscle neoplasm. It is important to note that a larger sample acquired through excisional biopsy or complete excision may be essential in some cases to ensure accurate diagnosis. Many of the cases reported in the available literature were diagnosed on post- mortem examination; however, biopsy collected with uterine biopsy forceps in one case of a poorly differentiated vaginal leiomyosarcoma was inconclusive requiring excisional biopsy for de nitive histological diagnosis with the aid of immmunohistochemical staining (Hurcombe et al. 2008). The surgical technique used in this case was elected to enhance the opportunity for maximal tumour debulking while maintaining an intact vestibule and vaginal wall without penetration into the rectovestibular space, peritoneal cavity or rectum. A standing procedure with the aid of a caudal epidural resulted in excellent visualisation of the tissue mass, the vestibule and the vagina for surgical manipulation. The use of the LigasureTMallowed rapid surgical debulking with minimal haemorrhage and excellent control of tissue transection depth. There is one report of an excisional biopsy of a leiomyosarcoma within the vagina although the surgical technique was not described, and the mass may have originated from the bladder (Hurcombe et al. 2008). There is a recent case description of the successful removal of an intraluminal uterine leiomyoma via an endoscopically assisted transvaginal approach that used the LigasureTMfor transection of the tumour from the uterine wall (Schneeweis et al. 2015). The LigasureTMis a bipolar electrosurgical device that denatures collagens and elastins in vessel walls and combined with mechanical pressure results in permanent sealing of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter (Fischer Jr et al. 2012). It has been used extensively for minimally invasive procedures in the horse. It is possible that use of the Ligasure device may denature proteins within the neoplastic cells altering their activity or resulting in cell death. In addition, transection of tissue and vessels at the base of the mass with a permanent sealing device may prevent seeding of surrounding tissue with tumour cells. Chemotherapeutic protocols may be considered for tumours with local recurrence or metastasis, although there is no evidence of ef cacy for leiomyosarcoma in the horse.

A retrospective study on canine intestinal leiomyosarcoma described a chemotherapeutic protocol with doxorubicin (30 mg/m2i.v. at weeks 1, 4 and 7), cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2at weeks 1, 4 and 7) and vincristine (0.7 mg/m2at weeks 2, 3, 5 and 6), but only two dogs were treated with this protocol making it dif cult to draw any conclusions regarding its effect on tumour growth (Cohen et al. 2003). Despite the lack of literature supporting the use of chemotherapy for treatment of leiomyosarcoma, it could be considered as a last resort in cases of tumour recurrence where all other options have been exhausted. Only three cases report on the successful outcome without recurrence of leiomyosarcoma for up to 20 months ' post-surgery in the horse (Livesey et al. 1986; Clem et al. 1987; Hinojosa et al. 2003); however, long-term outcome may depend more on location of the tumour and whether this location is amenable to surgical resection and/or debulking. Reports involving tumours of the duodenum, stomach and bladder resulted in euthanasia due to an inability to resect the tumour tissue (Mair et al. 1990; Boy et al. 1992; Hurcombe et al. 2008). Growth of leiomyosarcomas is considered to be rapid in many species and this tumour characteristic was apparent in two horses with tumours affecting the uterus and vagina/bladder (Lofstedt et al. 1987; Hurcombe et al. 2008). In humans, vaginal leiomyosarcoma is rare, but tumors recur frequently after surgical excision with metastases common and an overall poor prognosis (Ahram et al. 2006). Frequent recheck examinations are recommended to determine tumour recurrence and/or presence of metastatic disease; however, behaviour of this neoplasm in the horse remains undetermined due to its rare nature. The mare in this case report was re-examined 8 months 'post-surgery with no gross indication of tumour regrowth and only mild scar tissue present at the surgical site. Biopsy of the scar tissue was declined at that time as the mare was clinically doing well. Regrettably, the mare was subsequently sold, and no further follow-up was available. This report suggests that surgical debulking of a primary vestibulovaginal leiomyosarcoma with the LigasureTMdevice has a favourable prognosis for long-term outcome. The mare has done well up to 8 months 'post-surgery without macroscopic evidence of tumour recurrence, although recurrence remains a risk and frequent vaginal examinations to monitor for any indication of regrowth were recommended.

This describes the diagnosis and treatment of an aryepiglottic tumour in a 19-year-old Paint gelding. Diagnostic work-up included physical examination, endoscopic evaluation of the upper airway, and histopathology of the mass following removal. Treatment consisted of surgical excision of the aryepiglottic mass under endoscopic guidance followed by a 100 Gy dose of radiation delivered with strontium-90 plesiotherapy to the surgical bed at 72 h post-operatively. The radiation applicator was passed through the left nostril and the application area was con rmed via endoscopic evaluation. Histopathology, including immunohistochemistry, con aryepiglottic tumour was T cell lymphoma. Recheck examination, including physical examination and upper airway endoscopy, was performed 1, 3 and 6 months following treatment and local recurrence was not observed. Local control with minimal morbidity can be achieved with surgical excision of equine lymphoma followed by strontium-90 plesiotherapy. Introduction Lymphoma is the most common haematopoietic neoplasm identi ed in horses and accounts for 1 -3% of all equine tumours (Taintor and Schleis 2011). Clinical signs of equine loss, anorexia, depression, lethargy, ventral oedema, diarrhoea and colic 1983; Sweeney and Gillette 1989; Meyer et al. 2006; Mu ~noz et al. 2009; Durham et al. 2012). Solitary extranodal tumours have been reported in the spleen, palate, nasopharynx, nasal passage, sinus, tongue, meninges, gingiva and pelvis et et al. 1992; Tanimoto et al. 1994; Weaver et al. 1996; Gerard et al. 1998; Rhind and Dixon 1999; Oikawa et al. 2003; Montgomery et al. 2009). Ante-mortem diagnosis of lymphoma is typically made through histopathological evaluation of biopsy specimens or cytological examination of ne needle aspirates of a suspected lesion (Mair et al. 1985; Taylor et al. 2006; Taintor and Schleis 2011). Classi cation systems for lymphoma in veterinary species rely on morphological features of the tumour and incorporate assignment of T- or B-cell origin or proliferative indices (Teske et al. 1994; Vernau et al. 1997; Kiupel et al. 1999). The prognosis for horses diagnosed with lymphoma depends on the form of lymphoma and stage of disease. Current treatment options for lymphoma in the equine case include surgical excision of accessible masses, radiotherapy or administration of chemotherapeutics. Treatment has been reported to result in palliation and occasionally resolution ofdisease without recurrence (Taintor and Schleis 2011). The present case report describes the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of a 19-year-old gelding diagnosed with aryepiglottic lymphoma. Case history A 19-year-old American Paint Horse gelding presented for evaluation of coughing and dysphagia of several weeks duration. Transtracheal wash was performed 4 days prior to presentation and cellulitis of the ventral cervical region developed following the procedure. Upper airway endoscopy revealed a right-sided aryepiglottic mass. The gelding was referred for further diagnostics and treatment. Clinical ndings Initial physical examination performed revealed a pulse rate (48 beats/min) and respiratory rate (18 beats/min) that were within normal limits. Rectal temperature (38.9 \u00b0C) was increased. The gelding had feed material in both nostrils and would readily cough and snort feed material during eating. A venous blood sample was submitted for complete blood count, which revealed increased nucleated cell count 16.99109/L (reference range [rr] 5.5 -10.59109/L), neutrophil 14.5 9109/L (rr 3 -79109/L) brinogen 6 g/L (rr 1 - 4 g/L). Cellulitis of the ventral cervical region surrounding the transtracheal wash site was appreciated. Endoscopy of the nasopharynx revealed moderate feed contamination and an approximately 3 94 cm right aryepiglottic mass ( Fig 1a ). Treatment An intravenous jugular catheter was placed and the horse was administered potassium penicillin (22,000 Mu/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h), gentamicin 24 h), metronidazole (15 mg/kg bwt q. 8 h) and phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h). The horse was sedated and restrained in the stocks. Following topical application of 35 mL of 2% lidocaine solution, the majority of the mass in the right aryepiglottic region was resected using a combination of epiglottic scissors (Embertson Esophageal Epiglottic SCS 1404-883B)1and diode laser excision under endoscopic guidance. Dysphagia immediately resolved following surgical excision. Seventy-two hours following surgical excision, the gelding was again sedated and upper airway endoscopy repeated 2a ve mL of 2% lidocaine solution was topically applied to the surgical bed. Following radiation ALARA protection \u00a92017 EVJ developed with institutional oversight, anSr-90 probe with a2cmconvex application surface was attached with medical tape toasurgical laser cutting guide (Crochet chirurgie Laser equine 60cm)2inashielded area while wearing ring badges and two layers of surgical gloves. Medical personnel wore lead aprons during treatment while theprobe was passed through the leftnostril and nasopharynx tothe laryngeal region. The applicator was pressed against the tumour bed over 10min and 100Gy was administered (Fig2b).Endoscopy combined with application ofradiation therapy took approximately 15min toperform. After the treatment was completed, awipe test ofthe probe was carried outaswell asasurvey ofthetreatment room, resulting inbackground radiation levels, and thesource was replaced inthefacility shielded cabinet. Thehorse was discharged from the hospital following radiotherapy. Outcome Histologically, the aryepiglottic mass contained a homogenous population cells ahigh ofCD3 +neoplastic celllymphoma. onstall rest until his rst recheck appointment toradiotherapy were notobserved in period. Local recurrence endoscopically following treatment (Fig1b)and the gelding 'sexercise was increased tosmall paddock turnout. Recheck examination, including physical examination and upper airway endoscopy, was repeated 3and 6months after treatment and local recurrence was notobserved (Fig1c,d ). At this time, the horse was back in work and in good health.Discussion This case report highlights the role ofradiotherapy following ablative surgery inthe treatment oflocalised equine was maintained inthis case for post-operatively with no local recurrence. Radiotherapy was utilised because oftheconservative tissue resection technique selected inthis anatomic location. No radiation-induced complications following treatment with strontium-90 were observed atthe time points evaluated. This case report demonstrates that local control with minimal morbidity can beachieved with surgical excision a source (strontium-90, iridium-192 or iodine-125) through surface treatment orimplantation. Common forms of brachytherapy include interstitial, where sources are placed directly into the tissue, orintracavitary, where anapplicator containing sources isplaced within abody cavity. Brachytherapy can also be administered using a low dose rate (LDR), with dose rates <2Gy/min, and permanent implants, while high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is applied with dose rates greater than 12Gy/min using temporary implants. Plesiotherapy isa form of brachytherapy where the radiation is administered probes can vary, generally the strontium tipisshielded from the user bya1cm plexiglass pane. the within thetreatment surface atadepth of several millimetres. This treatment has been commonly used for malignant and benign corneal and conjunctival lesions in both a) b) c) d) Fig1:Upper airway endoscopic images ofa19-year-old American Paint Horse gelding illustrating: VETERINARY EDUCATION veterinary medicine (Hammond etal.2007; Ware and Gieger 2011). Teletherapy involves deployment ofradiation from an external beam, either linear accelerator orcolbalt-60 machine. Teletherapy isthe most commonly used radiation modality for human and small animal veterinary cases. Teletherapy requires anamply shielded treatment vault, and totreat ananimal weighing over roughly 160kg,adaptations have tobemade toprovide atreatment couch robust enough tosupport the patient (Henson and Dobson 2004). Whether radiotherapy isindicated depends upon the size and location ofthe tumour (Weaver etal.1996; Vail and Young 2002; Henson and Dobson 2004; Gerard etal.2010), and the dose isdetermined based upon tumour location, size and depth. Radiation therapy with three doses of megavoltage radiotherapy applied asasingle beam from a 4MV linear accelerator and given under general anaesthesia at7day intervals was used inone report totreat four horses diagnosed with lymphoma, three with solitary skin masses and one with amass inthe nasal passage (Henson etal.2004), and allfour horses were reported tobetumour- free forupto8years following treatment. Anadditionalreport ofradiation therapy with two doses of8Gyusing 6 MV photons given under general anaesthesia at7day intervals inapony with extensive paranasal sinus and nasal Bcell lymphoma suggested that palliative treatment was successful inimproving and prolonging quality oflifefor2.5years following inthat areasonable treatment option for large tumours, even incases where the entire tumour was not accessible tobeirradiated (Gerard etal.2009). The horse in thepresent report had complete remission for6months after combined ablative surgery and radiotherapy. Inastudy evaluating localised lymphoma in10cats treated with radiation was ineight cats (Elmslie etal.1991). Inthe sixcats that had tumour control 159weeks, with three alive atthetime offollow-up (Elmslie etal.1991). Beta astrontium source isafavourable treatment option for equine lymphoma for several reasons. The procedure issimple, quick and readily performed under standing sedation onanoutpatient basis, although case cooperation isessential inmaintaining consistent position the strontium probe. Strontium isapure bemitter without clinically signi cant photon activity, which greatly reduces the potential radiation hazards inhandling the strontium source and minimises shielding costs. Radiation effects are localised to theregion being treated. Acute effects, which arecommon and transient, include dry and moist desquamation and inflammation with reddened and possibly swollen tissues visible. Late effects can include nonhealing ulceration and necrosis (Weaver etal.1996; Henson and Dobson 2004). Radiotherapy treatment-related complications were not noted in the horse in this case report and he did not display any signs that we would have associated with acute orlate radiation effects, such as discomfort, drooling or reluctance to eat. Prognosis incases ofequine lymphoma isaclinical challenge. Histopathology and diagnostic imaging can be used tostage and determine prognosis. The WHO has developed aclinical staging system for lymphoma in domestic animals based onanatomic site and extent of organ involvement and clinical signs (Vail and Young 2002). Clinical stage can help determine which course oftreatment, including surgical excision, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or some combination thereof, ispursued inaspeci cclinical case. Future studies focusing ondisease subtype and location intheequine patient incorrelation with clinical outcome are necessary toidentify prognostic features and appropriate treatment (Vail and Young 2002; Durham etal.2012). Onthe basis ofexcellent local control rate with morbidity in thiscase, theuseofablative surgery followed bybirradiation from have nocon flictsofinterests.

Hollis, unpublished data). Although the technique is simple and the results can be excellent, the availability is limited. Strontium-90 is a high activity sealed source, which has very speci c security and health and safety requirements associated with its purchase, storage, use and eventual destruction. In the UK, there is no longer access to purchase new strontium applicators, so only institutions that already have the applicator can offer this therapy, at least in the UK. This means that only a few specialist institutions have access to strontium-90, which probably contributes to the minimal published data on its use in the horse. In human medicine, ruthenium-106 has taken over from strontium-90 for plesiotherapy applications, although, to the author 's knowledge, this has not yet been used in equine medicine and strontium-90 remains the only option for plesiotherapy in the horse.

Devereux* Equine Acupuncture and Chiropractic Referrals, Meadow Rise, Farley, success has been demonstrated using percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) to treat trigeminal-mediated headshaking (TMHS) in horses. The aim of this study is to determine whether electroacupuncture (EA) can provide similar remission from the pain of this debilitating condition. EA is less invasive than PENS and can be carried out in the stable yard without the need for a hospital setting and expensive equipment. Six horses and ponies showing clinical signs of headshaking were treated with electroacupuncture of the infraorbital nerve under light sedation. The nerve was stimulated with alternating 2 and 80 Hz frequencies for a period of 25 min with the current adjusted so that there was visible twitching of the nostrils and/or lips. Follow-up treatments were given when the signs recurred or 4 -7 days later if there was no initial response. The procedure was well tolerated by all the horses. Once a response was achieved, the period of remission often increased with subsequent treatments. Median remission time for the rst treatment was 5.5 days (mean 7.6 days, range 0-13 days, n =6). second treatment 8.5 days (mean 10.6 days, range 7 -21 days, n =6), third treatment 18 days (mean 28.8 days, range 6 -71 days, n =6), fourth treatment 47.5 days (mean 10 weeks, range 11 days -23 weeks, n =6), fth treatment 13 weeks 5 days (mean 18 weeks 5 days, range 5 weeks -46 weeks, n =5), sixth treatment 24 days (mean 26 days, range 13 -41 days, n =3). The three horses that started treatment in 2015 received a single treatment in April or May of 2016 and were still asymptomatic at the end of the study period in October 2016. It was concluded that EA of the infraorbital nerve is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for the management of horses considered to be experiencing trigeminal-mediated headshaking. Introduction The syndrome termed headshaking (HS) has a characteristic and well-recognised clinical presentation that is thought to be attributable to involvement of the trigeminal nerve. It has been suggested that the condition is similar to trigeminal neuralgia in man (Cook 1980; Mair 1999; Newton et al. 2000). The human disorder is characterised by episodic, intermittent or persistent, mild or severe tingling, burning, stabbing or shooting electric shock-like pain in the facial region, which is triggered by relatively minor, often speci c facial, nasal or oral stimuli. It is suggested that the equine condition is similar (Newton et al. 2000) accounting for the clinical signs observed in horses (Pickles et al. 2014). Nerve conductionstudies show that affected horses have a lower stimulus threshold to trigger sensory nerve action potentials in the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve than healthy horses (Aleman et al . 2013; Aleman et al. 2014). Electroacupuncture (EA) has been successfully used to treat chronic nerve/neuropathic pain in horses and man (White et al. 2001; Xie et al. 2005). Robert 'set al. (2016) described the use of PENS to treat TMHS in horses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EA provided sufcient relief to recommend as a rst line treatment for trigeminal-mediated (TM) HS. To the author 's knowledge there are no previous scienti c reports of the speci c use of EA for the treatment of TMHS in horses. Electroacupuncture and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are similar (Cummings 2001); both modulate perception of afferent nociceptive stimuli by inhibiting afferent pain signals and by activation of descending inhibitory pathways. The low pulse rate of 2 Hz induces encephalins and acts on land dreceptors providing analgesia, whist the higher pulse rates of 80 -100 Hz release dynorphins and act on j receptors (Han 2003). This combination of frequencies is more effective than a single constant current. More detailed information on the mechanisms of EA on persistent and neuropathic pain are described by Kim et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2014). Three of the horses in the current study were sensitive to sunlight so the owners were asked to use protective UV blocking face masks and/or nose nets when they were turned out or exercised. Previous studies have demonstrated that in 50 -70% of affected horses there is a signi cant decrease in clinical signs when using these (Mills and Taylor 2003). Horses 1, 2 and 6 also wore them in the stable. It has been postulated that photic stimulation of the optic nerve by sunlight causes cross-activation of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (Madigan et al. 1995). In addition to reflecting UV light, the effect of the face mask and nose net is considered to be due to stimulation of touch and pressure receptors, the axons of which synapse with the terminals of the small unmyelinated true pain C bres, subjecting them to presynaptic inhibition (King 1999). They also give some protection from wind, dust, pollen and thermal radiation from the sun. Full resolution of signs using just a nose net or face mask is rare (Pickles et al. 2014), and only one of the six horses in this study (Horse 4) showed an adequate response. Materials and methods The study was completed over a 19-month period and included four horses and two ponies ( Table 1 ). For inclusion they were considered to be trigeminal-mediated headshakers[The copyright line for this article was changed on 22 July 2017 after original online publication.] \u00a92017 The Authors.

Prior to inclusion each horse underwent a dental and oral examination plus nasopharyngeal endoscopy including examination of the guttural pouches in order to rule out as far as possible the presence of dental issues, tumours, infection or a foreign body. In addition, Horse 3 had dental radiography and a computed tomography scan was performed on Horse 6. All had negative ndings with these diagnostic procedures and were showing clinical signs of headshaking at the time of presentation for EA. In the 19-month period no horses were excluded from the study. All horses underwent a comprehensive clinical examination including moving in hand, on the lunge and ridden if appropriate, and a detailed medical history was obtained ( Table 2 ). Headshaking grades at rest and at exercise were recorded for each horse and the grading system of 0 -3 explained to the owners ( Table 3 ). When possible, a video recording was made of the horse at exercise. Assessment was made of the t of the bridle and saddle with ridden horses. Any dental, tack or musculoskeletal issues were addressed prior to commencement of treatment in case they were contributory factors to the headshaking. Procedure Each horse was sedated with a combination of butorphanol 0.025 mg/kg bwt This is the manufacturer 's recommendation for light sedation, but a reduced dose was often adequate. Whilst under sedation, the horse 's head was rested on a plastic covered polystyrene block or bedding bales padded with a soft blanket. Care was taken to ensure that the patient 's position was comfortable with the head in a neutral position. The left side of the face was treated rst. There was no need for the site to be clipped or scrubbed provided the horse 's skin was clean and dry. The infraorbital nerve was palpated and a sterile Chinese style acupuncture needle (0.3925 mm with a coiled copper handle with guide tube3) was inserted through the skin and slid under the nerve into the fascia between the nerve and the underlying periosteum 2-3 cm rostral to the infraorbital foramen. A variety of acupuncture needle types and sizes were tested, but early in the case series it was determined that inserting a 0.3925 mm sterile Chinese acupuncture needle3in a medial to lateral and rostral direction minimised the risk of the needle becoming displaced during the procedure. A second needle (Seirin L type needle, size no 8, 0.3 950 mm3) was placed in the brachiocephalic muscle at the base of the horse 's neck on the same side. A Cefar ACUS 44electrical acupuncture stimulator (this is no longer made) was used for Horses 1 -4 and Horse 6; an AS SUPER 45digital electric needle stimulator was used to treat Horse 5 for all but the rst treatment ( Supplementary Item 1 ). Crocodile clips from the lead were attached to each needle close to the skin to prevent 'drag 'on the needle ( Fig 1 ). The battery-operated EA unit was switched on and the intensity of stimulation increased slowly in increments of 0.1 mA until the nostril started to twitch. This was independently controlled for the two frequency settings (2 and 80 Hz) with the CEFAR ACUS 4. With the AS SUPER 4 the intensity of both frequencies changes at the same time. Once the twitch was observed, the intensity was increased very slowly to a level where both thetwitch of the 2 Hz and the tetanic spasm of the 80 Hz were visible but not causing the horse any discomfort (Supplementary Item 2 ). This was maintained for a period of 25 min. If the rst visible twitch caused the horse 's head to jerk rather than just a localised nostril twitch, the needle was considered to be too close to the infraorbital nerve. The current was reduced or switched off and the needle repositioned usually without the need to withdraw it completely. As the treatment progressed the intensity sometimes needed to be increased to maintain a constant level of twitch. On a small number of occasions, the stimulus caused a local twitch around the needle that did not extend to the muzzle region or only when the intensity was increased to a level above that considered acceptable. When this occurred, the intensity was reduced and the needle slowly withdrawn a little. This usually released the tip of the needle from within a band of fascia, and the muscle(s) started to contract freely. If the lower eyelid was seen to twitch or lacrimation occurred due to inadvertent stimulation of the facial nerve (CN VII) the needle was repositioned 1 -2 cm more rostrally to avoid the possibility of corneal irritation. For the rst treatment session, the whole procedure was then repeated on the other side of the face. Thereafter, if the horse was settled, treatment of the second side commenced once the rst side was underway. If necessary, the sedation was topped up before treatment of the second side. At the completion of treatment, instructions for the immediate management of the horse were dependent on the weather and the known trigger factors of the individual horse, which were avoided as far as possible. Three of the horses were known to be sensitive to sunlight and the owners were asked to keep a UV light-blocking fly mask (Cashel Crusader Fly Masks6, Premier Equine Buster Mask Xtra7, LeMieux Comfort Fly Shield Full Mask8; Equilibrium Field Relief Max Fly Mask9) on their horse in daylight hours if tolerated and to ride or drive with an UV-blocking riding mask (LeMieux Comfort Shield Riding Mask8) and nose net6,8,9, removing the mask only for competitions and jumping. Owners were also advised against trimming the whiskers, using a twitch or clipping the horse 's face over the infraorbital nerve. Optimum fly control was advocated with the use of fly rugs, repellents and stabling in summer. A daily report was requested by email including the horse 's name, the date, headshaking grades, weather conditions, exercise type and duration, plus any comments. Ridden work or driving could be undertaken the day following treatment unless the headshaking remained severe. Horses responding to the rst treatment were given a second treatment as soon as there was any sign of recurrence. Those that did not respond or showed short-lived improvement were given a second treatment 4 -7 days after the rst. Before each treatment, the horses were observed at exercise and graded by the author unless darkness or inclement weather prevented this. Horse 5 was examined by the author for the rst treatment but was geographically too far away for follow up treatment sessions. For this case, the technique was demonstrated to two experienced equine veterinary surgeons from a referral practice who carried out treatment on the second side of the face under the author 's guidance and then performed all subsequent procedures when requested by the author who was in daily communication with the horse 's owner. \u00a92017 The Authors.

Horse 3 was used for eventing. He had been in his owner 's possession for 2 years when he developed sudden onset headshaking at variable grades between 1 and 3 in May 2015. This persisted until his rst treatment in August 2015. Treatment intervals were 6 days, 12 days, 10 weeks and 20 weeks ( Supplementary Items 8 and 9). He occasionally showed signs on a single day between treatments but this spontaneously resolved and his eventing career continued uninterrupted. At the end of the study period he had maintained grade 0 and not received a treatment for 6 months ( Fig 4 ). Horse 4 developed clinical signs of headshaking in July 2015. It was well controlled with the use of a nose net but their use is prohibited in eventing under FEI rules. His signs were variable (grades 1 -3) and made him unrideable at times. They were mild in the stable and exacerbated by exercise. He responded to treatment allowing him to be ridden and compete but still showed mild grade 1 signs (occasional tics) on some days in the stable and at exercise.In March 2016 he became lame and received no further follow-up ( Fig 5 ). Horse 5 was purchased to bring on for riding club activities in November 2014. He rst showed signs of headshaking in September 2015 with variable signs ranging from grade 0 to 3 and was no longer ridden. At the rst assessment in March 2016 he was not headshaking in the stable. On the lunge he constantly rubbed his nose along the ground or spontaneously burst into canter becoming distressed with violent vertical flicks of his head. This continued when brought back into the stable and sedated, making needle placement dif cult. He responded to the EA with treatment intervals of 5 days, 8 days, 6 days, 7 weeks, 14 weeks and 3 weeks. In August 2016 the development of a pronounced rm swelling of his upper lip, thought to be due to a sting, coincided with a peak in HS grade 2 at rest ( Fig 6 ). During the trial period his training continued. He was the only horse in the study that would not tolerate a facemask or nose net during the period of treatment. Horse 6 was the most severely affected; she started headshaking 3 weeks after purchase and would not tolerate 3 T1 - 08.04.15 Fig 2: Horse 1.

At the start of treatment on 16 June 2016 she presented as grade 3 in the stable and on the lunge ( Supplementary Item 10 ). The only short periods without any signs were momentarily when eating or when lying down in the stable. Following the rst and second treatments there was an exacerbation of the clinical signs for 2 -3 days. The rst short period of complete remission occurred after the third treatment, scoring grade 0 for 3 consecutive days. Following the fourth EA session given 22 days after the commencement of treatment the mare was ridden for the rst time. A longer period of remission occurred after the fth treatment lasting 36 days at grade 0 (Supplementary Item 11 ). Treatment 6 was effective for 2 weeks and treatment 7 for just 5 days. Following an eighth treatment, the mare remained asymptomatic for the 3 weeks until the end of the study period ( Fig 7 ) and a further 5 weeks thereafter. Since the fth treatment the mare has been ridden regularly and lightly competed in riding club activities.Horses 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 continue to be monitored as part of the ongoing study. Discussion Case selection was important as this treatment is for cases with suspected trigeminal neuralgia rather than head shakers that are suffering from other underlying pathology (Lane and Mair 1987). Whilst it is dif cult to be categorical as none of the horses in the study underwent posterior ethmoidal analgesia or nerve conduction studies, both the referring veterinary surgeons and the author considered TMHS the most likely diagnosis. The owners were offered a full diagnostic work-up including local anaesthesia and a computed tomography scan, but ve of the six declined due to the cost. The trigeminal nerve is the largest of the cranial nerves. It is divided into ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular Fig 4: Horse 3.

J. Pickles Chine House widely accepted that trigeminal-mediated headshaking (TMHS) is a more accurate term with clinical signs of TMHS considered to reflect trigeminal neuropathic pain (Pickles et al. 2014; Roberts 2014). Although involvement of the trigeminal nerve had long been suspected in the aetiology of TMHS due to the presenting clinical signs (Williams 1897, 1899), a reduced threshold of activation of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve in headshaking horses compared with control horses has only been recently de nitively con rmed (Aleman et al. 2013, 2014). These elegant nerve conduction studies, the seasonality of clinical signs in many headshaking horses and absence of gross or histopathological lesions in the trigeminal nerves and ganglia from headshaking horses (Newton 2001; Aleman et al. 2013; Roberts et al. 2017) are suggestive of a functional rather than structural nerve disorder, although this requires further validation. In further support of this hypothesis is the nding that the activation threshold of the trigeminal nerve in a horse with seasonal TMHS tested during a time of remission showed a threshold for activation similar to control horses (Aleman et al. 2014). Unfortunately this horse was not tested during seasonal exacerbation of headshaking signs, which would appear to be the next logical step in elucidating any seasonal malleability of the activation threshold of the trigeminal nerve. The cause of the aberrant trigeminal nerve activity ('hypersensitivity ') in equine TMHS remains frustratingly elusive. Despite its predilection for latency in the trigeminal ganglion, equine herpesvirus-1 does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of TMHS (Aleman et al. 2012). Some clinical similarities appear to exist between TMHS and human trigeminal neuralgia (HTN), a debilitating cause of facial pain in people, which is described by sufferers as intermittent or continuous burning, itching, tingling, or electric-like pain in an area innervated by the trigeminal nerve (Nurmikko and Eldridge 2001). These same descriptions are often used by owners when recounting their horse 's headshaking behaviour. However, the majority of HTN patients have unilateral focal compression and demyelination of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone (Devor et al. 2002) with resultant ipsilateral (only) clinical signs (Nurmikko and Eldridge 2001). Neither demyelination injury (Newton 2001; Aleman et al. 2013; Roberts et al. 2017), nor the reduced conduction velocity (Aleman et al. 2014) which would be caused by such lesions, have been found in trigeminal nerve studies of headshaking horses. How or why some horses enter spontaneous remission of TMHS, which may last from weeks to years, is unknown.Long-term remission appears uncommon with only 5% of 109 headshaking horses reported to cease TMHS for more than one year (Madigan and Bell 2001). As headshaking horses can go into spontaneous remission (albeit rarely), some after many years of TMHS, it suggests reversibility of the trigeminal nerve hypersensitivity is possible. This offers the tantalising prospect of manipulation of the threshold activation as the Holy Grail of a true treatment, rather than just a management strategy, for TMHS. Electrical nerve stimulation is the therapeutic alteration of activity in the central, peripheral, or autonomic nervous systems by transcutaneous or implanted electrical devices. Two such therapies, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) and electroacupuncture, have recently been reported as successful in the management of TMHS in some horses (Roberts et al. 2016; Devereux 2019). These are a welcome addition to the armoury of TMHS treatments and appear to offer a more rational approach than prior mechanical or pharmacological treatments which did not address the underlying aberrant neurophysiology. Whilst these therapies do appear to show promise, cited remission times post-treatment of horses with seasonal TMHS such as those by Devereux (2019) should be interpreted with caution when they overlap with times of year when the horse would be expected to enter seasonal remission. Therapeutic application of electricity for pain dates back thousands of years since ancient Egyptians utilised electric sh to provide pain relief (Heidland et al. 2013). Following widespread use in the 19th Century, electrotherapy fell out of favour until publication of the gate control theory of pain by Melzack and Wall (1965) led to a resurgence of interest in neurostimulation. This gate control theory is also the science that underpins the common parental response of rubbing a sore area on a child. Melzack and Wall (1965) reported that the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord acts as a gate control system, which modulates the synaptic transmission of nerve impulses from peripheral bres to the central nervous system. Small nociceptive A- dand C bres hold the 'gate 'in an open position, while stimulation of large mechanoreceptive A- bbres by touch, pressure or vibration close the 'gate 'and inhibit pain transmission to the brain. Small nociceptive bres have a higher activation threshold than larger mechanoreceptive bres such that selective low level stimulation of mechanoreceptors can prevent or reduce pain transmission. Activation of these large A- bbres recruits inhibitory interneurons within the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord which exert their inhibitory action on both large and small diameter bres synapsing higher up the spinal cord. Additionally, activation of the descending inhibitory pathway, \u00a92017 EVJ starts in the periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain and passes through the ventral medulla into the spinal cord, occurs. Activation of this pathway results in the enhanced release of endogenous opioids and alterations of many other neuro-excitatory or including serotonin, noradrenaline, P (Heidland et al. 2013). Electrotherapy of human neuromusculoskeletal pain is currently performed using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS). In mild to moderate pain, TENS and PENS are effective, whereas SCS is useful for therapy of refractory neuropathic or ischaemic pain (Heidland et al. 2013). The electrical devices differ in regard to the amplitude (intensity), frequency, duration and pattern of the electrical currents. Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, which allows precise subcutaneous eld stimulation targeted to speci c areas of neuropathic pain, is a recognised treatment under National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for human sufferers of neuropathic pain (Anon 2013). It has proven effective in decreasing both subjective and objective pain scores in a randomised double-blind sham-controlled crossover trial on 31 patients with chronic pain and surface hyperalgesia (Raphael et al. 2011) and has been successfully used for the treatment of neuropathic trigeminal pain syndromes (Johnson and Burchiel 2004; Slavin et al. 2006). A total of 7 out of 10 (70%) patients with post-herpetic or traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain treated with PENS of the supra- or infraorbital nerves reported reduction in pain of at least 50% at 24 months (Johnson and Burchiel 2004). Similarly, Slavin et al. (2006) report 22 of 30 (73%) patients experienced more than a 50% reduction in pain following PENS stimulation of the trigeminal and/or occipital peripheral for craniofacial pain. The recently developed, equine speci c, neurostimulation device EquiPENS1has now been used in over 130 TMHS horses with approximately 50% successfully returning to the previous level of activity (V. Roberts, personal communication). Ultrasonographic guidance is used to direct the probe percutaneously such that it lies approximately 1 mm super cial to the infraorbital nerve prior to stimulation (Roberts et al. 2016). A detailed description of the procedure is given by Roberts et al. (2016). Response is individual and variable and a series of three initial treatments is required to determine if therapy has been successful. The median length of remission following the third treatment is reported as 15.5 weeks (range 0 -24 weeks, n =5) (Roberts et al. 2016). Further stimulation procedures can then be given as necessary at individually determined intervals as clinical signs resume, or worsen. Adverse reactions of mild swelling at the site of insertion or transient worsening of TMHS are infrequently seen following treatment and do not appear to in fluence response to the procedure (Roberts et al. 2016). Given the longer length of probe and closer approximation to the infraorbital nerve, greater nerve stimulation is likely to occur with EquiPENS compared with the described electroacupuncture technique (Devereux 2019). Whilst TMHS remains an enigmatic and frustrating condition, it is encouraging to see the wealth of new information elucidated in recent years. Neuropathic pain is notoriously dif cult to treat; however, the apparentfunctional, rather than pathological, nature of trigeminal nerve hypersensitivity in TMHS gives the real possibility that electrostimulation techniques may provide relief to horses with this distressing condition and their owners.

Beccati*, A. Cerocchi, M. third metacarpal bone Summary Two young adult endurance horses were referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Perugia for right (Case 1) and left (Case 2) forelimb lameness during 54 km and 81 km national endurance competitions; Case 1 was a 5-year-old Arab gelding and Case 2 a 6-year-old Arab female. The day after the com- petition there was no swelling or deformation and the affected forelimb was maintained in protrac tion avoiding full weightbearing. At walk both horses showed mild lameness with a shortening of the cranial phase of the affected forelimb. The horses demonstrated severe lameness when trotting in a straight line, and placed the limb in an abducted position. Initial total screening radiography was performed because of the clinical signs and the suspicion of fracture, but overall radiographic ndings detected were considered incidental ndings. At the second examination after 7 days of box rest, both horses showed no changes in clinical signs, except for resolution of the abnormal stance; radiographic examination was repeated, but no abnormality was detected. In agreement with the owners, it was decided to proceed with diagnostic analgesia, after discussing the asso ciated risks given the severity of the lameness; in both cases, the lameness improved signi cantly (Case 1) and was abolished (Case 2) within 5 min by diagnostic analgesia of the origin of the proximal suspensory ligament using 3 mL of mepivacaine. An ultrasonographic examination of the proximal suspensory area was per formed using a palmar approach on the weightbearing and flexed limb. In Case 1, there was an enlargement of the medial lobe of the suspensory ligament of the right forelimb compared with that of the left forelimb. As the diagnostic ndings did not explain the severity of the lameness, a computed tomography (CT) examination was with a multislice helical scanner; transverse slices were obtained from the distal row of the carpal bones to the distal third of the third metacarpal bone (McIII). Images were reformatted and displayed in bon e and soft tissue windows. In both cases, the computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-de ned oval/circular hypoattenuating area at the most medial aspect of the proximal McIII, between the McIII and the axial aspect of the second metacarpal bone; thi s area continued distally as a hypoattenuating line in a proximomedial to distolateral direction. Thickening of the medial part of the palmar cortex was also identi ed, and lesions were surrounded by increased endosteal attenuation (sclero sis) of the McIII ( Fig 1 ). In both cases the de nitivediagnosis was incomplete palmar m etacarpal cortical (fatigue) fracture. After the rest and rehabi litation period, re-examination performed 8 months after injury showed resolution of the lameness. In endurance horses, the principal cause of lameness is patholo pathology associated with the second and fourth metacarpal bones as differential diagnoses. In these cases, the de nitive diagnosis was obtained using CT examination of the pro ximal McIII; CT is an advanced diagnostic imaging technique that provides excellent bone detail.

Riggs* The Hong Kong Jockey Club, Department of Veterinary Clinical Services, Equine Hospital, Sha Tin Racecourse, New Territories, Hong Kong, China *Corresponding author email: christopher.m.riggs@hkjc.org.hk Summary Computed tomography (CT) generates sectional, multiplanar images based on x-ray attenuation properties of the subject. Contrast within images is based on differences in relative tissue density. It can resolve subtle structural abnormalities within bone and soft tissue and, as such, it has potential, among other uses, to screen for pathology within bones of the appendicular skeleton in racehorses, which could predispose to catastrophic fractures. Recent technological advances have made the possibility of performing CT imaging in the standing horse a viable clinical alternative. This commentary reviews some recent developments in this eld of clinical imaging in the horse. Nuclear scintigraphy revolutionised the practice of equine orthopaedics in the 1980s. The ability to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the standing, sedated horse was a game-changer in the early 2000s. Widespread access to computed tomography (CT) that can be undertaken without general anaesthesia may well transform our capacity to diagnose occult lesions of the appendicular skeleton in the future. In this issue of Equine Veterinary Education , Beccati et al. (2019) illustrate two cases of incomplete fractures of the proximal, palmar cortex of the third metacarpal bone that were diagnosed through CT. The images presented illustrate relatively subtle structural pathology that would have been difcult if not impossible to identify de nitively by other means. Nuclear scintigraphy would almost certainly have indicated the presence of intense bone remodelling at the locations of fracture and localised signal changes with MRI would have prompted diagnosis of injury to the bone. One might argue that these modalities would have been more appropriate in these cases. Scintigraphy would have facilitated a diagnosis without the need for diagnostic analgesia to identify the anatomical region involved and general anaesthesia (GA), both of which could have exacerbated the primary pathology. MRI could have been performed without the need for GA, although the time required for image acquisition with this modality makes precise imaging of the proximal metacarpus challenging. The option to undertake CT studies of the limbs without need for GA would have been optimal. Conventional CT units generate images by determining the radiodensity of individual 'pixels 'in a cross-sectional, fan-shaped scan of the subject. An x-ray generator and opposing detector(s) are mounted in a gantry, built into an annulus, through which the subject is positioned. The x-ray generator and detector are spun around the subject andmultiple data sets are obtained of two-dimensional (2-D) 'slices 'at right angles to the axis through the core of the machine. The subject is advanced progressively and precisely along this axis, thereby generating data as contiguous 'slices ' or in a spiral pattern in the longitudinal plane. The data are processed to generate images that can be presented as sequential 2-D sections in different planes or into three-dimensional reconstructions. While MRI and CT both produce sectional, multiplanar images, the data they provide are quite different. CT relies on x-ray attenuation properties within the subject and differences in relative tissue density for distinction of structures and lesions. MRI principally maps the presence of hydrogen atoms (largely contained in water and fat in the body) and structural information of the skeleton is inferred from this. Consequently, CT images exhibit superior de nition of anatomic structures, higher resolution information about the structure of skeletal elements and detailed simultaneous bone and soft tissue imaging. In addition, CT imaging can be completed in a fraction of the time it takes to undertake MRI studies, a factor which is particularly important when imaging the standing horse. Computed tomography has advanced signi cantly since it was rst introduced to human medical practice in the mid 1970s. The resolution of images has increased dramatically, scan times and radiation dose rates have been cut and the cost of installing and maintaining units has fallen. This technology has been used in veterinary practice for approximately 30 years although until recently it has been necessary to conduct equine scans under GA to position the anatomical region of study through the annulus of the scanner. An ingenious bit of lateral thinking led to development of a special platform, which facilitated positioning and precise advance of a horse 's head through a conventional CT scanner (see Powell 2011). This device is now commercially available and widely used in specialist equine practice. However, to position a horse 's limb within the annulus of the CT machine, the animal generally has to be placed in lateral recumbency and, therefore, under GA. This has several disadvantages: (1) GA is associated with a moderate risk of mortality or morbidity in horses. This risk is signi cantly increased if there is pathology that weakens a bone of the appendicular skeleton; (2) the cost of the whole procedure is much greater; (3) images can only be obtained with the limb nonweightbearing; (4) the process will severely disrupt a horse 's training programme, which makes it unsuitable as a routine screening tool. Different groups have attempted to overcome the challenges of undertaking CT scans in the standing horse. \u00a92018 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.12885Desbrosse and colleagues have described the use of a small peripheral quantitative computerised tomography scanner (pQCT) mounted in a special jig to image the distal limb of a standing horse (Desbrosse et al. 2008). The authors reported on 47 clinical cases, of which the device had been used successfully in 30 to con rm a diagnosis of or aid surgical planning for conditions of the foot. However, the horse 's limb has to be physically lifted and placed within the core of the machine for scanning and there does not appear to be a rapid means of extricating the leg in the event that the horse panics. In addition, imaging is restricted to the distal limit of the limb. A relatively recent development in CT has been to use larger sensors that take advantage of the cone of x-rays generated by x-ray tubes. In this way much greater volumes of tissue can be analysed in every rotation of the generator and sensor around the subject. Larger anatomical segments can be imaged per unit time than is possible with the narrow fan beam in more conventional units. So-called 'cone-beam CT '(CBCT) units are cheaper and easier to maintain although in people they have largely been restricted to use in dental practice. However, robotics technology has been combined with cone-beam volumetric imaging by one company in the USA to develop a system that can scan most regions of the standing horse to generate volumetric images (4DDI Equine, about the Equimagine; http://equine4ddi.com/). Up to four robots capable of operating several panels, high-speed cameras, 3D surface scanners and x-ray generators are controlled to perform co-ordinated manoeuvres around the subject. This system appears to hold great promise although it is still early days and few units have been installed to date. Two further companies are working to develop volumetric imaging CT units speci cally for use in the standing horse. One applies conventional fan-beam CT technology and a large gantry that encompasses both fore- or both hindlimbs at once (Asto CT1, http://www.astoct.com/). The gantry can be positioned in the vertical or horizontal planes to image head and neck or limbs respectively. In the latter mode, the gantry can be lowered into a corresponding recess in a platform so that it is flush with the 'ground 'surface. Once the horse has been walked into position the gantry is raised to the level required to scan the region of interest. Both limbs are imaged simultaneously. A proof of concept machine has been built and used to successfully generate images of limbs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=pd UHwPPPOKw). The Asto CT EquinaTMCT machine is now commercially available. A separate company, which has specialised in cone-beam volumetric imaging technology for imaging the lower leg in standing human patients, is also working on a design for a dedicated equine unit (CurveBeam2; http:// www.curvebeam.com/). Cone-beam machines do not necessarily rely on a continuous ring that extends around the patient, but can be arranged as separate arms either side of the subject, one of which carries the x-ray generator and the other, the detector. The two arms swing in perfect alignment around the subject. Consequently, the subject can walk between the arms to stand on a central platform, which remains stationary while the arms rotate around it during data acquisition. The emphasis of this design is a small footprint, low cost and practicality of deployment at widespread veterinary clinics and mobile vans. It appears that an equineunit is still at the relatively early stages of design although the prospect of a practical solution seems promising. One further group has brie fly reported development of a CBCT unit to image structures of the distal limb in the standing horse (Koch et al. 2017). Cross-sectional imaging was attempted in 22 cases and successfully achieved in 21 of these. Intrasynovial contrast was used in eight cases to facilitate imaging of soft tissue structures. The option to perform CT examinations on the limbs of standing horses safely, quickly and affordably will be a leap forward for diagnosis of lameness. Perhaps even more valuable, it potentially will offer a tool to use to screen horses at risk for repetitive stress bone injuries (Muir 2014). A tome of convincing evidence has been accumulated to demonstrate that the majority of fractures that affect racehorses (and, probably, endurance horses) are the catastrophic culmination of repetitive stress injuries. Foci of intense remodelling, coalescing microcracks and short, unicortical fractures in the cortices and subchondral regions of bones act as stress-risers from which catastrophic fractures originate. Images obtained using standing MRI can indicate the presence (or likely presence) of such injuries although the anatomical resolution of the images and the practical constraints of performing MRI (principally the prolonged scan times) limit the ef cacy of this modality for screening purposes. Over 70% of fractures that result in euthanasia of racehorses originate in the fetlock. While our ability to detect subtle lesions in critical anatomical locations in this joint has improved through application of dedicated radiographic projections the sensitivity and speci city of radiography alone is inadequate (Davis et al. 2017). Routine CT scans of populations of horses will no doubt reveal a spectrum of different defects in bones which have potential to cause problems. Currently, while the evidence is convincing, the conclusion that catastrophic fractures originate from lesions associated with repetitive stress injury remains hypothetical. Also, there is evidence that the incidence of defects in subchondral bone at the location from where fractures develop is far higher than that of fracture. Why do some of these lesions progress and others not? Are there critical features that can be quanti ed to make assessment of ndings suf ciently speci c to gain the con dence of the racing industry to ensure at risk horses are prevented from racing (Dubois et al. 2014)? Before standing CT could be used as an effective screening tool, we will require answers to these questions. However, I believe that answers will be found and, just as scintigraphy has saved the lives of thousands of racehorses since its introduction in the 1980s, I predict standing CT will have a positive impact on the safety of racing in the future.

In pasture- associated stringhalt (PSH), the clinical sign of exaggerated, prolonged hindlimb flexion is associated with a peripheral neuropathy affecting the larger myelinated axons that is thought to be the result of exposure to a plant-derived neurotoxin. It is likely that multiple host and environmental risk factors interact to produce PSH and the precise aetiology has not yet been elucidated. Drought-affected, poor-quality pasture and the presence of Hypochoeris radicata (commonly referred to as Catsear, Flatweed and False Dandelion) are recognised risk factors. Affected horses are typically mature and taller animals are considered more susceptible. Most horses with PSH recover spontaneously if removed from the presumptive source of toxin; however, recovery can be prolonged, taking several years for some horses, and might be incomplete in occasional cases. A wide range of therapies have been attempted in horses with PSH including phenytoin, thiamine, taurine, in ltration of digital extensors with botulinum and lateral digital extensor myotenectomy procedure. The ef cacy of these treatments is uncertain since controlled trials have not been performed and the spontaneous recovery of most horses makes any response to treatment dif cult to interpret. Introduction Stringhalt is a condition of horses characterised by excessive and prolonged flexion of one or both hindlimbs during forward or backward movement. The condition has been recognised for centuries and was referred to as \"springhalt \"in Shakespeare 's play King Henry VIII, rst performed in the early 1600s. Other terms for stringhalt include Hahnentritt (German for rooster kick), and more recently, equine re flex hypertonia (Mayhew 2009; Hahn 2015). Classical (or unipedal) stringhalt, predominantly affecting only one hindlimb, most often follows injury to one dorsal tarsal/metatarsal region ( Supplementary Item 4 ). However, the condition is considered to be idiopathic (Crabill et al. 1994; Sullins 2002). Pasture-associated stringhalt (PSH) appears to be the result of exposure to a plant-derived neurotoxin or neurotoxins and subsequent peripheral neuropathy. Often referred to as Australian stringhalt, PSH has also been termed \"outbreak \"or \"epidemic \"stringhalt, as the condition commonly affects multiple animals in the same paddock and time period(Kendall 1887; Cahill et al. 1986; Gay et De Pennington et al. 2011). PSH is most often reported in horses grazing poor quality, drought-affected pastures and, although occasionally asymmetrical, the condition is invariably bilateral. Initially described in Australia and New Zealand, PSH has been reported in Europe, North and South America, and Asia (Cahill et al. 1985; Takahashi et al. 2010; De Pennington et al. 2011). Clinical presentation and diagnosis Horses with PSH have characteristic, though very variable, hyper flexion of both hindlimbs when attempting to move (Fig 1 ,Supplementary Item 1 and 2). A grading system has been proposed (I -VI) based upon prior reports in the literature (Huntington et al. 1989; Domange et al. 2010). In mild cases (grades I and II, Table 1 ) the gait abnormality might only be apparent when the horse is excited or nervous, when it is turned sharply, or when it is forced to walk backward. Clinical signs can often be exacerbated while walking the horse down a slope, after a sudden stop or following hard exercise. Horses with more severe PSH exhibit a hopping action in which hyper flexion becomes progressively more exaggerated and of increased duration. In some horses, flexion is so extreme that the dorsum of the fetlock contacts the ventral abdomen and the duration of hyper flexion becomes so prolonged that both hind feet leave the ground, almost at the same time, even while walking (grades IV and V, Table 1 and Supplementary Item 2 ). In extreme cases, horses are unable to rise without assistance (grade VI) (Pemberton and Caple 1980; Cahill et al. 1985; Huntington et al. 1989; Domange et al. 2010; Draper et al. 2014) .Although both hindlimbs are invariably involved in cases of PSH, clinical signs can show some asymmetry (Huntington et al. 1989; Mayhew 2009). The gait abnormality is often worse in cold weather and appears to be worse in horses that appear agitated. The severity of hyper flexion might decrease after the initial few steps but the gait typically remains abnormal. Muscle atrophy occurs in most affected horses, with the long and lateral digital extensor muscles the most severely affected. Distal limb muscle atrophy is often obvious in the early stages of PSH. Many horses, particularly those with prominent signs of long duration, have atrophy of the thighs and adductor muscles. \u00a92017 variation inthe degree of hindlimb fetlock flexion, attheonset of protraction (Mayhew 2009). These variations inclinical signs might reflect the complexity and range ofneuromuscular structures affected by the presumptive toxin. Very occasionally, the forelimbs are also affected inhorses and appetite; however, changes inbehaviour have been reported. Ina small number ofseverely affected horses, such ndings have included increased aggression (Huntington etal.1989; Domange etal.2010).

Abnormalities inEMG recordings gradually returned toward normal paralleling the clinical recovery inthree horses with PSH when monitored over aperiod of8months (Huntington etal.1989). The gait abnormality inPSH can vary considerably between individual horses and, asmentioned, some horses can display changes intheir gait when the case ismildly affected. Differential diagnoses for PSH might include shivers, Scandinavian knuckling disease that horses with pain, oreven (such asapplication ofa legwrap) relating tothedistal limb orhoof may produce a stringhalt-like gait (Supplementary Item 3).Inmost cases, careful examination ofthegait and assessment ofthehistory should allow differentiation between these conditions and PSH. Shivers isarelatively rare movement disorder that has recently been shown tobeassociated with degeneration of Purkinje cellaxons within thedeep cerebellar nuclei etal.2015). ofthehindlimb when thelimb ismanually lifted orwhen the horse isbacked. Some affected horses will hyperextend (rather than hyper flex) their hindlimbs during backing. Forward movement isperformed normally inmost horses with shivers. However, arecent study described asubset of affected animals that also had intermittent hindlimb hyper flexion during forward movement (Draper etal.2014). asa consequence ofthe neuropathy, reported with shivers. Interestingly, shivers also appears tooccur more Fig1:Horse with clinical signs ofpasture-associated flexion ofthehindlimb.TABLE 1:Grading scheme horses adapted from Huntington etal.(1989) and Domange etal.

Clearly there appears tobeanoverlap intheclinical signs dently separate there isexposure commonly referred toasScandinavian knuckling syndrome) isa condition that shares some epidemiological and pathological features with PSH. However, rather than hindlimb hyper flexion, affected horses usually have symmetrical digital extensor dysfunction with knuckling ofthe metatarsophalangeal joint and stumbling (Hahn etal.2008; Grondahl etal.2012). Severely affected horses can become rapidly recumbent and many aresubsequently subjected toeuthanasia but, as noted inPSH, mildly affected animals often make afull recovery over several months (Grondahl etal.2012). Like PSH, the condition occurs inoutbreaks but most cases ofAEP occur between mid-winter and spring. AEP has been anecdotally linked tofeeding practices (affected horses have often been fed wrapped forage) but epidemiological studies have not yet found differences inmanagement (including feeding practices) between affected and unaffected horses (Wolff etal.2014). Limited studies have shown that, aswith stringhalt, AEP isassociated with injury to theperipheral nerves butitistheSchwann cells that appear tobethe primary target with subsequent demyelination (Hahn etal.2008; Grondahl etal.2012). conditions may represent aspectrum ofaperipheral neuropathy toxin Todate, identi nervous system (PNS) and to thedistal muscles supplied byaffected nerves.

AnAustralian study reported that 50of52horses diagnosed with PSH had grazed onpastures containing alarge amount and Malva parvi flora (Marshmallow, Mallow Weed), have very occasionally been associated with PSH cases after several weeks ofgrazing theincriminated pastures and reports ofPSH typically increase during drought 1989; Domange etal.2010). H.radicata has along plant some resistance todrought conditions. Thisplant, might therefore, provide green herbage inpaddocks with otherwise sparse dryforage. However, some horses have also been observed toselectively graze H. radicata (Pemberton and Caple 1980; Huntington etal. 1989). The onset ofclinical signs can bedelayed and disease might notbecome evident until one to3weeks after removal from affected paddocks (Huntington etal.1989; Gardner etal.2005). Multiple horses inthesame paddock areusually affected and, occasionally, allexposed animals willdevelop clinical signs. However, more commonly, only aproportion of horses develop signs, suggesting that exposure alone is appearing tobeatgreater risk,although thecondition hasbeen described occasionally beprotected from PSH byvirtue oftheshorter length oftheir neurons. Cattle and sheep grazing pastures incriminated inPSH are not affected. This presumably isbecause toxins are broken down by rumen micro flora. Other monogastric grazing species also donotappear tobeaffected. Pathogenesis and possible aetiologies The gait abnormalities ofPSH are often exacerbated when affected horses appear agitated ordisturbed. Conversely, sedation ameliorates etal.2002; Domange etal. 2010). This, and the observation that some horses with PSH exhibit changes inbehaviour, has been interpreted to support CNS involvement inthepathogenesis and Stewart these observations, inhorses PSH have been entirely restricted tothe peripheral nerves todate. The recent report ofcerebellar lesions described inhorses with the allied syndrome shivers suggests that further investigation ofthe CNS inhorses with PSH might be warranted peripheral inPSH.

While these ndings are interesting and support therole ofH.radicata inPSH, therapid change, and particularly the rapid improvement, inclinical signs isnot consistent with natural disease. Furthermore, young (and smaller) animals arerarely affected with PSH and further work could explain the clinical signs ofPSH. Ingestion ofLathyrus spp. (sweet pea) andproduces ahypermetric, stringhalt-like gait (Mayhew 2009). Although agents have been identi edinthese plants, the neurotoxicity isthought to be animals (Pemberton and Caple 1980; Cahill detected incases ofPSH. Although examination ofsoilsamples collected from paddocks that had contained horses with PSH revealed high levels offungal micro flora, the ofthis insamples ofH.radicata or pasture litter from pastures grazed byaffected horses (Barry 1956; Huntington etal.1989; El-Hage 2011).

Reproduced with permission from I.G. (Joe) Mayhew, Large Animal Neurology ,Wiley Blackwell Publishing. / MARCH 2019Three guaianolides have been identi ed in the roots and aerial parts of H. radicata (Bohlmann and Bohlmann 1980). The guaianolides belong to the sesquiterpene lactone class of chemical compounds with well-known cytotoxic properties, but their role, if any, in PSH is unknown. In a recent pilot study using GC-MS, numerous differences in the metabolic pro les were identi ed between H. radicata samples collected from pastures that had contained horses with PSH and samples collected from pastures with no known cases of PSH. The signi cance of those differences remains to be determined (El-Hage 2011). There is now evidence to suggest that H. radicata produces toxic metabolites only following chemical or climate induced stress (Bohlmann 1980; Maruta 2013). Metabolic pro les, again determined by GC-MS, differed between plants deprived of water (to simulate drought conditions) and those receiving adequate water, but it is not yet known whether these differences are related to disease in grazing horses (El-Hage 2011). Leaves of H. radicata exposed to chloride secreted 1995). neurotoxicity of an extract from aerial parts ofH. radicata plants subjected to chemical (copper chloride) stress was documented in cultured murine nerve cells (MacKay et al. 2013). The observed degenerative changes resembled those following exposure to repin, a sesquiterpene lactone, that is believed to be the agent of yellow star thistle ( Centaurea solstitialis ) and the cause in horses (Roy et al. 1995; MacKay et al. 2013). Treatment and management strategies for horses with PSH Numerous therapies have been suggested for the treatment of PSH, and, while some of these have been described in the peer-reviewed literature, none have been assessed in large- scale blinded or controlled studies (Dixon and Stewart 1969; Huntington et al. 1991; Kannegieter and Malik al. 2009; Domange et al. 2010; El-Hage 2011). The reported success of any treatment for PSH must, of course, be considered in the context that the vast majority of affected horses recover spontaneously following removal from the putative source of toxin. Most horses recover over a period of 6-18 months, but mildly affected horses (grades I -II) can recover more quickly. It should be noted that recovery can be extremely prolonged requiring over 2 years for complete resolution in some severe cases. Severely affected horses might be subjected to euthanasia if they become recumbent for prolonged periods. A very small number of horses never appear to recover completely, perhaps as a result of severe muscle wastage or brosis (Cahill et al. 1985; Huntington et al. 1989; Domange et al. 2010). Myotenectomy of the lateral digital extensor Surgery for stringhalt has been reported for over 300 years (Markham 1644); whilst myotenectomy has been advocated for classical stringhalt, ef cacy of the procedure in the management of PSH has been a point of some contention (Cahill et al. 1985; Huntington et al. 1989; 1994; Sullins 2002; Domange et al. 2010; Dyson and Ross 2011). Some horses with PSH have been reported to improve byseveral grades immediately following lateral digital extensor myotenectomy, although others only recovered after a prolonged convalescence (Cahill et al. 1985; Huntington et al. 1989; Domange et al. 2010). This has created some doubt regarding the value of the procedure in light of the spontaneous recovery of most horses (Cahill et al. 1985; Huntington et al. 1989); however, one report has suggested that the technique can be successful in many (11/13) horses with PSH (Torre 2005). Botulinum toxin in ltration Botulinum toxin type A (Botox A) is a potent neurotoxin that has been used to manage a number of hypertonic or spastic muscular conditions in man (Pathak et al. 2006). Horses are considered exquisitely sensitive to the effects of Botox A and a single report of its use in two horses presenting with classical stringhalt provided some encouraging results. Following inltration of 100 IU four times over 21 days into either the lateral or long digital extensor muscles and 300 IU into the vastus lateralis at Day 28, improvements in electromyographic and clinical parameters were observed over 2 -3 months (Wijnberg et al. 2009). Anecdotal reports of prolonged clinical improvement following Botox A administration provide some basis for further investigation of its use in horses affected with stringhalt. Muscle relaxants Mephenesin, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, produced rapid reduction of the hypertonia in a single horse with PSH following systemic (intravenous or intramuscular) administration of mephenesin but this effect was transient (Dixon and Stewart 1969). The authors proposed that mephenesin might modulate the response of CNS centres and neural tracts that might be responsible for the hypertonicity in PSH. Because of its short duration of action and potentially serious side effects in human patients, mephenesin now has limited availability and has been largely replaced by methocarbamol. Although anecdotally used to treat PSH, the ef cacy of methocarbamol in PSH has not been reported. Baclofen, an analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter c- amino butyric acid, is used as a skeletal muscle relaxant primarily to treat spastic muscular conditions in man (Standaert and Roberson 2010). Baclofen has been trialled in horses with PSH on the basis that it might downregulate hyperactive stretch re flexes (Pedersen et al. 1974). Administration of baclofen (1 mg/kg bwt orally q. 8 h) to 10 horses that had had signs of PSH for between 4 months and 4 years resulted in improvement in clinical signs in eight of the 10 horses. However, clinical signs regressed slightly or returned to pretreatment levels in seven of those eight cases once treatment was withdrawn (Kannegieter and Malik 1992). A later report indicated no changes in a horse with PSH following a 9-day course of baclofen starting at 7.1 mg/kg bwt orally q. 12 h and increasing to 10 mg/kg bwt orally q. 8 h for the last 7 days of treatment (Takahashi et al. 2002). Phenytoin has perhaps been the drug most often administered to horses with PSH and, at least anecdotally, appears to be the most consistently effective. Phenytoin is a sodium channel blocker that has been suggested to modulate tetanic muscle contractions and aberrant nerve activity (Woodbury 1982). Oral administration of phenytoin at dosages of 15 mg/kg bwt q. 12 -24 h to horses with PSH \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd159 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2019generally result in a degree of clinical improvement while the drug is administered. Additionally, EMG recordings from the long digital extensor muscle indicate a reduction in abnormal spontaneous electrical activity in horses receiving phenytoin (Huntington et al. 1991; Takahashi et al. 2002). It has been suggested that the mild tranquillisation that often accompanies phenytoin administration might be responsible for amelioration of clinical signs and, for most horses, clinical deterioration occurs after cessation of treatment (Takahashi et al. 2002; Gardner et al. 2005; Domange et al. 2010). Variations in pharmacokinetics have been reported following both oral and i.v. administration and might explain the lack of efcacy in some horses (Soma et al. 2001). Given this variability, monitoring plasma concentrations is recommended particularly for long-term administration (Beech et al. 1988; Huntington et al. 1991; Soma et al. 2001). However, aside from mild sedation few if any adverse effects have been noted in horses administered phenytoin for extended periods (Takahashi et al. 2002; Domange et al. 2010). It is of course important to recognise that the administration of phenytoin (and other drugs) might be regulated in competitive animals. Miscellaneous treatments Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential cofactor in neuronal cell metabolism, neurotransmitter production and myelin synthesis (Puri 2014). It has been commonly used in the treatment of human peripheral neuropathies (Ang et al. 2008). Although there is little evidence to support any bene ts of administration in man, thiamine has been used with anecdotal reports of success in the treatment of PSH (Huntington et al. 1989; Domange et al. 2010). Taurine is a sulfur-containing compound with metabolic activity in many tissues including the mammalian nervous system, where it appears to modulate neuronal excitability (Birdsall 1998). In a small number of horses, taurine (10 g orally q. 24 h) appeared to have a quite dramatic and repeatable calming effect in horses with behavioural changes thought to be related to PSH (Domange et al. 2010). Antioxidants including tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and dimethyl sulfoxide have been administered to horses with PSH presumably to reduce oxidative injury to distal axons of the long nerves (Armengou et al. 2010). Other supplements recommended for the treatment of PSH include L-tryptophan, magnesium and potassium bromide for purported neuromodulatory effects. Mycotoxin binders have been promoted for both the prevention and treatment of PSH. There is little theoretical basis for many of these supplements and no scienti c evidence to support the use of any of them. Conclusions and future directions Despite continuing advances in diagnostic and analytical technologies, there are still many gaps in our understanding of PSH. The techniques used in some of the earlier landmark studies may have been insuf cient to detect the pathological lesions that would explain the clinical manifestation of PSH. The recent nding of cerebellar changes in horses with shivers suggests that the application of newer diagnostic techniques might also bear fruit in horses with PSH. The use of noninvasive technologies such as magnetic motor-evoked potentials to assess the function of descending motor tracts may provide further insight into horseswith PSH. Similarly, magnetic resonance imaging techniques may identify peripheral nervous system dysfunction. This modality is a well reported PNS imaging modality in humans. These potentially valuable techniques have not been commonly used in cases of PSH to date and may aid both diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. Targeted scrutiny of the neuromuscular relays (including muscle spindles) suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of the gait abnormality of PSH might also be rewarding. De nitive identi cation of a causative toxin and an understanding of the exposure required to cause disease would be a major advance in the management of grazing horses in high-risk pastures. The in vitro and laboratory animal studies evaluating extracts from (stressed) H. radicata appear promising and might provide sensible targets for a preventative strategy. However, until a de nitive lesion and/or toxic agent are identi ed, recommendations for the prevention and management of PSH must remain empirical. PSH is well known to occur in certain geographical regions and might even be restricted to speci c paddocks. Reducing known risk factors by improving poorer pastures with fertilisers and/or introduced grasses such that H. radicata and other weeds are out-competed would seem logical. Supplementary feeding to reduce reliance on grazing might be a useful strategy if horses cannot be moved to another paddock. Once the clinical signs of PSH develop, the affected horse almost certainly has a distal axonopathy of the longer nerves. A prolonged recovery period is required, although nearly all affected horses will eventually recover once removed from the offending pasture.

US-Corp-1800140 SEP-18KindredBio is proud to announce our educational partnership with AAEP Critically Appraised Topic In horses with liver disease, does histological evaluation of biopsies provide better prognostic information than results of blood tests? I. C. Johns B and W Equine Hospital, Breadstone, disease is commonly encountered in rst opinion and referral practice (Dunkel et al. 2015). Determining prognosis is key to managing client expectations as long-term treatment is often required. Biopsy results are traditionally thought to provide the best prognostic information, but the procedure is invasive and more expensive than blood tests (Durham et al. 2003b). The PICO question was designed to help determine whether biopsy is still recommended as the best prognostic test, based on the available evidence. PICO question In horses with liver disease, does histological evaluation of biopsies provide better prognostic information than results of blood tests? P: Patient Horses with liver disease. I: Intervention/indicator Histology of biopsies. C: Comparison intervention/control Blood tests. O: Outcome Accuracy in providing prognosis. Search method A PubMed search was performed using the terms: (equine or horse) AND (liver or hepatic) AND (prognosis OR outcome). The results were screened to identify studies which were relevant to the PICO question. Exclusions Papers older than 25 years, papers that did not relate to the PICO question (e.g. diagnosis of liver disease without investigation of prognosis); secondary sources of information (book chapters/review articles). Studies included One retrospective cohort study (Dunkel et al. 2015) compared serum bile acid (SBA) concentrations and a modi ed histopathological biopsy score for prediction of prognosis; one retrospective study (Durham et al. 2003a) assessed the utility of serum biochemical and haematological data in determining prognosis; one retrospective study(Durham et al. 2003b) developed a histopathological biopsy score and applied it retrospectively to horses with suspected liver disease to assess prognosis. Two retrospective case series (West 1996 and McGorum et al. 1999) compared concentrations of serum biochemical and haematological results between survivors and non-survivors. Summary of evidence Dunkel et al. 2015 A retrospective study compared serum bile acid (SBA) concentrations with histological score for prediction of short-term (survival to discharge) and long-term (survival greater than 6 months) prognosis in 81 horses with biopsy con rmed hepatic disease. In addition to the biopsy score developed by Durham et al. (2003b; see below), this study attempted to determine whether speci c histological changes that contribute to the biopsy score were related to prognosis. Overall, 90% of horses survived short term and 83% survived longer than 6 months. In comparison to horses that survived, those that did not survive had signi cantly higher SBA, globulin, brinogen and total bilirubin concentrations and lower lactate dehydrogenase and albumin concentrations. Sensitivity and speci city of SBA and biopsy scores are reported in Table 1 . As well as overall biopsy score, the presence of several pathological changes relating to both reversible (for example in flammation) and irreversible pathology (such as portal and bridging brosis) were associated with a poorer prognosis. Relevance to PICO question This is the only study that has directly compared blood values with histological evaluation of biopsy specimens. The authors concluded that histological score had a better speci city compared with SBA concentration. Durham et al. 2003a A retrospective study compared various serum biochemical and haematological data between survivors and non- survivors in 116 horses with liver disease. Serum biochemical and haematological results were categorised for statistical evaluation. Table 2 summarises the key differences between survivors and non-survivors. Although biopsy score was not speci cally compared ndings, identi ed a signi cantly increased risk of non- survival in horses with higher scores, in particular those with scores greater than 7/14. \u00a92017 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.12871Relevance to PICO question This study provides evidence that there is a signi cant difference between survivors and non-survivors for some haematological and biochemical parameters. Durham et al. 2003b A biopsy grading system was devised which included the presence or absence, as well as the severity of brosis, reversible and irreversible cytopathology, in flammation, proliferation. The grading system was retrospectively applied to 73 horses with a suspected hepatopathy and 12 normal horses, and a weighted score (0 -14) was then developed based on survival at 6 months. Comparison with other possible predictors of survival was not performed. Horses with total biopsy scores between 2 and 6 were 12 times less likely to survive to 6 months than horses with biopsy scores of 0 (hazard ratio 12.04; 95% CI 1.34 -107.81; P =0.026), and those with biopsy scores between 7 and 14 were 46 times less likely to survive (HR 46.01; 95% CI 5.92 -357.45; P <0.001). Relevance to PICO question This study provides evidence that by quantifying the severity of histological changes, a biopsy score can be utilised for prognostic purposes. The study population is likely to be relevant to modern equine practice in the UK, and the survival rate (in contrast to the two studies below) would also be consistent with cases currently seen in referral practice. Although blood results for this population were reported in the previous study, direct comparison of the utility of biopsy score vs. blood results is not possible with the information provided. McGorum et al. 1999 A retrospective case series reported clinicopathological ndings in 50 horses with hepatic disease, comparing values between survivors and non-survivors. A biopsy was obtained from 17/50 but histological ndings were not reported nor was outcome in these cases. In contrast with the previously reported studies, a higher mortality rate of 72% (36/50) was reported, with half the cases diagnosed with pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity. Signi cant differences between survivors and identi ed for: GGT, GLDH and SBA ( Table 3 ).Relevance to PICO question As biopsy results were not reported, comparison of their utility vs. blood results cannot be made. The types of liver disease and the high mortality rate would not be typical of most hepatic disease cases seen in equine practice today. Higher levels of hepatic/biliary enzyme activity and SBA were associated with a poorer prognosis. West 1996 A retrospective case series reported clinical and pathological ndings in 40 horses with hepatic disease. The horses were classi ed into those with necrosis (n neoplasia of the liver (n =5). Admission and serial (every 2 -3 days) changes in blood biochemistry were reported, and compared with the mean values of normal horses. Comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were not directly made, although the authors commented that in the hepatic necrosis group the values of SBA, GGT and glutamate dehydrogenase (GD) 'declined to normal on clinical recovery, whereas in the animals that subsequently died values remained high '. Survival rates for other groups were not suf ciently high to make comparisons. Relevance to PICO question As biopsy results were not reported, comparison of their utility vs. blood results cannot be made. The types of liver disease and the high mortality rate would not be typical of most hepatic disease cases seen in equine practice today. Clinical implications Although the level of evidence is not high, and all studies had obvious weaknesses, the populations studies in the more recent publications are likely to be relevant to both rst opinion and referral equine practice in the UK. Based on the available evidence, histological evaluation of hepatic biopsies provides better prognostic information than does the results of blood tests. Of the routinely performed blood tests, SBA concentration provides the best prognostic information.TABLE 1: Sensitivity and speci city of serum bile acid (SBA) and biopsy score for long-term survival.

J. Pickles .Dear Editor First, I would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of Dr Kirstie Pickles to our current understanding of trigeminal- mediated head shaking (TMHS) in horses. In response to the clinical commentary (Pickles 2019), there are a couple of points that are worthy of further discussion. When comparing the ef cacy of electroacupuncture (EA) and EquiPENS, the commentary states that 'given the longer length of the probe and closer approximation to the infraorbital nerve, greater nerve stimulation is likely to occur with EquiPENS compared with the d escribed electroacupuncture technique '. The current understanding is that the electric eld strength is highly concentrated at the needle or probe tip and decays rapidly with increasing distance from the tip (Boezaart 2006; Mayor 2007; Silva et al. 2012). It also depends whether the needle/probe is electrically insulated or uninsulated, as the electrical elds generated are quite different. With an insulated needle or probe, the current is only present in a sphere around the needle tip, thus the high current density means that a low threshold current is suf cient to stimulate the nerve. Uninsulated needles transmit the current throughout their entire length -maximum current density at the tip with a lesser zone extending up the shaft. Provided the tip of the needle is close to the nerve and the current intensity and pulse duration (pulse width) exceed the threshold intensity for the target nerve, the length of the needle or probe is unlikely to have any signi cant in fluence. The closer the stimulating electrode is to the nerve the lower the current intensity required for its excitation; stimulation of the nerve (as monitored by the muscle twitch due to the connections of the infraorbital nerve with the buccal branch of the facial nerve, Li et al. 2009) at a low current intensity con rms close positioning of the acupuncture needle tip to the nerve. This is possible without ultrasound guidance due to the super cial site of the readily palpable infraorbital nerve. Where ultrasound guidance would be helpful is to avoid the occasional occurrence when the needle touches or penetrates the nerve causing overstimulation, which is uncomfortable for the patient and requires a minor adjustment to the positioning of the needle tip. In human patients, the position of the needle tip near a sensory nerve is con rmed when the patient reports a radiating paraesthesia with each pulse in the distribution area of the nerve (Boezaart 2006), but this is not possible in a sedated horse. This author has performed further trials in equine patients using a more focused needling technique (Mayor 2007) with two needles positioned 2 -3 cm apart under a single infraorbital nerve rather than using the brachiocephalic muscle. These unpublished results suggest that this is no more effective than treatment with a single needle in horses that show a good response to treatment or those that do not respond. Similarly, placing one needle under the infraorbital nerve and the second needle close toa mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve rather than in the brachiocephalic muscle appears to give no further bene t. The second point to mention is that while I accept that some of the remission times quoted include the time when the horse would be expected to enter seasonal remission, only two of the six horses were known to be seasonal headshakers. This was made clear within the context of the paper and the accompanying graphs and table (Devereux 2019). One year on from the end of the study it can now be reported that the two horses (horses 2 and 3) that only required a single treatment in the spring of 2016 have not needed any treatment in 2017 and thus have entered longer- term remission following the EA treatment. It would appear that both EA and PENS are effective for the treatment of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in an encouraging proportion of cases and both have their place in different situations. The advantage of EA is that it can be performed in the eld without the use of ultrasound if this is not available, thus making the treatment accessible to a greater number of horses. The needle tip can be positioned in an optimum site to achieve maximum stimulation of the infraorbital nerve with little or no distress to the horse. Local anaesthetic needs to be used with care if used for insertion of the EquiPENS probe as local anaesthesia of the tissue being stimulated blocks acupuncture analgesia (Lindley and Cummings 2006). Hopefully, this correspondence will generate further interest and discussion to improve the treatment for this painful and distressing condition. S.
