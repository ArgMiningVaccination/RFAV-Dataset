WHAT IS NER? Naturopathic Emotional Release is a holistic method of psycho-emotional therapy. Created by Naturopath Karlie McKeand, Naturopathic Emotional Release empowers holistic practitioners to help clients process and release emotional blocks and stress-related issues. Naturopathic Emotional Release or NER is a tool to help identify and integrate underlying emotional blocks. These underlying emotions can contribute to disharmony in the body leading to symptoms or undesirable patterns or behaviours in the subconscious. The method is based on the findings that neuropeptides are released during times of stress, and can attach to receptors on the neurons and cells of tissues throughout the body. This mind and body connection explains why stored emotions may contribute to pain, illness and disease, and how clearing those emotional energies could provide potential benefits. Naturopathic Emotional Release combines touch, muscle response and subconscious memory recall to help clients of all ages tap into and release these emotions.

The Naturopathic Emotional Release Certification includes: What others are saying: For many years as a naturopath, I knew I needed to offer my clients more when supporting their emotional and mental health. After much research into different courses, I stumbled across Naturopathic Emotional Release and straight away felt drawn to it. I became a qualified NER practitioner in early 2021 and it has been the most rewarding journey not only for myself but to see the positive changes in my clients as well. I feel more confident within myself and my growth since studying and being mentored by Karlie has been life changing. Karlie is an amazing mentor with a wealth of knowledge and our weekly Mastermind calls are always valuable for the growth of my business. I love the simplicity of NER and how I can assess the mind-body not only with someone in my clinic but also virtually. I now run online group programs with NER and I'll never look back! Karlie is passionate about her craft and I'm so grateful to have her as my mentor. Rachael Fattore- Naturopath, NER practitioner, Metabolic Balance practitioner joined the NER Certification group after completing my NER training with Karlie. I originally joined to ensure I felt fully supported as I introduced and implemented NER into my practice. I didn't want NER to be just another course I didn't use. The NER certification enabled me to build my confidence as an NER practitioner whilst experiencing the benefits of it personally. Eighteen months later I have stayed in the certification group as NER has helped me tremendously with my own personal growth enabling the breaking of patterns and beliefs from a very young age. From a business perspective, it's enabled so much growth. As an example, my books are full, and my income has tripled since adding NER into my practice and life. Thanks Karlie!!! Kerryn Odell- Naturopath, NER practitioner, Metabolic Balance practitioner NER has been a game-changer for both myself and my clients. I love that I can now help my clients to address the underlying drivers of their issues. I particularly love having a tool that can help them right there and then in times of acute stress, anxiety and grief. To be able to address the reasons why clients aren't doing the things they need to do is amazing. I use NER with all my clients and couldn't imagine practising without out and receiving it regularly. Thanks Karlie, you rock! Rebecca Grant- Naturopath, NER practitioner, Metabolic Balance practitioner My mind is blown by the changes and expansions that have happened since I began working with Karlie and using NER. Over a fairly short period of time we have shifted so much that I hadn't even realised was holding me back and keeping me playing small. Karlie intuitively navigates each session into exactly what I need at the time, whether I know it or not! Some examples of the shifts have been: - Becoming confident in attracting the right clients and inviting them into my high end program. - Overcoming the overwhelm of expanding into learning and creating a new membership option. - Being OK with asking for help and outsourcing work where my time could be better spent. - Giving myself permission (and actually following through) on nourishing and nurturing myself with down time and self care. All of our sessions are filled with love, compassion and grace. If you are serious about up levelling yourself and your business, I can't recommend Karlie's NER business sessions highly enough. It's the most incredible and liberating investment in yourself you can make. Naturopathic Emotional Release (NER) has been both a game changer and a life changer for me. From the very first moment of being introduced to it, I realised I could use and implement this tool and therapy in every area of both my personal and professional life. Working professionally as a Naturopath with my patients, I can see and feel the potential of NER in every way. I have been able to see the changes, sometimes instantly, at other times the deeper layers of a person's life story start to lift and I can see the healing that takes place session after session. NER is both a safe and effective tool that can be used as a stand-alone treatment or as part of another wholistic therapy. It is often the first tool I use with both my patients and family & friends. Karlie is an amazing practitioner and the creator of this wonderful tool. She is always there to support us with our questions and has provided an exceptional learning environment for us as NER practitioners. If you're looking to take your practice to the next level and looking for that missing component of our training as health care providers then NER is for you. I can't recommend NER highly enough. Bronwyn Legg- Naturopath, NER practitioner I cannot recommend Karlie's NER Certification program highly enough. It has been a game changer for me, not only in my business where I can now get a deeper level of healing with my clients, but also personally. Karlie has guided me with infinite patience, as I have broken through so many emotional blocks whilst managing to integrate some deep-seated emotions that had been holding me back. Wendy Milligan - Naturopath, NER practitioner, Metabolic Balance practitioner Karlie's NER certification course has changed my out look on life in so many ways. NER allows me to help my clients achieve their health goals much sooner because we can also address any emotional ties preventing them moving forward in gaining a healthier lifestyle. Personally I have been able to use NER to improve my own health and move forward in my business. Karlie is amazing to work with. I am so blessed to have found her and NER Thank you Karlie for everything Naomi Quick- Naturopath, NER practitioner I had the pleasure of learning NER in Bali with Karlie which was amazing experience and one I highly recommend. So the next natural step was to do a 6-week NER business course to support my own challenges with my business, so I can get out of my own way and on with things in a positive productive way. It's been an amazing experience that is also a lot of fun. NER has been a great way to remove personal and business blocks and it's been an experience that has helped me to shift some unhelpful behaviours in business and even in life. As a bonus, it's also a great way to continue to learn and re-engage in NER skills which has helped me to utilise and polish up on my own practice, including distance NER via self-testing. Another Naturopath and I enjoyed it so much that we decided to extend our 6 weeks and we are now going almost 12 months! MASTERMIND WEEKLY CALL: BUST THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS BLOCKS WITH NER Are you ready to release the blocks that are holding you back and build a thriving practice? Not only can NER help you create amazing clients, but it can also transform your own success. You see other practitioners around you creating amazing offers and attracting their dream clients but your own business success seems to have stalled, no matter what you do. Remove Your Own Self-Sabotage With NER Unfortunately, practitioners are not immune to self-sabotage patterns! Mindset blocks around money, abundance and being of service are rife in the healthcare profession. We are told over and over again, 'being a naturopath will never pay well' or 'real healers don't get rich off their clients'. As a result, you might find yourself: - Avoiding prescribing supplements, or offering a cheaper option instead of the right supplement - Booking clients less frequently than what they need - Procrastinating on following up or calling people back - Turning down opportunities that could boost your visibility - Charging less than what you are worth. This is where Naturopathic Emotional Release can help. That's right - it's not just an amazing tool to use with your clients. You can also use NER to identify your own blocks around success, money and business so that you can get out of your own way. Using NER can specifically identify your own blocks that are affecting your business and money and help integrate them so you can achieve your dreams and business goals in an easier efficient way. I've seen firsthand what a massive impact NER can have on a practitioner's mindset, abundance and business success. Using NER can help you succeed in business by addressing blocks around: - Being visible as a health expert - Launching programs and products - Showing up on social media - Running group programs - Public speaking or being confident on a live video - Running an online business - Holding workshops or retreats - Attracting income goals and increasing your prices - Paying tax and GST - Bringing in more clients - Confidently prescribing supplements and rebooking clients Discover What NER Certification Can Do At A LIVE Workshop \"I absolutely LOVED NER! Karlie was such a passionate and patient presenter. Not only did I come away with a new skill set that I implemented on my very next clinic day, I also got to work through my own stuff. The workshop setting is relaxed, while Karlie provided assistance as we are working through the steps. I couldn't recommend this more highly. It was like my missing piece of the puzzle.\" \"I find the emotional story to health fascinating. I always say to my patients \"I need to get into your head, to the person behind the thoughts\". Well now I have this most AMAZING Naturopathic tool to do this even easier, and my clients have had life-changing results! And I have only just completed my course, so watch out world, I now have a way to find out the emotion behind your continued behaviour, pains in your body and all those bloody hang ups! Thank you Karlie, Bali was everything I hoped for a I completely recommend your NER course to all health professionals. \" \"I went into NER training not quite sure what to expect, and I found it to be really practical and it's been immediately applicable to my clinical practice. Karlie is an excellent facilitator and has a wealth of experience that she shares in a way that's supportive and easy to understand. I loved connecting with the other pracs in the training and because we were practising on each other we were releasing our own emotional blocks at the same time which was awesome. I now offer NER sessions as a stand alone consultation and clients really love it. I highly recommend this innovative technique and training.\" \"When I saw the NER training event coming up I knew that I wanted in, I wasn't totally sure what it was or how it worked but I was keen to give it a go. I was also looking for a point of difference as a practitioner and a way to further help my clients on an emotional level. NER has been easy to implement into naturopathic consultations and I'm so glad I now have this new skill, which helps uncover and shift some of the emotional roadblocks on the path to healing. Karlie is an amazing and practitioner and trainer and is truly passionate about NER. Her style of training made me feel calm and confident and I would totally recommend this course to any practitioner who wants integrate a new technique into their practice, allowing access and release of emotional roadblocks.\" \"I loved the NER training as a Bali immersion. It was an all-embracing and enjoyable experience. Initially I questioned whether I could justify it, but also knowing I had to do it. I came away with skills that I am using most days in clinic, quite a bit of personal emotional healing and a few days holiday that I desperately needed. Many of my clients need counselling support, which is not in my scope of practice but with NER I can provide the support they need. The Bali experience and the follow-up support has provided me with tools I am incorporating to clear emotional blocks for my clients. The results I am achieving could not have been possible with a 100% nutrition focus. I am enjoying getting more confident with my new skills and I would thoroughly recommend anyone who deals with clients with emotional issues (and who doesn't) to incorporate NER into their practice.\" Stay in Touch Join our NER Facebook Group Click through to the Naturopathic Emotional Release Facebook group.
