British journalist Brian Deer researched for seven years in order to prove that the study by Andrew Wakefield was not only misleading but was deliberately so. Brian Deer's research has confirmed that which was previously known about Wakefield's conduct of the study, says Professor Robert Booy. Professor Booy heads up the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance at West Mead Children's Hospital in Sydney. \"What Deer did was confirm a number of things we knew already. The General Medical Council in the UK found this man to be both dishonest and unethical. \"He looked further into and found more evidence that the research he (Wakefield) did was unreliable, unethical and dishonest.\" For example, says Professor Booy, \"Andrew Wakefield's claim that several of the children who had been exposed to MMR developed autism after the vaccination - within a week or two - was incorrect. \"Half of the children already had their symptoms before they were vaccinated.\" The study findings were published in the Lancet in 1998. Says Professor Booy, \"I wrote a letter along with colleagues to the Lancet saying 'This is very poor science and should not have been published.'\" In the years since, many researchers in Europe and the US have looked at vaccination. \"The evidence is totally in favour of the vaccination being safe,\" says Professor Booy. Lancet withdrew the article two years ago and most of the article's co-authors have also withdrawn their support, says Professor Booy. As well, Mr Wakefield have been struck off the medical list by the Medical Council. \"So it's been building up over time. But more evidence has come to light in the last few days and that underlines what we had thought and believed.\" The effect of the study was to lower immunisation rates, particularly in the UK and Ireland, says Professor Booy. \"It hardly had any impact in Australia, other than making parents worry and that's a problem in itself. \"But in the UK, in some parts of London, the immunisation rate went down to 70 per cent and then they had outbreaks of measles. Likewise in Ireland, in Dublin; these outbreaks affected very young children and several died as a consequence of measles who could otherwise have been immunised.\" Professor Booy himself first began researching autism 30 years ago as a medical student. \"Back then we knew very little. \"What we've learned in the last few years is that there is a strong genetic component which means that it's partially inherited but not completely and that it can run in the family. \"There may also be an environmental trigger - something else which the child is exposed to that may make it come on. \"But certainly, the genetic element has come to the fore from several very high quality studies in the last few years.\" Despite the facts and findings, Andrew Wakefield has \"come out fighting and defending himself\", says Professor Booy. \"He's a very charismatic person who I first heard speak way back in 1996.\" At the time, Robert Booy was impressed, he says. His boss, however, thought otherwise. \"He said, 'No, he's a loony.' And I couldn't see it at the time.\" Andrew Wakefield has gone on believing in himself, despite all the evidence being against him, Professor Booy feels. \"I think he's got a fixed delusion about his own work. He can't change his mind now because he's so fixed in his position - to change his mind now would make him look "}
