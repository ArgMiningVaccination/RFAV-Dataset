They spot so many mistakes- though I am grateful for their constructivecriticism aimed at making me a good doctor.To take their advice on board, I must have ahumble and willing heart to learn. Humility is vital not only in medicine, but also in the Christian life (Philippians 2:3-11). The past yearhas been a rocky one for my faith. But each time I surrendered myself to God, he made hissustaining grace known to me in a real way. At times I wondered if I was alone in my doubts,so I appreciate Jason Roach's reminder thatongoing repentance is normal and necessary in the Christian life (pp23-26). He urges us toconsider whether we are trusting in Jesus who died for us, rather than in worthless idols. God calls us to humility, but warns us against gullibility. Even among our church leaders, Jesus warns us to 'Watch out for false prophets.They come to you in sheep's clothing, butinwardly they are ferocious wolves.' (Matthew 7:15) We must test all teaching ( Nucleus articles included!) against the Bible that is given us by theLord - who is our ultimate authority. As such, Si\u00f4nGlaze's article, about applying the teaching of theEpistles correctly (pp38-39), is an important one.We need great discernment outside church walls too, when engaging with the world. Today'ssociety believes the myth of secular neutrality.Alex Bunn convincingly debunks that myth byexplaining how everybody (not only Christians)sees life through a certain perspective, and that medicine is strewn with moral judgments (pp32-37). Worldviews also affect the conduct andpresentation of medical research. To complementour evidence-based medicine training, we need a values-based approach (pp27-31). If you are still not convinced that personal values matter, consider how Barack Obama is changingthe world (pp14-22). Andr\u00e9 Van Mol writes hisanalysis from the perspective of a US-basedChristian doctor. In the face of the generalmedia's unbridled enthusiasm, his critique ofObama's policies is a sobering one, in particular,the implications for medical ethics.

The editor's address remains nucleus@cmf.org.uk , though your comments will go to Pete Mackley(editor-elect) as this is my goodbye. I am sograteful for the privilege of serving, and what I learnt from Mark Pickering (former managingeditor). I thank the production team, editorialcommittee, reviewers, authors - and you readers.After three years as editor, I look forward tospending more time on the front line, putting into practice what I have been writing about. Hugh Ip 4 nucleus easter '09It's in the early hours of the morning in mid January. I'mstanding in a cholera camp in the town of Kadoma, 140kmsouth-west of Harare (thecapital). As I look around, myeyes widen taking in the sights.People are everywhere: beds,benches, floor and wheelbarrows.Sunken eyes look up at me, as I gaze at the endless line of IVdrips. The stench of chlorinelingers in my nose; vomit anddiarrhoea stain the floor. Thecamp, with a capacity of 200, is overwhelmed by 700 people. Walking amongst the hastily erected tents is a team ofnurses, doctors and medicalstudents. They are changing IVdrips, giving oral rehydrationsolution, as well as cleaning up the vomit and diarrhoea. One student is praying for aparticularly sick elderly man,and as I turn around a sevenyear old child is carried in. Helooks about four, malnourishedand barely breathing; a cannulais sited and we pray that hemight live. Those first five minutes in the cholera camp moved andchallenged me in a way I couldnot imagine. Amidst the stenchof death, a group of Christiandoctors, nurses and medical students are risking their ownhealth and giving their time,bringing life and hope, andseeing God do amazing things. from England to Zimbabwe Three weeks ago, I was considering what I'd just readon the CMF website whiledriving home from work. 1 Zimbabwe is in crisis: crippledby massive inflation andpolitical infighting, 2most hospitals and the medicalschool have been closed for the last four months. In the fewclinics that remain open, thereis a lack of even basic drugs.Nurses are earning US $0.10 a month in a country wheretransport costs are US $40 per month.Now cholera is sweeping the country. The outbreak started in August 2008, but acceleratedin early December (start of therainy season) due to a numberof factors, including poorsanitation and a lack of safedrinking water. Almost 88,000people have contracted thedisease, with close to 4,000deaths. 3Every province has been affected and what remainsof the health system has longbeen overwhelmed. 4cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe John Greenall writes an eyewitness account 5 nucleus easter '09cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe The website appeal is straightforward - 'pray and actnow, Zimbabwe is bleeding'. As Iprayed, I wondered what I coulddo. I realised that God wastelling me to go, to encouragethe workers on the field, raiseawareness of the problem, andreport back on rumours ofsome incredible things that God has been doing. So afterdiscussion with my clinicalsupervisor, rearranging myannual leave, hurried emails,and a cholera vaccination - I was on the plane. joining Celebration Health I visited the health wing of Harare church CelebrationMinistries International,Celebration Health. 4On seeing the devastating choleraoutbreak, it acted swiftly toraise funds from partnersincluding CMF a students. Over7,000 patients have beentreated in just seven weeks,with a death rate under 1%,according to Dr Andrew Reid (ofthe Celebration Healthleadership team).The work is not confined to one location. CelebrationHealth performs regularreconnaissance missions to rural areas investigatingpossible outbreaks, sometimesleaving team members tocoordinate a response. Theserural areas are particularlydifficult to manage, given thethin spread of the populationover large distances; deathrates due aretherefore higher. also involved; churchmembers help to build thecamps and educate thecommunity, while choirs sing in the camps. students and junior doctors lead the way The medical students (part of CMF Zimbabwe) have beenpraying together regularly overthe last few years. They havealso led health educationprogrammes in schools and hospitals in Harare. Forexample, a fourth year medicalstudent (who leads the healtheducation team) teaches thelocal community how to preventthe spread of cholera. Theyestimate that over 10,000people have been reached by her team's communityprogrammes. Celebration Health is sharing the gospel and seeing manycome to Christ. In each areawhere they have worked, a church or cell group hasstarted. Conversions evenhappen amongst teammembers; volunteer doctorsand nurses come onto the fieldand God so touches them thatthey are born again and beginto undergo discipleship. Thework is, however, tough andthey are obviously tired. Yet oneof the students said to me: 'Godis not a God who stands back Operation Outstretched Hand Celebration Health has sent in a total of 19 teams. Each team usually comprises five doctors, twelve nurses, four pharmacists, two logisticians, a driver and a caterer (though thelargest team consisted of 85 people). Eight teams were ready tobe deployed at any time. Celebration Health is now one of thelargest providers of cholera care in Zimbabwe due to this largepool of volunteers. They work in partnership with otherorganisations including Medecins Sans Frontieres, UNICEF, WHO,as well as the local health authority and the Ministry of Health.6 nucleus easter '09cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe and watches...Jesus is in that cholera camp, amongst thevomit and the diarrhoea, full ofcompassion for these people. I asked myself where Jesuswould be at Christmas and I knew he would be here, so I wanted to be here too.' The scale of the problem can seem overwhelming. One areaof a local town (home to 20,000residents) has no clean wateravailable and the sewagesystem is not functioning.During my visit, I saw that thepublic toilets were two feetdeep in faeces, with a writhingmass of maggots - and still inuse. Adults were gettingdrinking water from brokenpipes that well up amongstsewage; children were playingball in the sewage, as well aseating fruit with dirty hands.The community has lived likethis for seven years. It hasgotten so used to living in thesewage that the people do notseem sad. On the contrary,many smile and the childrenplay happily. As I walked alongside rivers of sewage, I was reminded that inheaven there are rivers of livingwater running through thestreets. 5The Celebration Health team have seen that God wantsthem to be agents ofreformation in this town and throughout Zimbabwe; theylong to see living waterprovided for these people now. This will involve rebuildinginfrastructure and changingbehaviour. biblical truths come alive In a country with so much need, biblical truths seem to comealive. One doctor said that theyare ministering to Jesus himselfwhen they help those strickenby the cholera crisis. Jesus willsay to those who have lived inobedience to him: 'For I was hungry and you gaveme something to eat, I wasthirsty and you gave mesomething to drink, I was astranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you lookedafter me, I was in prison and youcame to visit me.' \"Then therighteous will answer him, 'Lord,when did we see you hungry andfeed you, or thirsty and give yousomething to drink? When did wesee you a stranger and invite youin, or needing clothes and clotheyou? When did we see you sickor in prison and go to visit you?'\"The King will reply, 'I tell you thetruth, whatever you did for oneof the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' 6 Right: Disinfecting cholera beds Below: John (third from right) shares a meal with the team7 nucleus easter '09cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe Most importantly, Celebration Health has always beenunderpinned by prayer. They are taking God at his word andseeing that God's answer to thesituation comes through them.It really hit home to me thatwhen the Bible speaks of ourGod being a God of compassion, 7 justice,8and concern for the weak9- that God acts in these ways through us. As part of God's kingdom on earth, we are the means by which hiskingdom comes to those aroundus. God's love, compassion,justice and mercy are beingdemonstrated powerfully inZimbabwe through this team ofmen and women. The studentshave stepped up to thechallenge and they are leadingsomething big. Their vision,maturity and leadership skillsare developing rapidly. Theirdream is big; their prayers are fervent, and these arebeginning to be answered. ask what you can do It is tempting for us to feel 'I'm just a student, I couldn't beinvolved in anything as big asthis', and yet these Zimbabweanstudents inspire us to getinvolved. So what can you do?You can pray both for thesituation in Zimbabwe and alsofor the students over there with uncertain futures, that theywould know God's leading intheir lives. You can givefinancially - the CMF appeal hasnow closed, having reached thetarget of \u00a330,000 (for IV fluids,giving sets, needles, soap andgloves amongst other things),but the Archbishops' Appeal is open. 10 And, like the students inZimbabwe, you can be open toGod calling you to somethingfar bigger than you everimagined. Will you lift your eyesup, dream big, and ask God tohelp you believe that he mayuse you to achieve theimpossible? After all, his Wordsays that we can do anythingthrough him. 11Who can you reach out to? What needs existin your home country or townor street - homelessness,deprived populations, a lack ofhealth education? As medicalstudents and doctors we have a key role to play for 'the leastof these'. 12 The Celebration Health teamwould often sing one particularsong. I pray that it will be your prayer as you recommityourself to sacrificially servingour all-powerful God:Lord I answer to your call To go where others dare not go To press on ahead and never look behind. Though the road may not be easy, It always hurts to sacrifice But I'm ready Lord to pay the final price. There's a new great horizon just waiting there for me, If I only trust in God and just believe. I won't give what cost me nothing; you're far too precious Lord for me. Thank you for your mercy, Thank you for your love, Thank you for choosing, using me.

Matthew 25:40 8 nucleus easter '09In the midst of stressful exams and hectic wardrounds, it is easy to forget where we are heading. Over 400medical students from aroundthe UK (and abroad) arrived inDerbyshire for the annualnational student conferencefrom 13-15th February. We werethere to learn about living inthe light of tomorrow. Reading from Revelation, Steve Brady (Principal of MoorlandsBible College) outlined God'splan to renew and restorecreation. In his first Bibleaddress (Revelation 1:9-20), he described how the apostleJohn was exiled to the island ofPatmos by the Romans for hisfaith. Jesus reassured him inthis difficult time, 'Do not beafraid. I am the First and theLast. I am the Living One; I wasdead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever!' 1 We were reminded of Jesus'character and authority. Hisbeauty, humility and mercyshould shape our response tohis majesty. Jesus' eyes are 'like blazing fire'; 2he sees us as we truly are so he cannot bedisillusioned with us. We can be comforted that our destiny is in the safest hands, becausewe belong to a personal and loving God. In Brady's second Bible address, he focused on the 'Battle of theAges'. The imagery of Revelation12-14 illustrates the battle(between good and evil) thatbegan at the Fall, still beingplayed out in heaven and onearth. Living between thecrucifixion and Jesus' secondcoming, we will encounterspiritual battles at medicalschool, because we are made inGod's image. The devil wishes todestroy that image, dehuman-ising us, but we can overcomehim 'by the blood of the Lamb'. 3 Brady's third Bible address(Revelation 21-22) looked aheadto the new creation. There willbe continuity and change. It will be a community providingsecurity, full of purity,illuminated by God. We can lookforward to a place where thetree of life will provide truehealing for all the nations; ourGod will make everything new! tackling diverse issues It was difficult to choose between the exciting seminarsranging from church history todrug addiction. Having just completed an obstetrics andgynaecology placement, I foundTamie Downes' seminar onabortion particularly useful. Sheexplained the current methods ofabortion, and the relevant laws.In groups, we examined what theBible says about when human lifebegins and how its value isderived from God. The discussion,about our duties as healthcareworkers, convinced me of theneed to ensure that patientsmake an informed choice. What about the spiritual aspect to health? Is there ever a need toexplore this during history-takingto determine the cause of illness?In the psychiatry seminar, welooked at what the Bible saysabout how mental disorderspresent, and the issue ofdemonisation. Richard Dawkins certainly does not believe in demons. DavidRobertson (church minister anduniversity chaplain in Dundee) ledan interesting discussion aboutDawkins' book The God Delusion . We questioned: why atheism has become the new religion,whether faith is reasonable andcompatible with science, as well as how we can sensitivelychallenge these issues.living in the light of tomorrow Libby Maskrey learnt more than she could imaginenucleus easter '09in the light of tomorrow - conference reportin the light of tomorrow - conference report Sensitivity is certainly needed when we talk about sex. How yousee its function and meaningdepends on your worldview -whether you follow in thefootsteps of philosophers andethicists (past and present) orGod's eternal Word. 'Sex and theMaker's was thetitle of CMF Chairman Trevor Stammers' conference address.He challenged us to consider theimplications of biblical teachingfor our own lives, and how todeal with the consequences ofsex in society. Crucially, God'slove is manifested most clearlyin the cross - not in erotic love.totally worthwhile! I arrived at conference tired, unmotivated andshivering from the cold. I left having learnt morethan I thought possibleabout the majesty ofGod, the ongoingspiritual battle in ourpersonal lives and themedical world, as well as our hope in the newcreation!

The student conference committee (SCC) stayed up all night until Saturday 6am, folding sheets ofcoloured paper... so every woman woke up onValentine's Day to find an origami flower outsideher room, with an inscription reminding them of God's love, 'Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens'. 4 Those with energy to burn had Saturdayafternoon to play badminton and football, or walk in the picturesque grounds, while othersbrowsed bargains in the bookshop. The eveningentertainment options included: the UniversityChallenge quiz, a lively Ceilidh, a Bladerunner film showing and discussion, the praise concert, orjust relaxing with friends from review groups(where we discussed the main talks). Some of us got to meet the international students who arrived after their Londonpreconference. Many of them overcame greathurdles, by God's grace, to attend. We also heardabout God's work in UK medical schools in themorning praise and prayer sessions, and duringthe annual general meeting. 10 nucleus easter '09nurse suspended for offering prayer to patient A 45 year old community nurse was suspended in December 2008 simply for offering to pray for apatient. Caroline Petrie, a committed Christian, hadfinished attending to the patient's dressings at herhome. The patient politely refused and was notoffended, but mentioned the incident to anothernurse in passing. Petrie was subsequentlysuspended. However, after much publicity andoverwhelming public support, she was soonreinstated by North Somerset Primary Care Trust. Petrie's case comes amidst the recent Department of Health publication of Religion or belief: a practical guide for the NHS . It contains much that is useful and welcome, but Christians may have concernsabout the potential implications of certain sections.This may be a timely call to vigilance regarding the freedom to live out our faith in the NHS.( telegraph.co.uk 2009; 7 February, 2 February, cmf.org.uk 2009; January) global conflict zones More than 20 conflicts are currently taking placearound the world. Of these, seven conflicts are eachcausing over 1,000 violent deaths per year. Mosttopical of the 'minor' conflicts (causing fewerfatalities) has been the resumption of sectariankillings in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the UK hasbeen involved in wars for most of the last decade atleast, including Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. One lesser known conflict is the Mexican drug war. Since 2006, it has led to around 10,000 deaths, 6,268of them in 2008. For the most significant conflicts,look to Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. Theseinclude the two 'war on terror' fronts in Iraq andAfghanistan; the Israeli - Palestinian conflict; civilwars in Sri Lanka, Somalia, Congo and Sudan; as well as the ongoing standoff between nuclear powersIndia and Pakistan over Kashmir. The civil war in Congo alone has claimed an estimated three to four million lives (more than anyother conflict since World War Two). Most are fromdisease, malnutrition and the collapse of healthservices rather than actual violence - therein lies the great health challenge that wars present: notjust the initial death toll (in places like Gaza andnorthern Sri Lanka), but the need to stem deathsfrom waterborne illnesses , malnutrition, and lack of medical care (eg obstetric). However, that doesnot begin to cover the long-term mental healthproblems of people who have seen friends, familyand whole communities slaughtered around them. Few organisations are equipped to respond to these sorts of crises. High profile groups, like the RedCross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, enter acutesituations, but gaps post-conflictreconstruction lulls in fighting. Medair is aChristian organisation that specialises in long termhealth and relief projects to help restore suchtraumatised communities. Nevertheless, aid organisations can only operate with the blessing of the government in the conflictzone. In Sudan, 13 international aid groups wererecently expelled by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. They deny his allegations of aiding theInternational Criminal Court, which recently issuedan arrest warrant for Bashir, holding him responsiblefor atrocities in Darfur. Reuters reports: He wanted foreign aid groups to stop distributing aid in Sudan within a year... If carried out, the orderwill also create a dilemma for international donors,including the governments of the United States andnews review 111 nucleus easter '09Britain, over whether they will be able to continue to pour millions into projects across theunderdeveloped country without full control over how their aid is distributed. The stakes for justice have been raised. If theinternational community (eg United Nations (UN)and African Union) does not act soon, civiliansstand to suffer more. 300,000 lives have alreadybeen lost and 2.75 million displaced from homes.( reuters.com 2009; 16 March, Economist 2009; 7 March, wikipedia.org 2009; March, globalsecurity.org 2009; March) rape - a weapon of war Civilians in conflicts worldwide are beingsubjected to sexual, as well as physical, violence.Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Darfur are some of thecountries that have witnessed mass rape of men,women and children. In a recent report by MSF inDarfur, nearly 300 women attended a health clinicin a five-month period having been raped, a thirdby more than one individual. The number ofwomen raped is probably about 15 times higherthan the 300 who attended the clinic. Many rapedindividuals were cast out from their families oreven jailed by the police for having illegalpregnancies (unmarried women can be prosecutedfor falling pregnant under Sudanese law). Doctors and counsellors report being overwhelmed by the number of victims. New UN resolutionsrequire more frequent updates on the fate of womenand children in war. However, victims are nowspeaking out and trials are taking place. An arrestwarrant (including charges of rape) was recentlyissued for the Sudanese president. It is the braveryof victims that is slowly bringing perpetrators tojustice; that cannot happen a moment too soon.( economist.com 2009; 19 February, news.bbc.co.uk2009; 4 March, doctorswithoutborders.org 2005, globalization101.org 2006; 12 December) assisted dying update Should doctors be required to assist the deaths oftheir patients? There is much action in Westminster,and Scotland where health matters are devolved. Margo MacDonald, Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has Parkinson's disease. Shewants to change Scottish law to legalise voluntaryeuthanasia and physician assisted suicide, and hasbeen holding a consultation. Her proposed bill needs18 signatures (from the 129 MSPs) to be debated. If it were, the lengthy consideration needed would becompleted before the next Scottish election in 2011. In the UK Appeal Court, multiple sclerosis patient Debbie Purdy was refused any guarantee that herhusband would not be prosecuted for assistingher suicide if he were to accompany her to theDignitas facility in Switzerland. The UK Coroners and Justice Bill includes a brief and laudable attempt to update the law on assistingsuicide by changing the 1961 language of 'aid, abet,procure, counsel' to that of 'encourage or assist', to stop internet-inspired suicide clusters (eg inBridgend, South Wales). We anticipate a last-minuteamendment so that British relatives going toDignitas could not be prosecuted. This might seemmoderate, but it would establish a principle in UK law and launch us down a slippery slope.( carenotkilling.org.uk 2009, www.cmf.org.uk 2009) cheaper drugs for poor countries GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has promised to cap drugcosts for the world's 50 poorest countries at aquarter of their US and European prices. In addition,Andrew Witty, GSK's new chief executive, will reinvestnews review 212 nucleus easter '0920% of the company's developing world profits into upgrading local health care infrastructure (egimproving clinics, drug distribution and training).GSK also renewed its commitment to research intoneglected tropical diseases. The price cap entails a sacrifice of five million pounds in annual sales, though shareholders will bereassured that this is a small proportion of GSK'stotal revenues of \u00a322.7 billion (2007). The Lancet estimates that 'the money to be reinvested locallywill be less than overall profits.' DespiteWitty's generosity, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)criticises the company for not sharing its HIVpatents with other researchers. 'Other companies have taken some similar steps to stimulate research and strengthen healthinfrastructure - for example, Pfizer in Bangladesh',reports BMJ.

Chantelle (the mother) is reported to havehad numerous other boyfriends, so the fatherhoodof baby Maisie is in question. Their story is anothermilestone in the disintegration of our society'smoral stance on sex outside marriage. Journalist Melanie Phillips criticises the opposition against anything that may be remotely perceived as moralising or passing judgment. Those who urgeself-restraint and behavioural boundaries aredismissed as out of touch with reality. Alfie andChantelle demonstrate that children are not mini-adults capable of responsible and well-informeddecisions, but they are not alone. There were 8,196 pregnancies among girls under 16(legal age of consent) in 2007, compared with 7,826 in 2006. The government is likely to miss its targetof halving teenage pregnancies amongst girls under18 by next year. 'The Government's teenage pregnancy strategy has been a disaster for young people... The expansion ofconfidential contraceptive services for young peopleunder the age of 16 is making it more difficult forgirls to resist the advances of their boyfriends and is giving the green light for boys to pressurise girlsinto sexual activity', said Norman Wells, director ofthe Trust. ( 2009; 26 February, telegraph.co.uk 2009; 17 February, dailymail.co.uk 2009; 16 February) let down by hybrid embryo hype Due to a shortage of human ova for embryonic stemcell research, animal-human hybrid embryos wereportrayed as vital to finding cures for conditions likeAlzheimer's disease. Recent research cast seriousdoubt on this assertion from last year's HumanFertilisation and Embryology Bill debate. Scientists inserted human DNA into egg cells from cows, mice and rabbits. But the hybrid embryos didnot correctly express genes vital for pluripotency(capacity to develop into different cell types). 'For those trained in the science, this is not news, but instead a completed fate that was known fromthe beginning', commented leading US stem cellscientist James Sherley. Sir Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly the sheep, moved from animal-hybrid embryosin favour of induced pluripotent stem cells. Theseadult stem cells, 'made to act like embryonic ones',avoid compromising human dignity. Funding has also been a problem in the UK.

Transsexual children should be given puberty- blockers from the age of twelve, say controversialdraft guidelines from the International EndocrineSociety. Preventing early pubertal changes wouldgive children, who express a wish to change sex,time to make a decision. The guidelines come amid news of the world's youngest person to undergo a successful sexchange. Kim Petras began treatment (in Germanyunder national health insurance) with hormonereplacement therapy at the age of twelve,completing it with gender reassignment surgery at the legal age of 16. Puberty-blocking treatment for this indication has not been approved in the UK for under-16s, althoughit is offered by some clinics in Canada, Australia,Germany and the US. Some doctors believe thatchildren do not have the emotional maturity orunderstanding to make such a permanent lifechanging decision. Also, little is known about thelong term affects of puberty-blockers if patientswere to change their mind about therapy. Someteenagers with such feelings may find pubertyrepellent if they believe they are becoming thewrong sex. However studies show that 80% of boyswho experience transsexual feelings as childrenchange their mind in adulthood. ( newscientist.com2008; 10 December, dailymail.co.uk 2009; 5 February) non-invasive fetal tests - coming soon The NHS should prepare for advances in non- invasive fetal DNA tests, recommends theFoundation for Genomics and Population Health.With no risk of miscarriage, these are safer than current invasive methods (such asamniocentesis), and can be used much earlier inpregnancy. The technology uses cell-free fetalDNA in maternal blood. They can potentiallydetect Y chromosomes for those at risk of sex-linked disease, or an abnormal ratio ofchromosomes (eg Down's syndrome). A working group from the Foundation examined ethical and social issues raised; particularly thepotential for sex selective abortions anddetermining paternity. They concluded,'Implementation of non-invasive prenatal diagnosisfor clinically significant genetic disorders isdesirable, both to improve the quality andmanagement of antenatal care and to facilitateparental reproductive choice.' Nevertheless, thegreater ease with which abnormalities can bedetected - and embryos discarded - is concerningfor those who believe life to begin at conception. The report recommends education of the public and healthcare professionals, to ensure that individualsare adequately informed. It cautions the NHS toensure that the tests are thoroughly evaluated forreliability and effectiveness, as well as calling forauditing processes and best practice guidelines. Will these be enough?

His political convictions are starkly drawn: of 100 USsenators, his was the mostliberal voting record of any. 1 Obama's promise to reach acrossthe political aisle is inviolable; hewas at the leftward extreme ofthe Senate, thus making a policycompromise with anyone else a de facto move to the right. Obama has professed Christianity for around 20 years.His home congregation wasChicago's Trinity United Churchof Christ (belonging to aprofoundly liberaldenomination). Its pastor isJeremiah Wright, whoseincendiary comments and black-identity views broughtwidespread publicity, little of it flattering. 2a time for change? President Bush left office with adismal one third approval rating. 4 His post-9/11 favour steadilyeroded over time due to negativeperceptions and imageryassociated with: the Iraq war, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Baydetention camp, the Patriot Act,the Homeland Security Act, wiretaps, hurricane Katrina, VicePresident Cheney, DefenseSecretary Rumsfeld, the WallStreet meltdown, and thebanking crisis among othercontroversies. Whichever ofthese names rings familiar, the general public's esteem of it will be poor.On the other hand, some (like Sir Bob Geldof) have expressedfrustration at the lack ofrecognition for Bush's landmarkinitiatives. 5He oversaw a vast expansion of non-militarygovernment spending.Prescription drug coverage wasprovided for 32 million Medicarerecipients at a cost of $40billion in 2008. 6Likewise, the Bush team carried out the mostsweeping overhaul of US foreignaid infrastructure in 40 years. 7 His administration: nIntroduced the President'sEmergency Plan for AIDSRelief (PEPFAR) 8 nProvided a third of allsupport for the Global Fund the US political landscape The US has two main political entities: nThe Democratic party is thought of as left-leaning or liberal, statist (desiring a larger government role in things), unionfriendly, taxation supportive, non-traditional on social issues,and often self-identifies as 'progressive'. nThe Republican party is considered right-leaning or conservative, favouring limited government, lower taxation,free-trade/capitalism, traditionalism on social issues,preference for private sector initiative over governmentprograms, and support for the military. Extremists, moderates, contrariants (those who do the opposite of expectations) and the apathetic exist in the two, as does adegree of overlap on any given issue. Their comparison to theLabour and Tory parties is reasonably useful.16 nucleus easter '09Obama: change for good? to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria5 nContributed half of all foodaid to Africa 5 nBegan a $350 million fund to fight neglected tropicaldiseases 9 nLaunched the MillenniumChallenge Corporation toreward poor nations andeconomic freedom 10 nTwice continuedauthorisation to allow tax-free imports to the US market 11 As commander-in-chief of theworld's largest military, Bush,like his predecessors, did nothesitate to exercise the globalreach of American armed forcesfor disaster relief on manyoccasions (as he did withinhours of the Asian tsunami). Bush's vibrant pro-life ethics were well known. He prohibitedgovernment funding ofembryonic stem cell (ESC)research on lines developedafter 2001, but did not ban ESCresearch, 12contrary to mistaken media reports. In 2003, hesigned into law the Partial-BirthAbortion Ban Act and theTrafficking Victims ProtectionReauthorization Act. Hisadministration stronglychampioned rights ofconscience. In 2001, restored the 'Mexico City policy' ofrefusing US government fundingfor overseas family planninggroups that provide or counselfor abortions. changing of the guard The 'Mexico City policy' was reversed by Obama as one ofhis first reforms. A national pollexposed this decision as his meet the US and its government Our constitutional separation of powers between government branches (executive, legislative, and judicial) is designed to ensure checks and balances. Americans inherently distrustgovernment agencies with even the appearance of excessiveauthority. As reflected on our currency and in our national pledgeof allegiance, this 'one nation under God' is the one mostinfluenced by biblical Christianity. It is also the most ethnicallydiverse, aspiring to the national motto of 'E Pluribus Unum' 3 ('Out of many, one'). Even with the wide swing of leadership, the transition from the Bush administration to that of Obama'swas carried out peacefully, as is our long tradition. Though a left-of-centre president was elected, we remain a solidly right-of-centre nation. Nonetheless, a cultural war has been afootfor decades - liberal versus conservative; secular versus believing;and it only heats up with time. Obama's leftist supporters expectvast policy, legal, and - ultimately - cultural transition. For example, gay marriage is a consistent loser at state ballot boxes (even here in my liberal California), but it is advancedthrough activist judges and courts. The left looks for Obama to nominate liberal Supreme Court justices, with similarappointments anticipated for lower positions in the judiciary. If the highest court becomes leftward stacked, new options forchange would manifest that might not otherwise be feasiblestrictly democratically. Though Democrats now hold largemajorities in both the House and Senate (the government'slegislative bodies), a number are at least as conservative as theirRepublican counterparts and could side with them on economicand social issues, so not all is as it seems.Obama: change for good? least popular so far, with a 58% disapproval rating.13He will attempt to do precisely what he promised regarding medicalethics, health care provision,and research - namely drivethrough the most radical policychanges in memory. Obama isalready using executive ordersto speed his agenda; includingputting a hold on Bush's end-of-term orders until his teamreviews them. Obama has been a supporter of abortion on demand. 14In 2003, he voted against the Born AliveInfants bill 15(patterned after a 2001 federal bill protectingbabies who survived abortions,entitling them to medical carerather than disposal). How farwill he go? Will he mandatethat insurance planspay the ban onlate-term abortions,remove fetalcoverage from the Children's Health Insurance Program, andreverse state laws eitherlimiting abortions or requiringwaiting periods or parentalnotification? 16 He asserted last year that hewould sign the Freedom ofChoice Act (FOCA) designed toremove most impediments toabortion on demand. But evenin a Democrat-controlledCongress he is unlikely togarner the necessary votes.Pro-life groups considerdefeating FOCA their firstpriority, and eagerly welcome a vigorous public debate to expose its extremist implications (such as listed in the previous paragraph) which will assure loss of public support. 16,17,18The pressure from the far left on Obamaaggressively to liberalise abortion-related laws will be relentless. 'Keep abortion safe and legal' is a motto of the pro-abortionlobby, but its safety is nowbeing questioned. It is afunctionally unregulatedindustry, with abortion clinicsexempt from many of theextensive federal regulationsgoverning outpatient surgicalcentres. A Kansas PlannedParenthood abortion clinic is facing 107 criminal countsbased on confidential review ofonly 29 patient records, while alate-term abortion provider inKansas is under investigationfor alleged malpractice. 19,20 May Obama soon ascertain the dangers of abortion. 21,22 attacking rights of conscience Prior to leaving the White House, the Bush administration finalisedregulations enforcing existinglaws 23protecting medical practitioners' rights of conscience, including penalties against entities which coerce employees to comply with treatments (such as abortion) against their will. The Obama team is 17 nucleus easter '0918 nucleus easter '09already planning to reverse these.24 Erosion of protection for conscientious objection would be deeply compromising for bioethics, a field with a Christian origin birthed toprotect human dignity. 25 Exposing healthcare providers to prosecution for non-complicity with procedures they deem unethical or immoral guarantees a Supreme Courtchallenge, whilst inviting a massexodus from obstetrics and gynaecology, family medicine, and paediatrics for pro-life physiciansand medical students. The ensuing provider shortage would be crippling, considering the US is one-third evangelical. 26 stem cell research Obama supports federal funding for ESC research.27The public and press share misconceptions regarding ESC versus adult stem cell (ASC) research results. Every one of more than 80 stem cell treatments benefitinghumans has come from ASCs and their corollaries fromplacental, umbilical, amnioticfluid and other sources.With the advent of inducedpluripotent stem cells (humanadult stem cells reprogrammedto an embryonic-like state) in2007, the full potential of stemcell therapy may well berealised without the sacrifice ofanother embryo. Sir Ian Wilmut(University of Edinburgh), ofDolly the sheep fame, is walkingaway from the cloningtechnology he created in favourof the new directreprogramming method. NobelPrize winner Sir Martin Evansconcurs, 'This will be the long-term solution'. 28'Even a scientist who cares not a whitabout the morality of embryodestruction will adopt thistechnique because it is sosimple and powerful. Theembryonic stem cell debate isover,' 29proclaimed Dr Charles Krauthammer. If only life weresuch smooth sailing. California'sGeron Corporation announcedin January its plans to beginthe first human treatment trialswith human ESCs.

PresidentObama and much of the publichave been told otherwise. faith-based initiatives Obama's executive ordercontinuing and expandingBush's White and NeighborhoodPartnerships (helping groups toprovide federally-funded socialservices) may cut both ways. 33 Monies and opportunities maywell increase, but what of thefaith part? For religious groupsaccepting these federal funds,potential restrictions onpersonnel practices andevangelistic efforts might causemany to opt out rather thancompromise. Liberal religionistsand secularists hope Obama willrestructure the faith-basedoffice so as to rein in moreconservative elements. 34 health system: weaknesses exaggerated? The gigantic health care system is not nationalised, but contains at least five socialised/government entities: nMedicare (for the aged) nMedicaid (for the poor) nPublic Health Service (division of the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for health promotion and meeting urgent public health needs) nUS Military (for service people) nVeterans Administration (for former service people) The troubling assertion that around 46 million Americans are without insurance is clouded with confounding variables. The'uncovered' include many in the aforementioned five nationalsystems (none are technically 'insurance policies', adequatethough they may be) and those of middle or higher incomes who have opted not to purchase health insurance. No emergency department in the US can turn away a patient, particularly if penniless, which accounts for 'health tourists' from other industrialised nations who make their first stop an emergency room for prompt access to treatment for whichthey were denied or put on long waiting lists at home. Yet genuine problems exist. The Economist reports that the US spends 'twice as much per head on health care as other richcountries. Yet for $2.2 trillion a year - twice the GDP of India -Americans get mediocre results. They die, on average, nearly twoyears earlier than west Europeans.' 36Mitigating factors include:37,38,39 nTen million unregistered immigrants fall through the cracks nFew age restrictions on expensive treatments (egchemotherapy, renal dialysis, and surgeries) nInfant mortality is counted from birth (rather than theinternational standard of two weeks old) nAdvanced pre- and post-natal care: expensive, and enable highsurvival of extremely premature infants (whose expectedhealth problems bring down the average) nAdvanced intensive care medicine nThe US keeps honest records for all to see and criticise20 nucleus easter '09Obama: change for good? modern day slavery Opposition to human trafficking is one thing on which pro-lifebelievers and the Obamaadministration see eye-to-eye.This rare island of commonground can serve as a launchpoint for interaction amidst our sea of non-concordance. We expect continuation andadvancement of the TraffickingVictims ProtectionReauthorization Act 2008. From ahistorical perspective, this is thethird time Christians are leadingthe charge to end slavery (thefirst being the institution of themedieval serf system; 35the second was William Wilberforceand the abolitionists). health care provision The US is in a uniquepredicament: it is the world'sthird largest nation of both areaand population. Americansreside in over 200 urban areas.The most challenging elementof national health systems,regionalisation and rationing,would be magnified here. Worseyet, many Americans conceivethat government-run healthcare equates to having all thecurrent choices and benefits,but for free! These expectationscannot be met by anyadministration.The Obama-Biden health plan 40 is estimated to cost an immense $50-65 billion. Itproposes using and expandingthe current structure with sometwists such as: nTightening controls Small to employees) nLimiting malpracticeinsurance costs nRaising the contributionstoward insurance from large employers previouslynot offering such nDeveloping a National HealthInsurance Exchange (toassist people in findingprivate and public medicalplans) nLiberalising rules on genericdrugs and their import Obama's colossal financial stimulus/recovery bill includesprovisions for the new NationalCoordinator of HealthInformation Technology, bureaucracy for treatment costcontainment over safety andeffectiveness. 41,42The concept isnot new in Europe, but it is a chilling idea for Americans. providing for the poor andmarginalised The national-level safety nets of Medicare, Medicaid and thePublic Health Service are joinedby numerous organisationssupporting free or very low costfacilities. These include (eg Shriners and StJude's) and centres, (often fundedby tribal casinos), Christianrescue missions, and pregnancycentres (often pro-life). A recognised problem remains the working poor, those whoseincome levels exceedqualification for Medicaid whilebeing insufficient for privateinsurance. Their safety valveremains emergencydepartments, which cannot turn patients away, but theconsequence is the over-taxingand sometimes closure of such.In addition to the Obama-Bidenhealth plan, the new teamintends to help the poor by: 43 nRaising the minimum wage nInvesting in transitional jobs for upward mobility nProviding tax and foreign aid Americans claim to be the mostgenerous people on earth, yetbooks are published contestingthat claim. In 2007, the US gaveonly 0.16% of its gross domesticproduct (GDP) in aid compared to Norway, Sweden and theNetherlands who gave over 0.8%.Although those countries gavemore per capita , they do not have 304 million people. The US' '$21.8billion aid budget was still thebiggest in absolute terms'. 44 Figures based on GDP penalisethe US for having a massiveeconomy (25% of the globaltotal). 45Often excluded from comparative statistics are the magnanimity of Americanbusinesses, private giving (45%of worldwide philanthropy), andvolunteerism, along withobviously robust military aid. 45,46The Obama administration will likelycontinue the strong Americantradition in foreign aid, thoughjust following through withBush-era commitments likePEPFAR will be costly in a time of recession. leadership values matter No organisation can rise above the constraints of itsleadership. A nation, non-governmental organisation,hospital, church or study groupwill find its limitations are thoseof its leaders - regardless of itsother assets. Consider how some Christian entities havesuffered due to the lack ofintegrity in their directors.Conversely, marvellous things have come throughunderestimated teams led byindividuals, with the anointingand favour of the Lord, whoconducted themselves inexcellence and made the mostof what they had. It's a verysmall rudder that steers a large ship, 47for good or bad. As members of the body of Christ and co-labourers withhim, 48we can influence the atmosphere where we work,rather than being victimised byit. Take the example of Danielserving a world-class demoniacObama: change for good?22 nucleus easter '09Obama: change for good? like Nebuchadnezzar.49Through understanding of honour,protocol and loyalty - he servedwith his gifts in a foreign placewithout compromising hisintegrity and relationship withGod. Esther was in the king'scourt during a difficult time, but one for which she waspositioned, as are we. 50Joseph, also an outsider in a strangeland, was another for whommultiple rejections were keystepping stones toadvancement 51- a spiritual principle to keep in mind. Few of us will be the chief advisor or second in command of acountry, yet each of us iscertainly the finest Christiansome of our patients andcontacts will ever meet. how can we pray? Scripture reveals that it is ourheavenly Father who raises upleaders and makes them great, 52 that their hearts are in hishands to direct, 53and that we are to pray for them.54 Pray for President Obama, his wife, his children and theirfamily life. Pray for his team,that they be surrounded withthe wise counsel of God'speople of excellence, anointingand favour. Pray for the Lord tomeet the president, his family,and administration in a life changing way. Pray for divineappointments. The manyChristian organisations andstaff fighting the good fightalso need prayer and financialsupport.

I passed with flying colours andate suitably large portions ofdessert in the cafeteria for therest of the week. As far as I wasconcerned I'd passed and didn'tneed to worry for a very longtime. Health checks conjure upthis kind of pass/fail mentality.Either my health is good enoughto make me relax for anotherfew months, or something isflagged up that means I need to take serious action. Unfortunately the Christian life is not that simple. Of course weneed to ask ourselves initially ifwe still believe that we aresinners in need of a saviour, Jesus Christ. If we fail here thenwe are spiritually dead andneed to repent and believe. Butif that belief is genuine it isalways accompanied by ongoing repentance . So, in a sense, 'do I pass the test spiritually?' is the wrongquestion to ask. There is noChristian for whom growing infaith and repentance is not anongoing requirement that willdemand different things atdifferent times. We need to view our churches more likehospitals than country clubs. Ina country club you don't expectto see any sick people. In ahospital, intravenous tubescoming out of people's necks are normal. Understood properly, the spiritual health check is a goodmodel for the Christian life fortwo reasons. Firstly, we need torecognise that we are all sick.Despite our spiritual hearttransplant, 1we constantly need to pitch up at God's follow-upclinic because we still need hishelp. So acknowledging sin andseeking to grow in faith shouldbe normal conversations overcoffee in church, not ones thatmake us wish we'd pickedsomeone else to talk to.Secondly, we need to admit thatwe are not in the best positionto assess our own health, andJason Roach urges us to focus on the gospeltime for a spiritual health check? 24 nucleus easter '09that we need help. When speaking to some of my medicfriends, it became clear that we can struggle with this simpleyet profound truth. We've allheard the old adage thatdoctors make the worstpatients. Perhaps it is becausewe are so used to being thedoctor that it can be hard to let someone else do the work of analysing us. The same struggle exists for some of us spiritually. Wesometimes wonder if preachersand Bible study leaders reallyunderstand the uniquepressures we face as medicsand so we switch off. But ifanyone cangive us the health check we need, it is not us. Theultimate diagnostician is JesusChrist. It is his grace and truth,found in his Word, that show uswhat we really need: 'For theword of God is living and active.Sharper than any double-edgedsword, it penetrates even todividing soul and spirit, jointsand marrow; it judges thethoughts and attitudes of theheart.' 2 getting a spiritual diagnosis After walking through the outpatient clinic, we need tostep into the spiritual X-Raywatch out: relationships and time management Perhaps a particular area to highlight is romantic relationships with non-Christians. Biblically speaking, one of the key purposesof marriage is to help each other fulfil God's command to bring all things in subjection to him. 3This is severely compromised by marriage to a non-Christian. Hence Paul stipulates that unlessalready married before conversion, Christian marriage should be to a believer. 4,5,6 We work closely and intensely with people who have values thatoverlap with ours in areas we are passionate about. However wemust guard ourselves from situations that are sinful and wouldprofoundly limit our long term ability to glorify the Lord. Evenwhen we are clear that dating might be wrong, we can becomeflirtatious is a way that serves our own sinful desires and not only dishonours God but may hurt others in the process. Another pitfall is being wired (like myself) to take the path of least resistance (and therefore minimal organisation) in life. Whenwe haven't thought beforehand about how we should spend ourday, week or month, we quickly find ourselves overwhelmed bythe urgent or exciting at the expense of the crucially important.As a doctor it was saying 'yes' to staying behind, which meant Icouldn't make something at church. To avoid this, why not factorin church family commitments around other parts of your sociallife, extra-curricular activities and work? Often there is stillenough time to do lots without neglecting the important.time for a spiritual health check? 25 nucleus easter '09time for a spiritual health check? department. God's word makes it very clear where to head tofind our diagnosis. Romans 1:25aexplains that by nature we areworshippers who have atendency to worship the wrongthing: 'They exchanged thetruth of God for a lie, andworshiped and served createdthings rather than the Creator'. So a good spiritual diagnostic tool is to ask ourselves, 'whatare the things in our lives whichtake on an inordinately highvalue?' What, if it was takenaway would ruin our lives, or make us doubt our faith?Medics are of coursesusceptible to all the sameinfluences that any Christianstudent might face. The classic temptations are often: perfectionism (lovingwork and achievements toomuch); lust (loving are these thingsaffecting you? If we're honest,they all affect us to somedegree. 1 Corinthians 10:13makes it clear that there are noproblems that are not commonto all of our human hearts; we merely differ in the extent towhich we struggle with them. We often find it hard to do this kind of self analysis. But that is something we were nevermeant to work through alone!Ephesians 4:11-16 makes it clearthat we share responsibility forhelping our church communityto change. That means investingin our church community so that we have genuinefriendships, where we canencourage and be encouraged.Having identified the areas thatneed work, what's the solution?It's time to enter the spiritualoperating room. going into surgery John became a Christian in hissecond year of medical school.It went fine for the first year -great quiet times, a boldevangelist, and really stuck intothe Christian Union. But of lateJohn seems more like the 'old'John - before he became aChristian. He's often drunk inthe bar, flirting with girls andnot reading his Bible. His friendstell him that he needs to sortout his quiet times. But theproblem started well before he missed his first morningdevotion. He thought progressin the Christian life was up tohim - just a matter of ticking a few boxes. Like the story of theProdigal Son, where his olderbrother was so interested inearning brownie points that helost sight of the grace of God. 7 This passage reminds us that'works' won't work. The things we love aren't as good as thepromises of God in the gospel.This is what Titus means when hesays that the gospel teaches usto say 'no' to ungodliness; 8and why Paul proclaims that the dailyChristian life is lived 'by faith inthe Son of God' who loved us andgave himself for us. 9 We see this in three ways.Firstly, the gospel reminds usthat no matter what sin weuncover in ourselves, therepentant Christian can beassured that 'there is now nocondemnation for those inChrist Jesus'. 10God has watched the DVD of our lives in superslow motion; he has seen ourwords and actions and everynasty thought we've had. Hesees the stuff we carefully tidyup in the editing room beforewe share our prayer points.Despite all this, he sent his Son to save us. Secondly, the gospel reminds us that being 'in Christ' means thatwe have resurrection power26 nucleus easter '09time for a spiritual health check? that enables us to beat sin.11 We all know how unjust it feels when we are wrongly accusedof something. Imagine thespotless Son of God'stemptation to rebel - when hewas treated (spiritually) as if hehad slept with his best friend'swife, murdered children andmuch more - when he bore thesins of the whole human race.And yet Jesus bore it allwithout sinning, died on thecross, and rose again!Incredibly, we have thoseresources at work in us. Thirdly, the gospel reminds us that even when we fail we areon a journey of transformationthat will certainly end in ourcomplete perfection. 12This truth gives us a great encouragementto hang in there for the longhaul, knowing that God willcomplete the work oftransformation in us. No doubt this sounds simplistic, but the Bible suggests thatunderstanding the basics bettergets to the root of the deepestproblems. We seek pleasure inthe wrong places because wedon't realise the joy we canhave in Christ; we seek securityin material things and peoplebecause we forget that we areadopted by the God of theuniverse. It's more of Christ, notspiritual techniques that we need. recovery and rehabilitation The truth is that change is a slow process. We'll be doing itthe whole of our lives! Thereare no quick fixes in the life ofongoing repentance. However,progress comes through theWord of God getting from ourheads to our hearts - so we canfind ways to encourage thatprocess. We start with prayer, for all our efforts come to nothing withoutthe work of the Spirit of Godthrough the Word. But why notread Christian biographies thatstir the heart with stories ofpeople who lived the gospel outin extraordinary ways? Why notlearn bits of the Bible so thatthey are at your finger tips intimes of need, or truths fromthe Bible you can accessquickly? For example, when I'm struggling with sin or suffering Ilook at my hand and rememberfive unchanging spiritual truths:God the Father loves me; Godthe Son died for me; God theSpirit lives in me; I'm on my way to glory; and all thingswork together for my good.If that sounds too much like hard work, why not review yourChristian music selection onyour iPod and try and get thosewords churning around yourhead? You will, I'm sure, think of other ways to preach thegospel to yourself. Reading the Bible, singing songs, andaccountability groups are allgood 'means' to help keep us on track. But ultimately, it is thegospel of Christ above all elsethat will ensure we remainspiritually healthy.

Assuch, personal or professionalbeliefs and values (whethersecular or religious) can beinvolved in medical research andclinical practice; in this case,medicine moves from beingevidence-based to being values-based. Both are indispensableelements of patient care. For example, new evidence-based drug treatments offerpossibilities for alleviating a widevariety of conditions. But what ifthe research and development was conducted in the developingworld, on 'volunteers' whoseconsent has been compromised,in communities that are unlikelyto gain from the findings? Ethicaldimensions of medicine that areoften neglected include: informedconsent, confidentiality,autonomy and human rights(illustrated powerfully in the films The Constant Gardener and Extreme Measures ). Medics are well trained in evidence-based medicine, toidentify the most appropriatetreatment for the condition. Most doctors are competent incritically appraising research -determining whether it addressesthe reader's concern, if appropriateand what its and whether theconclusions actuallyfollow from theresearch.

Whocan object to research that mightlead to a cure for strokes, burns,spinal cord injuries, dementia,diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis?But do we take these promises at face value or do we lookbehind the spin? The article mentioned above, on embryonic stem cell research(ESCR) and therapeutic cloning, is a case in point. Superficially itseems that Reeve, who died in2004, was supporting ESCR. Yet if one looks at what he isquoted as saying nucleus easter '0929behind research headlines the picture is more ambiguous: 'I really wish the public and thosewho will be making policy wouldunderstand that scientists do notneed to use fertilised embryos fortheir research'. Here we see ablurring of boundaries betweenthe hopes of ESCR, and the factsof current adult stem celltreatment. In these cases whereboundaries are blurred, thescientific community's Winston's statementis such an example: In order to persuade the publicthat we must do this work, weoften go rather too far in promising what we might achieve... I am not entirely convinced thatembryonic stem cells will, in mylifetime, and possibly anybody'slifetime for that matter, be holdingquite the promise that wedesperately hope they will. 2 It is hard to dismiss theconclusion that one value driving ESCR is a belief in the'technological imperative'.Science says we can, thereforewe should. Scientists love toexperiment; I know - I (Chris) amone myself. When questions arisein our specialist area, we love to explore, develop explanatorytheories, and try to confirm orrefute those theories by moreinvestigation. Geraldine Peacock (former chair of the Charity Commission), who has had Parkinson's for 18 years, is quoted as saying, 'I would not want to stop any process unless I knew it was categorically not going to work for those who are suffering'. 3But is this sanction of the technological imperative appropriate? Should scientists be able to justify ever more intrusive experiments, push the boundaries and ultimately,perhaps, remove them altogether? There may be more ethical alternatives, withgreater chances of success. 4,5 the plank in our own eye As Christians, we must handle research and bioethicalarguments with integrity, as in all other areas of our lives. 6We need to know the facts and drawappropriate conclusions fromthem. We should outline possiblefuture scenarios withoutscaremongering but not pullpunches either. Truth is what we ought to be seeking. We do not need to proclaim explicitly our arguments as being'Christian'; we can argue the issueon 'human' or 'secular' terms.This is not weakness oraccommodation to the world. For if our facts are right and ourarguments are valid, then we aresimply calling attention to thetruth. All truth is God's truth; hislaws and values are designed topromote human life and humanwell-being. We should not denyour Christian roots and beliefseither, because they provide thefoundation for our values andarguments. Let us consider anillustration that Christianssometimes use to argue against abortion: nucleus easter '0930 nucleus easter '09behind research headlines A woman has tuberculosis, and the father has syphilis. Togetherthey had four children. Theirfirst child was born blind... The second child was stillborn...The third child was deaf anddumb...and their fourth was bornwith tuberculosis. They're nowpregnant with their fifth child.Would you recommend that they abort this child? 7 If respondents answer 'yes',they are told that they 'justkilled Beethoven'. The point is well taken that we cannotpredict the outcome from eventhe most apparently terriblecircumstances, but the problemis that, on further investigation,the details given in this briefscenario appear to be false. 8 This often leads to a dismissivereaction to any other goodarguments based on goodevidence and sound reasoning. interpret research wisely How do we apply our Christian minds to the latestdevelopments mentioned in the BMJ, BMA News , or daily newspapers ?We suggest a number of questions that we canask ourselves (and other people),to ensure that our reactiondisplays a love of God as well as a love of our neighbour.identify the key issues We need to be clear what thespecific problem or dilemma is. What disease is beinginvestigated and what is beingproposed? What would theproposal add to the currenttreatment? How does thisresearch add to medicalknowledge? establish the facts Next, we need to be clear aboutthe exact facts of the matter.What is being claimed and onwhat basis are those claimsmade? This is similar to applyingour critical faculties to anyevidence-based medicine issue. Isthe claim well-founded? Was theresearch rigorous in its method and do the results appear likelyon the basis of current scientificachievements elsewhere? Whatis the bottom line claim and how does that relate to theevidence? Is this the onlyinterpretation of the evidence or the most likely one? Is there causation or simply acorrelation of effects (possiblydue to an unconsidered factor)? identify the relevant values By this time, something of theresearchers' worldview, or atleast their values, will havecome across. These need to besought explicitly and comparedto your own. Ethical values arethe values behind enhancement10 Research into human treatment is aimed at assisting theinjured, the disabled, those afflicted with genetic disease(eg gene therapy for cystic fibrosis). But will human desire for such technological advances in treatment stop at this or will itlead on to calls for 'enhancement' (eg gene therapy to enhanceintelligence or prevent ageing)? The rush to an enhanced 'transhuman' state, in which certain human beings have capabilities that the rest lack, will inevitablycreate a two-tier society, as in Brave New World . The technology may initially be used for (and justified by) medical purposes. But just like plastic surgery, it will undoubtedly come to be aconsumer product, demanded and paid for to suit people's desiresand whims - as long as they can afford it. Despite the advocacy ofDr Kevin Warwick (Professor of Cybernetics at Reading Universityand the self-styled first 'cyborg' 11), most people, especially from the developing world, will not have a choice in the matter.31 nucleus easter '09behind research headlines usually imposed on a study, as they cannot be derived by thescientific method.

We needto analyse the evidence baseprovided and integrate this with other available evidence,remembering that many negativestudies are not reported, and thatmuch research is constrained due to lack of funding. Where we have identified differences between our own values and those of theresearchers, we need to ask howthe two sets of values differ, andwhat the practical out-workingsare. Are there preferablealternatives - either because theyare more effective (evidence-based medicine) and/or becausethey are more acceptable (values-based medicine)? By identifying the evidence-based arguments the issues can beexplored effectively without a mention of 'thou shalt not' and other Christian jargon. Well evidenced arguments candemonstrate the reasonablenessof the Christian worldview.Through determining the relevantvalue systems, we will be able tosee why and how they come intoconflict. By identifying andpointing out these differences, we can point out to others howthe relevant evidence relates to the differing values. This will stimulate exploration of the linksbetween values and evidence;useful for verifying the foundationbehind our values. conclusion We are instructed to be asinnocent as doves, but as shrewdas snakes. 12Integrity and wisdom are powerful allies. We cannotallow the world's agenda to gounchallenged. Ultimately ourbattle is spiritual and we arecalled to defend God's truth, not purely for his sake alone, but because God's values andcommands bless all human life.

Matthew 10:1632 nucleus easter '09People of faith are often accused of irrationalbias. Some ethicists go further to argue that themorally neutral demands of thesecular state should alwayssupersede doctors' personalbeliefs. They would evendeprive doctors of their currentlegal right of conscience not toparticipate in abortions, forinstance. Ethicist JulianSavulescu writes: A doctor's conscience has littleplace in the delivery of modernmedical care. What should beprovided to patients is definedby the law...and the patient'sinformed desires. If people arenot prepared to offer legallypermitted, efficient, andbeneficial care to a patientbecause it conflicts with theirvalues, they should not bedoctors. 1 It is important to question this view, which is becominginfluential; not just amongsecular humanists, but alsoclinicians, lecturers, and yourmedical school classmates. Thisarticle will refute three claims:medicine is a morally neutralscience; people of faith aremore prejudiced; and a doctor'sChristian faith harms patients.1. clinical medicine is not a morally neutralscience Values are unavoidable in the practice of medicine. All doctorsmake value judgments daily;indeed it would be wrong not to do so. Good doctors do notsimply dispense whateverpatients request, as if we were'medical slot machines'. Valuejudgments are guided by ourindividual moral compasses, as we will see in the followingexamples. Imagine you are a doctor who diagnosed breast cancer in anelderly lady. The family asks younot to inform her of thediagnosis as it might upset her.No scientific knowledge canequip you to decide what wouldbe best, but moral principles andyour conscience (moral sense ofright and wrong) can. Here, truthtelling is a compelling principle. A patient once consulted me for fertility treatment, and the verynext week returned requestingan abortion. Why the change? Ittranspired that she was beingcoerced by her partner, who haddecided he did not want childrenafter all. Although science wasinvolved, it was my 'moralindignation' that led me to ask the 'why' questions. Or suppose that a neurotic patient with low self esteemdemands inappropriate plasticsurgery. Do you simply acquiesceif they are informed? Or do youtry to do what is in the patient'sbest interest, and consider thebest allocation of resources?Morality surely requires thelatter. Yet some academics write as if morality and medicalscience belong to separateworlds. Where did this idea come from? Enlightenment thinking Enlightenment thinkers such as David Hume 2(1711-1776) suggested that the onlytrustworthy truth claims werethose based on the scientificmethod (based on empiricalobservation and logicalanalysis). However, this view failsby its own standards, becausethe assertion itself is not based on any scientific observation or logical reasoning! The key word is 'only' - nothing but science has any authority.The absurdity of this claimpasses us by because the mostefficient route to reliableknowledge about the materialthe myth of secular neutrality Alex Bunn questions the assumption that 'faith equals bias'33 nucleus easter '09the myth of secular neutrality world is indeed empirical science. But this pragmaticapproach is very different to the dogma that science is theonly source of truth, therebyexcluding history, personalexperience, accumulated wisdomand divine revelation. The Enlightenment divided the world into two. The physicalworld of 'fact' explored byscience was seen as 'real'. The non-physical realm - ofemotions, values and ethics -was seen as subjective andimmaterial (non-physical).'Immaterial' has now come tomean irrelevant. Outside ofscience, no consensus waspossible, so ethics (and thehumanities generally) werereduced to personal opinion.Thus materialism, the idea thatnothing exists except materialthings, was born. How did materialism affect ethics? Prior to theEnlightenment, Aristotledescribes four dimensions(termed 'causes') and nature) nefficient cause (physicalmechanism) nfinal cause (purpose) nformal cause (soul oressence).Take the example of a sculpture, such as Michelangelo's David.You can describe the stone it is made from (material cause),as well as the sculptor's work(efficient cause). But thecomplete account of an artist'swork should include thepurpose and meaning; forinstance to celebrate a hero(final and formal causes). TheEnlightenment excluded the lasttwo causes as redundant, andeven forbidden, leaving theWest with an impoverishedculture of materialism. Before the Enlightenment, morality was concerned with how things should be -measured against design andpurpose. So another by-productof rejecting an absolutepurpose (eg giving glory toGod), was moral relativism.Right and wrong were now'relative to social, cultural,historical or personalcircumstances'. 4 We have now seen how theerroneous idea developed thatmedicine, being a science, ismorally neutral. What about itspractitioners; is there such anentity as a 'morally neutraldoctor'? Let us consider how everyone, atheistsincluded, has values.2. everyone has values John Patrick (former Associate Professor in Clinical Nutrition at the University of Ottawa) was asked to teach his medicalstudents 'from a morally neutralposition'. 5This is such an accepted ideal today that no-one questioned the medicalschool dictate. But only a littlereflection is needed todemonstrate the absurdity ofsuch a request. The question is'why should I practise morallyneutral medicine/education?'And the only appropriateanswer would to valuessuch as tolerance (of diversemoral standpoints) andsubsequent non-judgmentalism.These may be laudable, but theyare moral commandmentsnonetheless. In practice, we allbehave as if moral facts existthat are known to all, even if wecannot agree on the details. 6,7 Everyone has a worldview - a set of assumptions, priortruth commitments, by which to interpret the world and liveby - on which they base theirmorals, even if they do notrealise it. Worldviews are notscientific conclusions, but thatdoes not make them irrationalor biased. They answerquestions such as:34 nucleus easter '09the myth of secular neutrality nHow and what we can know? (epistemology) nWhat is the purpose and goalof does a good life consistof? (ethics) nWhat is wrong with man andthe world, and how we canaddress it? (politics and faith) nWhere did man come is he? (anthropologyor ontology) nWhat happens after death?(eschatology) The worldview (and subsequent values) we adopt will determineour medical ethics. The tablegives an example of how thisworks, from the perspective of a secular humanist. Statements at the worldview level are no more rational,scientific or provable thanmainstream faith beliefs. Giventhat everybody has a worldview,what are the values of thesecularist worldview? understanding secular humanismThe Council for SecularHumanism outlines itsworldview: 8 nA conviction that dogmas,ideologies and traditions,whether religious, political orsocial, must be weighed andtested by each individual and not simply accepted on faith. nCommitment to the use ofcritical reason, factualevidence, and scientificmethods of inquiry, ratherthan faith and mysticism, inseeking solutions to humanproblems and answers toimportant human questions. nA primary concern withfulfilment, growth, andcreativity for both theindividual and humankind in general. nA constant search forobjective truth, with theunderstanding that newknowledge and experienceconstantly alter our imperfectperception of it. nA concern for this life and a commitment to making it meaningful through betterunderstanding of ourselves,our history, our intellectualand artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us. nA search for viable individual,social and political principlesof ethical conduct, judgingthem on their ability toenhance human well-beingand individual responsibility. nA conviction that with reason,an open marketplace of ideas,good will, and tolerance,progress can be made inbuilding a better world forourselves and our children. Much of the outline appearsacceptable at first glance. ButLevel of belief 1. The particular situation (immediate judgment) 2. The rule to be applied in a type of situation 3. The general principle4. The worldview (philosophical framework)Example I should euthanise this patient who has multiple sclerosis Euthanasia is acceptable for consenting adults who arecompetent to request it No action can be wrong if it does not hurt a third party There is no God who has revealed his will to man, so it is up to individuals to decidefor themselves what is rightand wrong35 nucleus easter '09the myth of secular neutrality their position is spelt out more fully in a manifesto.9,10It claims that, 'any account of natureshould pass the tests ofscientific evidence', and any newdiscoveries can only confirmtheir materialism. It excludeseven the possibility oftranscendent values, or any goalbeyond the here and now. Itrejects any authority higher thanman, and embraces subjectiveethics. These are hardly neutral,scientific statements, but areunashamedly materialistic.Specific examples of secularhumanist beliefs that are value-laden (and non-scientific)include: nAll men should be valuedequally, even if evolution has not made us equal nA baby in the womb can betreated as a disease thatmarginally increases amother's mortality nThere is no objective right or wrong, as there is noauthority higher than man nIf God exists, he should provehimself to us according toscientific standards compare the Christian worldviewIt is easy to forget howdistinctive the Christianworldview is, with its insistenceon the sanctity of life. Non-Western cultures (without the Judeo-Christian heritage) are often lessprepared for human rights and democracy, because theylack a theistic worldview. Thevanguards of modern liberaldemocracy recognised thatrights are absolute (orunalienable) because they aredivinely endowed. These includethe French Declaration of theRights of Man, 11and the American Declaration ofIndependence: 12 We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are createdequal, that they are endowed bytheir Creator with certainunalienable Rights, that amongthese are Life, Liberty and thepursuit of Happiness. Nevertheless, when secularistsappeal to universal humanrights, they are plundering theresources of Christianity, whilerejecting the authority of theCreator who endowed them. Thedebt owed by secular humanismto Christianity is clearer tothose outside our culture. LeeKuan Yew, Minister Mentor ofSingapore, responded to theWestern outcry over a sentenceof flogging for vandalismsaying: 'To us in Asia, anindividual is an ant; to you he is a child of God. It's anamazing concept.' 13Given the values that secularhumanists hold to, we can nowlook at whether they are able toact ethically without appealingto values outside of science. a case example Evan Harris (a prominent secularhumanist Member of Parliament)recently campaigned to extendcurrent abortion laws toNorthern Ireland. 14The 1967 Abortion Act has never coveredNorthern Ireland, and thedemocratically electedrepresentatives have rejectedsuch a move, encouraged by various polls of publicopinion. 15,16 So on what basis can democracybe over-ridden? In order tosupersede a nation's choice, one must appeal to sometranscendent value, higher than public opinion. But secularhumanists specifically deny any such higher authority! In this case, Harris might invoke equality. In that, once a freedomhas been granted to one part ofthe population, it should begranted to everyone within thejurisdiction of the legislature.However, equality can also becited in favour of the unbornchild, so it cannot decide theissue. Certainly there is nohuman right for abortion,36 nucleus easter '09the myth of secular neutrality despite attempts by some secular humanists to establishone. Secular humanists, whilstnot bowing to the divinelawgiver, appeal to a higherauthority to advance theircause. Their claim of moralneutrality is nonsense. even moral relativists impose their moralitySecular humanists who espousemoral relativism tell us not toimpose our morals on others.Yet they commonly exemptthemselves from the absoluteinjunction not to impose one'smorals on another (when itcomes to their particularinterests or cause). They areright in the second instance:either a moral law is binding on everyone or no-one. Forexample, it is meaningless to say 'racism is completelyunacceptable...to me!' James Porter Moreland (an American philosopher andtheologian) tells the story of a conversation he had with a student in his collegedormitory. The student objectedto Moreland's traditionalmorality on marriage, and toldhim not to impose it on him. On the way out, the philosopheragreed, but deftly grabbed thestudent's stereo and made forthe door. 'Hey, where are youtaking my stereo? That's theft!' The philosopher replied, 'don'tyou impose your morality on me!' This may have been a cheeky prank to make a point, but it issurely the case that allrelativists are merely selectiverelativists. Students who aretaught the culture-bound natureof ethical codes in a sociologylecture would be incensed iftheir lecturer was foundawarding the best marks tostudents who offer monetarybribes or sexual favours! to impose or not to impose? So everyone who has a moralopinion will rightly try topersuade others to abide by it.Thankfully, Christians agreewith non-believers on mostmoral issues in medicine. Theareas of conflict are mostlyaround our care of the mostvulnerable, the taking of humanlife, and free speech. Recently, concern has been raised about Muslim medicalstudents refusing to seepatients who have self-inflictedillnesses caused by alcohol orpromiscuity. 17After consultation with the medical profession atlarge, the General MedicalCouncil (GMC) has issuedguidance on 'personal beliefs':All have personal beliefswhich affect their day-to-daypractice. Some doctors' personalbeliefs may give rise to concernsabout carrying out orrecommending particularprocedures for patients. 18 It is reassuring that the GMCrecognises that every doctorhas beliefs which necessarilyimpact on their practice,whatever their worldview, andtherefore rejects the myth of secular neutrality. It alsoconfirms the current legalposition that gives doctors the statutory right to excludethemselves from involvement inproviding abortions. Doctors areobliged to ensure that patientsare informed of how to procuresuch services which are legallyprovided, and that they are notdiscriminated against on thebasis of lifestyle and self-inflicted illnesses, such assexually transmitted infectionsor alcoholic liver disease. 3. Christian doctors have done good inmedicine CMF has always maintained that a doctor should notdiscriminate on the basis ofpatients' moral choices, butshould treat patients as Christwould. 19He treated people as37 nucleus easter '09the myth of secular neutrality moral beings whose choices matter for their present healthand eternal destiny. He wasboth bold in confrontingwrongdoing, while respondingcompassionately. 20Perhaps at times we can forget that ourmoral condemnation should bereserved for disciplining thosein the church family. 21 But how should Christiansrespond when the secular state threatens the lives of the vulnerable? Proverbs tells us to 'rescue those being ledaway to death; hold back thosestaggering towards slaughter'. 22 Civil disobedience isoccasionally necessary. 23 Daniel is a role model ofsomeone who continued to do right, even when the societyaround him became wicked. 24 Likewise, Paul tells us to obeythe authorities who have beenestablished by God. 25But where the government legislateswickedness or compromises the sharing of the gospel (eg byoutlawing free speech),'we mustobey God rather than men'. 26 Conscience should not beconsidered a dirty word inmedicine. Thankfully, doctorswith (and without) faith haveacted on their consciences.They have refused to assist injudicial amputations, femalegenital mutilation, and torture of political prisoners.Conversely, it is out of religiousconscience that pioneeringdoctors have started: hospicecare, adoption of orphans,missionary medicine, leprosycare, as well as care for thehomeless, drug addicts andthose who are HIV-positive. We need not be ashamed ofrecommending faith sensitivelyand with permission, as there is growing evidence for thebenefit of faith for health. 27 conclusion No-one can avoid making moraljudgments, whether they arereligious or not. Secularhumanists also make them onthe basis of their worldview andact as if they are binding oneveryone else. Christians areexplicit in recognising theauthority of divine revelation inethics, but that does not makefaith irrational. Christians havegood reason to be proud of theimpact of Jesus' ethics onWestern medicine, as long as wefollow his example of valuingboth truth and love.

We now consider the hermeneutical questions: how his Word applies to us today.1 Though people share muchcommon ground when askinghermeneutical questions,differences of opinion alwaysarise. These differences ininterpreting God's word are due toinconsistencies, stereotypes, andchurch traditions - though we maynot be aware of them. Two rulescan help us to be more consistent:1. 'A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to itsauthor or his or her readers.' 2 2. 'Whenever we share comparable particulars withthe first century hearers, God'sWord to us is the same as his Word to them.' 3 So exegesis is key! But how do theEpistles apply beyond the originaltext? This generates a number ofproblems, which we will dissect toanswer hermeneutical questionsbetter. problem 1 - extended application Say there is a situation in the Epistles to which modern dayparticulars or contexts compare.Is it justified to extend theapplication to other contexts?Take 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 as anexample: know that andthat Spirit destroy him; for God's templeis sacred, and you are that temple. Should these verses apply to the individual believer when, in itsoriginal context, it applied to thelocal church? The biggest dangerof this is in bypassing exegesisaltogether (and misinterpretingGod's word). As a rule, when thereare comparable situations, God'sword to us should be limited to itsoriginal intent. Outside of thisrule, extended application isnormally found to be sound bydiscovering the application inother passages where that is their original intent. problem 2 - particulars that are not comparable Some texts detail events that have no direct modern dayequivalent or are very unlikely tooccur. Exegesis often reveals aclear principle that we can apply,but these principles must apply togenuinely comparable situations. Certain issues may be important to some, but treated withindifference by others. For Paul,eating food served to idols was a matter of indifference, but itclearly wasn't to others. 4Here are some guidelines for decidingwhether something is a matter of indifference:1. What the Epistles saw as matters of indifference can This series is summarised from Fee G, Stuart D. How to Read the Bible for all its Worth (3rd ed). Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2003how to read the Bible for all its worth Si\u00f4n Glaze teaches us to read the Epistles the Epistles: the hermeneutical questions39 nucleus easter '09probably still be seen as such 2. Matters of indifference are cultural rather than inherentlymoral (even if they come fromreligious culture) 3. The sin-lists 5in the Epistles name principles rather thanspecific first century issues problem 3 - cultural relativity The Bible is a text of eternal importance written during aparticular time in history. Dosome issues, which appear tohave modern day comparables,need to be translated into ourtimes or simply left out? There isno divinely ordained culture, sowe cannot simply live as in thefirst century. But how and wheredo we draw the line? Here aresome guidelines:1. Decide on the core message of the Bible: the Cross is core butnot the holy kiss 6 2. Distinguish what the New Testament sees as distinctlymoral 3. Be aware where the New Testament reflects differences 7 in teaching and where it isconsistent: differences mayindicate cultural issues 4. Distinguish between principles and specific applications 5. Determine the cultural options that would have been open tothe New Testament writers 8 but with great care! If thewriters have only one cultural option open to them and theyaffirm it in the text then thelikelihood of that issue being'culturally relative' increases.Homosexuality was bothaffirmed and condemned ingeneral society during the firstcentury, yet the New Testamentis consistently against it. This isunlikely to be a culturallyrelative issue 6. Be aware of possible cultural differences between the firstand 21st centuries. For example,consider the position womenheld then before reading thevarious passage s speaking on the role of women 9 7. Recognise the difficulty of this process and be humble to eachother when tackling thesetough issues problem 4 - task theology Sound exegesis is crucial when learning theology from theEpistles, because the theology istask oriented rather thansystematically presented. Eventhen, our theologicalunderstanding is limited by thefact that the Epistles are writtenfor specific situations. So beyondwhat the text says, 'everythingelse is mere speculation'. 10 The other problem is when we askour questions of texts written forspecific situations, which only answer their questions. To deal with contemporary issues (suchas abortion), 'we must attempt tobring a biblical worldview to theproblem'. 11 conclusion To answer the hermeneuticalquestions, we must look at God'sWord to them before we examinehis Word to us. After all, we do nottreat every patient with acuteabdominal pain for appendicitisreflexively. We use their history(the context) to inform ourtreatment. Interpreting God'sWord is no different; we mustcome to the conclusion sensiblyand consistently. Si\u00f4n Glaze is a clinical student at Cardiff Universityhow to read the Bible REFERENCES 1. Ip H.

This isachieved by complexinteractions between hernervous system and musclecells that are intomotor units. As 'an octopuswould encircle a pole', motornerves wrap themselves aroundmotor end plates, in millions of neuromuscular junctions. Many things can upset the balance of our Christian faith,both doctrinally and practically.The church, the body of Christ,is at its best when reaching outto others in love, rather thanwasting away in inactivity bylooking selfishly inwards. Sadly,we have not always fulfilled thiscommission; instead exerting'extreme exaggerated reflexes'to spiritual controversies of thetime. Do any contemporarydebates come to mind rightaway? In the books of Galatians and Romans, the apostle Pauldemonstrates a better way. Hedenounces the Jewish believersfor their legalism, yet upholdsgood works as the outworking of a heart transformed by God'sgrace. So much of Christianfaith is a balance betweenextremes. The physiological process of maintaining balance isremarkably simple tounderstand. An action potentialtravelling down the motor nervewill stimulate only one responsefrom the muscle fibres acrossthe junction: a shortening tocause contraction. This isrepeated over and over,providing a constant stream of messages to maintain tonethroughout the body's muscle'choir'. This constant 'click-click'of messaging is what allows thegymnast's body to remainpoised on the beam. When itcomes to maintaining balance,communication is vital. Similarly, the body of Christ can learn much throughcommunication betweenbrothers and sisters across theglobe. It is sometimes hard tolook beyond cultural differencesin the way others see church,and remember that God lovesthem. This is worth the effort,as he teaches us valuablelessons about his body. Thisrequires an open heart and humility that God delights to give. The Bible urges us toclothe ourselves with humilitytoward one another, becauseGod opposes the proud butgives grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:5). In conclusion, the church finds unity incommitment to the head, JesusChrist; we must find fellowshipin our mutual obedience to him.

Though focusing on abortion, the main message is about practicallove and exploring more deeply God's heart ofcompassion - learning to see people as he does. Philip Clarke takes the sometimes abstract command 'love your neighbour as yourself'(Matthew 22:39), and shows us how to make it realin our everyday lives. In recounting his experiencesas a GP in Southampton, he explains that showingcompassion can be challenging. However, it is in thedifficult people that compassion proves the mostpowerful witness, where God works most radically. The author highlights the need to love the lost and broken before expecting them to understandthe concept of a loving saviour. He illustrates theimportance of us, Christian medics, fightingvaliantly for God's will whilst not rejecting thosewho go against it. When advising a female patientagainst abortion, this may mean ensuring thatcommunication channels remain open so that she can return for support and counselling even if she went ahead with the procedure. A Heart of Compassion renewed my excitement and enthusiasm for facing the challenges of being a Christian doctor.

But we oftenforget about individual Christians, our friends, for whom this struggle is a daily reality. Alex Tylee convinces the readerof the need for compassion, honesty anduncompromising holiness in relating to ourselves and others. Tylee affirms her commitment to salvation as God's way of dealing with sin and exploressensitive areas such as identity and evangelism inthe homosexual community. She encourages herreaders with a firm biblical basis to walk lovinglywith friends, whether gay or straight; earning theright to introduce Jesus without assumption orpre-judgement, with understanding and humility.Her well researched arguments are based onpersonal experience and interviews; the casestudies illustrate how Christian friends can makea life-changing impact on others at university. This book is genuinely worth reading. It is not formulaic in its approach or derogatory in anyway. It places Jesus at the centre, challenging usto think, change, and obey his command to loveour neighbour as ourselves (Matthew 22:39).

The simplequestion, 'what would Jesusdo?' produces such a simpleanswer. Yet how many of ushave demonstrated Christ-likecompassion when walking pastthe cold and hungry man sittingon the footpath? I remember making dinner for members of the Belfasthomeless community at a localhostel with my Christian Unionsmall group. These are regularpeople, who somehow ended upon the streets. Most of them,like us, had families and went to school, enjoying life. Untilsomething happened - toofrequently involving alcohol,drugs, or broken-downrelationships. Author Peter Campion challenges our attitudes to these outcast members of society who enter ourhealthcare institutions. Is itright for our negativity andnarrow-mindedness tojeopardise their healthcare? The article clearly states thatboth the homeless UK citizenand the asylum seeker (whosecase is under consideration) are entitled to NHS healthcare at the point of need. Astomorrow's doctors, we shouldengrave this important fact into our minds. The Bible tells us to love our neighbour as we love ourselvesand to help the needy. OurFather remembers what is donein secret and will reward us withthe abundant riches of hiseternal kingdom. Gillian Blayney Queen's University Belfast Editor, I was talking to a 'spirituallyneutral' friend last year. Our'religious' debate ended withme exclaiming: 'studyingmedicine shows me that thereis a mighty God behind humandesign.' '...Oh really? The more I learn, the more I thinkeducation is the answer to all human problems', heresponded. In retrospect, that was a great opportunity to speak about Jesus, and to address my friend'smisconceptions about God. I often wonder whether reading books from an atheisticperspective (like The God Delusion ) is a waste of time,when we have so many medical textbooks to cover! But I thank Nucleus for its beautifully summarised report ('hasscience buried God?') of thedebate between RichardDawkins and John Lennox. I was totally engrossed by thefree online video of their firstencounter, recommended in the article. If I had been better equipped prior to the conversation withmy friend, we could have drawnmore out of the dialogue,although it is not too late to follow up. But I want toencourage all Christian medicalstudents to use such articlesand online resources, so we can always be ready to give adefence to everyone who asksus about the reason for thehope that is in us (1 Peter 3:15).
