Bonnie was born September 8th 1974 in Fells Church, Virginia, USA. She's the youngest child of Sh\u00e9amus McCullough and Aileen McCullough (n\u00e9e MacLachlan). Bonnie is a very powerful psychic human girl, later revealed to be a very powerful witch. Bonnie is the twin flame soulmate of [Damon Salvatore](/wiki/Damon_Salvatore), the best friend of [Elena Gilbert](/wiki/Elena_Gilbert_(novel)), the childhood close friend [Meredith Sulez](/wiki/Meredith_Sulez) and [Matt Honeycutt](/wiki/Matt_Honeycutt), the close friend of [Stefan former childhood friend of [Caroline Forbes](/wiki/Caroline_Forbes) and [Tyler Smallwood](/wiki/Tyler_Smallwood), the intended love interest and object of affection of Bastian Cassidy, and the enemy of [Klaus](/wiki/Klaus), [Shinichi](/wiki/Shinichi), and [Misao](/wiki/Misao). Bonnie was born into a large family of witches. Her family eventually formed into a coven. Although her father and her mother possess the witch gene, neither are practicing witches, because in their families, the ability to practice witchcraft always skips a generation. In addition, some members of her family may or may not choose to embrace their abilities and practice witchcraft. For example, a few of her older sisters and brothers, are all born with the gift of magic and are technically all witches and warlocks, but they choose to suppress their abilities and keep them dormant, choosing to live as regular humans instead. Bonnie, being the youngest of the McCullough children, originally started out as the weakest in power. However, since Bonnie has learned to control and harness her abilities more effectively as a witch, she has become a very powerful witch, arguably becoming the most powerful of her family and the most powerful character in the series next to Damon. Bonnie is of full Gaelic-Celtic ancestry. She is \u00be Scottish and \u00bc Irish. Both of her maternal grandparents were Scottish immigrants while her paternal grandfather is Scottish-American and her paternal grandmother is an Irish immigrant. Bonnie is descended from patriarchal and matriarchal bloodlines of very powerful sorcerers, magicians, warlocks and witches. She is descended from ancient Celtic Druids who practiced Druidic and Celtic magic. The Celtic Druids are Bonnie's oldest known maternal ancestors. Bonnie's distant maternal ancestor Annis MacB\u00e0ine, who was born in Scotland some time between 10th Century and 12th Century A.D., was a very powerful witch (arguably one of the most well known powerful witches in the world) who practiced and mastered very powerful, benevolent White Magic. She utilized her magic for good purposes and used it to help others (spells that she would conduct include health, healing, love, fertility, and cure spells, for example). MacB\u00e0ine passed down the gift of White Magic onto her descendants (the MacLachlan family). As a result, the gift of White Magic skips a generation within the MacLachlan family. Bonnie's eldest known paternal ancestor Proins\u00e9as Ciar\u00e1n (known commonly as Francis Blackburn in order to conceal his true identity), who was born in Ireland some time between 12th century and 14th Century A.D., was a very powerful, corruptive, and dangerous warlock. He practiced very destructive, malevolent Black or Dark Magic. Blackburn was a very deadly warlock who was the leader of an Irish Coven of witches and warlocks. Many greatly feared him due to his extreme power and malevolent, evil practices. However, before his corruption and turn to the dark side, Blackburn was originally a powerful, benevolent warlock who had good intentions and had used his magic to help, protect and save people. But once he started practicing and mastering the Dark Arts, he became twisted and corrupted by its power. Through this corruption with the use of Black Magic, Blackburn became selfish, hateful, vengeful, cruel, murderous, psychotic, twisted, and sociopathic. The man that he was before he used Black Magic completely disappeared and what was left was an evil, mentally warped, psychotic and deranged man. Even after he became evil and twisted in his ways, Blackburn would conceal his true intentions and personality by continuing to practice White Magic, like he had done before Black Magic corrupted him. Blackburn used his gift of magic to manipulate, torture and kill numerous people without any guilt or remorse. Members of his coven even compared him to the Devil himself because he was so malevolent and evil in his ways. He passed down his gift of Black Magic to his descendants (the McCullough family). But similar to the MacLachlan family, the gift of Black Magic skips a generation in the McCullough family. For example, both of Bonnie's parents, Seumas and Aileen, do not possess the gift of magic and are humans. However, her maternal grandmother (Lilias MacLachlan) and her paternal grandfather (Gregor McCullough) are a witch and warlock respectively and displayed the gift of magic. Due to her bloodlines, Bonnie possesses the gift of White Magic through her matriarchal bloodline and Dark or Black Magic through her patriarchal bloodline. Within the MacLachlan family, it is the women who possess witch abilities or magic, while within the McCullough family, it is the men who possess warlock abilities or magic. Bonnie chooses to practice White Magic and chooses to keep her Dark Magic suppressed out of fear of hurting the people she loves or innocent people in addition to letting the darkness overwhelm or consume her. Bonnie's maternal grandmother, Lilias, who was a Scottish immigrant born in Edinburgh, Scotland, was a very powerful witch who practiced White Magic. Bonnie has slowly learned to control her strong abilities as a psychic turned witch, although her powers often become much too powerful and overwhelming for her to handle at times. Bonnie's witch abilities are hereditary according to herself, and she says that the witch powers and abilities always skip a generation in her matriarchal line and her patriarchal line. Bonnie has also used her magic successfully when trying to help Elena find Stefan when he had went missing in [The Struggle](/wiki/The_Struggle). Physically, Bonnie is described to be a small, petite girl with deep, large brown eyes, a heart shaped face, long strawberry red-gold loosely curly hair (which is originally straight but was curly permed to make her look taller than she is) and very fair skin or complexion, which is said to be highly translucent and opaque. Bonnie's physical appearance is often described to be innocent, dainty and childlike. Initially, in the very beginning of the series, Bonnie comes off as kind hearted and caring, but she is not seen to be very bright, scholarly and intelligent at all. In Dark Reunion, Bonnie begins to dabble in the art of witchcraft, and successfully pulls off a summoning ritual to call Stefan back to Fell's Church, then successfully manages to help Stefan communicate with a ghostly Elena by various means. At the end of Dark Reunion, Bonnie is the one who screams about the unfairness of their tragic fate, which triggers Elena's return from the afterlife. It is unknown if Bonnie's strong and powerful powers played any significant role in making this happen, or if it was just a matter of lucky timing (it was the night of the summer solstice, when ghosts were said to be prone to returning to Earth anyway). She slowly realizes that she isn't as dumb as she believes herself to be (and, as a result, as she's convinced everyone else she is), and that she's actually rather resourceful, useful, needed and loved by all of her friends. Although Bonnie's characterization generally appears to be light-hearted, bubbly and sweet, Bonnie is strongly and deeply fascinated with and drawn to darkness and unconventionality, especially with death. Bonnie frequently talks about, fantasizes about and romanticizes death, especially her own; constantly talking about her Scottish grandmother's prophecy that she would be young and beautiful in her grave, and she is going to die romantically. She is fickle, idealistic and flighty when it comes to the opposite sex. Bonnie is described to be highly flirtatious and coy. She has a habit of chasing boys, therefore, this has made her look somewhat flighty, ditzy, unstable and even promiscuous when it comes to the opposite sex. She has had numerous boyfriends, crushes and infatuations whom she doesn't seem to take seriously at all due to her fickleness, flightiness and her inability to commit to a stable, long-term romantic relationship. Bonnie is initially attracted to Stefan Salvatore because she finds him polite, romantic and cultured. Bonnie has shown some interest in Matt Honeycutt. She begins to develop a relationship with Matt (especially in Dark Reunion), although Matt is still very much in love with Elena. Matt has been seen to be very protective over Bonnie, especially where Damon is concerned, and he appears to have a brotherly, best friend and platonic connection with her. She has a pleasant and easy-going connection with Matt. Bonnie has a very deep, strong, indescribable and undeniable attraction and connection with Damon Salvatore. She deeply and strongly cares about him (unconditionally) and is indescribably and undeniably drawn to him. Damon has frequently saved her life on various occasions throughout the course of the series and because of it, Damon is seen as Bonnie's hero and protector. Damon has shown to be fiercely protective (sometimes overly protective) of Bonnie even though he won't and can't admit it to himself (for whatever unexplained reasons) and he is always there for her whenever she is in trouble of any kind. Bonnie is Damon's \"weak spot\" although Damon constantly and repeatedly tries to deny it throughout the series. By the end of the original series, Bonnie had become significantly more mature, grounded and serious; focusing on the more important issues and problems at hand rather than about the opposite sex and chasing boys. She even surprises herself a few times with her own insightful, helpful contributions to the fight against Klaus. Bonnie, who is a powerful psychic with supposed witch ancestry, is often greatly overwhelmed by her powers, and attempts to repress the true extent of them without very much success. Physical Description[ ] Bonnie is the arch-feminine type; the epitome of femininity and fragility. She is feminine, fragile and dainty and she has the appearance of a delicate damsel in distress. Physically, Bonnie is considered to have a perfect, symmetrical face; however, Bonnie does not seem to recognize or see her own physical beauty. Bonnie has an unconventional beauty with an otherworldly, exotic aura. She is not the standard blond-haired and blue-eyed model beauty that Elena is. Her beauty is something that could be considered \"different\". It could even be argued that Bonnie is prettier than Elena. Facially, Bonnie has a small heart-shaped face with a well-shaped rounded forehead, full cheeks, and a delicate chin. She has very white, fair (just as fair as Elena), soft and translucent skin, almost like that of a young baby's skin. Bonnie's skin is lightly freckled because of her Scottish/Irish or Celtic heritage. Along with the fair and translucent skin, Bonnie has lightly rose-tinted cheeks. Bonnie's skin is so fair and opaque that her blue veins and fjords are visible to the naked eye; Damon mentions this when he first meets Bonnie unexpectedly in After Hours. Bonnie has very beautiful almond shaped eyes that are large and slightly wide-set. Bonnie's eyes are very soft, watery, limpid and soulful yet vibrant, luminous and expressive at the same time. She has noticeably long and thick lashes which frame her soft eyes. As for her eye colour, Bonnie has hazel-brown or honey-coloured eyes. Bonnie has femininely arched eyebrows that frame her soulful, soft and limpid eyes. She has a very small, straight, slender and delicate nose that is slightly upturned at the tip; her nose is best described as a \"pixie or fairy nose\". Bonnie has a well-shaped mouth with well-formed and full lips. As noted by Damon himself, she has a very warm, soulful and enchanting smile with perfectly straight white teeth. Bonnie has noticeably large and rounded indentations or dimples in both of her cheeks when she smiles. As for her hair, Bonnie has very thick, luxurious, softly curled (also slightly frizzy) ranging from reddish gold to strawberry red hair that looks like it is on fire. Bonnie's hair trails down her back all the way to the middle of her waist. Bonnie's original hair type is bone straight but she permed her hair curly, because she believes it will give her some height. Bonnie has slightly large yet delicate and elf-like ears to match her small and fine facial features, similar to that of a pixie or fairy. Bonnie has an exceptionally long, slender and delicate neck, similar to that of a ballerina from Swan Lake. Damon has taken notice of Bonnie's long, delicate neck; he has noticed that she has very visible blue veins on her neck. Damon noted to himself that Bonnie's neck is extremely tempting for a vampire, because it is very long, delicate and has visible veins along it, making it easier for a vampire to feed. As for her body and her physique, Bonnie is very slim and slender. Bonnie has a small boned, slight and elfin type body. Her figure is somewhere between that of a young girl and a woman. She has small breasts (she is an A Cup) and Bonnie often complains about her small breasts, saying that it makes her feel less of a young woman and more like a child. She has a very slim torso, with very small shoulders, slim and delicate arms, a very tiny waist, slightly wide hips and slim, short legs with small hands and small, delicate and dainty feet. Bonnie is very short and petite in height. She is between 4'9\" to 4'11\", which only makes her physical appearance all the more childlike. According to Damon, Bonnie has a very charming, pleasant and melodious voice. Damon is strongly attracted and drawn to it. Hence why he has given Bonnie the pet names \"Little Redbird\", \"Redbird\" and \"Songbird\". As for her fashion sense and sense of style, Bonnie dresses in casual clothing with the exception of formal gatherings and events. Nevertheless, Bonnie always looks very feminine and stylish in whatever she chooses to wear. Often, Bonnie wears jeans with a variety of nice, assorted coloured tops. As for her footwear preference, she wears sneakers, high heels, or boots. Bonnie has a tendency to accessorize. She wears necklaces, pendants, rings, bracelets, earrings and belts with her ensemble. Bonnie's overall appearance is innocent, vulnerable, and fragile; comparable to a kitten. However, she has a classical yet unconventional beauty that gives her the constant impression of a pixie or a fairy. Her physique was described by Damon to be somewhat diminutive and slightly underdeveloped in appearance. Her body is somewhere between that of a little girl and a young woman. Bonnie has very small breasts and she is almost flat chested; she is an A-cup bra size, so she is not completely last chested. Bonnie has long, luxurious, and thick reddish-gold hair that used to be straight before she permed it curly, since she believed it made her look taller. The appearance and the abundance of her hair is what makes her resemble a pixie. She has a small heart-shaped face with a widow's peak and soft delicate features: a small, straight and dainty nose like that of a cherub, deeply-defined dimples in both cheeks, and large, almond-shaped hazel-brown eyes with long, thick eyelashes. Her smile was noted by Damon to be soulful and enchanting. Her skin is as fair and perfect and translucent as that of Elena's, so fair indeed that her veins and fjords are easily visible (Damon had taken significant notice of this). Despite her height, Bonnie was noted by Damon to have an exceptionally long and dainty neck, like that of a ballerina in Swan Lake. He had also described her voice to be charming, highly melodious, and pleasant, comparable to that of a nightingale or a songbird, hence his nickname for her is \"Little Bird\" or \"Little Redbird\". A few quotes Bonnie's physical appearance: From [The Struggle](/wiki/The_Struggle): \"Blinking, Elena brought a face into focus. It was small and heart-shaped, with fair, almost translucent skin, framed by masses of soft red curls. Wide brown eyes, with snowflakes caught in the lashes, stared worriedly into hers.\" From [The Return: Nightfall](/wiki/The_Return:_Nightfall): \"Bonnie, with her hair that was called something strawberry, but that looked simply as if it was on fire. Bonnie of the translucent skin, with the delicate violet fjords and estuaries of veins all over her throat and inner arms. Bonnie, who had lately taken to looking at him sideways with her large childlike eyes, big and brown, under lashes like stars.\" From Damon and Bonnie: After Hours: \"The maiden, who was exceptionally dainty and pretty and had, to a vampire, the most exquisite feature of all, an exceptionally long and delicate column of a neck, was looking up at him soulfully. That was nice, that she was short. Damon didn't care that much for tall girls because he wasn't very tall himself. She also had - you couldn't help notice - particularly large eyes in her small heart-shaped face, giving her the appearance of a kitten. They were clear brown eyes, with a dark ring at the outer rim of the iris, then a very light brown ring, as if light were shining through them in the middle, and then another dark ring around the pupil. Her hair was the color of a strawberry and curled softly all over her head in a way that made you think \"pixie.\" Altogether, she was a lovely little ornament, with fine blue veins in naturally translucent skin.\" Personality Description[ ] Bonnie is a good-hearted, good-natured, cheerful, likeable, charismatic, kind, caring, nurturing, loving, empathetic, sensitive, romantic and charming person, but she is not considered to be that bright or intelligent at the start of the series. She is not an academic, scholarly person by any means. Bonnie does not take school or her studies very seriously at all. In most instances, Bonnie finds school too serious, boring, and disciplinary for her personality. Bonnie starts off highly unsure about her identity and her future. She seems to have no clue as to who she is and what she really stands for. She is immature, naive, ditzy, childish, shallow, boy-crazy, and insecure in the beginning. However, as the series progresses over a time, Bonnie begins to strongly develop, mature, deepen and evolve in many ways. She begins to get a much deeper and clearer understanding of who she really is. Through her character development and evolvement, Bonnie becomes a more mature, stable, grounded, and strong-willed person. As well as developing as a person, her already strong and powerful psychic or witch abilities (which are hereditary and run through her matriarchal bloodline) start to develop and become more and more powerful as time goes on. She eventually masters the art of witchcraft, acknowledging her status and identity as a witch. Bonnie is a practicing Wiccan; it has been hinted in the books that Bonnie is not only a powerful psychic but that she has very powerful witch ancestry (according to Bonnie, her maternal grandmother was a very powerful witch). Bonnie is extremely loyal, compassionate, empathetic, loving, kind, caring, nurturing, and fiercely protective. She will do absolutely anything for her friends, her family and the people she loves. Not only this, but Bonnie is the kind of person that would help innocent people or a person in need. She's a generous person and she is always trying to lend a helping hand when it is most needed. Bonnie comes off as rather eccentric, quirky, and offbeat in personality. She is highly misunderstood as a result, even by her own family and her own group of close friends. Bonnie is strongly attracted to the unusual, wild side of life. She has a thing for the bizarre, and she appears the most unconventional and avant garde out of the core group. She is a highly adventurous, spontaneous, explorative and curious person. In many ways, she is rather opposite of her best friend, Elena. While Elena has a tendency to be more vain, proud, and selfish, Bonnie is more of a humble, generous, giving and selfless person. For the majority of Bonnie's life since her childhood, Bonnie has always seemed to live in the shadows of Elena. Therefore, she has always felt like she is second best because of it. Bonnie feels deep down that Elena and Meredith are more of a woman than her and that she will forever be seen as the \"child\" of the group, because she is the least emotionally and mentally mature, even though she is the exact same age as them. Despite this, Bonnie never seems to complain even though she has always ended up feeling second best to both Elena and Meredith. Although, Bonnie is not the overly competitive type in the way that Elena is; therefore, she has felt absolutely no desire to try to compete with Elena in any way. This is because Bonnie has always felt like she has lived in Elena's shadow anyways. Bonnie doesn't come off as the intense academic or scholarly type whatsoever, but the reason for this is that she has a habit of engaging her mouth and her emotions before her brain. However, despite that she is not an academic person by nature, she is rather intelligent, intuitive, sharp, quick and intellectual in many other ways. She has a \"sixth sense\"; therefore, she can read the emotions and the thoughts of other people with complete ease. She also possesses an off beat sense of humour. Bonnie is also capable of being extremely sarcastic when she wants to be, especially when she is irritated, angry, annoyed or frustrated. She is known to provide much comic relief and wit, especially in times of tense and dire situations. Bonnie has a tendency to use humour, wit and sarcasm to hide what she feels or to protect her feelings from possible hurt. Bonnie is extremely friendly, likeable, light-hearted, cheerful and charming. Therefore, all of her friends adore her and are highly protective of her. Although, it has been seen that many of Bonnie's friends happen to underestimate Bonnie. They have a habit of treating Bonnie like she is a child, and they refuse to see her true and full potential as a person. Her friends often feel the need to protect and take extra care of Bonnie constantly, because they see her as the damsel in distress who needs constant saving and protecting. As a result, Bonnie is severely underestimated and under appreciated amongst her own inner circle. Bonnie fits in with the group, but doesn't fit in with the group at the same time. She is best friends with Elena, Meredith, Matt, and Stefan. She has been childhood friends with Elena, Meredith and Matt since kindergarten and was close friends with former friend-turned-rival Caroline since the first grade. Bonnie gradually befriends Stefan after Matt befriends him and becomes best friends with him. Bonnie is extremely close to Elena (Elena considers Bonnie to be her very best friend and Bonnie refers to Elena as her best friend), and she also has a very strong bond and friendship with Meredith as well (who also considers Bonnie to be her very best friend). Bonnie used to be best friends with Caroline until she turned against Elena at the start of their Senior year. Bonnie grew distant from Caroline when she had become ultra competitive, especially with Elena. Bonnie develops a strong dislike for Tyler and although she initially finds him attractive because of shallow reasons (he's physically attractive, rich, athletic, strong), Bonnie has said that Tyler possesses an unbearable, unlikable, and intolerable personality. Bonnie develops a good, solid, platonic friendship with Stefan. She initially finds Stefan very handsome, attractive, romantic, polite and cultured. Bonnie thinks that Stefan is a good-hearted and caring person with the best of intentions. Stefan has described Bonnie as the \"fiery little pixie\", giving the nickname to Bonnie with the implication that Bonnie is a passionate, spunky, and fiery person in nature. Damon has said that Bonnie can be stubborn, impractical and naive at times. Bonnie starts off as very emotionally dependent on other people. As the series goes on, she becomes a much more independent, confident, and self-assured person. She also matures and grows up rather fast in the original trilogy, showing much spiritual and emotional growth. Bonnie generally has a positive, optimistic attitude. She is highly spiritual and has a very gentle and healing nature. Bonnie has a tendency to put a great deal of emphasis in fantasy or at the unseen in her life, whether it be her emotions or her own intuition. Bonnie has a habit of absorbing the thoughts and emotions of everyone around her; therefore, she is highly sensitive, receptive, empathic, and emotional. Bonnie is rather enchanting in personality. She is very kind to her friends as there is nothing that she would not do for any of them. She is very emotionally dependent on her loved ones. Bonnie hates to see those she loves and cares for suffer in any form. It could be argued that Bonnie is too overly selfless and giving. She never really pays enough attention to her own happiness and wellbeing. Bonnie is too emotionally involved in the lives of her friends to the point where she seems to lose her own identity in the process. Bonnie shows a dislike of discord and violence of any kind as it upsets her sensitive, fragile and emotional nature. Despite her generally kind and caring personality, Bonnie is very fiery, intense, passionate, feisty and spunky. She can definitely be very strong willed and determined, especially when she wants something. Bonnie has also been shown to be rather reckless, impulsive, hot-headed and overly emotional at times. In comparison to Elena (who is balanced between being emotional and stoic) and Meredith (who is stoical, calm and aloof), Bonnie is the most emotional of the main trio of girls. Bonnie also has a quick, fiery temper when provoked and it is very easy to provoke her into anger. She also has a sharp and biting tongue when she is upset, angered, betrayed or hurt. Since Bonnie does not have height or size to use to her advantage, she will often use cutting, sharp and hurtful words when she lashes out at others (very much like Damon). She has even managed to hurt Damon of all people with her words. Bonnie is also rebellious and doesn't seem like she cares about following the norm or the rules. She seems like the type that would be into an unconventional way of living. Although kind, caring and empathetic, she has a strong dark streak or side to her personality. She is fascinated with the dark side of life, such as death/dying, blood, morbidity, the supernatural and darkness/living in the shadows. Bonnie is also easily corruptible by dark forces and darkness. This is probably so because dark forces, entities and beings are either drawn to Bonnie's goodness, naivety, fragility which make her easy to take advantage of/easily corruptible or they see a darkness in Bonnie that makes her easy to turn to the dark side. She seems to have no issue with talking about death and she even happily fantasizes about how she is going to die and be young and beautiful in her grave. Bonnie also fantasizes about being physically strangled and dominated by hot, strong and dominant men, indicating that she is into the darker side of romance. Bonnie has extremely strong and powerful psychic abilities. Her powers seem to become most vibrant, active, or heightened when she is in Damon's presence. She is able to feel Damon's Power clearly when she is around him or with him. She is able to sense what he is feeling and thinking (this is seen in Dark Reunion). Most of the time, Bonnie seems to act as an unwitting medium for helpful spirits and ghosts, most notably the spirit of a powerful witch named Honoria Fell, who has made many attempts to aid the girls (Elena and Meredith) when they are in need of help through Bonnie. Bonnie does not remember anything she says or does while she is in this condition, because she basically goes into a catatonic state or a hypnotic trance. She has occasional prophetic flashes, such as when she jokingly (but coincidentally) reads Elena's palm on the first day of school and comes up with a genuine prophecy or prediction that she would meet a dark, handsome but not imposingly tall stranger (the same day that Elena met Stefan). Bonnie uses her powers in times of significant purpose. She's shown herself to be very useful, resourceful, competent, helpful and beneficial during plans, battles, and missions. Bonnie is the most purposeful, useful and resourceful person in the entire series, simply because of her powerful abilities as a witch. In Dark Reunion, Bonnie begins practice and embrace her witchcraft (because of her witch ancestry). She successfully pulls off a summoning ritual to call Stefan (and later on, Damon) back to Fell's Church, then successfully manages to help Stefan communicate with Elena in spirit by various means through a dream sequence. At the end of Dark Reunion, Bonnie is the one who screams about the unfairness of their tragic fate, which triggers Elena's unexpected return from the afterlife or Spirit World. It is unknown if Bonnie's powers played any significant role in making this occur, or if it was just a matter of lucky timing (it was the night of the summer solstice, when ghosts were prone to returning to Earth from the Spirit World anyway). As the series progressed, she slowly realizes that she is not as unintelligent and dumb as she believes herself to be (and, as a result, as she's convinced everyone else she is). She realizes that she's actually capable of being intelligent when she puts her mind to it. Bonnie also comes to realize that many of her friends are strongly dependent on her; that they need Bonnie during times of need. Even though Bonnie is known to be timid, fragile, delicate and vulnerable, she is much stronger and tougher (physically, mentally and emotionally) than she appears to be on the outside. Even though she can be rather naive, idealistic, gullible, and trusting at times, Bonnie is rather sharp and challenging. She does have a highly passionate, emotional nature, even more passionate than Elena herself. Bonnie is idealistic and she is a hopeless romantic. Although Bonnie's character appears to be generally light-hearted, Bonnie possesses an inherently dark, brooding streak within her personality. She is deeply drawn to adventure and the dangerous, unusual, wild, and unpredictable side of life. Bonnie is deeply fascinated and intrigued with darkness, especially with death or dying, the occult, and morbidity. Bonnie frequently talks about death with a light hearted humour, much to Elena and Meredith's discomfort. Bonnie romanticizes and fantasizes about death, especially her own. She constantly talks about her Scottish grandmother's prophecy that she will die young; that she would be young and beautiful in her grave. She consistently talks about how romantically she might die. Bonnie has had some very dark, twisted fetishes and fantasies about romance, love and the opposite sex. She doesn't seem to show any disgust at the potential of being romantically involved with an edgy bad boy that is a potential criminal (such as a serial killer, rapist, abuser) who is extremely unconventional and does not live by the rules of society. Bonnie has a dark fetish about being tied up and being completely submissive to a very dominant, domineering, and controlling guy. Bonnie has openly stated that her deep, dark fantasy or fetish is being strangled, beaten up, or tied up by a hot guy (primarily someone who is a bad boy). As for the type of guy Bonnie seems to be attracted to, she seems to have a thing for very attractive, strong, dark, controlling, and compelling men. At the start, she is fickle in chasing after Stefan, and then Matt throughout the original series. By the end of the original series, however, Bonnie has become much more deep, mature, stable, and grounded, focusing on the more important problems at hand than about love, romance, flirting, and the opposite sex. She even surprises herself a few times with her own insightful contributions to the fight against a powerful Old One named Klaus. Bonnie, who is a highly strong witch, is overwhelmed by the strength of her powers at times. She attempts to repress the true extent of them without very much success. She is sometimes very afraid of what she can and might do and is scared of her strong powers using her, instead of the other way around. As a witch, Bonnie has intense dreams, prophetic flashes, visions and predictions, which has sometimes caused her to pass out, faint and become unconscious, because of its severe intensity at times. Bonnie is highly romantic. She seems to have a strong desire to belong to someone and give herself to someone completely and wholly. Bonnie is very naive and idealistic when it comes to love and romance. She seems to thrive on the idea of having a prince charming or a knight in shining armour constantly saving her and swooping her off her feet when she needs protecting. Bonnie is in love with the idea of love. She has consistently been fickle when it comes to the opposite sex throughout her life. She has a tendency to chase after boys for the hell of it; she seems to chase the opposite sex simply because she wants to or desires to belong to someone. Despite her constant chasing, Bonnie never seems satisfied with the boys that she does chase and date. She is extremely boy-crazy and unable to settle down with one particular guy for too long because of her addiction to flirting. Bonnie has had various boyfriends and flings. None of them she has managed to take seriously or stick with for a prolonged time. She seems highly fickle, flirtatious, coy and flighty when it comes to the opposite sex, mostly because of her immaturity and naivety regarding love and romance. She is unsure of what kind of man she is really looking for or interested in at the start of the story. Despite her immaturity in the love department, Bonnie is very passionate and emotional when it comes to love. She is a hopeless romantic at heart, someone who is willing to be completely devoted to another person. Bonnie can come off as jealous, clingy and dependent towards her potential romantic suitors. She does seem to have a particular type of guy that she is looking for; she seems strongly attracted to strong, powerful men who will go out of their way to protect her and keep her safe. At the start, she thought Stefan was very romantic, attractive and polite, and she was very thankful to him when he saved her from an intense situation with the History teacher, Mr. Tanner. She begins to develop some romantic feelings for her close friend Matt, although Matt was still very much in love with Elena at the time. However, Bonnie's relationship with Matt is highly platonic in nature. Matt has more of a brotherly relationship with Bonnie, meaning that he is quite protective of her (sometimes overly protective), especially when it comes to protecting her from Damon (whom Matt has always seen as potential danger or threat). Bonnie has a very deep, intense and complex connection and relationship with Damon. There is an indescribable, electrifying, and magnetic connection between Damon and Bonnie. Bonnie is Damon's weak spot and Damon has a lot of indescribable inner tenderness for her. Their connection and relationship is known as one of the most intriguing, unusual and interesting dynamics of the entire series (according to many readers), and their connection is an intriguing combination of platonic, romantic, and sexual in nature; crossing a fine line between genuinely innocent or pure and intensely, dangerously passionate and erotic. Despite the fact that Damon and Bonnie have had many moments of deep tenderness and affection (Damon has kissed her many times throughout the course of the series), Damon and Bonnie have also had somewhat of a chaotic, tumultuous relationship sparingly throughout the series. Bonnie was the very first person whom Damon met immediately after arriving in Fells Church. She has often talked about how gorgeous and inhumanely beautiful Damon is (beyond his physical appearance). She has even admitted to herself that he is almost more gorgeous than Damon's younger brother, Stefan. She seems strongly, magnetically drawn to Damon for indescribable reasons but part of the reason is because he is mysterious and edgy with a bad boy image. She is also deeply, strongly fascinated by his dark, compelling and powerful aura, which often causes her psychic powers to react, heighten and intensify immensely. Bonnie deeply, strongly as well as unconditionally cares about Damon despite what anyone else thinks or says about him (including her own friends Elena, Meredith and Matt), and Damon has saved her life when she has been in trouble on many occasions throughout the course of the series, including unexpectedly before the original series began (After Hours). She often believes in Damon; believing that Damon is a good, kind-hearted, compassionate, affectionate and caring person, despite him repeatedly trying to hide it through committing incessant immoral acts. Bonnie strongly feels that underneath the cold, uncaring exterior that Damon puts up as a wall for self-preservation, that he is a kind, gentle, tender person deep down within, who is simply highly misunderstood. She strongly believes in Damon regardless of the circumstances, even if Damon has treated her badly, due to his ego or selfish gratification. Bonnie was the very first person to see Damon's deeply buried, inner humanity. Damon naturally and effortlessly brings out a much stronger, deeper, passionate and mature person/side out of Bonnie. Damon has managed to have a strong, yet silent impact on Bonnie's involvement and personal development throughout the series. Because of Damon, Bonnie is able to see the world much differently then she did at the beginning of the series (which was a highly idealistic, shallow view), and therefore, she has become much more mature, practical and much more aware of the world around her. Out of everyone in the series, Damon is the one and only person who sees Bonnie's true, greatest and full potential as an individual and he sees her as a much stronger, passionate and powerful young woman at the core of her being (though he still thinks of her as a woman-child at times), even though she appears very fragile and vulnerable on the outside. Damon and Bonnie have shared many deep, intense and meaningful moments together in the series, although many of these \"special moments\" in which they have shared together have not been revealed throughout the series and have been rather 'secretive' in nature (although the reason for this is not known). Damon is fiercely and strongly protective of Bonnie and he will do absolutely anything at all costs to protect her from harm and keep her safe. He is also very nurturing, tender and gentle with her, even though he won't admit his actions of affection towards her to himself. He seems to always be there for her when she's in trouble, or when she calls him for help. Bonnie is the one person in the series who brings out the true human side in Damon naturally and effortlessly;thecaring, affectionate, compassionate, tender side of him \u2014the 'true Damon', which is deeply hidden within his soul. It is highly clear that Damon has a strong, indescribable soft spot and tenderness for Bonnie, although the exact reason for this is highly unexplained and unknown. In terms of outer personalities, Bonnie is the complete and total opposite of Damon in many ways. Bonnie has a lighter personality; Damon has a darker personality. Bonnie is more selfless and humble; Damon is more selfish, vain and proud. Bonnie is more weak, fragile and vulnerable; Damon is more dominant, powerful and strong. Bonnie is moral; Damon is immoral. Bonnie is more emotionally weak; Damon is more emotionally strong. Yet, despite the many differences in their outer personalities, Damon and Bonnie share a special, deep, strong affinity and bond with each other. In the Evensong trilogy, it has been strongly implied that Damon is Bonnie's soul mate. Bonnie is often referred to in the novels, especially in The Return: Nightfall, as a maiden. Damon often thinks of her as a maiden because of her innocence, although although she is the same age as Elena. In the novels, Damon often refers to her as a \"woman-child\". She is somewhat of a child and she faints constantly, as she lacks any control or self-restraint over her very strong psychic powers. Bonnie is very fragile and she is easily frightened and overwhelmed, although she does become a much stronger person as the series progresses. She is highly expansive and visionary, but she is quite damsel-in-distress like. Names [ ] BONNIE (Name #1)[ ] - Bonnie is a feminine given name of Scottish or Scots-Irish origin.

Powers[ ] Due to her witch ancestry, Bonnie possesses exceptionally strong magical powers, in the early stages where she came into them, frequently overwhelmed her completely because of their intensity. Because of this, she often tries to suppress the true extent of her powers as much as she could, but with little success: her formidable supernatural powers had caused her to either pass out or collapse numerous times throughout the series. However, as the series progressed, Bonnie learned to control and master her powers all by herself without any outside help, and they had often proved invaluable to her friends. Bonnie is now a powerful witch who has mastered the art of witchcraft and she often uses her magic to help the group during missions and battles. Bonnie is arguably the most powerful character in the series next to Damon, especially now that Elena has lost her angelic or Guardian powers and abilities and is now a normal human.

For example, if a witch casts a spell that grants immortality, the person that had immortality cast upon them may suffer some kind of weakness. Or if a witch uses magic to create a life, another life will be taken/someone will die in their place. - Fear: A distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc., whether the threat is real or imagined; the condition or feeling of being afraid could cause a witch to involuntarily block their own powers for a short time. - Stamina: Magic can be highly tiring and draining on one's stamina. Naturally, the stronger the magic or magic user, the greater the strain on stamina. - Mortality: Based off the fact that witches are still human, they share many of the same weaknesses as non-supernatural beings (e.g. age, decapitation, disease, heart-failure, suffocation, etc.). - Herbs: Ingestion of certain herbs can cause a witch to lose consciousness and prevent them from using magic for a undetermined amount of time. Another herb, Lobelia flower prevents concentration and the practice of magic and can be used to weaken a witch as one would weaken a vampire with vervain or a werewolf with wolfsbane. - Overexertion: The excessive use of magic could lead to disorientation, nose bleeds, fainting, unconsciousness, and if taken to the extreme, death. - Witchcraft: All magic can be undone through the use of witchcraft and with enough magical power any spell can be broken. - Stronger Magic: It can overcome weaker forms of magic. - Science Manipulation: Magic can react disastrously if Science is invovled. - Magic Resistance: The power to be highly resistant to Magic.

The user has the ability to use anti-magic which can nullify and destabilize most if not all forms of magic and even destroy a magic user's capability to utilize magic. They can achieve a variety of destructive effects on magic users, including crippling and/or killing them. - Magic Itself: Magic can be used to defeat or overcome magic. - Lack Of Knowledge: Without the knowledge or proper skill, the intended use of a spell can create unpredictable or potentially dangerous results. - Unpredictability: Magic is unpredictable, if one gets too creative or is interrupted in a crucial moment. Results range from amusing to annoying, but mendable, to destructive to lethal, to Catastrophic to Apocalyptic. - Societal Laws/Rules: Society with knowledge about magic is likely to have rules/laws about its use, and areas of magic that are forbidden. In some societies, magic may be limited to a specific class or status. - Imagination: User is unable to use spells that are beyond their imagination. - Actions/Conditions: May need to perform certain actions/fulfill conditions to use magic, ranging from specific words/songs, certain hand/body moves, materials that may be consumed or even extensive rituals. - Loss of Magic: Sometimes a magic user can lose their magic unexpectedly, rendering them powerless. - Physical/Emotional Side Effects: There are always possible physical and emotional side effects that can occr while using magic or after using magic. - Nature: It is said that nature will always find a balance when witchcraft is performed and spells will always have loopholes. This means, among other things, that no being can be truly immortal. - Bound Objects: Spells that persist beyond the moment when they are cast require that they be bound to a person or object so that they remain active, if the object is destroyed the spell will end. - Ashwood: Can prevent a Witch from using magic when inside a circle composed of this. - Iron Sulphate: Substance used to suppress the magic of witches. It is akin to wood for vampires; the element of iron acts like a poison to the bloodstream of a witch, and is extremely lethal to their kind. - Colocasia Powder: Powder that prevents the use of Dark Magic. - Witch Cruids: Magically enchanted bottles. When a bit of the witch's blood, a personal item, and some mandrake root are placed within and lit on fire, the witch will die instantly. - Sways: Magical objects used to transfer a witch's powers to another person, whether another witch or a mortal, willingly or otherwise, - Dark Witch Killing Ritual: A ritual usable by mortals (notably witch hunters) that kills a dark witch. - Malleus Maleficarum: A sigil that renders a witch, whether normal or dark, powerless so long as they remain within it. - Vampire Blood: Some witches can be allergic to vampire blood if they are fed it. Witches can potentially become violently ill and in extreme cases, can even die. Tools [ ] - AMULETS: An object that is used to protect its wearer from harm. - ATHAMES: A ceremonial dagger with a double-edged blade that is commonly used to direct energy. Many Witches own one or more ritual knives. These are commonly known as \"athames\" in Wiccan circles. In the Scottish traditions, the knife is called a \"yag-dirk\" and in Sax Wicca it is known as a \"seax\" (see-ax). As with all ritual tools, the athame is a very personal magickal item-one which you will want to take some care in obtaining. It should fit well and comfortably in your hand, for one thing. You certainly wouldn't want it to go flying across the room while you are casting a circle. This type of occurrence could cause a drastic drop in the attendance level at your next circle! Many Witches make their own blades or \"personalize\" purchased ones with runes, carvings and other symbols; all of which serve to blend the energy of the tool with their own magickal intentions. Modern Witchcraft books almost always state that the athame is a \"black handled double edged iron blade.\" You may call this model, \"the classic', if you like! But many other practitioners now use athames made from stainless steel, copper, silver and various other metals, or even carved stone. Some have family heirlooms, such as letter openers which serve the purpose. Some Witches never use a blade at all! So you can see, it is more important that the tool you choose suits you personally rather than reflect the latest fashion craze. The athame can be used to cast the magick circle, call the \"quarters\" or elements, and is part of many an opening ritual, handfasting (wedding) or initiation rite. It is associated with the element of Fire and the South. It is customary in some traditions to have your blade given to you as a gift. Some Witches or ceremonial workers give their tools a magickal \"name\". (This practice has become a common reference in many role playing games and fantasy novels.) Almost all materials written state-and most Witches/Wiccans, with the possible exception of the Sax Wiccans, agree- that magickal tools should not be used for any other purpose than ritual work. Often the blade is left \"dull\" or unsharpened because of this. (Another blade, the \"boleen\", with a white handle is sometimes used to harvest herbs or carve symbols, but not used for ritual work.) Some Witches will not let their tools be touched by anyone other than themselves. Some covens or working groups share common tools. It is, other than for those who are dedicated into a specific Tradition, what you are comfortable with. - BELLS: Bells have been around for many years, they come in different shapes and sizes, as well as different tones and sounds. The most popular bell in the US is the liberty bell. Another popular bell is the Notre Dame bell found in France. It is any wonder why we like these bell? It might just be the rhythmic sound and vibrations. People have been singing Songs and carols about this beautiful instruments for years, that might just be why there are associated with winter holidays. The bell also has magical associations. It has been believed for centuries to possess a magical and/or spiritual power. They are associated with the divine: their sound is symbolic of creative power, their shape a symbol of the female force and celestial vault. The bell is an uncommon tool. Yet, once you use it in a ritual, you might just feel the need to keep using it. There is no one way to use the bell, use your imagination! Here are a few ideas; you can use it to open and close the sacred circle, Invoke the Goddess, ring to ward off negative energies (as well as invite positive energies ), or use it to signal different sections of a ritual and/or Sabbat. But most of all have fun, create your own rituals using the bell! (bell thoughts submitted by Rain'). - BOLLINE: The Bolline or White-Handled knife as it is now known, is the practical knife of the craft. Traditionally it was used to harvest herbs and had a blade in the form of a small sickle. Today it is normally a mundane knife used for cutting and carving. It has a white handle to differentiate it from the Athame, which has a black handle and is used only for magickal purposes. The bolline is used to cut wands and herbs, to mark and carve candles with symbols and to cut cords for use in magick. Any other ritual function requiring the use of a knife, such as cutting flowers for the altar, can be performed with the bolline. - BOOK OF SHADOWS: The Book of Shadows is the workbook of the witch. In it is recorded: Rituals guidelines, Invocations, Spells, Runes, Rules of a particular Coven or Tradition, Symbols, Poems, Chants, and anything else of use to the witch during ritual. Traditionally the Book of Shadows was always hand written by the individual. A common custom for new initiates into a Coven, is to hand copy his teacher's Book of Shadows exactly as it appeared, then later to add his own material as he progressed in the craft. Today with the advantages of technology they are often typed and photocopied, or even computerised onto Floppy Disc's. To make your own Book of Shadows, you can use any form of blank book, but perhaps the best type to use are those of a loose-leave nature, thus allowing pages to be shuffled around when preparing for rituals. My personal Book of Shadows is made from recycled paper, bound up in natural tree bark covers, these are available in some art shops and bookstores. - BROOM: The broom is a ritual tool of the witch, sacred to both Goddess and the God. The God - through its symbolic phallic shape, The Goddess - through its three-piece make up, the stick, brush and binding cord being symbolic of the triformis aspect of the Goddess. Traditionally the broom was made from three different woods. Ash for the handle, Birch twigs for the brush and Willow for the binding cord. Ash is protective and has command over the four elements. Birch is purifying and draws spirits to one's service. Willow is sacred to the Goddess. The broom is used for a variety of purposes but most generally to purify and protect. It is used to ritually cleanse an area before magick is performed by symbolically sweeping away negative energies and astral build up. Of old it was used to guard the home and persons within against psychic attack or evil curses, this by placing it across the threshold, windowsills or doorways. It was also placed under the bed or a pillow to protect the sleeper. Traditionally and perhaps the use which most people identify it with, are the old wedding ceremonies of the Gypsies and the early American slaves, where a couple leapt over the broom to ensure fertility, domestic harmony and longevity. Today pagan hand-fasting rituals often include a broom jump. - CANDLES AND FIRE: A block of solid wax with an embedded wick that is commonly lit to to amplify a witch's spell. Witches use candles in their spells to aid them and channel the flames. This enhances their magic as they draw energy from the flames. Fire is a strong component in Witchcraft as it is the main offensive tool used. It has also been used as barriers and to destroy objects. They also use candles in channeling. Channeling is when a witch siphons power of an element, celestial event or even another witch. Candles have been used as a Witches' tool for centuries, as they have been used by many other religions for the setting of the proper atmosphere to help attract or to influence a particular power. There are many factors that play into the power of the candle, as it absorbs one's personal energy from their consciousness and releases that energy in the dancing flame. The color of the candle is very important when performing rituals or magic, for each color emits a particular vibration and attracts certain influences. - CAULDRONS: A large metal pot that is commonly used to hold the ingredients for elixirs and potions. The cauldron is probably the tool most associated with witchcraft and is steeped in magickal tradition and mystery. The cauldron is the container in which transmutation, germination, and transformations may occur. It is symbolic of the womb of the Goddess, and is the manifested essence of femininity and fertility. Everything is born from the cauldron of the Goddess and afterwards everything returns back to it. It is also symbolic of the element of water, as well as reincarnation, immortality and inspiration. In ritual the cauldron is used as a container for making brews and potions, or to contain a small fire for use with spells. It can also be used for scrying (divination) by filling it with water and gazing into its depths. In ancient times the cauldron was used as a cooking vessel and for brew making. Traditionally it was made from cast iron, it rests on three legs and has an opening smaller then its widest part. Cauldrons are made in many sizes but can be difficult to find, so you will need to persevere if you want one. - CHALICE: The chalice or cup is used on the altar to represent the Female principle of Water. The Chalice is one of the four elemental tools of witchcraft and represents the elements of Water. It is a symbol of containment and often represents the womb of the Goddess. The base is symbolic of the material world, the stem symbolises the connection between man and spirit and the rim or opening symbolically receives spiritual energy. The chalice can be made of any material, in times of old - Horns, Shells and Gourds were used to hold sacred liquids during ritual, and then in later times - Silver became the preferred material, having long been associated with the moon and the Goddess. The chalice is used to hold the blessed water and wine during ritual. It is traditional in many covens to pass the chalice around all members, who then take a drink as a token of unity. - THE CIRCLE: Before enacting a ritual, witches usually create a ritual circle to provide a safe haven for the purpose of working magick. The Circle exists outside the boundaries of ordinary space and time, between the worlds of the seen and the unseen. It is a space in which alternate realities meet, in which the past and future are one. The circle represents unity, completion, continuity, and wholeness, as well as protection. and the circle also corresponds to the annual cycle known as the Wheel of the Year. Many circles are not physical, but exist as energy patterns created by an enacted meditation of words, gestures and/or visualizations. Physical circle are constructed with stones, plants, candles, sacred symbols objects, sacred symbols or just a drawn circle to form the circle's perimeter, providing a clear boundary between mundane and sacred space for the enactment of ancient rites and rituals. - DAGGERS: The blades are used in various areas of Witchcraft, especially those concerning the sacrifices. The name used to indicate magical knives is athame, especially in Wicca, where, however, are not used to cut or remove blood but only to direct energy. In Sacrificial Magic daggers are being used to kill the victim and absorb its power. - DARK OBJECTS: Dark Objects are ordinary objects which are enchanted with dark magic and are commonly used to carry out a malevolent task. Exactly like a regular enchanted object, a witch will attach a spell to the object and that object will contain that spell from the moment it is created until the moment it is destroyed or a witch removes the spell. These objects can also be used by humans against the supernatural and, in some cases, against the witches themselves. Dark Objects can not only be used by humans and supernatural beings for various effects, but they can also be channeled by witches as an additional power source to enhance their spells as a result of the objects' mystical nature. - ELIXIRS/POTIONS/TONICS: An elixir is a clear, sweet-flavored liquid used for medicinal purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one's ills. In traditional belief, an elixir is a transport device for enchanted magic. Elixirs, or potions, are liquids that have been enchanted with sorcery to issue a spell's effects upon a biological imbiber of the drink or a material object doused by it. - GRIMOIRES: A family journal is documented with magical recipes, rituals, and spells. A Grimoire is a magic spellbook where a witch records all of her/his spells, rituals, potions, and herbs. It can be filled with information of hexes and spells. There is no original grimoire, they vary in size and contents depending on the witches who own them. Some grimoires are more valuable than others because of their content, and vary in size and content. Some are aesthetically beautiful, leather-bound, and with pages of parchment, others seem only old books with torn pages. A Grimoire is a witch's personal book of rituals and lore, which is usually handwritten and kept by the individual witch. The name \"Grimoire\", (deriving from the Old French word for letters; \"grammaire\"), is a general term, as the true name for the book is kept secret by most traditions and even when the name for this book is discussed, it will often vary between the traditions. (In Wicca it is called \"The Book of Shadows\"). The witch's Grimoire contains rituals, invocations, traditions, symbols, poems, chants, legends, stories and anything else thought to be important by the individual witch. The contents are most often based upon the lore of a particular tradition, but it will also contain many personal flourishes as well. It is sometimes written in \"runes\" or pictures so that it cannot be read by the uninitiated. An apprentice witch's Grimoire is usually begun by being hand copied from a teacher's Grimore and then later added to by the apprentice as they progress in the craft. - HERBS: Various flora used as ingredients to be incorporated into spells as binding agents. Witches use stones and herbs in their magic as many of them have magical properties. Amber crystal protects a witch from evil, Vervain protects them from vampires and Wolfsbane protects them from Werewolves. The later two have the same effect but are for vampires and werewolves, respectively. They cause the victim to be weak and feverish when ingested similar to poisoning. - THE HOMELAND: A deep spiritual connection to the ancestral homeland lies in the heart of the true witch and \"The Homeland\" is quite possibly the most important aspect of Traditional Witchcraft. The ancestral homeland is the home of the Gods and Goddesses, and in many beliefs the two are synonymous. The early inhabitants of Europe believed that the spirits they venerated inhabited the land itself. Many were migratory people, and when they traveled across the continent they took their deities with them. When these early Europeans wished to honor their deities, they created a connection between their ancestral homeland and the land where they now stood. In this way, the new land becomes a part of their ancestral homeland, along with its spirits and when a Witch wishes to connect with these spirits they evoke (or invoke) the spirits of the land itself. - MORTAR AND PESTAL: In every witch's kitchen there is a mortar and pestle. The pestle is a heavy stick whose end is used for pounding and grinding, and the mortar is a bowl. A mortar and pestle are tools used to grind together herbs for spells, rituals and healing. In ancient times, herbalism was a mixture of medicine and magic and herbs have been used in magical rituals for centuries. They are one of the main tools of the Witch and Witchcraft has maintained a long tradition of honoring and keeping the ancient ways of the use of herbs. - PATON (OR ALTAR PENTACLE): The Altar pentacle is usually a disk or plate of metal or wood inscribed with the five pointed star in a circle. (See our pentacle section for more details on the pentagram and its meanings.) This is set upon the altar and used to consecrate various other tools and as a focal point of concentration for magickal workings. It is associated with the Female North and the element of Earth. Some Witches use a paton when calling in the elements as well. Patons (sometimes \"peytons\" or \"patens\") can now be found made of ceramic and glass. You can even make your own from clay or simply draw and color one on stiff paper. In some references, it is stated that patons in the 'old days\" were only made from disposable materials so that evidence of your beliefs could be quickly burned should the authorities come knocking at your door! - PENTACLE: A pentacle, (or when drawn \"a pentagram\" ), is a five-pointed star pattern, surrounded by a circle, with its apex pointing upward toward the Divine. It is one of the most potent, powerful, and persistent symbols in human history and also one of the most recognized symbols of witches and witchcraft. The five points of the pentacle symbolize the four directions and the fifth is a symbol of the sanctity of the Spirit, with the circle symbolizing unity and wholeness. The five angles of the pentacle also represent the five metaphysical elements of Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Spirit. When used in rituals it is believed that the pentacle may act as a portal between the material world and world of spirits. Many witches wear a pentagram as a sign of their religion, (like a crucifix or Star of David), or as an amulet, charm or talisman, and when made out of silver it is said to represent the moon energy. Ceremonial altars often feature a pentagram and the image is also found on many ceremonial tools such as cauldrons, and chalices. Originally formed from the clay of the Earth, today pentacles are more often crafted in metals such a copper, brass, silver or gold. - RUNES: The word \"rune\" comes from the Old English word \"rown\", which means \"mystery\" or \"secret\". The first runes were carved and not written and \"to rune\" something means to inscribe upon an item with a secret language and thus give magickal effect to what is inscribed. Throughout history, many magickal alphabets have been formed out of pre-existing alphabets. By changing the old alphabets slightly and adding personal flourishes, one is able to make a runic alphabet. After a runic alphabet has been designed, it is usually dedicated for the purpose as such. Runes can be used for writing things which one does not want others to be able to read; a form of encryption. They can also be written or inscribed for magickal workings. (The use of magickal alphabets was forbidden by early Christian priests because of their use within Heathenism and magick and as late as the 17th century people were killed in Iceland for the use of runic alphabets.) To read the runes aloud will release something that is bound and to inscribe the rune on an object takes on magickal meanings and the runing of the object and is said to imbue magick and power onto it. - STONES: Various minerals and ores used to boost or bind a witch's spell. Stones and minerals are often used by witches as a vessel that they can imbue with their magic, in conjunction with their already existing magical properties. This could mean binding a spell or enchanting the stone to serve a specific purpose. They can also be used as a repository for magic that can be channeled by a witch for additional power, which is typically used in the form of a talisman. Breaking the bond between a spell and a talisman is often a tedious task as each talisman is unique. - SWORD: With the coming of the modern \"Celtic Revival\", the sword has become a very popular-and quite showy- magickal tool. It can used in place of, or in addition to, the athame. Most groups who hold rituals indoors usually limit the use of the sword to just one for the Priest/Priestess. Ten five- foot swords in a small room could get a bit messy, I would think! However at festivals and outdoor rituals, Witches often bring their own swords to mark the boundaries or quarter points of the circle. There is now a growing interest in actual \"sword play\" and entire festivals have sprung up which feature events based on swordsman- or woman!-ship. - SYMBOLS: Seals drawn or written used as physical representations of spells. Symbols are various seals and markings used to represent an object, function, or process. They are used extensively by witches in their practice of magic usually in the form of rituals though, they may also act as physical representations of spells as well. - TALISMANS: An object that is used to magnify a witch's power. Witches use material items that act as talismans. They are usually in the form of a crystal or stone and made as a personal object to the witch. It can increase their powers and help them to channel magic. The talisman, also, has the power to incorporate external energy and be used if required by the witch, as demonstrated by Freya. When a talisman is full of magic, it can greatly increase the power of spells and rituals. Probably the material they are made plays a key role in the power of the talisman itself. - THURIBLE (OR INCENSE BURNER): A container used to contain a hot coal for burning incense. This is best made from a fire resistant or fire proof material. The most common are the \"mini-cauldrons' of iron and the various brass types which come in wonderful shapes and sizes. Some even hang on a chain. The incense itself represents the element of Air while the fire (charcoal) represents Fire. The combination of these two elements are used to purify ritual areas, other tools or the circle itself.

Bonnie inherited the magical gift from her mother's bloodline. Her maternal grandmother was a powerful sorceress like Bonnie. According to Bonnie's maternal grandmother, she has a lineage of both White Magic and Dark Magic, meaning that there were witches amongst her bloodline who were good and practiced good magic and also other witches amongst her bloodline who were bad/evil and practiced bad magic. As a result, she is capable of exorcising and practicing White Magic or Black/Dark Magic due to her matriarchal bloodline possessing both kinds of magic. - Bonnie met Damon before Elena (After Hours). - Bonnie kissed Damon before Elena (After Hours). - Bonnie is presumed to be the one true soulmate (or twin flame) of Damon Salvatore, although this has not yet fully been confirmed as there has been no visible silver cord seen connecting Damon and Bonnie through astral projection. They do display all of the signs and symptoms of a twin flame or soulmate connection such as electric shocks and jolts by physical touching or kissing, ability to read each other minds, strong telepathic connection, ability to sense and feel each other's feelings and emotions without words, etc. In order for their twin flame/soulmate connection to be 100% confirmed or established is for either Damon or Bonnie to have an out of body experience through astral projection (similar to what Elena experienced with Stefan in \"Shadow Souls\" when she saw the silver cord connecting her's and Stefan's souls together or Adam and Cassie from \"The Secret Circle\" discovering that they are connected through a visible silver cord). Both Stefan/Elena and Adam/Cassie are 100% confirmed twin flame soulmate couples because both couples have discovered the silver cord connection with or without astral projection. The same silver cord connecting true soulmates together phenomenon is also highly prevalent in the Night World Series for true soulmate couples such as - Bonnie is of Scottish and Irish descent. Her mother Aileen's side are of Scottish descent or origin but her father Seamus is of both Scottish and Irish descent or origin. She has paternal ancestors that are of Irish descent.

Because of this, she possesses magic abilities and powers that were passed down to her from her ancestors. - Bonnie's magic abilities are from her maternal or matriarchal side and they always skip a generation. For example, her maternal grandmother Lilias has magical abilities and is a witch but her mother, Aileen, is a regular human and does not have magical abilities. Her older sister Mary also doesn't have magical abilities either. Either Mary has them and they have remained dormant because she has chosen to not master them or she has inherited the gift from her mother but has chosen to not practice witchcraft. It is unknown if her other sisters practice magic like Bonnie since like Mary, they all possess the gift of magic. - Bonnie had a dog named Yatzee. - Bonnie loves red roses and white lilies. - Bonnie's favourite piece of jewelry is her white opal ring, which is all colours and which she wears with every kind of clothing, both casual and formal. - Bonnie is the only witch in the series. - Bonnie's counterparts from other LJ Smith books and series are Cassie Blake (The Secret Circle), Sarah Strange (Night World), Kaitlyn Fairchild (Dark Visions), Poppy North (Night World), and Winfrith \"Winnie\" Arlin (Night World). - Bonnie McCullough & Cassie Blake - Bonnie and Cassie are rather similar in looks and physical appearance.

Both Cassie and Bonnie have similar hair colours, although Bonnie's hair is described to be fiery red while Cassie's hair is more of a topaz-auburn. Cassie and Bonnie also have rather similar personalities and temperaments. They are both childlike, innocent, insecure and shy at first but they are very friendly, bubbly, upbeat, and good natured once they get to know someone. They both lack confidence about their physical appearance and do not seem to acknowledge how pretty and beautiful they really are. Other people (such as Adam and Nick in Cassie's case and Damon, Matt, Stefan, Zander and Bastian in Bonnie's case) are always the ones to notice or acknowledge their physical beauty. Cassie and Bonnie also go through similar journeys in that they become more confident and self assured as their respective series progresses. Cassie and Bonnie are also described to be the pretty girl next door but become beautiful or stunning when they dress up in highly fashionable or fancy clothing and do their hair and makeup. In addition, Bonnie and Cassie are seen to be very kind, caring, empathetic, compassionate and selfless. They are both extremely loyal to their friends and they are always willing to help them as well as others who are in need of comfort, help and support. Cassie and Bonnie both start of unsure about their powers and abilities as a witch.

Sarah and Bonnie are both very fragile and delicate looking. They are both petite in stature and have a willowy appearance.

Others have compared Bonnie's looks to that of a fairy or pixie, which is a Celtic/European mythical creature, while others have compared Sarah's looks to that of a \"dryad\", which is a Greek female nature spirit. Despite their obvious physical beauty, Sarah and Bonnie are both highly insecure about their looks and have insecuriies regarding their physiques. Both of them acknowledge that they lack having a womanly figure and are too flat chested. Personality wise, Sarah and Bonnie are both insecure and shy girls and do not understand why they receive male attention or protection (Mal and Kierlan in Sarah's case; Damon, Zander, Stefan, Matt and Bastian in Bonnie's case) because they do not think much of their physical appearance. As a result, Sarah and Bonnie are both confused as to why certain boys are romantically attracted to them (Kierlan/Mal in Sarah's case; Damon/Bastian in Bonnie's case).

Both Sarah and Bonnie suffer from physical ailments due to their respective abilities (Sarah gets bad migraines and nightmares when she has visions/premonitions; Bonnie gets nosebleeds and faints/blacks out when she loses control of her witch abilities). - Bonnie McCullough & Kaitlyn Fairchild - Bonnie and Kaitlyn are similar in physical appearance with both of them having red hair (Bonnie's hair is a fiery red color while Kaitlyn's hair is a autumn fire color). Bonnie and Kaitlyn are also very fair skinned due to their Celtic/Gaelic ethnic background. They are also very slender and slight in height and physique, with a willowy and fragile appearance.

Both Bonnie and Kaitlyn are involved in a love triangle and are torn between an \"edgy, rebellious, charming bad boy\" (Gabriel in Kaitlyn's case; Damon in Bonnie's case) and a \"noble, heroic, good boy with a dark streak\" (Rob in Kaitlyn's case; Bastian in Bonnie's case).
