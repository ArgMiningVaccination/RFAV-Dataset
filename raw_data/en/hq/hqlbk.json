On the one hand, two naturally occurring betulinic acid saponins isolated from Chinese medicinal plants bearing an a-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (l-\u00bb2)-a-L-arabmopyranose moiety, a library of eight bidesmosidic saponins with betulin and betulinic acid as aglycones as well as five lupane- and germanicane-type chacotnosidic derivatives have been synthesized via the use of different glycosy\u00eeation methods such as Schmidt's normal and inverse procedures and phase-transfert conditions. On the other hand, structure-activity relationship study reveals that highly polar sugar moieties at the C-3 position of the lupane skeleton have a negative impact on the anticancer activity while the activity is increased for the germanicane-type triterpenoids. Otherwise, the presence of an L-rhamnose moiety at the same position increases the cytotoxicity of lupane-type saponins such as betulin 3,28-O-bis-a-L- rhamnopyranoside, which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against the cell lines from the most prevalent human cancers (IC50 = 1.7-1.9 umol'L\" '). Contrary to naturally occurring oleanane-type most the lupane-type saponins and parent triterpenoids betulin and betulinic acid do not induce any haemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells (HD50 >10Q umol^L\"1) independently of the nature of the sugar moieties. Also, 28-G-j8-D-glueuronide betulinic acid, which is an acyl glucuronide metabolite, has been efficiently synthesized and could be used as an anticancer prodrug pour groupement la inverse de Schmidt et les conditions r\u00e9actiomielles par transfert de phase.

The overall syntheses involved eight linear steps starting from allyl betulinate and commercially available L-arabinose, L-rhamnose analogues containing an a-L-arabinose moiety are also reported. These results open the way to the synthesis of various lupane-type saponin derivatives as potentially bioactive compounds.69 INTRODUCTION Natural products (NPs) have attracted increased attention over the last century as an important source of new drag leads for the pharmaceutical industry.1\"4 In the domain of cancer research, 47% of antitumour compounds approved from 1940 to 2006 are either NPs or their semi-synthetic derivatives.5 Saponins are a specific class of NPs widely distributed in the plant kingdom, which consist of a triterpenoid or steroid skeleton bearing one or more sugar chains.6 They exhibit numerous pharmacological and biological properties such as anti-inflammatory,7 haemolytic,8 cytotoxic and antitumour9 activities. Since many commonly used traditional Chinese drags are rich in saponins,10 some authors considered them responsible along with polyphenols for the majority of biological effects observed in the Chinese medical literature.11 However, the isolation of saponins from plant extracts is often a long and fastidious process and usually only small amounts of products are obtained in a pure and homogeneous form.12 Therefore, chemical syntheses are needed and appear to be a realistic way to gain access to a broad library of saponin glycoforms in order to study the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of this important class of NPs.13 Betulin (1) and its C-28 carboxylic derivative betulinic acid (2) (Figure 1) are naturally pentacyclic lupane-type triterpenoids that possess multiple pharmacological activities.14'15 Betulinic acid (2) has the ability to inhibit the growth of various cancerous cell lines in vitro without affecting normal cells. The in vivo antitumour activity of betulinic acid (2) was also confirmed whereas no other toxicity was observed on tumour-bearing mice at doses of 500 mg/kg body weight after intraperitoneal injections.17'18 Thus, due to the selective cytotoxicity and favourable therapeutic index, which are in contrast with the majority of antitumor agents actually used in chemotherapy, betulinic acid (2) is considered a promising anticancer agent.19'20 Nonetheless, further clinical development of betulin (1), betulinic acid (2) and lupane-type analogues is strongly hampered since they are virtually insoluble in water (0.02 (ig/mL for 2)21'22 and possess high partition coefficient values (log P>6) which complicate the preparation of injectable formulations for biological assays and decrease their bioavailability in the70 organism.23 The introduction of polar groups at either C-3 or C-28 positions such as phthalates,24 amino acids25'26 or sugar moieties27'28 is an interesting avenue to increase the hydrosolubility of lupane-type triterpenoids 1 and 2. Recently, our preliminary SAR studies have shown that adding an a-L-rhanmopyranose moiety at the C-3 position of 2 resulted in a significant increase of both the water solubility and the in vitro cytotoxic activity against human lung carcinoma (A549) and human colon adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) cancer cell lines.27 Therefore, it was postulated that betulinic acid saponins represent an interesting class of potent anticancer agents and require additional investigations. Lupane-type saponins having betulin (1) or betulinic acid (2) as aglycones are rarely isolated from a natural source29*31 and their chemical syntheses are very scarce in the ,^27,28,32-37 Betuliiiic acid 3p-0-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l-\u00bb2)-[(3-D- glucopyranosyl-(l-\u00bb4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside (3) (Figure 1) is a naturally occurring monodesmosidic saponin isolated from the roots of Pulsatilla koreana, which is a plant widely used in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of malaria, amoebic dysentery and various cancers.31 Saponin 3 exhibited moderate in vitro cytotoxicity against A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2 and HCT15 cancer cell lines and significant in vivo anticancer activity against BDF1 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC).38'39 The particular trisaecharide chain at the C-3 position of saponm 3 has been shown to be a nontoxic moiety which would increase the activity and water solubility once conjugated to NPs. Another 28-O-p-D-glucopyranosyl betulinic acid 3p-0-a-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(l-^2)-a-L-arabinopyranoside (4) (Figure 1) isolated from the aerial parts of Schefflera rotundifolia, a plant used as folk remedies for the treatment of pain, rheumatic arthritis and lumbago in Asian countries, exhibited noticeable antiproiiferative activity against J774.A1, and HEK-293 an a-L-rhaimopyranosyl~(l\u2014\u00bb2)-ot-L-arabinopyranose moiety at the C-3 position have already been isolated from P. chinensis, which is one of the most well- known plants used in traditional Chinese medicine.29'41\"43 Hence, as part of our71 efforts to prepare lupane-type saponins as anticancer agents,27'28 this report describes the first synthesis of two naturally occurring betulinic acid saponins (3 and 4). The syntheses analogues containing a-L-arabinose are also reported. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To our knowledge, the synthesis of betulinic acid saponins bearing a unique a-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(l\u2014\u00bb2)-a-L-arabinopyranosyl moiety at the C-3 position such as natural saponins 3 and 4 has never been reported until now. Two general synthetic approaches exist in the literature for this particular type of intersugar linkage.13 One strategy consists in preparing the disaccharide donor followed by coupling with the triterpene or steroid aglycone.44\"45 Since, in this case, the arabinose residue does not contain a neighbouring participating group at the C-2 position, the main inconvenience of this convergent glycosylation is the formation of an a/p anomeric mixture which complicates the further purification of intermediates.'\"3'44'45 In this work, we adopted the stepwise glycosylation approach in which the arabinose residue containing a C-2 neighbouring participating group was first coupled with the aglycone. This linear strategy was shown to form a stereospecific 1,2-trans glycosidic bond'*3 usually found in the linkage of natural triterpenoid saponins.12 Moreover, stepwise extension of the sugar chain allows the preparation of a great variety of analogues by simply altering the monosaccharide donors,46 Thus, such an approach to provide saponin glycoforms may be of further interest for studies regarding the SAR of natural and non-natural saponms and their development as pharmaceutical or biological agents. Saponins 3 and 4 can be retrosynthetically (Figure 2) disconnected into distinct fragments: the natural lupane-type betulinic acid (2) and the commercially available monosaccharides L-arabinose, L-rhamnose and D-glucose. As shown in Figure 2, the benzoyl participating groups were selected as protecting groups for the sugar donors 5-8 since they avoid the formation of rrans-esterification products47'48 in comparison72 with the acetyl groups and can be easily removed under alkaline conditions without hydrolysis of the C-28 ester in the aglycone. In addition, the anomeric position of sugar donors 5, 6 and 8 was activated by the trichloroacetimidate (TCA) group which was first devised by R.R. Schmidt in the early 1980s50 and shown to be ideal donors for the coupling with steroids and triterpenoids using various Lewis acids as promoters such as trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) or boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3\u00bbOEt2).51 While TCA donors are usually used for the preparation of ether-glycosides,13'47 we planned to employ the sugar donor bromide 752 in order to selectively glycosylate the C-28 carboxylic acid function and produce the ester-glycoside at a later stage of the synthesis after assembly of the disaccharide.5 As depicted in Scheme 1, the starting point of our synthesis consisted in the preparation of the known 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-P-L-arabinopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (8). ' Accordingly, the commercial L-arabinose was subjected to perbenzoylation with benzoyl chloride (BzCl) using a catalytic amount of 4- dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) at 60 \u00b0C. The crude residue was then brominated (33% HBr/HOAc) at the anomeric position, hydrolyzed with silver carbonate (Ag2COs) in an acetone/water solution activated using and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) to famish 8 in 38% yield after four However, two anomeric protons signals \u00f4 visualized in the !H NMR spectrum indicating that, unexpectedly, the resulting product was an inseparable mixture of 8 and 2,3,5-tri-O- C-4 (\u00d4 84.3 ppm) confirmed the presence of the TCA 9 in the mixture. It was further postulated that the furanosyl form of the arabinose residue was produced during the benzoylation step since the conversion of pyranose to furanose in hot pyridine is not unprecedented. To confirm this hypothesis, in a separate experiment, L-arabinose was perbenzoylated under the previously mentioned conditions but keeping the temperature under 25 \u00b0C throughout the73 overnight reaction to afford l,2,3,4-tetra-0~benzoyl-P-L-arabinopyranose (10, 91%) along with 1,2,3,5-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-L-arabinofuranose (11) in only 1% yield. This time, the purification by silica gel (SiCh) column chromatography allowed the separation because both products 10 and 11 presented a significant difference in their retention factors according to TLC (hexanes/EtOAc 3:1). Afterwards, 10 was brominated and hydrolyzed to furnish 12 (73%, two steps) which was activated with CCI3CN and DBU to yield 8 (80%) as a pure P-anomeric form without any trace of 9. With TCA sugar donor 8 in hand, the next task was its linkage to the 3-OH of the lupane core of betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2). As previously described, pure 1 (>95%, GC-MS) was obtained by exhaustive extractions in dichloromethane (CH2CI2) of the external bark of Betula papyrifera followed by recrystallization.28 The natural carboxylic derivative 2 was then synthesized from 1 following known methodologies. Here, the choice of the protecting groups at the C-28 position of triterpenoids 1 and 2 was crucial for the synthetic strategy since benzoyl groups have to be removed under basic conditions without affecting this position. Thus, as revealed in Scheme 2, we planned to temporarily protect the C-28 carboxylic acid position of betulinic acid (2) with an allyl ester as already reported by our laboratory in an earlier publication.27 In addition, betulin (1) was treated with tert- butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSC1) in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF) to yield the new compound 13 (90%) protected at the C-28 primary alcohol position by the most robust among silyl groups.57 The regioselectivity of the silylation reaction was confirmed from the upfield shift in the ]H NMR signal of the (8 3.81 ppm in 1 to 3.68 ppm in 13). For the introduction of the arabinose moiety, we chose to use the mixture of TCA donors 8 and 9 in order to obtain both arabinopyranoside and arabinofuranoside saponins which could be of further interest for SAR investigations. Indeed, although the isolation of natural saponins bearing an a-L-arabinofuranosyl residue was already reported, ' studies regarding their synthesis are scarce. ~62 Consequently, according to Scheme 2, coupling of the acceptor 13 with a mixture of donors 8 and 974 under the catalytic promotion of TMSOTf in dry CH2CI2 followed by subsequent removal of benzoyl groups using 0.25 N NaOH in a solution of 1:2:1 afforded the C-28 protected betulin along with the 3p-0-a-L-arabinofuranoside 16b (13%, two steps). Moreover, similar treatment of acceptor 17, i.e. coupling with donors 8 and 9 and deprotection of the benzoyl groups, furnished allyl betulinate 19b were obtained in good yields (66% and 71%, respectively) by the subsequent deprotection of the allylic ester and pyrrolidine in dry other hand, the overnight desilylation of 16a and 16b by the action of 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in HO Ac 1:1 under reflux ' was sluggish affording the target saponins 15a and 15b in unoptimized 42% and 37% yields, respectively. Thus, in order to increase the overall yields, the known acceptor 28-acetyl betulin (14) ' was coupled with the donors 8 and 9 in a separate experiment and deprotected using the above mentioned methodology to access 15a (73%, two steps) and 15b (15%, two steps). As expected, the coupling constant data on the H NMR spectra confirmed the a-anomeric configuration of the achieve the Rhap(l\u2014>2)Aiap intersugar linkage, the synthesis started with the regioselective protection of 3'- and 4'-OH of the arabinose moiety (Scheme 3). Accordingly, the treatment of 16a under the catalytic action of pyridinium p- toluenesulfonate (PPTs) conjunction isopropylidenated in 60% yield. The treatment of the arabinoside 18a under similar reaction conditions furnished 20b (74%). We first attempted to glycosylate the equatorial with the known 2,3,4-tri-O- benzoyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (6)27 using TMSOTf as the promoter at -10 \u00b0C to room temperature. Unfortunately, the reaction was sluggish providing the target disaccharide glycoside 21b in an unsatisfactory 22% yield. One75 possible explanation for the moderate yield was the rapture of the isopropylidene group which led to the formation of a complex mixture of products. 3 Thus, by modifying the reaction conditions, it was found that the sugar donor 6 could be coupled with the acceptor 20b under the promotion of the Lewis acid BF3\u00abOEt2 in CH2CI2 at a cryogenic temperature of -78 \u00b0C in a nearly quantitative yield (99%). Glycosylation of the acceptor 20a with 6 using the same conditions proceeded smoothly to give the protected disaccharide saponin 21a in a good THF, room temperature] were performed experimental conditions to provide C-28 deprotected derivatives 22a arabinopyranosyl moiety at the C-3 position were successfully obtained after the deprotection of the isopropylidene group using /j-toiuenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH\u00bbH2O) in a dry CH2Cl2/MeOH 1:2 MeOH/THF/H2O 1:2:1) in 84% and 61% yields, respectively, over two steps. As expected, regarding saponins 23a and 23b, the two anomeric proton signals on the !H NMR spectra indicated the a-anomeric configuration of the rhamnopyranosyl ppm, rhamnose for the (1\u2014>2) intersugar linkage. At this stage of the synthesis, we wished to prepare the natural betulinic acid saponin 3 starting from the fully protected derivative 21b. According to Scheme 4, the deisopropylidenation was achieved by treatment of 21b with TsOH\u00bbH2O (0.7 equiv) in a dry CH2Cl2/MeOH 1:2 solution to afford 24 in 70% yield. Surprisingly, the !H NMR spectrum of 24 showed that, once the isopropylidene was removed, the arabinopyranosyl moiety underwent a ring-flipping to adopt preferentially the !C476 chair conformation rather than the usual 4Ci one.46 Indeed, the coupling constant of the proton H-l' was relatively small (Ji;2 3.3 Hz) in comparison with 21b (Ji^ 7.5 Hz). Recently, this unusual !C4 chair conformation was reported in the literature for saponins containing an a-L-arabinopyranose moiety with a bulky group at the C-2'.44\" 46>65 In the !C4 conformation, the 4'-OH is in the equatorial position while the 3'-OH is in the axial position. Since it is known that the equatorial hydroxyl groups are more reactive than the axial ones,66 we planned to directly glycosylate this position in order to avoid tedious protection-deprotection reactions which would increase the number of steps of the synthesis.40'63 Therefore, as shown in Scheme 4, the acceptor 24 was coupled with the known donor 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (5)27 under the promotion of TMSOTf (0.1 equiv) in CH2CI2 at low temperature (-10 \u00b0C) to provide the desired protected 25 in 50% corrected yield along with the unreacted 24 (15%). The regioselectivity of this reaction was clearly proved by 2D NMR HMBC analyses which showed a strong correlation between the proton H-l'\" of the glucopyranose (\u00f4 5.12 ppm, d, C-4' of the arabinose (8 76.0 ppm). It is worth noting that the arabinose moiety of the protected saponin 25 adopted the unusual '\u20ac4 chair conformation as revealed by the small coupling constant of the proton H-l' (6 4.65 ppm, d, J\\t2 3.8 Hz). Subsequent removal of the allyl and benzoyl groups of protected derivative 25 using the above mentioned methodology afforded the natural betulinic acid saponin 3 (60%, two steps) in which the arabinose residue retrieved the typical C\\ conformation (5 4.79 ppm, d, Ji;2 6.1 Hz, H-l'). The overall yield for the synthesis was 10% over eight linear steps from allyl betulinate (17). The physical and analytical data (*H NMR, '\"C NMR and [a] 5D) of 3 were all consistent with those reported for the natural product isolated from the roots of P. koreana. The last step of our work was to incorporate a glucopyranosyl moiety at the C-2 8 position of 22b with the aim of synthesizing the natural betulinic acid saponin 4. As depicted in Scheme 5, the free carboxylic acid derivative 22b was coupled with the known sugar donor 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl bromide a CH2CI2/H2O 1:1 give the fully protected derivative 26 (78%). Modifying the reaction conditions such as using the TCA sugar donor 5 in conjunction with TMSOTf or BF3*OEt2 as the promoters did not increase the yield and led to a complex mixture of rearrangement products (data not shown). As expected, the strong HMBC correlation between the proton H- 1'\" of the glucopyranose (<5 6.03 ppm, d, 9.7 C-28 of the aglycone (8 174.1 ppm) revealed that the reaction took place at the C-28 carboxylic acid position. The target natural betulinic acid saponin 4 was finally obtained after the removal of isopropylidene dry CEfeCla/MeOH 1:2) in an excellent 82% yield (two steps). The overall yield for the synthesis was 27% over eight linear steps from allyl betulinate (17). Surprisingly, it was found that the physical and analytical data ( H NMR, C NMR and [CC]25D) of 4 were not consistent with those reported for the natural product isolated from the aerial part of S. rotundifolia. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (HR-ESI-MS) NMR equipped with a cryogenic probe further proved that the structure of the synthetic saponin 4 was correct (Figure 3). The ]H NMR spectra of saponin 4 showed that the coupling constant of the proton H- 1' (S 4.53 ppm, d, J\\^ 4.6 Hz) in the was also observed for saponins 23a and 23b bearing the same disaccharide residue at position 4.52 ppm, d, J\\% 4.6 Hz, H-l' in MeOD). In the course of this work, regarding the preparation of the sugar donor 8, we found that using K2CO3 as a base instead of DBU led to the preferential formation of the known 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-a-L-arabinopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate-1C4 (2T)44 (Table 1). The proton H-l' of 27 was visualized like a broad singlet on the H NMR spectrum (S 6.33 ppm) as already reported in the literature for arabinose,44\"4 >52'65 xylose 8'69 and fucose 5 adopting this unusual conformation. Hence, a J\\^ coupling constant midway between 4C] !C4 conformation suggested the78 arabinose residue in and 23b were in a high conformational mobility.70'71 It is worth noting that such a phenomenon was recently observed for naturally occurring saponins isolated from Stryphnodendron fissuratum having a terminal arabinose moiety.72 In order to verify this hypothesis of conformationai mobility, we performed a 'H NMR analysis of saponin 4 in which the temperature was increased from 0 to 100 \u00b0C. As shown in Figure 4, the coupling constant values of the proton H-l' decreased {J\\^ 5.9-4.1 Hz) with an increase of the temperature. In comparison, the coupling constant values of the proton H-l\"1 of the glucopyranose moiety were quite similar over the tested temperature range (Ji^ 8.2-8.0 Hz). With regards to the saponin 4, these 'H NMR data suggested that the equilibrium between the 4Ci and '\u20ac4 conformations of the arabinopyranose moiety tend to shift towards the lC\u00e2, conformation if the temperature is raised and vice versa. CONCLUSION In summary, this is the first report of the synthesis of naturally occurring lupane-type saponins bearing an a-L-rhamnopyranosyl~(i-\u00bb2)~a~L-arabmopyranose sugar moiety. In 3P-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l-\u00bb2)-[P-D- glucopyranosyl-(l->4)]-a-L-arabinopyranoside (3) and 28-O-P-D-glucopyranosyl betulinic acid 3p-0-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l-\u00bb2)-a-L-arabinopyranoside were using a stepwise glycosylation approach in 10% and 27% yields, respectively, over eight linear steps starting from allyl betulinate (17). It is noteworthy that the arabinose moiety of saponin 4 was in a high conformational mobility between 4Ci and 1CA chair conformations as reflected by the unusual anomeric coupling constant of the proton H-l'. These results open the way for concise and efficient syntheses of a wide range of betulinic acid saponin analogues as pharmaceutical and/or biological agents that can be of further interest in the elaboration of meaningful SAR studies. Work is currently in progress in our laboratory in order to evaluate the in vitro haemolytic, anticancer and anti- inflammatory activities of these natural saponins 4) their analogues (15a, 15b, 19a, 19b, 23a and 23b) and results will be reported in due course.79 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General methods Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.

As highlighted by the preliminary cytotoxicity evaluation against A549, DLD-1, MCF7 and a-L-rhamnopyranoside moieties at both C-3 agent (IC50 1.8-1.9 uM).125 INTRODUCTION Bidesmosidic saponins are naturally compounds, which consist of a triterpenoid or steroid aglycone bearing two sugar moieties usually at the C-3 and C- 28 positions.1 Biological activities exhibited by saponins are quite diversified (cytotoxic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, molluscicidal) and have been reviewed extensively. However, clinical development of saponins as pharmacological agents is strongly hampered because of their haemolytic activity inducing toxicity in most animals when delivered intravenously.3 Interestingly, it has been reported that bidesmosidic saponins are considerably less haemolytic compared to monodesmosides and thus represent attractive chemical targets for structure-activity relationships (SAR) studies. The first synthesis of a bidesmosidic saponin was achieved by the group of Biao Yu5 in 1999. Since this accomplishment, several syntheses of bidesmosides have been published although most of them are solely related to diosgenin6\"8 or oleanolic acid5'9\"12 as aglycones. distributed in nature.13'14 Synthesis of monodesmosidic lupane- type saponins has been reported by us15'16 and by other groups.1 \" However, to our knowledge, the only example of the synthesis of betulinic acid bidesmosides is the preparation of the 3,28-bis-P-D-ghicopyranoside derivative.\" Natural bidesmosidic saponins of the lupane-type are scarce and have been isolated principally from plant species of the Schefflera13''25 and Pulsatiila6\" genera. Braca and co-workers isolated the 3p-O-(a-L-arabinopyranosyl)-lup-20(29)-ene-28-O-P-D-glucopyranosyl ester (3) (Figure 1) from the aerial parts of S. rotundifolia, a plant used as a folk remedy in Asian countries. Bidesmosidic saponin 3 exhibited noticeable cytotoxic activity against J774.A1, HEK-293 and WEHI-164 cell lines and was found, in this study, to be more active than glycosides having oleanolic acid or hederagenin as aglycones.126 We now report the synthesis of the natural bidesmosidic betulinic acid saponin 3 along the parent triterpenoids betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2). The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the synthesized saponins was evaluated against human cancer cell lines (A549, DLD-1, MCF7 and PC-3). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of bidesmosides In order to synthesize bidesmosidic betulin saponins, we first planned to introduce arabinopyranosyl or rhamnopyranosyl moieties at the C-3 position of 1 prior to glucosylating the C-28 position. As depicted in Scheme 1, betulin (I)15 was treated with fcrf-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (THF) the C-28 primary hydroxyl position.7 The latter 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-p-L-arabinopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (7)5 or 2,3,4-tri-O-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (8) (Figure 2) under the promotion of the Lewis acid trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) in dry CH2CI2 at room temperature to afford protected monodesmosides 10a and 10b in yields of 71% and betulin saponins lia (75%) and lib (87%), Since the next step consisted in the glucosylation at the C-28 position, we tried to couple 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate30 with lia using the above mentioned glycosylation conditions. However, the reaction afforded the rearrangement product allobetulin 3 (5-0-2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-a-L- arabinopyranoside in 42% yield with no trace of the desired bidesmosidic glycoside 12a. Similar treatment of the acceptor lib with the donor 4 led to the exclusive formation of the frara-esterification product 28-0-benzoyl betulin 3P-O-2,3,4-tri-O-127 benzoyl-a-L-rhamnopyranoside in 42% yield. As shown in Scheme 1, further modifications of the glycosylation conditions were considered using the acceptor lib in conjunction with various glucosyl donors (4-6) and promoters such as boron trifluoride procedure31 and phase-transfer conditions32 were also tried in order to glucosylate the C-28 position of lib. Unfortunately, all these attempts failed to yield the target bidesmoside 12b. Instead, rapid decomposition of sugar donor (4-6) was generally observed based on TLC analysis. It is worth noting that lib was nearly quantitatively transformed into allobetulin 3p-0-2,3,4-tri~O- benzoyl-a-L-rhamnopyranoside when the Lewis acid AgOTf was used as promoter of the glycosylation reaction. The yields of the rearrangement were comparable to those reported by Li and co-workers for the preparation of allobetulin from betulin (1) catalysed by solid acids.33 Therefore, we turned to another approach for the synthesis of bidesmosidic betulin saponins. According to Scheme 2, the known betulin 3-acetate (13)16 was prepared in good yield (86%, two steps) from 1 following a reported procedure. Once again, attempts to glucosylate the acceptor 13 with 4 under the catalytic action of TMSOTf (0.1 equiv) in dry CH2CI2 (20 mL/mmol) rram-esterification (28-0-benzoyl betulin 3- acetate, 17% yield) instead of the desired glycoside 14. However, condensation of 13 and 4 proceeded smoothly to furnish 14 (60% yield) when only 0.05 equiv of TMSOTf was used in 40 mL/mmol of dry CH2CI2. Thereafter, deacetylation of the C-3 position was achieved by treatment of 14 with acetyl chloride (AcCl) in dry 1:2 to afford 15 in good yield (75%). The latter acceptor was coupled with the donors 7 or 8 using TMSOTf as the promoter to give the fully benzoylated bidesmosides 12a (62%) and 16b in excellent yields (86% and 80%, respectively). The overall yields for the syntheses were 24% for 16a and 26% for 16b over four linear steps starting from betulin 3-acetate (13).128 Synthesis of the natural bidesmosidic betulinic acid saponin 3 along with the non- natural saponin 19 was achieved in a straightforward manner. As depicted in Scheme 3, the lupane-type triterpenoid betulinic acid (2) was condensed with the known 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (6)35 under phase- transfer conditions32 a refluxing solution of CH2CI2/H2O 1:1 to furnish 17 in excellent yield (90%). The latter was coupled with the donors 7 or 8 under the promotion of TMSOTf to afford 18a (63%) and 18b (86%). Subsequent removal of the benzoyl groups by treatment with NaOH in MeOH/THF/H2O provided the target bidesmosidic saponins 3 (75%) and 19 (81%). The overall yields for the syntheses were 43% for 3 and 63% for 19 over three linear steps starting from 1. Unexpectedly, it was found that the physical and analytical data ('H NMR, 13C NMR and [<X]D) of saponin 3 were not in agreement with those reported for the natural product isolated from S. rotundifolia.25 Surprisingly, glucosylation at the C-3 position of 28-0-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-p-D- glucopyranosyl betulinic acid (17) proved to be very difficult. In fact, as shown in Scheme 4, all attempts to condense the acceptor 17 with either the trichloroacetimidate sugar donor 4 under Schmidt's normal36 and inverse procedure31 or the bromide sugar donor 6 in conjunction with silver oxide (Ag2O)37 and AgOTf38 (modified Koenigs-Knorr methods) failed to yield the fully protected bidesmosidic betulinic acid saponin 20. According to TLC and NMR analysis, no coupling product was observed in any assays and the acceptor 17 was nearly fully recovered. Thus, we chose to adopt another strategy in which the unprotected betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2) are glycosylated at both C-3 and C-28 positions via Schmidt's inverse procedure (Scheme 5). Using this methodology, the acceptors (1 or 2) and the promoter (TMSOTf) were premixed before the dropwise addition of the sugar donors (4 or 8, 3 equiv) at low temperature (-10 \u00b0C). Deprotection of the crude product (NaOH, MeOH/THF/H2O) and purification by C-18 inversed target saponins (21a, 21b, 22a and 22b) in yields ranging from 37 to 84% over two steps. As expected, the 1,2-frans-glycosidic linkage (a-L-rhamnoside and p-D-gkteoside) of saponins was for 22a activity of lupane-type bidesmosidic saponins was evaluated against four human cancer cell lines including lung carcinoma (A549), and colorectal (DLD-1), breast (MCF7) and prostate (PC-3) adenocarcinornas. These cancer cell lines were chosen as cellular models since they are quite prevalent in the population and cause the majority of human cancer deaths. The parent triterpenoids betulin (I),15 betulinic acid (2)41 and the clinically used etoposide were used as positive controls. The cytotoxicity of 28-O-p-D-glucopyranosides of betulin and betulinic acid18 was also investigated. Cell viability was assessed through the resazurin reduction test after 48 hours of incubation between compounds and cells. ' The cytotoxicity results are expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50% of the cell growth (IC50). As shown in Table 1, betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2) inhibited cancer cell growth with IC50 ranging from 3.8 to 23.3 uM and 10.3 to 41 uM, respectively. It is worth noting that these natural triterpenoids were significantly more cytotoxic against A549 and DLD-1 cell lines (P <0.05). Moreover, cytotoxic activity was also assessed against human normal skin fibroblasts (WS1), but no selectivity was observed for the new series of bidesmosidic saponins. It had been shown in previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies that the free C-28 carboxylic acid function is important to preserve the cytotoxicity of betulinic acid (2).18'44'46 As revealed in Table 1, in our SAR study, this assertion was verified for the two monodesmosidic betulin and betulinic acid at C-28 (IC50 >100 (iM). On the other hand, the cytotoxicity profile of most of the synthesized bidesmosidic saponins bearing an additional sugar moiety at C-3 was generally similar or higher than betulinic acid (2) against tested cancer cell lines. Bidesmosidic saponins 21a and 21b were the soie exceptions to this general tendency since the presence of P-D-glucopyranoside130 moieties at both C-3 and C-28 positions seems to have a detrimental effect on cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, saponins 2ia and 21b were preferentially cytotoxic and significantly (P <0.05) more active than betulinic acid (2) against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cells (IC50 14.5 and 20 \\xM, respectively). It is noteworthy that the natural bidesmosidic betulinic acid saponin 3, which features an a-L-arabinopyranoside moiety at C-3, was only moderately cytotoxic against the lines (IC50 23-76 JJM) whereas the betulin analogue 16a bearing the same sugar residues was more cytotoxic than betulinic acid (2) against MCF7 and PC-3 cell lines (IC50 9.5 and 5.3 fiM, respectively). In this SAR study, the most active saponins were generally those bearing OC-L- rhamnopyranoside moieties. Indeed, bidesmosides 16b, 19, 22a and 22b inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 1.7 to 23 uM. Saponins 22a and 22b containing an a-L-rhamnopyranoside moiety at both C-3 and C-28 positions were highly cytotoxic against all tested cancer cell lines (IC50 1.7-1.9 and 6.0-7.2 fiM, respectively) and significantly more active parent triterpenes (P <0.05). Notably, bidesmosidic betulin saponin 22a was the most potent of all tested compounds to inhibit the growth of human cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of saponin 22a was also significantly higher than betulinic acid 3P-0-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (IC50 2.6 fiM, A549)15, which was shown in previous SAR studies to be the most cytotoxic compound of 44 tested lupane- and germanicane-type triterpenoids and related 3p-O-monodesrnosidic saponins.15'16 The cytoxicity correlated with the presence of rhamnose moieties was also reported in the literature for solasodine steroidal glycosides.47'48 It was suggested that certain types of cancer cells may have protein receptors, such as lectins,4 \"51 that recognize rhamnose moieties and facilitate movement of the drug into the cellular cytoplasm.47 Thus, these rhamnose receptors could serve to deliver the anticancer agent directly to the tumor. ~\" Further investigations are needed to confirm if the strong in vitro cytotoxicity of bidesmosidic saponins 22a and 22b can be explained131 by the binding of their rhamnose moieties to the specific sugar receptors of cancerous cells. CONCLUSION In summary, eight bidesmosidic saponins (3, 16a, 16b, 19, 21a, 21b, 22a and 22b) were synthesized in moderate to good overall yields starting from betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2). The syntheses were achieved by a combination of Schmidt's procedures and phase-transfer conditions using fully benzoylated trichloroacetimidate and sugar bromide donors. This SAR study suggests that the relative cytotoxicities of bidesmosidic betulin and betulinic acid saponins are strongly influenced by the nature of both the aglycone and the sugar moieties. Bidesrnosides 22a and C-28 positions were highly cytotoxic. Therefore, these preliminary results indicate that bidesmosidic saponins having betulin (1) or betulinic acid (2) as the aglycone may have clinical potential as anticancer agents. The relatively high polarity of these compounds should facilitate the preparation of non-toxic injectable formulations for further in vivo studies on animal models. Work on the evaluation of the haemolytic activity and the mechanism of action of these new \"lead\" compounds (22a and 22b) is currently in progress in our laboratory and results will be reported in due course.

Human lung carcinoma (A549), human colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD-1), human breast adenocarcinoma and human normal skin fibroblasts (WSl) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Ail cell lines were cultured in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Mediatech Ceilgro, vitamins (lx), penicillin (lx), and sodium pyruvate (lx) (Mediatech Ceilgro, VA). Cells were kept at humidified environment containing 5% CO2. plated in 96-well microplates (Costar, Coming Inc.) at a density of 5 x 103 cells per well in 100 uL of culture medium and were allowed to adhere for 16 h before treatment. Increasing concentrations of each compound in biotech DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was maintained at 0.5% (v/v) to avoid solvent toxicity. Cytotoxicity was assessed using resazurin * on an automated 96-well Fluoroskan Ascent Fl plate reader (Labsystems) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 ran, respectively. Fluorescence was proportional to the cellular metabolic activity in each well. Survival percentage147 was defined as the fluorescence in experimental wells compared to that in control wells after subtraction of blank values. Each experiment was carried out thrice in triplicate. IC50 results were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis. Significant differences of cytotoxicity between samples were determined by Kruskal- Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed by post hoc multiple comparisons with Student-Newman-Keuls method. Probabilities (P) inferior to 0.05 were considered significant. All computations were done using statistical software Sigma-Stat version 3.5.

In this study, the haemolytic and cytotoxic activities as well as the membrane cell permeabilization property of a library of 31 semi-synthetic and natural lupane- and oleanane-type saponins were evaluated and the structure-activity relationships were established. It was shown that, lupane-type saponins do not exhibit any haemolytic activity and membrane cell permeabilization property at the maximum concentration tested (IC50 >100 /iM) independently of the nature of the sugar moieties. While oleanane-type saponins such as p-hederin (25) and hederacolchiside A] (27) cause the death of cancer cell lines by permeabilizing the cellular membranes, lupane-type saponins seem to proceed via another mechanism which could be related to the induction of apoptosis. The overall results suggest that the cytotoxic lupane-type glycosides 10 and 22 bearing an a-L-rhamnopyranose moiety at the C-3 position could represent promising antitumor agents for further studies on tumor-bearing mice since they are devoid of toxicity associated with the haemolysis of red blood cells.168 INTRODUCTION Saponins are natural compounds found in higher plants and exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities [Sparg et al, 2004]. Despite a marked interest of the scientific community during the past decade towards the isolation [Vincken et al, 2007], total synthesis [Yu et al, 2007] and pharmacological properties [Liu et al, 2002; Sparg et al, 2004] of these ubiquitous glycosides, the haemolytic activity of saponins inducing toxicity in most animals is a major drawback for their clinical development. Although the exact mechanism of the rupture of erythrocyte membranes (haemolysis) by saponins is not yet clearly understood, it was found to be correlated with their amphiphilic properties. It has been hypothesized that saponins interact with lipid membranes of cells [Melzig et al, 2001] and form insoluble complexes with cholesterol leading to formation of pores [Seeman et al, 1973], permeabilization of cells [Baumann et al, 2000] and subsequent loss of haemogloblin in the extracellular medium. On the other hand, Winter and co-workers [Winter, 1994] proposed a different mechanism in which the haemolysis of erythrocytes is caused by the interaction of saponins with the water channel aquaporin resulting in an increase of the water transport. Since all saponins are not haemolytic, some structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were recently undertaken in order to find active compounds such as anticancer agents [Chwalek et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2007] or vaccine adjuvants [Oda et al, 2000; Sun et al, 2005; Sun, 2006] devoid of toxicity. It was shown that there is no evident correlation between the haemolysis of red blood cells and cytotoxicity of saponins [Wang et al, 2007], and both the nature of the aglycone and the osidic part are important for these biological activities [Chwalek et al, 2006]. Voutquenne and co-workers [Voutquenne et al, reported that, 59 tested triterpenoid glycosides, bidesmosidic saponins bearing sugar moieties at both were generally less haemolytic than C-3 monodesmosides toward erythrocytes. In another study, it was also pointed out that the presence of non-natural linkages (1,2-cw-glycosides) have detrimental effects for both the haemolytic and cytotoxic activities of saponins [Chwalek et al, 2006]. However,169 since the isolation and total synthesis of saponins are usually quite difficult to achieve, the SAR studies are often limited by the possibility of obtaining a broad variety of pure saponins in a convenient quantity for biological assays. In the past few years, our laboratory has been interested in the synthesis of cytotoxic lupane-type saponins having pentacyclic triterpenoids betulinic acid (1) or betulin (2) as aglycones. To this date, more than fifty natural and non-natural saponins have been chemically synthesized such as monodesmosides [Gauthier et al, 2006; Thibeault 2008a] [Gauthier et al, 2008b] containing various sugar moieties. Our SAR studies have shown that highly potent [Gauthier et al, 2008b] and/or selective [Gauthier et al, 2006] anticancer agents are obtained for lupane-type saponins bearing an a-L-rhamnopyranose moiety at the C-3 position. Thus, we thought that it would be of interest to investigate the haemolytic activity of these lupane-type saponins in relation with their cytotoxicity profile in order to choose \"lead\" compounds devoided of undesirable toxicity for farther in vivo studies on tumor bearing mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the haemolytic activity and SAR of saponins having betulinic acid (1) or betulin (2) as aglycones. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, natural oleanane-type saponins such as hederagenin 3p-O-p-D-giucopyranoside (7), \u00f4-hederin P-hederin (25), hederacolchiside A (26) and hederacolchiside Ai (27) isolated from species of the Hedera genus [Elias et al, 1991; Mshvildadze et et al, 1993; Mshvildadze et al, 2001] were also investigated and their activities were compared to lupane-type saponins (5, 6, (24) and hederacolchiside (27) were already shown to possess strong haemolytic [Chwalek et al., 2006] and anticancer Park et al, 2001; Barthomeuf et al, 2002; Bang et al, 2005b; Rooney et al, 2005; Gerkens et al, 2007] both in vitro and in vivo which are related to their capacity to interact with biological membranes [Debiton et al, 2004; Mazzucchelli et al, 2008]. In this study, we report the in vitro haemolytic and cytotoxic activities as well as the membrane cell permeabilization property (calcein-170 AM assay) of a library of 31 semi-synthetic and natural saponins of the lupane and oleanane family and discuss their SAR. RESULTS Haemolysis of red blood cells In vitro haemolytic activities of triterpenoids 1-4 and saponins 5-35 on sheep red blood cells (erythrocytes) are shown in Figure 1. The values are expressed as the concentrations that cause 50% haemolysis of erythrocytes (HD50). PBS buffer at pH 7.4 was used as a negative control and Sigma-Aidrich\u00ae Saponin mixture from quillaja bark (20-35% sapogenin) was used as a positive control. Significant differences in the values \u00b1 standard deviation were calculated in comparison with Firstly, the results in Figure 1 clearly indicate that lupane-type saponins were non- haemolytic compared to oleanane-type saponins with HD50 values mostly over 100 fxM similar to the negative control. While betulinic acid (1), betulin (2) and betulin glycosides were completely inactive, only three saponins with betulinic acid (1) as aglycone showed slight haemolytic activity significantly different from those of the control and oleanane glycosides (P <0.05), i.e. saponin 21 C-28 (HD50 a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l\u2014>2)-a-L-arabinopyranose moiety at C-3 (HD50 = 78 \u00b1 a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l->2)-[P-D- glucopyranosyl-(l->4)]-a-L-arabinopyranose moiety at C-3 (HD50 94 \u00b111 contrast, all natural oleanane-type saponins induced strong haemolysis of red blood cells with HD50 values ranging from 1.7 to 22 jiM. The saponins P-hederin (25) and hederacolchiside Ai (27) with oleanolic acid (4) as aglycone were the most haemolytic of all tested saponins (HD50 = 2.0 \u00b10.1 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 |iM, respectively) and were more active than the positive control. \u00f4-Hederin (23) and a-hederin (24)171 showing significantly (P \u00ab3.05) similar haemolytic activity (HD50 = 12 \u00b1 1 and 10 \u00b1 1 |iM, respectively) were approximately five to six fold less active than saponins 25 and 27. The activity of hederagenin saponin bearing a P-D-glucopyranose moiety at C-3, colchiside (7), was significantly higher than saponins 23 and 24 with an HD50 value of 16 \u00b1 2 uM. The least potent oleanane-type saponin to induce the haemolysis of erythrocytes was hederacolchiside A (26) (HD50 = 22 \u00b1 3 pM). The related triterpenoids hederagenin (3) and oleanolic acid (4) did not exhibit haemolytic activity at the maximum concentration tested (HD50 >100 uM), The in vitro antiproliferative activity of compounds 1-35 against lung carcinoma (A549), colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) and normal skin fibroblasts (WS1) human cell lines was assessed using the resazurin reduction test [O'Brien et ah, 2000] in which the fluorescence is proportional to the cellular metabolic activity. Betulinic acid (1) was used as a positive control [Kessler et al., 2007] in this assay. The cytotoxicity results presented in Table 3 are expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50% of the cell growth (IC50). They are subdivided into five groups: triterpenoids (1-4; group lupane sapomns containing a-L-arabinopyranose (28-35; group V). In the first group, betulin (2) was the most cytotoxic triterpenoid (IC50 = 10.3-15.0 jJVl), In contrast, hederagenin (3) and oleanolic acid (4) were only moderately active against A549 cancer cell lines (IC50 = 39 \u00b1 6 and 27 \u00b1 3 uM, respectively) while they did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against DLD-1. As previously reported [Gauthier et al, 2007], betulinic acid 3p-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (10, pM) was the most active monodesmosidic \u00eeupane-type saponin of group II against cancer cell betulin 3P-0-a-D-mannopyranoside (14, saponins 9, bearing a glucopyranose moiety at either C-3 or C-28 were not able to exhibit cytotoxicity at the maximum concentration tested (IC50 >100 JJM). Moreover, the unusual a-L- arabinofuranosides (5, 6) were also completely inactive against cancer (IC50 >100 MM). Of all tested compounds in this study, betulin bis-3,28-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (22) was the most potent to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 1.7 to 1.9 fiM [Gauthier et al, 2008b]. Bidesmoside 21 bearing two rhamnose moieties was also strongly active (IC50 4.9-7.3 jiM) with a cytotoxicity profile slightly superior than betulinic acid (1). In addition, the bidesmosidic saponins 19 and 20 containing a rhamnose moiety at C-3 were significantly more active than 1 against colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (IC50 = 11.0 \u00b1 0.5 and 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 JJM, respectively). In group IV consisting of oleanane-type saponins, the order of anticancer activity was quite similar to the haemolytic activity. Indeed, there is a significant correlation between both biological activities (P O.05, Pearson product moment correlation). However, oleanane saponins (7, 23-27) were not as cytotoxic as the positive control betulinic acid (1) against A549 and DLD-1. The strongest cytotoxicities on human cell lines were exerted by P~hederin (25) and hederacolchiside Ai (27) (IC50 = 14-30 and 5.7-16 pM, respectively). Other saponins (7, 23, 24 and 26) with hederagenin (3) as aglycone were only moderately active against cancer with IC50 ranging from 30- 62 In the last group, lupane-type saponins (30, 31, 32 and 35) containing an a-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(l->2)-a-L-arabinopyranose moiety did not exhibit any cytotoxicity at maximum concentration tested. The most active saponin of group V was betulinic acid 3p-O-a-L-arabinopyranoside (28) which exerted a cytotoxicity profile similar to the parent triterpenoid 1 against cancer cell lines (IC50 = 11-12173 while the betulin analogue 29 was inactive (IC50 >100 (iM). The addition of a glucose moiety at the C-28 position of 28 to give bidesmoside 33 had a detrimental effect on the anticancer activity (IC50 = 50-76 }iM). In contrast, the cytotoxicity against A549 and WS1 was increased when a glucose moiety was added at the C-28 position of 29 to give bidesmoside 34 (IC50 = 19 \u00b1 2 and 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 juM, respectively). Permeabilization of cell membrane In order to evaluate the propensity of saponins to permeabilize the cellular membrane, we performed the calcein-AM assay [Debiton et al., 2004]. In this test, the calcein-AM enters passively into the cells, is converted into a green fluorescent and retained within intact cells. After treatment with drugs, the fluorescence is proportional to the number of cells (A549, DLD-1 and WS1) with undamaged membranes. The results presented in Table 3 are expressed as the drag concentration that decreased calcein fluorescence by 50% (IC50). the membrane of A549, DLD-1 and WS1 human cell lines at maximum concentration tested (IC50 >200 \\xM). On the other hand, regarding the oleanane-type saponins, (3-hederin (25) and hederacoiehiside Aj (27) were the most active as they strongly permeabilized the membrane of all human cell lines with IC50 ranging from 2.8 to 4 JJM in function of the type of cells. This membrane activity was significantly higher (P <0.05) than other saponins in this group having hederagenin (3) as aglycone such colchiside hederacoiehiside A (26, IC50 = 86-159 jiM). Moreover, there is a significant correlation (P O.05) between the haemolytic activity and the membrane permeabilization potential of oleanane saponins (7, 23-27).174 DISCUSSION Saponins are well known to exhibit cytotoxic and haemolytic activities [Sparg et al., 2004] which are strongly correlated with the nature of both the aglycone and sugar side chains [Takechi et al., 1995; Oda et al, 2000]. However, it was reported that these two properties are not linked since they can proceed by different mechanisms [Chwalek et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2007]. Recent studies demonstrated that several naturally occurring antitumor saponins cause the death of cancer cells by induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway [Haridas et al, 2001; Lee et al, 2005; Zhu et al, 2005]. On the other hand, the haemolysis of erythrocytes was shown to be a function of the capacity of saponins to interact with the membrane cholesterol of red blood cells [Bangham et al, 1962]. However, Hu and co-workers reported that the liposomal membrane disrupting activity of oleanolic acid saponins glycosylated at both C-3 and C-28 positions (bidesmosides) can occur without the presence of cholesterol [Hu et al, 1996]. The haemolytic activity of saponins is a serious drawback to the further pharmaceutical development of this type of natural product although some saponins show only weak [Oleszek et al, 1992] or no haemolytic effect at all [Woldemichael et al, 2002]. In this SAR study, our results showed that, contrary to the majority of saponins including those of the oleanane family, lupane-type saponins do not exhibit any haemolytic activity at the maximum concentration tested (HD50 >100 /iM) independently of the nature of the sugar moieties. In fact, there were no significant differences between the haemolytic activities of lupane-type monodesmosides (5, 6, those containing a-L-arabinopyranose moiety (28-35). Similar results were reported by Yoshizumi et al. for lupane-type saponins with a modified ring-A isolated from the leaves of Acanthopanax sessiliflorus which did not lead to any haemolysis [Yoshizumi et al, 2006]. Betulinic acid saponins 21, 30 and 32 are the sole exceptions since they exerted weak activity against red blood cells (HD50 = 78-94 /iM). With regard to saponins 30 and 32, the slight haemolytic activity could be correlated with the presence of an a-L-rhanmopyranosyl-(l\u2014>2)-a-175 L-arabinopyranose moiety at the C-3 position of the triterpenoid skeleton. Indeed, this unique disaccharide chain is also present in oleanane-type saponins such as a- hederin (24) which have been shown to induce strong haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes [Chwalek et al, 2006]. Yamashita and co-workers reported that betulin (2) and betulinic acid (1) triterpenoids do not exhibit any haemolytic effect even at a concentration of 500 fiM. [Yamashita et al., 2002] as corroborated by our results et al, 1995; Zuco et al, 2002] and are of great interest for their clinical utilization as anticancer [Kessler et ah, 2007] or chemopreventive [Chaturvedi et al, 2008] agents. Although they are virtually not haemolytic, betulin (2) and betulinic acid (1) have been reported to induce alterations of erythrocyte membrane shape towards echinocytes [Ziegler et al, 2004], which seems to be related with their capacity to inhibit the growth of Plasmodium falciparum [Ziegler et al, 2006]. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity was shown to be due to the incorporation of triterpenoids 1 and 2 into the lipid bilayer of erythrocytes [Ziegler et al, 2004]. In this study, the natural oleanane-type saponins (7, 23-27) were shown to exhibit strong (IC50 = 1.7-22 fjM) compared to 3 and 4 (IC50 >100 /JM). On the whole, it appears to be a direct correlation (P <0.05) between the capacity of oleanane saponins to cause the lysis of red blood cells and their membrane cell permeabilization property. Moreover, the order of cytotoxicity seems to be linked with both the membrane alteration and haemolytic activities of oleanane saponins (P <0.05). It is noteworthy that P-hederin (25) and hederacolchiside Aj (27) with oleanolic acid (4) as aglycone were significantly more haemolytic and cytotoxic than a-hederin (24) and hederacolchiside A (26) bearing, respectively, the same sugar moieties. These results are in good agreement with those of Barthomeuf et al who reported that oleanolic acid saponins exhibit higher cytotoxicity than hederagenin saponins [Barthomeuf et al, 2002]. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the structural requirements of potent antitumor oleanane-type saponins including a-hederin (24), hederacolchiside A (26)176 and (27) isolated from the roots of Pulsatilla chinensis [Mimaki et al, 1999] and P. koreana [Bang al, 2005a] are the presence of an a-L-Rhaj>-(l->2)-a-L-Arajp moiety at the C-3 position and a free carboxylic acid at the C-28 position [Bang et al, 2005b]. Recently, hederacolchiside Ai (27) was reported to induce membrane injury resulting in the formation of pores and permeabilization of the membrane of human melanoma (MEL-5) cells, which could be related to its anticancer activity [Debiton et al, 2004; Mazzucchelli et al, 2008]. Moreover, another study highlighted the apoptosis inducing activity of saponin 27 [Gerkens et al, 2007]. These results suggest that the anticancer activity of hederacolchiside A] (27) and its analogues could be due to the complementary action of both the alteration of cellular membranes and apoptosis induction. Nevertheless, as revealed by the results of the haemolytic assay, it is obvious that the high toxicity towards erythrocytes of these oleanane-type saponins (7, 23-27) could hamper their utilization as pharmaceutical agents. While lupane-type saponins tested in this study were almost non-haemolytic, their cytotoxic activity were in some cases superior to oleanane-type saponins and greatly varied according to the nature of the sugar moieties linked to C-3 and C-28 [Gauthier et al, 2008b]. Indeed, monodesmosidic saponins presence p-D-Glcp or G&lp moieties at the C-3 position of the lupane skeleton seems to have a deleterious effect on the anticancer activity. In contrast, saponins bearing a-D-Araj?, a-D-Manp or p-D-Xylp at the C-3 position exhibited a cytotoxicity profile similar or slightly inferior to the parent triterpenoids 1 and 2. The addition of an a-L-Rhap at C-3 of betulmic acid (1) gave the most active monodesmosidic saponm (10) against human cancer cell lines (IC50 = 2.6-3.9 /xM). With regard to iupane-type saponins of group V, it is worth noting that saponins (30-32, 35) bearing an a-L-Rhap-(l\u2014\u00bb2)-a-L-Arap moiety at the C-3 position were not able to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines at the maximum concentration tested. Thus, our results suggest that this unique sugar moiety, which has been previously identified as a basic sequence for the antitumor activity of oleanolic acid and hederagenin 2002; Bang et al, 2005b] such as saponins 24-27, does not improve the in vitro cytototoxicy of lupane-type saponins. Notably, betulinic acid saponin 28 bearing an a-L-Aiap without the presence of an a-L-Rh&p linked at C-2' exhibited a cytotoxicity profile slightly superior to 1 against coiorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. As shown for monodesmosides 8 and 9, the presence of a P-D-Glcp moiety at the C-3 position of the lupane skeleton has a detrimental effect on the cytotoxicity of bidesmosidic saponins 17 and 18. These results may be explained by the high polarity of the glucose moiety which could prevent the diffusion of the saponins into the cellular cytoplasm [Chwalek et bidesmosidic saponins (19-22) containing a-L-Rhap moieties strongly inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines, the most active compound being betulin bis- 3,28-a-L-rhamnopyranoside (22) (IC50 = 1.3-1.9 JUM). the high anticancer activity of rhamnose containing saponins may be attributable to their interaction with lectins which could recognize rhamnose and facilitate the diffusion of the drag into the cytoplasm [Cham et al, 1990; Gauthier et al, 2008b]. In this SAR study, as for the haemolytic assay, all tested lupane-type saponins were unable to permeabilize the membrane of both human cancer (A549, DLD-1) and healthy (WS1) cell lines as determined by calcein-AM assay (IC50 >200 /xM). Therefore, cytotoxicity of lupane-type saponins such as glycosides 10 and 22 may be explained by another mechanism which should not involve cellular membrane injuries. The parent triterpenoid betulinic acid (1) has been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells [Pisha et al, 1995] independently of the p53 gene status through the perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species [Fulda et al, 1997]. These processes trigger the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, activation of caspases and subsequent DNA fragmentation [Fulda et al, 1998]. Thus, in a study in progress in our laboratory, we investigated the mechanism of action of lupane-type saponins. The preliminary results showed that, similarly to betulinic acid (1), saponins 10 and 22 could induce the death of A549 and DLD-1 cancer cell lines through the induction178 of apoptosis as revealed by both the cleavage of apoptotic factors such as PARP and caspase 3 and the characteristic morphological changes in the cells (data not shown). In conclusion, the haemolytic and cytotoxic activities as well as the membrane cell permeabilization property of semi-synthetic and natural lupane- and oleanane-type saponins have been investigated and structure-activity relationships have been established. While oleanane-type saponins such as P-hederin (25) and hederacolchiside Ai (27) cause the death of cancer cell lines by permeabilizing the cellular membranes, lupane-type saponins seem to proceed according to another mechanism which could be related to an apoptosis induction. The overall results suggest that lupane-type saponins such as the highly potent glycosides 10 and 22 represent promising anticancer agents for further studies on turnor-bearing mice since they are devoid of toxicity associated with the haemolysis of red blood cells in comparison with oleanane-type saponins. Work is currently in progress in our laboratory in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of the anticancer action of lupane-type saponins and results will be reported in due course. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION DMSO grade Biotech and Saponin from quillaja bark (20-35% sapogenin content), the positive control used for the haemolysis assay, were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich\u00ae Canada. Betulinic acid (1) was purchased from Indofine Chemical Company Inc. and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Triterpenes and saponins Betulin (2) was extracted from the outer bark of Betula papyrifera Marsh, and purified by silica gel flash al., 2006]. Lupane-type saponins 6, 8-22, 28-35) were synthesized according to procedures previously179 reported by our laboratory [Gauthier et al, 2006; Thibeault et al, 2008a; Gauthier et al, 2008b]. Oleanolic acid (4) was kindly provided by Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie-Hom\u00e9opathie de l'Universit\u00e9 de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Hederagenin 3P-0-P-D-glucopyranoside (7), \u00f4-hederin (23) and a-hederin (24) were isolated from the berries of Hedera colchica and purified as described previously [Mshvildadze et al, 2001]. Hederagenin (3) and P-hederin (25) were obtained by acid and alkaline hydrolysis from hederasaponins C and B, respectively, isolated from the leaves of Hedera helix [Elias et al, 1991]. Hederacolchiside A (26) and hederacolchiside Ai (27) were isolated from the leaves of Hedera colchica and purified according to literature [Mshvildadze et al, 1992; Mshvildadze et al, 1993]. The chemical structures (Tables 1 and 2) of all triterpenes and saponins used in this study were confirmed by spectral data (MS, '*H and 13C NMR) and their purity first eentrifuged at 3000 RPM for 5 min and then suspended in PBS to obtain a 1% erythrocytes solution. Samples were dissolved in a mixture of 5:1 DMSO/PBS to obtain a concentration of 500 ug/mL. Concentration gradient were prepared within a range of 500 ug/mL to 3,9 iig/mL. A 160 jiiL volume of 1% erythrocyte solution was added to 96 wells microplates (Cos\u00eear, Coming Inc.) and a volume of 40 uL of sample or control solution was added to obtain a final erythrocyte concentration of 0.8% and sample concentration gradient ranging from 100 pg/mL to 0.78 jig/mL. Microplates were incubated at 37\u00b0C on an orbital shaker for 60 min. Microplates were then eentrifuged at 3000 RPM for 5 min, after what the supernatant was transferred to empty microplates. Absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 run with a Varioskan plate reader (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Each experiment was carried out twice in triplicate. HD50 was calculated by comparison with the 100% haemolysis caused by the highest Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae Canada) concentration and were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.180 Cells culture Human lung carcinoma (A549), human colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) and human normal skin fibroblasts (WSl) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were cultured in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Mediatech Cellgro, vitamins (lx), penicillin (lx), and sodium pyruvate (lx) (Mediatech Cellgro, VA). Cells were kept at in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were plated in 96-well microplates (Costar, Corning Inc.) at a density of 5 x 10 cells per well in 100 uL of culture medium and were allowed to adhere for 16 h before treatment. Increasing concentrations of each compound in biotech DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was maintained at 0.5% (v/v) to avoid solvent toxicity. Cytotoxicity was assessed using resazurin [O'Brien, J. et al, 2000] on an automated 96-well Fluoroskan Ascent Fl plate reader (Labsystems) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was proportional to the cellular metabolic activity in each well. Survival percentage was defined as the fluorescence in experimental wells compared to that in control wells after subtraction of blank values. Each experiment was carried out thrice in triplicate. IC50 results were expressed as assay Exponentially growing in 96-weli microplates (Costar, Corning Inc.) at a density of 104 cells per well in 100 uL of181 DMEM and were allowed to adhere for 24 h before treatment. Microplates were then washed with PBS, and 16 (iM calcein-AM was added in 100 JJ,L of culture medium. Microplates were incubated 60 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for the calcein to be incorporated into cells. Unabsorbed calcein was then removed and microplates were washed with PBS. Growing concentrations of samples or controls were added in 100 uL of DMEM without FBS. Microplates were incubated 30 min after what wells were washed again with PBS. Fluorescence was read with a Fluoroskan Ascent Fl plate reader (Labsystems) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was proportional to the cell membrane integrity. Each experiment was carried out twice in triplicate. IC50 results were expressed as means \u00b1 by polynomial regression of dose-response curve after blank subtraction. Significant difference between samples were determined by Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed by post hoc multiple comparisons with Student-Newman-Keuls method. Probabilities (P) inferior to 0.05 were considered significant. Correlation coefficients were determined by Pearson Product Moment Correlation.

All neosaponins as well as their rearrangement products of the germanicane-type were evaluated in vitro for their anticancer and haemolytic activities. Although betulinic acid and betulin 3P-0-chacotriosides were neither rearrangement products allobetulin and 28- oxoallobetulin 3p-0-chacotriosides (9 and 10) exhibited a cytotoxicity profile up to four-fold superior to betulinic acid against human breast (MCF7) and prostate (PC-3) adenocarcinomas cell lines (IC50 = 10-18 fiM). However, these saponins were as cytotoxic on healthy cells (WS1) than on cancer cells. It is worth noting that only chacotriosides featuring non-polar functions at the C-28 position (6, 9 and 10) exerted a haemolytic activity against red blood cells.198 INTRODUCTION The naturally occurring ktpame-type triterpenoids lupeol (1), betulin (2) and betulinic acid (3) have been thoroughly investigated during the past years on account of their promising medicinal properties,1\"5 and particularly their chemopreventive6 and antitumor ' activities. Therefore, several studies have been undertaken, which focused generally on the preparation of anticancer derivatives of triterpenoids 2 and 3 modified at C-3 and/or C-28 positions. ' \"\" Recently, with the aim of increasing the water solubility of these non polar cholesterol-like triterpenoids and studying their structure-activity relationships, we synthesized a broad library of mono- and bidesmosidic lupane-type saponins, \" which have been evaluated for their cytotoxicity against the growth of human cancer cells. Our results revealed that the addition of rhamnose moieties at both C-3 and C-28 positions of triterpenoids 2 and 3 can give anticancer agents many fold stronger than betulinic acid (3).15 Furthermore, we showed that contrary to the majority of naturally occurring saponins,'6'17 most of the lupane-type glycosides do not exhibit any haemolytic activity (HD50 >100 uM) against red blood cells,1 which is of great interest regarding their clinical utilization as anticancer agents when intravenously delivered. Saponins bearing a 2,4-branched trisaccharide containing rhamnose moieties such as chacotriosides are quite their Indeed, dioscin, namely diosgenyl a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l\u2014*2)-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1\u2014\u00bb4)]-|3-D-glucopyranoside, a well-known saponin isolated from several plant species used in traditional oriental medicine, have been shown to induce apoptosis within cancerous cells19'20 and to exhibit promising antitumor activities.21\"23 Moreover, the apoptosis inducing activity of steroidal alkaloid bearing the same chacotriosyl moiety, to be correlated with the presence of rhamnose moieties. ' Therefore, we thought that it will be of interest to prepare lupane-type saponins incorporating this particular 2,4-branched trisaccharide. Hence, as shown in Figure 1, we report here the synthesis of lupeol, betulin and betulinic acid monodesmosidic saponins (6-8) bearing a chacotriosyl moiety at the C- 3 position as well as their germanicane-type rearrangement products (9 and 10). The199 in vitro cytotoxic and haemolytic activities of all synthesized saponins are also reported. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, we chose to adopt a stepwise glycosylation strategy rather than a convergent one, in order to obtain exclusively a 1,2-\u00a3ra\u00ab,s-giycosidic linkage. Thus, as depicted in Scheme 1, the synthesis began by coupling the trichloroacettmidate (13, 1.5 equiv)12 under the promotion of the Lewis acid trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf, 0.1 equiv). After the glycosylation, removal of the benzoyl groups under standard deprotection conditions (NaOH 0.5 N, MeOH/THF/HiO room temperature) P-D-glucosides 14!2 (90%), 15 (72%) and 16 (80%) in good to excellent yields after two steps. Then, the regioselective pivaloylation27 at both C-6' and (PivCl) pyridine (Py) furnished, expected, the protected derivatives 17-19 in moderate yields (60-62%). The Schmidt's inverse procedure28 was chosen in order to synthesize the chacotrioside moiety. This approach was shown to give better yields than the normal procedure when two hydroxyl groups are simultaneously glycosyiated. Thus, coupling of the acceptor 17 with the donor 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (20, 5.0 equiv) using TMSOTf (0.5 equiv) at -10 \u00b0C to room temperature followed by removal of benzoyl and pivaloyl groups led to the formation of the target chacotrioside lupeol saponin 6 in a moderated yield (57%, two steps). Surprisingly, under the same glycosylation conditions, the germanicane-type rearrangement products allobetulin and 28- oxoallobetulin 3p-0-ehacotriosides (9 and 10) were obtained in 32% and 24% yields, respectively, instead of the expected C-28 protected betulin and berulinic acid 3$-O- chacotriosides. This result may be explained by the fact that triterpenes 2 and 3 can undergo a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement in the presence of an excess of Lewis acids.13'30'31 Therefore, in light of these results, we performed, in a separate200 experiment, the glycosylation of the acceptor 16 with the donor 20 using a smaller amount of TMSOTf (<0.2 equiv) in the reaction medium. As shown in Scheme 2, under these conditions, the fully protected chacotrioside derivative 21 was prepared in an excellent yield (96%) without any detectable trace of rearrangement products. The target chacotrioside betulinic acid saponin 8 (78%, two steps) was finally obtained after the hydrolysis of benzoyl and pivaloyl groups (NaOH 0.5 N, MeOH/THF/H2O 1:1:1, 50 \u00b0C) followed by the subsequent deallylation at the C-28 position. For some unclear reasons, all attempts to prepare the chacotrioside betulin saponin 7 from the glucosidic derivative 18 under various glycosylation conditions were unsuccessful (data not shown). Moreover, we tried to prepare the target neosaponin 7 by the reduction of the carboxylic acid function of 8 using aluminium lithium hydride (L1AIH4) in refluxing THF.32 Unfortunately, the reaction resulted in a complex mixture of inseparable products. We next reasoned that using another less hindered protecting group than TBDPS at the C-28 position of betulin (2) such as a pivalate ester (Piv) should allow us to obtain better results. Thus, as depicted in Scheme 3, 28-O-pivaloyi betulin (22), which was synthesized in good yield (76%) by treatment of betulin (2) with PivCl in pyridine, was glucosylated at the C-3 position to afford 23 (68%, two steps) after deprotection of the benzoyl groups. Regioselective pivaloylation of 23 led to the formation of 24 (60%), which was then simultaneously glycosylated at both C-2' and C-4' positions with the TCA sugar donor 13 via the Schmidt's inverse procedure to provide the fully protected chaeotriosidic derivative. Unexpectedly, deprotection of benzoyl and pivaloyl groups of the crude product using NaOH 0.5 N at 50 \u00b0C afforded 28-O-pivaloyl betulin 3j3- chacotrioside (25) instead of 7. Thus, in order to cleave this sterically hindered primary pivalate ester, compound 25 was subjected to a basic hydrolysis with a higher concentration of NaOH (1.5 N) at reflux for a longer period of time (48 h). Under these conditions, the target chacotrioside saponin 7 was finally obtained in an excellent yield (88%) as a pure and homogeneous form. It is worth noting that, as revealed by the coupling constant values of the anomeric protons, 1,2-trans-201 glycosidic linkages (a-L-Rhap and p-D-Glcp) all newly synthesized neosaponins (6-1\u00db).33 The cytotoxicity of the synthesized neosaponins (6-10) was evaluated in vitro by the resazurin reduction lung fibroblasts (WS1) human cell lines. Betulinic acid (3) was used as a positive control.35 Cytotoxicity results presented in Table 1 are expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50% of the cell growth (IC50). Also, haemolytic activity of neosaponins 6-10 wass assessed in vitro on sheep red blood celis (erythrocytes). As shown in Table 1, the values are expressed as the concentration inducing 50% haemolysis of erythrocytes (HD50). PBS buffer at pH 7.4 was used as negative control and Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae Saponin mixture from quillaja bark (20-35% sapogenin) was used as positive control. Firstly, the cytotoxic results indicate that the chacotrioside moiety has a negative impact on the anticancer activity of lupane-type triterpenoids (IC50 >50 umol'L\"1). These results are in good agreement with our previous investigations in which lupane-type saponins bearing highly polar sugar moieties at the C-3 position such as jS-D-glucose12'15 or a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(l-\u00bb2)-a-L-arabinopyranosels were not or only weakly cytotoxic against human cancer cell lines. On the other hand, it is worth noting that allobetulin and 28-oxoallobetulin chacotnosides (9 and 10) exhibited a cytotoxicity profile similar and even stronger than betulinic acid (3) with IC50 values ranging from 3.8 to 18 umol'L\" . Indeed, neosaponins 9 and 10 were about four-fold more active than betulinic acid (3) to inhibit the growth of human prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines (IC50 = 10 \u00b1 1 umohL\"1). To our knowledge, it is the first time that such an increase in the anticancer activity of germanicane-type triterpenoids 4 and 5 was reported in the literature.13 Thus, the results suggest that the beneficial cytotoxic effect of the chacotrioside moiety is highly dependent of the nature of the aglycone.202 Interestingly, it appears in this study that the chacotriose moiety increases the haemolytic activity of the less polar triterpenoids, i.e. lupeol (1), allobetulin (4) and 28-oxoallobetulin (5), but not for betulin (2) and betulinic acid (3).18 Moreover, the presence of a supplementary carbonyl group (lactone function) on neosaponin 10 increases the haemolytic activity up to ten-fold in comparison with neosaponin 9. Noteworthy, allobetulin chacotrioside (9) is a quite interesting compound for farther in vivo studies since it is weakly haemolytic (HD50 = 90 \u00b1 9 fimol'L\" ) and exhibits a good cytotoxicity profile against cell lines derived from the most prevalent human cancer types. However, this saponin was as cytotoxic against healthy cells (WS1) than on cancer cells. In summary, a series of five saponins of the lupane- and germanicane-type bearing a chacotrioside moiety at the C-3 position were synthesized via a stepwise glycosylation strategy and evaluated for both their cytotoxic and haemolytic activities. Although the lupane-type chacotriosides did not show any cytotoxic activity, allobetulin and 28-oxoallobetulin chacotriosides (9 and 10), which are the rearrangement products of triterpenoids 2 and 3 respectively, exhibited an anticancer activity profile similar and even stronger than betulinic acid (3) against human cancer cell lines. On the whole, the results suggest that the cytotoxic and haemolytic activities of saponins containing a chacotrioside moiety at the C-3 position are correlated with the nature of the aglycone.

The target compound could be used in an anticancer prodrug monotherapy (PMT) strategy since it is non-cytotoxic, non-haemolytic, more water soluble than betulinic acid, possesses a good in vitro stability in phosphate buffer and can be hydrolyzed in the presence of jS-D-glucuronidase releasing in vitro betulinic a the main phase 2 metabolic pathways by which the organism transforms a drag or a xenobiotic into a more water soluble substance allowing its detoxification and further excretion.1 The glucuronidation reaction is catalyzed by enzymes of the of diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UDPGTs). Compounds into O-glucuronide ethers, while those containing carboxylic acid functions are transformed into O-glucuronide esters, the so-called acyl glucuronides. Since most of the glucuronides exhibit a weaker biological activity than their corresponding aglycones, the glucuronidation is generally considered as an important detoxification metabolic process in mammals.2 However, even if the giucuromde has no activity itself, it can undergo an enzymatic hydrolysis catalyzed by j8-D- glucuronidase that subsequently releases the corresponding biologically active aglycone.1 Furthermore, in some cases such as morphine-6-glucuronide, the glucuronidation can maintain or even increase the therapeutic effect of the drug.3 Several studies have revealed that acyl glucuronides are potentially active metabolites of carboxylic acid-containing drags.4 In fact, these compounds may be considered responsible for adverse side effects and the toxicity of such drugs.5 Indeed, acyl glucuronides can undergo hydrolytic reactions, intramolecular rearrangements with plasma proteins leading to covalent drug-protein adducts. ' Therefore, the determination and characterization of acyl glucuronide metabolites have important toxicological implications during the clinical development of carboxylic acid-containing drugs. Bevirimat or PA-457 (2, Figure 1), namely betulinic acid 3j8-O-(3',3'-dimethyisuccinyl), is the first in the new class of HIV drugs called maturation inhibitors that specifically block a late step in processing of the HIV Gag protein. Structurally, bevirimat (2) is a C-3 esterified derivative of the anticancer agent betulinic acid (1) that features two carboxylic acid groups. Recent studies have shown that bevirimat (2) is metabolized to two acyl monoglucuronides and one acyl diglucuronide after oral administration to rats, the rnonoglucuronide 4 (Figure 1) being the major metabolite.8'9 The naturally occurring lupane-type triterpenoid betulinic acid (1) is a promising anticancer agent10 found in various fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants.1' Betulinic acid (I) is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma. * Although metabolites of betulinic acid (1) have not yet been characterized, it may be hypothesized that acyl glucuronide 3 could be a major metabolic product. Therefore, it is of great importance to synthesize in adequate amounts the acyl glucuronide 3 in order to evaluate its biological activity and potential toxicity. 1 R1, R2 = H 0 II 2R1=\\\" v ^CO2H,R2 = H 3 R1 = H, R2 = | 4 R1 = Figure 1. Structures of betulinic acid (1), bevirimat (2) and acyl glucuronides 3 and 4. Anticancer compounds bearing a glucuronide moiety can also be considered as prodrugs. '3'14 Indeed, glucuronides can be selectively activated to the tumoral site since the enzyme 0-D-glucuromdase is found at highly elevated concentrations in necrotic tumor tissue. 3>1 Moreover, ^3-D-glucuronidase is more active in cytoplasmic acidic pH, which is usually found in cancer cells.17 The design of a281 suitable glucuronide prodrag must be based upon four criteria: 1) improved water solubility, 2) stability in blood, 3) decreased cytotoxicity, and 4) susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage,14 Thus, in this paper, we report an efficient stereoselective synthetic strategy for the preparation of 28-0-/8-D- glucuronide beiulinic acid (3). In vitro stability in phosphate buffer, in vitro haemolytic and cytotoxic activities as well as enzymatic hydroiysis in the presence of iS-D-glucuronidase were also investigated in order to determine if the acyl glucuronide 3 could be used in a prodrag monotherapy strategy (PMT). Although the synthesis of O-g!ucuronide ethers has been frequently reported in the literature,18\"20 few studies have been undertaken on the chemical synthesis of acyl glucuronide derivatives. '\" \"* A first approach developed by Juteau et al2* consists of coupling a carboxylic acid-containing compound with allyl glucuronate (6) via Mitsunobu conditions. The main advantage of this method is that the sugar is minimally protected, which considerably reduces the number of steps of the synthetic procedure. Thus, as depicted in Scheme i, allyl glucuronate (6)24 was obtained in 54% yield after treatment of D-glucuronic acid (5) with allyl bromide (AllBr) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in dimethylformamide (DMF). Compound 6 was then coupled with betulinic acid (1)\" in the presence of triphenylphosphine (PPI13) and anhydrous THF. Surprisingly, under these conditions, 28-O-a-D-glucuronide betulinic acid (7) was isolated in low yield (9%) as the major product instead of the allylated j3-anomer. The configuration of the glycosidic linkage Attempts to synthesize acyl glucuronide 3 via Mitsunobu (A) and selective acylation (B). Therefore, we turned to another approach recently developed by Stachulski and co-workers26'27 allowing the stereoselective formation of /3-glucuranides. As shown in Scheme 1, the selective acylation of allyl glucuronate (6) with betulinic acid revealed by TLC and NMR analyses, no coupling product was formed during this reaction and triterpene 1 was almost completely recovered after silica gel column chromatography. Addition of THF in order to improve the solubility of both compounds 1 and 6 did not lead to better results.282 We then chose to use the TEMPO-mediated selective oxidation28 to achieve the preparation of acyl glucuronide 3. As depicted in Scheme 2, this approach consists of selectively oxidizing the primary alcohol of the known 28-O-j8-D-glucopyranoside betulinic acid (8)29'30 in the presence of TEMPO/KBr/Ca(OCl)2 under aqueous conditions (?-BuQH/H2Q).31 Once again, using these conditions, no glucuronide was formed, probably due to a lack of solubility of glucoside 8 in the reaction medium. OH TEMPO/KBr/Ca(OCI)2 f-BuOH/H2O4:1 Scheme 2. Attempt to synthesize acyl glucuronide 3 via TEMPO-mediated selective oxidation of glucoside 8. The successful synthesis of 28-0-j8-D-glucuronide betulinic acid (3) was finally achieved under modified phase-transfer conditions.32 Thus, as shown in Scheme 3, betulinic acid (1) was coupled with the commercially available methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-l-bromo-D-glucopyranuronate (9) in the presence of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and tetrabutylaromonium bromide (Bi^NBr) in a heterogeneous solution of CH2CI2/H2O to provide 28-O-(methyl-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-/3-D-glucuronate) betulinic acid (1O)33 in good yield (76%). Subsequent simultaneous deprotection of acetyl groups and saponification of methyl ester under basic conditions (KOH, THF/H2O) allowed the formation of the target acyl glucuronide 334 (89%) in a synthesis of acyl glucuronide 3 under phase-transfer conditions.283 In order to determine if the acyl glucuronide 3 could be used as an anticancer prodrug in a PMT strategy, we investigated several parameters. Firstly, the in vitro cytotoxicity of glucuronide 3 was assessed against lung carcinoma (A549), colon adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) and normal skin fibroblasts (WS1) using both resazurin reduction test35 and Hoechst assay.36 As revealed in Table 1, the acyl glucuronide 3 did not exhibit any significant cytotoxic activity with an \u00cfC50 greater than 100 uM, The in vitro haemoiytie activity of glucuronide 3 was also assessed against sheep erythrocytes. As for most of the lupane-type glycosides, 7 no haemoiytie activity was measured for acyl glucuronide 3 (HD50 >100 uM). Another essential parameter to evaluate for an anticancer prodrug is its stability in solution. To this end, the in vitro stability was determined by analytical RP-HPLC38 after incubation at 37 \u00b0C of acyl glucuronide 3 in phosphate buffer (0.02 M; pH 7.2). As measured by Wen and co- workers8 for the bevirimat glucuronide 4, the acyl glucuronide 3 was quite stable and no decomposition products were observed even after a one-week incubation time (168 h) in phosphate buffer. It is noteworthy that acyl glucuronide 3 was significantly more water soluble than betulinic acid (1) since it was possible to dissolve it at low concentrations (\u00bb150 jiM) in phosphate buffer. Finally, cleavage of acyl glucuronide 3 in the presence of Escherichia coli /3-D-glucuronidase (4.3 U/mL) in phosphate buffer (0.02 M; pH 7.2) was measured by analytical RP-HPLC.38 As shown in Figure 2, it is quite interesting that betulinic acid (1) was released at 75% in the solution after a 24 h incubation time at 37 \u00b0C. Increasing by 10 fold the concentration of |3-D-glucuronidase (43 U/mL) led to the complete release of betulinic acid (1) after less than one hour. Therefore, these results showed that the acyl glucuronide 3 is a good substrate for the enzyme /3-D-glucuronidase. Table 1.

This novel methodology could be applied for the preparation of the major acyl glucuronide metabolite of bevirimat (4) or other carboxylic metabolites. In view of the results, acyl284 glucuronide 3 could be used as an anticancer prodrag in a PMT strategy since it is non-cytotoxie, non- haemolytic, more water soluble than betuiinic acid (1), quite stable in phosphate buffer and can be hydrolyzed in the presence of (3-D-glucuronidase releasing betuiinic acid (1), a promising anticancer agent. Further studies will be undertaken in order to assess the in vivo antitumor potential of the acyl glucuronide 3 and results will be reported in due course.
