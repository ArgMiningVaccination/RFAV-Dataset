We reviewed the literature on vaccines routinely recommended in HIV-infected patients to estimate how seroprotection decreases over time in those who initially responded to immunization. For each study retrieved from the literature, the decrease of seroprotection was modeled with a log binomial generalized linear model, and data were pooled in a meta-analysis to provide estimates of seroprotection 2 and 5 years after the last vaccine administration. Our analyses confirmed that the duration of seroprotection was shorter in HIV-infected patients and that with current guidelines, a substantial proportion of patients would have lost protective antibodies before a booster was proposed. We therefore discuss the implications for the monitoring of antibody levels and timing of revaccination in these patients. Keywords: HIV; meta-analysis; vaccination.
