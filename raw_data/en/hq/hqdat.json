I have been hearing about it for some time now. Recipes for juices and smoothies for a liver or colon detox have been doing the rounds in my social media .In fact, I recently heard of a clinic in Australia that is visited by the rich and the famous to get detoxed! So what is Detox? Detoxification or Detox is the removal of toxins from a living organism. And by \"toxins\", they mean poisonous material that is produced within the living organism. I would like to confess here that the word \"detox\" has been stuck in my mind for quite some time now.I am trying to \"detox\" since my chemo finished in 2014 and I got my Cancer back in 2015, knowing that \"detox\" is an ESSENTIAL step for fighting cancer. So with my brain buzzing with the word \"detox\", I arrived at the door of the blessed month of Dhul Hijjah. Having missed out on the opportunity to fast during Ramadan , I decided to fast in Dhul Hijjah and make the most out of the 10 blessed days. As I went through A-W-E-S-O-M-E resources on Dhul Hijjah, I was again incredibly amazed by the mercy of Allah [ that He ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ keeps providing us with opportunities to have our sins forgiven. He ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ so wants us in Jannah!](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) And then, some thing happened in my brain, akin to an electrical cross connection of wires. The wires labelled \"detox\" and \" productive 10 days\" connected and produced an electrical cloud which was full of question marks. I brushed the \"cloud\" aside and decided to focus on the 10 days and having my sins forgiven and prayers accepted. And then, I chanced upon a post on my Facebook Feed which said, \" Have you thought \"Why are these the 10 blessed days while we had the 10 blessed nights in Ramadan?\" A huge explosion sounded in my brain, the electrical cloud had burst. The words \"Spiritual Detox\" poured down upon me, drenching my senses completely. My mind became illuminated by the answer to the question on my Facebook newsfeed . Allah [ wants us to detox our lives. He ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ wants us to remove the poisonous activities in our daily lives which harm our faith. In other words, Allah](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ wants us to have a Huge Super Recharge of Imaan (Faith) .](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [Armed with this thought, I closely observed my activities and emotions for those 10 days. I noticed that I was conscious of reciting the takbirat more often, dealt with my negative emotions, kept a check on my temper with the kids and felt my heart soften. In general, my heart was in a better condition than before the commencement of the 10 days.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Blog_Dec02_Inside.jpg) Thus, I acknowledged the immense wisdom behind each action of Allah [ . ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) You and me are human beings, created weak. Allah [ says \".... And man has been created weak.\" (An Nisa, 4:28). Falling prey to the onslaught of Shaitan as the Messenger of Allah ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [said, \" \"The shaitan flows through man like blood.\" ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/saw-e1435236304866.png) [1](#fn-13669-1) It is extremely essential to detox our hearts from the waste that Shaitan creates as he moves in around us, luring us towards sin. Glory Be to Allah [ who loves to make it easy for us, to strengthen us so that we can withstand and fight the attack of the shaitan on us, as He ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ says \"...Allah intends to make things easy on you..\" (An Nisa, 4:28)](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) The inability of our hearts to forgive, love, restrain from sin, feel guilty upon committing one, submit to Allah [ is because of loads of toxins in our heart. Once the process of detoxification is over, the capacity of the heart to love, forgive, learn and submit increases manifold.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) And thus, we acknowledge the utmost importance of \"detoxing \" our hearts and of \"enrolling\" in self-help programs to do so. Let's see some \"programs\" for Spiritual Detox that we can successfully implement:- - Fasting - The third pillar of Islam gives us a great all rounded \"program\" for spiritual detox. Allah [says 'Every good deed of Adam's son is for him except fasting; it is for Me. and I shall reward (the fasting person) for it\".](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [2](#fn-13669-2). When we fast, we do it solely to gain Allah [pleasure and stay away from telling lies or backbiting and yelling. We are controlling our nafs(conscious). So, if you can fast, then go for it. Fast the 3 white days, or Monday and/or Thursday. Now what if you are like me and can't fast due to some illness? Hmm...no problem, imagine you are fasting and watch over your actions that day.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) - Read and understand the Quran -There can be no better cleanser of the heart than reading Quran and understanding what it says. It enters your heart and settles down quietly. You won't notice it till it raises it's voice to draw your attention to an act that you commit intentionally or unintentionally , which displeases Allah [. And then, it won't quieten down till you seek forgiveness from Allah](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [and fix your mistake. It boosts spiritual health and growth. So read with understanding insha'Allah.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) - Do istighfar excessively \u2014 Have you ever felt like there is a heavy weight on your heart? Like there was something that was holding it tight? It is the sins that we commit intentionally or unintentionally. The Messenger of Allah [said , \"There is (at times) some sort of shade upon my heart, and I seek forgiveness from Allah a hundred times a day.\"](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/saw-e1435236304866.png) [3](#fn-13669-3)Allah [says \"And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful\" (An Nisa, 4:110)](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) - Treat your heart to the dhikr of Allah [\u2014 Let me ask you a question. What happens to a fish when its taken out of water? It dies. Exactly! Ibn Qayyim said, \"Remembrance of Allah to the heart is what water is to the fish\". When toxins overload our system, we feel fatigued and sick, rendering us unable to do many things. That is why we \"detox our system\" by eating foods that cleanse our bodies. Similarly, remembrance of Allah](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [is that \"food\" for our hearts that cleanses our sins and negative emotions.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) - Treat yourself to a \"deeni treat\" - Usually, we have a favorite smoothie or juice that we drink to detox. Similarly, do you have favorite speaker, writer or website that you regularly follow for their content? Or maybe a friend with whom you enjoy discussions on hadith or tafseer or a dua? Grab yourself a cup of your favorite coffee and listen to the speaker or while you read. Sit back, relax and enjoy the flow of conversation with your friend. - Talk to Allah [- I cannot tell you what a quick and thorough spiritual detox occurs when you do an act that pleases Allah](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [and have a good hearty talk with Him](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [after that. Tahajuud is the best time but if you can't make it, then just have a \"talk\" with Allah](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [any time of the day. Sit alone without any distractions and go for it. You will feel the tears flow quietly down your cheek, the ties that hold your heart tight will start loosening and a warmth will surround your soul.](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) - Inculcate a Good Habit - Some act/s of goodness like visiting the sick , joining a local weekly halaqa, volunteering, etc., acts are excellent quick detox actions as they increase the level of faith and God consciousness in a person. In the end , I would sincerely like you to give spiritual detox your serious attention. Toxins, physical and spiritual are a reality. They restrict our growth and restrain us from enjoying this beautiful life that Allah [ has given us. Its our right to live a life in which we fulfill our purpose for being created which is to worship Allah ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ and enjoy the various blessings that He ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) [ has bestowed upon us. The only way to do it is to continuously detox and grow. It doesn't take long to do. ](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) Allah [ says , \"The day wherein neither wealth nor son will avail a person except the one who comes to Allah with a sound heart} (Al-Shu'ara: 88-89)](https://blog.islamiconlineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-Subhanahu-wa-Taala.png) May Allah [ make us those who, when they leave this world, have a pure heart that has been cleansed so many times that it shines bright with His love and mercy.
