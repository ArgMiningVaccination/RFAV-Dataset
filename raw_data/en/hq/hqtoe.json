The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. John L. Mica (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Mica, Towns, Tierney, and Waxman. Staff present: director; Davenport, clerk; Cherri Branson, minority counsel; and Jean Gosa, minority staff assistant. Mr. Mica. Good morning, I would like to call this meeting of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources to order. This morning, the topic of hearing is ``Hepatitis B Vaccine: Helping or Hurting Public Health?'' I will begin this morning's proceeding by reading my opening statement, then I will yield to the minority for their opening comments and other Members who may join us. Finally we will proceed to our four panels this morning, and I am sure into this afternoon. Public health, including vaccine safety, is critically important to our subcommittee. Today we are exercising our oversight responsibility for the Department of Health and Human Services, and we are committed to ensuring that our national immunization policies and programs are functioning properly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration are Federal agencies primarily responsible for immunization policy and safety. They will be sharing their expertise with us later in this hearing. There is no doubt that immunizations have greatly improved public health in our country. Small pox has been eradicated, and cases of polio, tetanus, and diphtheria are today very rare. These are great victories for our public health system. Unfortunately, however, the history of immunization shows that sometimes vaccinations do injure a child or an individual rather than inoculating them. That is why Congress created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986 to compensate those who have been harmed by a vaccine. My colleague, the ranking member of our full committee, the gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, who I hope will be joining us shortly, and my brother Dan Mica, who was then a Member of Congress from Florida, worked to successfully enact that law. Oversight of that law and program, I believe, is a very important congressional responsibility. This is the first oversight hearing on that law held in 10 years. The purpose of which is not only to protect vaccine manufacturers, but also to compensate individuals injured from inoculation by a vaccine. I do have some concerns whether the compensation fund is working in the way Congress intended, and we will discuss that today and possibly hold additional hearings. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued new rules making it harder to receive compensation, so that while there is over $1 billion in the fund, only a fraction of that was awarded last year. The vaccine experience in the early 1980's also demonstrates that when a pattern of injuries from a vaccine emerges, the vaccine can be made safer. The crisis in public confidence in diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, DPT as it is commonly known, led to creating the compensation law and also resulted in the creation of a safer vaccine. Today what is termed the ``whole cell vaccine'' that caused the controversy is coming off the market, and has been replaced by a safer vaccine called ``acellular vaccine.'' Today, we have convened individuals from a variety of government, academic, professional, and citizens groups in an effort to provide a structured opportunity for Members of this subcommittee to ask questions about the Federal Government's hepatitis B vaccine policy and its impact on our public health. I want to make very clear at the outset that the purpose of this hearing is not to scare parents away from immunizing their children. That should not be the result of today's hearing. The purpose of this hearing is to examine the effectiveness of the 1986 law, also to learn more about how our Federal agencies are administering immunization policy and monitoring and analyzing the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine, and finally to review evidence of adverse reactions to the vaccine. The hepatitis B virus is certainly a very serious disease. We will hear today from witnesses who have experienced the terrible effects of this disease. In 1996, the CDC reported 10,637 new cases of hepatitis B, 279 cases which affected individuals below the age of 14. The CDC estimates that 4,000 to 5,000 people each year die from hepatitis B-related liver disease. To combat this disease, the CDC issued guidelines in 1991 recommending that every infant receive the hepatitis B vaccine. In 1995 the CDC recommended the routine vaccination of teenagers. The FDA first licensed a plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine in 1981. In 1986, the FDA licensed the first recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, meaning the vaccine is the first genetically engineered one. Based on CDC recommendations, 42 States mandate that children be vaccinated before entering kindergarten; 20 million children a year now receive some type of required vaccine. Almost 90 percent of all children in this country are now immunized. When a parent takes their child in for a vaccine, they are supposed to be given an information sheet outlining the risks and benefits of the vaccine. While almost all of the States mandating childhood vaccinations allow exemptions, the information sheet does not tell parents that these exemptions exist. Recent news reports have questioned the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine, and have also suggested an association between the vaccine and multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders. I would like to point out a report I have seen from New Hampshire. The 48 reported adverse reactions to the vaccine in children aged 1 to 10 in recent years were 16 times greater than the cases of the disease. There were only three cases of the disease. It was reported that there were four times as many child deaths, 11, as there were cases of the disease. If this is true, I find the information quite shocking. We will hear more about these statistics later in the hearing from some of the researchers that were involved in analyzing this particular series of cases. Is it possible that the preventive measure for the disease is riskier than the disease itself? We must ask ourselves that question. But our job today is not to prove whether or not this vaccine causes illnesses or death. Instead, we have created a forum for asking questions about what scientific evidence does exist and whether further studies should be completed. Specifically, I would like this hearing today to examine some of the following issues. First, what is being done to study the adverse reactions reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System? Second, do the benefits of administering the vaccine to infants outweigh the risks? Third, what process does the CDC employ to make a recommendation for a vaccine? What role do pharmaceutical companies play in that process, and do conflicts of interest exist? Fourth, what disclosure is required before the vaccine is given, and is that disclosure adequate? With this outline in mind, I would like to now recognize the ranking member of our full committee. As I mentioned before, he was one of the individuals very much involved in passage of the 1986 law. I know he worked with my brother Dan on this matter, and was very instrumental in reviewing this whole matter of vaccinations, adverse reactions, and compensation. So I am delighted that he has joined us, and I would like to recognize our ranking member, the gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, for a statement. Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your recognizing me to make this opening statement and I want to thank you for the accommodations that you have made in adding additional witnesses to this hearing. This hearing today touches on an extremely important public health issue. Vaccination is an essential weapon against infectious disease, and I think it is important that we pay attention to how well we are succeeding in our fight against infectious disease. While childhood diseases continue to spread death, disability, and misery through other parts of the world, the United States has made tremendous progress against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and other diseases. Without vaccination, our population would be vulnerable to devastating outbreaks of these diseases. We cannot be complacent about our success. Unlike our parents and grandparents, we are not terrorized every year by the threat of polio and whooping cough epidemics. Perhaps that makes it easier to doubt the value of vaccines and to focus on their potential risk, but if children are discouraged and parents frightened from the vaccines and do not take these important vaccines, we will quickly become vulnerable again to infectious diseases. No one doubts that there are adverse reactions to some vaccines. They happen. Children and adults suffer disease or disability as a result. That is why I sponsored the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 which established the compensation program. This program relies upon the best available science and medicine to provide an alternative to litigation for individuals who suffered the specific vaccine- related injuries. Today, we must continue to rely upon what science tells us about the benefit and risks of vaccines. We know that hepatitis B kills 4,000 to 5,000 people in the United States every year. We know that at least 25,000 children are infected with hepatitis B each year, and we know hepatitis B is a silent killer that waits decades before destroying livers and ending lives. Everything we know about the hepatitis B vaccine indicates that its benefits far outweigh its risks. That being said, we must naturally remain vigilant and continue epidemiological research into potential side effects of the vaccine. Today, we are going to hear compelling stories from both sides of the controversy over hepatitis B vaccines. We will hear from families who have suffered adverse reactions to the vaccines or health problems they believe are linked to the vaccine. We will hear from the families of those who have experienced hepatitis B, the social stigma surrounding it, and the fears engendered by this highly infectious disease, and I am sympathetic to all of our witnesses and look forward to their testimony. Mr. Chairman, I wish to submit for the record, along with this statement, letters and statements supporting hepatitis B vaccine from leading medical and patient organizations, including the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Liver Foundation, Hepatitis Foundation, and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. I think it is important to have in our record what these public health groups say about this vaccine and their support of the efforts to continue the vaccination program. I am pleased that we have Congressman Moakley, who will tell us from his own experience about the hepatitis disease; and I welcome all of the other witnesses and look forward to their testimony. Mr. Mica. I thank the gentleman. Without objection, the items that he mentioned will be made part of the record. [The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A. Waxman and the information referred since notice of the hearing, we have many associations and groups from all over the country providing us with remarks they have requested be entered in the record. I would like to ask unanimous consent that they also be made part of the record and without objection, so ordered. I would now like to recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing on the important topic of hepatitis B vaccine. Less than 100 years ago, infectious diseases were the most common cause of death, disability, and disease in the United States. Polio, pertussis, measles, and diphtheria killed and disabled millions of people. However, because of the development and use of vaccines, these diseases are a distant memory for most Americans. Unfortunately, as old threats fade away, new threats to public health emerge. Today hepatitis B, an infectious disease which can be eliminated with universal vaccination, unnecessarily kills thousands of people a year in the United States. According to the CDC, in the United States, 200,000 people contract hepatitis B each year. Each year over 11,000 people are hospitalized and 20,000 remain chronically infected. Overall, an estimated 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis B infection; and 4,000 to 5,000 die each year from hepatitis B, related chronic liver disease or liver cancer. Hepatitis B vaccine prevents both hepatitis B infection and those diseases related to hepatitis B infection. The vaccine has been available since 1982. The CDC has recommended the hepatitis vaccine as part of the routine infant vaccination schedule since 1991. Prior to the CDC recommendations, approximately 30,000 infants and children became infected with hepatitis B each year. Hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective. More than 20 million people have received the hepatitis B vaccine in the United States and more than 500 million have received the vaccine worldwide. Mr. Chairman, I am glad to hear all of our witnesses today, but particularly honored with the presence of Representative Joe Moakley, dean of the Massachusetts delegation. We all know Mr. Moakley as the voice of the 9th Congressional District of Massachusetts and the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee. However, many of us are not aware of his personal experience with hepatitis B. In the 1980's he was diagnosed with hepatitis B. For several years he didn't know that he had contracted the disease. However, in 1995 with only a few months to live because of the damage the disease had caused to his liver, he received a liver transplant. Today he is a healthy man, and he is here to share with us his thoughts about the hepatitis B vaccine, and I look forward particularly to hearing his testimony. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for this important hearing. Mr. Mica. Thank you again for your opening statement and also for your comments and introductory remarks about our colleague, Mr. Moakley. [The prepared statement of first panel is made up of individuals who have had some personal experience with hepatitis B, including our colleague. Let me introduce the panel, and I think Mr. Tierney has given an introduction to Joe Moakley. We have Michael Belkin, Judy Converse, Marilyn and Lindsay Kirschner, Barbara Hahn, Karen with PKIDS, and we have Betty Fluck. That is our first panel, and again all of these individuals have some personal relationship and experience with the problem of hepatitis B. Except for Mr. Moakley--we don't swear in our Members of Congress--this subcommittee is an investigations and oversight subcommittee, and so we do swear in our witnesses. Again, with the exception of our Member, if you could all please stand. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Mica. The witnesses have answered in the affirmative and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome each and every one of you for participating and for coming forward and providing this subcommittee with your important testimony and personal experience. Since we have such a large number of requests for witnesses, we are going to try to adhere pretty strongly to the 5-minute rule. If you have a lengthy statement or additional information you would like made part of the record, upon request we will have that entered into the record. So with those opening remarks and welcome, I would like to now recognize the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts and ranking member, former chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. Moakley. STATEMENTS OF HON. JOHN JOSEPH MOAKLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS; MICHAEL BELKIN; JUDY CONVERSE; MARILYN AND LINDSAY KIRSCHNER; BARBARA HAHN; KAREN WITH PKIDS; AND BETTY FLUCK Mr. Moakley. Thank you very much, Chairman Mica and Congressman Waxman and my colleague from Massachusetts, Congressman Tierney. I thank you very much for allowing me to testify today and give my perspective on the hepatitis B immunization. As Congressman Tierney said, I was diagnosed with hepatitis B in the early 1980's. The doctors thought I may have gotten it on a congressional fact-finding trip to China, but they were not sure. Mr. Chairman, this is one of the frightening aspects of hepatitis B. Thousands and thousands of people contract it and have no idea how they got it. In fact, 40 percent of the people who get hepatitis B aren't in the so-called high-risk categories and don't even realize that they have it for many, many years. I was sick for years, and had no idea that my liver was failing. In the spring of 1995, after a thorough examination, my doctor told me I had 2 months to live. The hepatitis virus had led to cirrhosis of my liver. I was very sick, had no strength; and I was severely jaundiced, but I was one of the lucky ones. I was put on a waiting list for an organ transplant and received a donor organ just before it was too late. This July it will be 4 years since my successful liver transplant, and there is not a day that goes by that I don't thank God for my renewed health. Unfortunately, 1.25 million Americans have hepatitis B and are potentially infectious to others. Each year 150,000 Americans get hepatitis B and 4,000 to 5,000 die from it. These are very alarming statistics, made even more tragic by the sad reality that we have a severe shortage of organ donors in this country, and many of these people with hepatitis B will eventually require a liver transplant. That is why immunization is still the most effective means of preventing hepatitis B and its consequences. Hepatitis B vaccines are safe and highly effective in preventing hepatitis B infection amongst susceptible children and adults. You say 42 States; I don't know. It is somewhere between 38 and 42, including my own State of Massachusetts, that have enacted laws requiring children to be vaccinated against hepatitis B before they enter kindergarten. Immunization is still the best weapon and by far the most cost-effective way we have to prevent this devastating disease. I have heard of the recent reports which question the safety and the efficacy of the hepatitis B vaccine. Some of them link the vaccine to multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases. But, Mr. Chairman, I have some of the same information that Mr. Waxman has. The World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society have all recommended that the hepatitis B vaccine not be suspended. Experts have reviewed the data and determined that there is no clinical or scientific evidence whatsoever linking the hepatitis B vaccine with multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune disorders. The fact of the matter is that the benefits of the hepatitis B vaccine far outweigh any of the claimed risks. Hepatitis B infection is still a real threat in this Nation and throughout the globe. That is why it is so important to continue with this immunization. These are programs to prevent the spread of this terrible disease. Hepatitis B is a highly contagious disease, 100 times more contagious than HIV; and we have to continue to immunize our infants and children. The truth is, when immunization rates fall the disease returns. We saw this a few years ago when there were huge outbreaks of measles, which everybody assumed was under control. So even though these reports of people developing disorders after vaccinations are very, very tragic, we need to look at the clinical and scientific evidence. The Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization, and the French Government have all conducted studies that conclude there is no evidence of a causal relationship between hepatitis B and multiple sclerosis or other disorders. As sad as these stories are, and I have heard them all, Mr. Chairman, they should not determine public health policy in this country. Because, Mr. Chairman, if we suspend immunization programs, we will only end up with more cases of hepatitis B that could be even more tragic. Take it from me. I don't wish this terrible disease on anyone. There is no reason for anyone to suffer from this disease. It is totally preventable. So I look forward to the day that hepatitis B meets the same fate as small pox. Mr. Chairman, this vaccination will help get us there. Thank you very much, and I have a conflict of time so if there are any questions, I would be glad to answer them now, and then I would like to be excused. Mr. Mica. Thank you. We would be glad to extend that courtesy to you. [The prepared statement of do you have any questions of Mr. Moakley at this time? Mr. Waxman. No. I want to thank you very much for your testimony. I think you have told us in a very eloquent way, from your own personal experience, if we can prevent this disease and how important it would be to do so. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. I have no questions. Just to thank you and say that we are glad that the results are as they were. Mr. Moakley. I am, too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Moakley. I don't have any questions at this time, but I am going to listen to all of the panels that we have, and I may personally get back with you. Mr. Moakley. That would be great. Mr. Mica. And, hopefully, have some more educated questions at that time. Mr. Moakley. And I would be willing to present myself to the panel once again, if necessary. Mr. Mica. We will now hear from Mr. Michael Belkin. Mr. Belkin. Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to submit for the record, the 25,000 adverse reaction reports from the government reporting system and my recorded testimony which is an investigation of those reports. Mr. Mica. I don't know if we will be able to submit all of those in the record. But what we can do is make reference to them, and they can be kept with the committee. I think that would be appropriate. Is that acceptable? Mr. Tierney. That is fine. Mr. Mica. We will do that because it is almost impossible to include all of those in the report. We will make reference to them, and they will be kept with the committee records. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Belkin. My daughter Lyla Rose Belkin died on September 16, 1998, at the age of 5 weeks, about 15 hours after receiving her second hepatitis B vaccine booster shot. Lyla was a lively, alert 5-week-old baby when I last held her in my arms. Little did I imagine as she gazed intently into my eyes, with all of the innocence and wonder of a newborn child, that she would die that night. She was never ill before receiving the hepatitis B shot that afternoon. At her final feeding, she was extremely agitated, noisy and feisty and then she fell asleep suddenly and stopped breathing. The autopsy ruled out choking. The New York medical examiner ruled her death sudden infant death syndrome, but in the notes and in the conversations with our pediatrician on the day of the autopsy--this is in the pediatrician's notes--what the coroner said, ``Brain swollen. Not sure cause yet. Could not see how recombinant vaccine could cause problem.'' SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion. It means it is not this, it is not that. A swollen brain is not SIDS. It turns out in the medical literature a swollen brain, brain inflammation, is one of the most common signs of an adverse reaction to a vaccine. I set out to do an investigation of this vaccine and adverse reactions, and these are my conclusions and I urge you to read them. I have some prepared remarks that are far too lengthy to summarize here. First of all, let's look at the vaccination policy in this country, this Rube Goldberg flowchart that I have. This committee has oversight over the CDC, which has oversight over the ACIP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. This committee sets immunization policy, and I urge you to really concentrate on this. I think there is a conflict between the public interest and the private interest of drug companies and the interest of the bureaucracy that is violating the public interest. As an oversight committee, I think this is something that you should look into. This committee sets mandates which go out to the States and go to the children, and some small percentage of children have adverse events which go into this thing called VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. From VAERS they go into an empty drawer, and they pile up and go nowhere and nothing is done. The CDC and the FDA do studies saying we don't see any problem with anything. Can you please change the chart. First of all, newborn babies are not at risk of getting this disease. I quote you the risk groups from the CDC hepatitis B disease fact sheet: injection drug users, sexually active heterosexuals, homosexual men, infants from disease endemic areas, low socioeconomic levels, sexual household contacts of infected persons, infants born to infected mothers, healthcare workers, chemodialysis patients. Not newborn babies. Then why do you say are newborn babies infected with hepatitis B? The vaccine is the first thing that they get in the first 24 to 48 hours of their lives in the hospital. Here is the ACIP's original statement from 1991. ``In the United States, most infections occur among adults and adolescents. Efforts to vaccinate persons in the major risk groups have had limited success. In the long term, universal infant vaccination would eliminate the need for vaccinating adolescents and high- risk adults.'' And then they say, ``Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants. The first dose can be administered during the newborn period, preferably before the infant is discharged from the hospital.'' That is where it came from. I quote you from government statistics, summary of notifiable diseases, 54 cases of hepatitis B in the 0 to 1 age group in 1996. And if we compare that, that is that. In the VAERS reports in that year, there is more than 1,000 adverse reaction reports, and there are 47 deaths of these reports. So this needs to be investigated. I am not saying that every report in VAERS is directly related to the vaccine, but I have torn apart the VAERS data, and I am trained in statistics. I am an advisor to some of the largest financial institutions in the world and a former proprietary trading strategist at Salomon Brothers. One of the most striking findings of this data is that almost 80 percent of the reports of hepatitis B, 77 percent are in females; only 23 percent in males. More than three times as many women are having adverse reactions reported in VAERS. No one is looking at this. Dr. Chen of the CDC dismisses it and says nurses tend to over-report. I think that is a big mistake. Independent doctors with no financial interest should take a look at this. I would just like to conclude with the way vaccine policy is set in this country. Dr. Modlin at the ACIP meeting on February 19, which I attended in Atlanta said--first of all he said at a debate in New Hampshire: ``How do we decide something? Is the theory biologically plausible? Has it been tested by appropriate methods? Is the study well concluded? Are the results statistically sound?'' Now I read to you from the transcript of the ACIP meeting regarding the approved rotavirus for premature infants: ``Available data are insufficient to fully establish the safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccine in premature infants.'' There is a section under Adverse Events that details what little information there actually is with respect to premature infants. To my knowledge, we don't have data from a clinical trial specifically. Some bit of information, as I recall, suggested that there was a relative risk for hospitalization. Obviously, a situation where we have to make a judgment in the absence of data and with a vaccine that has not yet been tested in this group. They voted 9 to 1 to approve rotavirus vaccine for premature infants with no scientific statistical studies on it. I think that is a big problem. This is my charge to you. I am afraid that this vaccine policy is dominated by forces that are not in the public interest and this committee should investigate the 1991 ACIP recommendation establishing universal hepatitis B vaccination of newborn babies; and if, as with the rotavirus vaccine examples were done, no studies were done to prove that this was safe in a broad sample of racially and genetically diverse babies less than 24 to 48 hours old when they established this recommendation, we can find those studies. We have a Freedom of Information Act request in from the National Vaccine Information Center. Then the CDC has been experimenting on babies like guinea pigs, and this committee should suspend that universal at-birth immunization policy. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony. We will hold questions until we have heard from all of the witnesses. [The prepared statement are recognized. Ms. Converse. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I regret having a reason to speak here today and have no other reason to do so except for the sake of truth. I live in Massachusetts. I wish to state also that I hold a master's degree in public health and I am a registered dietician, I was trained to accept and encourage immunization and was in no way inclined against immunizing my son Benjamin. He is 2\\1/2\\ now. I would like to say there is no history of autism or seizure disorder in my family or my husband's family. If Ben were here in front of you today, he would seem completely normal, but I will try to explain a little bit about his disability which he struggles with every day. He was born full term, normal in every way. Vaginal birth with no interventions or drugs. His Apgar scores were 9 and 10, which means that all of his reflexes were perfect and present. Before discharge, he was immunized with Recombivax HB against hepatitis B. Neither I nor my husband recall receiving informed consents for this vaccine, nor do we recall seeing him get the shot, but it is in his immunization record. No signed informed consent specific to this hepatitis B vaccine was present in the copy of Ben's medical record which we recently requested. His fourth night in this world was his first at home. And about 5 hours after arriving home, he had his first seizure. Frantic calls to maternity and pediatric staff fell on deaf ears. The extent of the medical advice we received was to put him on our clothes dryer and turn it on. No one mentioned the vaccine. No one expressed concern that he was turning blue, that he couldn't stop screaming or that he appeared to be having tremors or full-body spasms. Ben had 3 more seizures, losing consciousness in the next 8 days, as well as many episodes of arching his spine rigidly without losing consciousness. He vomited forcefully every day, had a recurring mild fever, eczema, was unable to remain asleep, had diarrhea and cried constantly, but no one thought any of this was out of the ordinary. I was told these thing are normal for a breast fed infant which, of course, I knew was not true. He was only 12 days old. The third time he passed out, he did not resume consciousness. He was cyanotic. At the emergency room he was tested for several diagnoses and all were negative or inconclusive. He was observed overnight, and after nearly losing him, we were sent home the next day with a shrug. No one mentioned the vaccine. No one expressed interest or concern for the events of the previous week and no one advised us in any way about what appeared to be seizures and a struggle for his life. Ben's medical record even states in a gross understatement that his first days of life prior to this admission were uneventful. The same doctor who wrote this note privately admonished me for agreeing with the attending pediatricians to spare Ben the trauma of another spinal tap. Convinced Ben had meningitis, he said, ``It is people like you who cause lifelong mental retardation.'' Ben's discharge note states only that he had apnea, despite having tested negative for it. We entered the hospital looking for answers but left with none. He worsened with the second immunization for hepatitis B at age 4 weeks. This was when I realized he had been given the shot at birth and that was probably causing his problem. I asked for a delay for Ben's other immunizations at 2 months and was refused. I knew that accepted pediatric practice dictates that a sick child should not be immunized, but the doctor refused. When I persisted, he told me we could either immunize Ben on schedule, which we had to do because it was the law, or we could call DSS. With this threat, Ben was immunized and all of his symptoms worsened. At 4 months he was immunized again. At 6 months, I refused further shots and switched doctors. He was seen by neurologists and developmental specialists, but no one could explain why he was too floppy to attempt normal developmental tasks, couldn't sleep, suckled poorly, kept vomiting, why eczema persisted, despite being breast fed, why he passed out in shock when he heard Velcro, plastic bags, or aluminum foil. By age 10 months, he could not pull himself to sitting or crawling and could not roll over. We sought help from the Early Intervention Program, and Ben qualified for services based on his motor delays. For the first time, a formal acknowledgment of his delays was drafted. Reflexes which were normal at birth had disintegrated and protective responses inexplicably delayed. Ben had two or three seizures a week during his early infancy and early toddlerhood. The events of these seizures never vary and Ben had one as recently as 2 months ago. He cries hard with one breath which seems to empty his lungs; and he is then silent, mouth open, not breathing and struggling for air. Excuse me. As he suffocates, he turns red, blue, and then purple. His extremities become blue, his limbs flail as if he is drowning. Often on his left side Ben will have a flapping tremor of his hand while his arm, neck, and shoulder are rigidly flexed. As his asphyxiation is complete, he is gray. His eyes lose their luster, his pupils dilate and his eyes roll back in his head and then he is unconscious. He usually regains consciousness quickly once his muscles are relaxed and he can breathe again, but these episodes are traumatic, exhausting, and frightening for Ben. They invariably occur in response to a stimulus he cannot manage, whether it is auditory anxiety related or from a fall or bump. Even though Ben had seizures like this when he was just a few days old, we were told they were breath-holding spells which he consciously contrived in response to our overprotectiveness. The doctors told us we were causing Ben's seizures, odd behaviors, and delays by bad parenting. I was told I over-nursed him by one neurologist, and asked why I needed something to be wrong with my son by a pediatric developmental specialist. I believe this is a grossly ignorant assessment of what may be grand mal seizure episodes. Ben also appears to have petit mal seizures in which he rolls his eyes back in his head and grimaces, pierces the air above his head with his left hand, elbow locked, and hand quivering. Ben was diagnosed with autism recently and sensory integrative disorder last fall. He cannot reliably sense, organize, or prioritize information that he receives about anything in the world. He cannot be placed in group daycare. He is terrified of his own peers. These few examples don't describe how profoundly disabled he is now. I would especially like to state that our pediatric providers were very unsupportive, and I do believe my son would have died if I followed their advice. We have had very little guidance from them through this journey. His current physician agrees not to immunize him and has supported our refusals, but she has not reported his reaction and discouraged me from doing so. She told me we would be harassed by the Massachusetts State Department of Public Health and forced to prove damage from each vaccine with invasive blood tests. When we asked for a medical waiver, she gave us only a vague philosophical one. She acknowledged to me that the hepatitis vaccine is an unnecessary affront to an infant's well-being and she refuses to give the younger two or her three children this vaccine because it is of no benefit. I have no doubt in my mind that this vaccine damaged my son, not just because he was normal at birth, full term with a family history void of these problems, but because the progression of events after the shot are in keeping with criteria for a hepatitis B vaccine adverse event listed by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The fact that the pediatric community failed to recognize his reaction in no way exonerates them or the vaccine industry. It simply means that thousands of healthy newborns will slip through the cracks with severe reactions and be untreated and un-acknowledged. After reading data on hepatitis B in the United States, as a person trained in public health sciences, it is plain to me that a program to vaccinate newborns is of no worth to anyone except those who sell vaccines. The immunity it imparts wears off before a child is old enough to have sex with an infected partner or use contaminated needles, which are the foremost modes of transmission. Therefore, it is my opinion that there is no benefit and only risk for newborns receiving this vaccine. Thank you. [The prepared statement for your testimony. We now recognize Ms. Kirschner and Lindsay Kirschner at this time. Ms. Marilyn Kirschner. I thank you for having us here today. I am here with my daughter Lindsay, maintaining a commitment to pave the way so that other parents can make an informed choice in regard to the hepatitis B vaccine. Lindsay is representative of all of the children who fall under the mandate. Six months before the vaccine, we had an idyllic life, reveling in the joy of Lindsay's bat mitzvah, perfect in every way. Lindsay received the hepatitis B vaccine 2 days before entering high school. The next day she seemed flu-like. The day after that, so dizzy she couldn't stand up without holding the walls. The following day she passed out. So our life goes since August 1997. Lindsay has had syncopal and pre-syncopal episodes. Her ability to stand was compromised for almost 6 months due to unremitting dizziness. Following our doctor's advice, unknown the vaccine was the culprit, Lindsay had the series of three. It was on the third shot Lindsay became so violently ill within 2 hours that I knew the vaccine was the catalyst of her illness. At 16, Lindsay should be having fun with friends, dating and driving. Instead, her days are filled with doctor visits, 15 specialists, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal taps, ER visits, and hospital admissions. Lindsay is plagued on a daily basis with headaches of a severe kind, joint pain, seizures, nausea, hair loss, dizziness, gastroesophogal reflux, and extreme fatigue. She has been diagnosed with an Acquired Dysautonomia and is unable to hold food down with frequent retching and vomiting. She takes a minimum of 10 medications daily; and if she misses one, her ability to stand is in serious jeopardy for up to a month. We have traveled to specialists in four States and will be traveling to doctors in two more States before July. Unfortunately, Lindsay is not isolated in her journey. After WPLG Miami health reporter Kristi Krueger broke Lindsay's story, the first one to air in the country, I heard from dozens of people who have themselves been, or have family members, affected by this vaccine. Please join me in viewing some clips from the Emmy Award- winning broadcast that brought national attention to this issue. Mr. Mica. Maybe while they are trying to get that working-- -- Ms. Marilyn Kirschner. I will finish my testimony. Family life as we knew it has been destroyed. This illness is an emotional and an extreme financial drain, as I am hardly able to work, depending on my family to support us and feeling like a beggar for our survival. As a single parent, this vaccine has ripped out a part of our lives that can't be replaced. Lindsay, my former National Junior Honor Society president in 8th grade, is now on a 504 disability plan, missing 70 days of 9th grade and pushing beyond that in this, her 10th grade year. What about her future, college, a career? Will my son David ever forgive me for being so unavailable last year when he was a senior now that he is 3,000 miles away in L.A.? The joy of his scholarship offers and prom departure all took a back seat to Lindsay's illness. Or the fact that he is spending his birthday on a plane so we could be at this hearing after just returning Sunday from his first year at USC. What about Lindsay's puppy, Frisbee, and bird, Boca, who are boarded almost as much as they are at home? What about our shattered lives, barely a fragment left of what used to be? Tragedy is not supposed to be the American way. Lindsay, nor anyone, should have to live like this because scientific studies weren't done to determine if this vaccine was safe to give to every child. My daughter shouldn't have to suffer like this because government officials and drug company executives didn't do their jobs. Thank you. [The prepared statement you for your testimony, and now we will recognize Lindsay Kirschner. Ms. Lindsay Kirschner. Thank you. I would just like you to imagine having a life like the one that follows. Your day starts at 2 a.m., when your body starts jerking uncontrollably and a burning smell fills the air. After your body relaxes, you drift back to sleep only to be awakened a short hour later overcome by nausea. You reach for the bowl that is always on the side of your bed because you've had this feeling before, and you know it is not going to be pretty. Maybe you get another 2 or 3 hours of sleep, but a soothing voice awakens you at 6:15 because it is time to get ready for school. You feel a killer headache approaching on the ride and you dread the thought of sitting in classrooms for the next 6\\1/2\\ hours while fighting constant dizziness and nausea. When you try to take your Algebra II tests, you realize that you have forgotten the formulas to use, even though you wrote them more than 25 times in your homework last night. As the day passes, you look at other kids and long to be normal like them. And maybe for 10 minutes in between constant aches and pains, you manage to forget your problems and feel like you do belong. But then a sudden sharp pain in your arm or the urge to vomit reminds you how different you truly are. Let's face it. You haven't made it through one full week of school in your 10th grade year of high school. You struggle to keep your head up throughout the remainder of the day and are relieved when the dismissal bell finally rings. When you get home, forget watching Rosie or MTV. Your eyes are already closing, and so you fall into the comfort of your bed and stay there for the next couple hours. If you manage to wake up in time to do all of your homework, then you struggle to finish it because sitting at the computer brings constant dizziness. Later, when you start retching, you instantly regret eating the food you had for dinner, whether it be nachos or pasta, and you vow never to eat it again, no matter how delicious it tastes. Although you are anxious to get more sleep, the thought of nighttime evokes anxiety because as you lie in bed, you know that in just a few short hours, the painful cycle will begin again and your struggle will continue. To most of you, this would just be a bad dream. But it is the reality I have faced for the past 2 years; and no matter how hard I pinch myself, it won't go away. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared statement don't know if we can get this to restart there. These are clips that you have provided, Mrs. Kirschner. [Video shown.] Mr. Mica. I would like to thank both of you for your testimony and recognize at this time Barbara Hahn. Barbara, you are recognized. Welcome. Ms. Hahn. Thank you. I would like to thank also Congressman Mica for allowing me to be here to testify today. My name is Barbara Hahn. I am from the greater Cincinnati area north of Kentucky. Up until several months ago, I was employed as an interpreter for the deaf which takes a lot of concentration, and also I am a chaplain. In June 1995 I was diagnosed with hepatitis B. That was about a week before my 25th wedding anniversary. My doctor told my husband and I that I had a sexually transmitted disease and that he should be tested and vaccinated. What the doctor failed to tell me at the time was that hepatitis B could be spread in many other ways. I had complete trust in my husband and thank God he had faith and trust in me. So the suggestion of sexual promiscuity did not harm our marriage in any way. Within a week, we were informed that my husband tested negative as did my children who have all been vaccinated since this ordeal began. Incidentally, none of them have had any adverse reaction to the vaccination. Shortly after my diagnosis of hepatitis B, an employee of the Cincinnati public schools where I formerly worked informed me that it was the belief that a student I had worked with had hepatitis B. This employee and the child's nurse had gotten themselves vaccinated. I was furious because no one had bothered to tell me about the vaccine, and I had worked very closely with this child as an interpreter. I had even gone to gym class, a place where children are frequently hurt, with this student. However, I have since been informed that this child did not have hepatitis and had only been vaccinated for protection since this student was in a high-risk group, being that he had multiple disabilities. This story caused a great deal of pain to the student's family, and I deeply regret if they were hurt in any way by my checking out this rumor. I was eventually told by the representative of the Cincinnati school occupational safety department that I probably contacted hepatitis from a dentist since this is thought to be one of the easiest places that we can pick up the virus. I never pursued this possibility any further because my doctor told me in June 1995, at that same time that I was diagnosed, that I already had cirrhosis of the liver which meant that I probably had had the virus for years. I tried for years to find out how I got this virus. Had it been from my mother who died of liver cancer as a result of breast cancer? Did I get it from grade school or dental work surgeries? Did I get it from one of the hospitals or clinics where I happened to be an interpreter? Did I get it from a child who ran into me on the playground or from the little girl who was upset and bit me while I was working at the Cincinnati public schools? Recently, the immigration policies have brought an increasing number of foreign students into our school systems, and the incidents of hepatitis are much higher in other countries. Is that how I got this disease? I am part of the 40 percent of hepatitis B patients who will never, repeat, never know how we got this chronic, possibly terminal, disease. I would wish to see no one else go through this. While the possibility of a liver transplant looms in the future, at present I suffer from what is called portal hypertension, which is related to cirrhosis, and chronic fatigue. Portal hypertension means that I wake up every once in a while feeling nauseous and throw up great amounts of blood and end up in the ICU. It's through repeating bandings of 3 to 6 month intervals that they are controlled. That's where they put a tube down my throat and try to tie off these little bulges before they rupture. I am constantly nauseous, constantly fatigued. Sometimes I get confused about what I'm going to say, and I have not been able to fully enjoy my grandchildren. The only thing that I can be sure of, is I did not get hepatitis B from sexual contact, drug use, or tattoos. However, I have now arrived at a place in my life--I accept the fact that I will never know the path of my transmission. I no longer search for that answer. Now I focus on how the virus can be stopped from spreading. Hopefully, someday our schools will be as worried about hepatitis as they are with other vaccines. I was required to be tested for several things before becoming employed by the school, but no one ever asked me to be tested for hepatitis. Now, ask yourself how easy it would be for your children to contract the disease while playing basketball, soccer, baseball, or track. What about the fights in the school lunch lines? Or what about the little girls and boys who trade pierced earrings back and forth perhaps unknowingly infected with hepatitis B since it is a silent disease that we don't know about for years. I don't mean to frighten anyone here with the ease of contacting hepatitis, but statistics show that it's easier spread than AIDS, as others will no doubt testify to. In closing, I make one personal point. I know by being here today I have added another brick to my wall of isolation because of the fear some people have of contracting my disease. I also know that many people will not believe that I have only had one intimate partner in my life for 29 years, but my husband does. And you know, that's really all that matters to us. Oh, yes, there is one more thing. The best thing my doctor did tell me is I needed to get my kids and my grandchildren vaccinated, and I did. So you cannot even imagine the joy when several weeks ago, I received in the mail my son's blood donor card. Actually, he received it. I took it. And he is now an eligible blood donor. Why am I happy? This means that I have successfully prevented my son from contracting this terrible disease and he is safe. So all I'm asking of this committee is to consider and help me to protect other children the same way I am trying to protect my own, through vaccination. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony and I will recognize Karen with PKIDS. Ms. Karen. Chairman Mica and members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. I am here today to talk about my family. I won't add to the list of statistics related to the immunization issues. I would like to personalize them to bring them to a level that you can relate to from the heart, rather than from a business, political, or clinical standpoint. My husband and I have three young children. Unfortunately, I can't bring them with me, but these are the three children. One of us became infected with hepatitis B and is now a carrier. One of our twins is the face of this virus. Although he has no apparent symptoms yet, his liver is dying. This is an invisible process until the end. Biopsies at ages 3 and 4 confirmed that he already had cirrhosis, and as you have heard from other people on the panel that's quite unusual. It usually takes decades, but at age 3 he already had cirrhosis, which is permanent scarring of the liver. He did not respond to a 7-month course of Interferon, which is a form of chemotherapy, and no other treatment has been available for him. He has had cirrhosis long enough now that he must be monitored frequently for liver failure and cancer. There is a four letter F word which we try to shield our children from, and it's something they shouldn't know anything about at such a young age, and that word is fear: fear of social repercussions, fear of financial ruin, fear of sickness, death, and loss. You may have noticed that I have not provided our family name, and that's because I can't. The first thing hepatitis B families learn, usually after rejection by friends and family, is to go to extreme lengths to protect their children's privacy. We cannot risk exposing our children's plight on news programs such as 20/20 to help inform others of the dangers of this disease. We desperately want to reach out for comfort when we learn our child has an incurable illness, but we can't. Local hospitals offer support groups for parents of children with diseases such as cancer, but not hepatitis. We, therefore, formed a nonprofit group, PKIDS, or Parents of Kids with Infectious Diseases. PKIDS is determined not only to help families with infected children but also to educate the public about viruses including hepatitis. My work with PKIDS enables me to accomplish my personal goal of ensuring that other families are prepared to deal with the complicated issues related to living with an infectious disease. Parents feel an overwhelming need to warn day care workers, teachers, Sunday school teachers, playmates and their parents of the extra care that needs to be taken if our child scrapes his knee, bites or is bitten, or has a bloody nose. We want to tell everyone to get shots, yet we agonize over the negative consequences of telling. Will our child be treated fairly? Will he be ostracized on the playground? Will our kids be singled out as the kids at school that everyone needs to avoid? Will information given to the school nurse in confidence wind up as the topic of conversation at a PTA meeting? There are discrimination and disability laws that guarantee my child a public education, but there are no laws to protect his heart. My husband and I attended a school parent meeting and during casual conversation, a mom mentioned that she had visited the school superintendent because she had heard there was a child in the district with hepatitis B. She wanted the superintendent to identify that child so that she could isolate her child from him. My husband and I sat there paralyzed in silence waiting for everyone to look at us. And all I could think of was if you wanted to protect your child, get the shots; have him get the shots. We supervise our child's play. We watch his soccer games. We coach his soccer games. We are there as much as possible in order to protect other people's children. But it's obviously impossible to continue this vigilance as the children grow older. When a neighbor tried to put a bandage on our child's bleeding cut, I pushed her away; and she thinks I am overprotective. But what she doesn't realize is that I was protecting her. No one else should have to live with this virus because it's preventable. We worry about our ability to provide the best medical care for our child. His Interferon treatment cost well over $20,000 and only a portion was covered by insurance. We are self- employed and we watched our health insurance premiums triple over a 3-year period. Those premiums now exceed our mortgage payment. We wonder if we will ever be able to afford college or retirement for our children. If no cure or control is found for hepatitis B in the very near future, our son will most likely need a transplant, a liver transplant. We have been warned that transplant and post-transplant care could ruin us financially. At worst, it's only a temporary solution for him, as the virus could eventually take the new liver as well. I call this virus IT, capital I, capital T. Those of you familiar with Stephen King's Master will understand why. IT invades our lives, our thoughts, our spiritual beliefs no matter what defenses we erect. I watch my happy children playing, and IT reminds me that we will soon have to tell my son that he has a serious illness. Whenever he doesn't feel well, I wonder if this is IT. How long will IT allow him to play the sports he loves? How will IT affect his school performance? Hepatitis statistics make it very difficult for us to be optimistic. You can all look at your children and fantasize about their senior proms, their weddings, and their careers, but I cannot. My son is a leader, he is clever, he is creative, he is charming, and he is very protective of his brothers and they look up to him. I fear the effect IT will have on his brothers, and I worry about how they will deal with this illness or worse. I fear that I will watch my child die, the worst possible thing that can happen to a parent. No other family should ever have to experience this pain because three shots can prevent IT. Hepatitis B is transmitted primarily through blood and sexual contact with infected persons. My child can infect yours by sharing tooth brushes at camp. He is losing his baby teeth and when children lose their teeth their gums bleed. And kids share things. A toothbrush is one of the things they share. He can infect your children through biting or leaving blood residues on a hard surface. He has frequent nosebleeds as a result of the virus. It affects his clotting factor, and the virus lives on hard surfaces such as tables for up to a week. He doesn't even have to be there and another person can become infected or through sports as mentioned by other people. There are infected kids out there with no symptoms. They are not reported, no one knows they have it. They have not been diagnosed yet. Infected children and young adults will be socializing with and dating your children. It is clear to me that those who oppose immunizing our children are well informed about things such as vaccine composition and side effects. However, I beg you to educate yourselves about the hepatitis virus and disease progression as well because only then will you be able to make a truly informed decision regarding immunizations and help us to protect our children. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared statement we will recognize our last witness in this panel, Betty Fluck. You are recognized. Welcome. Ms. Fluck. I would like to thank you for allowing me to come before you today to share my experience with you. Never did I dream that I would have this opportunity. I am a diagnosed victim of the hepatitis B vaccine. My husband and I are not antivaccine. Each of our three boys has been vaccinated per health department guidelines. However, they will not have the hepatitis B vaccine. On December 2, 1997, I took my second hepatitis B vaccine in the series of three. I was required to have the immunization for my job. I am a registered nurse and have been for 20 years. I had just started a new job as a public health nurse for the local health department in Kokomo, IN. Part of my job description was to give immunizations in the department's weekly clinic. Roughly 12 hours after receiving my vaccine, I woke up in severe pain. I developed a 104 degree fever, nausea, vomiting, respiratory problems, a rash, severe head, neck and back pain, swollen joints, and I was unable to move my legs. When the fever broke several hours later, I regained a small percentage of my leg strength, but the severe damage had already been done. I had to use a cane to move around. I had absolutely no energy, and I had constant joint and leg pain. I was sleeping approximately 22 hours per day. I continued to run intermittent low-grade fevers. The first doctor that I went to said that I had a reaction to the hepatitis B vaccine but was unable to help. I went from doctor to doctor looking for help. I ended up at Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis. I first saw a doctor who was very kind and told me that he had read about some of the problems with the vaccine. He promised to do some research into the vaccine's adverse reactions. He asked me to see one of his colleagues at IU Med Center, a rheumatologist. This rheumatologist from IU was simply hostile to the idea that the hepatitis B vaccine could have caused my problems. He suggested that some of my problems could be caused by or attributed to a kidney stone. Please be aware that at this point, my fingers were so painful that I could not open a soda can. I returned to the first doctor at IU Med Center 1 month later for a scheduled followup. This doctor, who had been encouraging and sympathetic 1 month ago, now refused to use the word vaccine and attributed some of my problems to the aging process. Unhappy with both of these doctors, I requested a meeting with a patient advocate and the IU doctors. At this meeting the first doctor finally told me that I had a ``political problem, not a medical one.'' My condition continued to deteriorate from cane to walker to knee braces. Finally, in September 1998, I was put in full leg braces that run from my toes to my hips. With the use of the braces and forearm crutches, I have some mobility. Eight months after the initial injury, I was able to find an out of State doctor who was treating people for vaccine damage. I must now see him every 3 months. The vaccine has caused nerve damage to my legs and hands. The medical name for my problem is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [IDP]. I also have multiple types of autoimmune disorders, and I now have an elevated rheumatoid arthritis factor. I undergo weekly IV treatments that cost several thousand dollars per week. Although I have more energy now, there is no real prognosis for my condition. Immediately after I was injured, I contacted the pharmaceutical company asking them for help. They told me that they had never heard of this problem before. I realized at that point that I was not that unique and decided to write to the FDA through the Freedom of Information Act. I requested any reports on file about adverse reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine for one particular company from 1991 to present. Four months later, I received a box containing a 1,045-page report. On each page, there were summaries of approximately eight reactions. These 8,000-plus reactions ranged from mild to death. I made an appearance on ABC's 20/20 in January 1999, on their story about the hepatitis B vaccine. Since that show was aired, I have received numerous calls from adult victims and parents of children who had been injured after taking the hepatitis B vaccine. One common theme among the victims is that their doctors told them it couldn't be the vaccine because it was perfectly safe. I recently testified before the State senate committee in Indiana with the intent of removing the mandate for the hepatitis B vaccine for school entry. The proposed amendment was designed to give parents the choice to waive the vaccine for any reason. On March 2, 1999, it passed the State senate by a vote of 45 to 4. However, the House sponsor of the original bill killed it rather than bring the bill up for debate. In Indiana, a doctor from the department of health told the Senate committee that one of the arguments for the vaccine was that it was the ``first anti-cancer vaccine.'' Fortunately, we were able to show that the ``anti-cancer vaccine'' theme was taken from the PATH website. PATH is an organization within the World Health Organization. PATH suggested that the ``first anti-cancer vaccine'' theme was a good marketing tool to bring about interest in a ``boutique'' vaccine. I have minutes from the CDC study group meeting on the hepatitis B vaccine held in March 1997. The minutes of the meeting show that it would take at least a 60-day study to show the onset of MS. Clinical studies done by the two manufacturers were 4 and 5 days in length respectively. It should be noted that the afternoon session of this meeting was chaired by Dr. Robert Sharrar of Merck. This group was to decide how to identify various types of adverse reactions, such as MS, and demyelinating disease and to plan meaningful studies. When Dr. Sharrar appeared on ABC's 20/20 in January, he said that he honestly believed that hepatitis B vaccine had not caused any problems. Can an employee of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures the vaccine be objective in designing experiments to show fault in a product that generates close to $1 billion in sales for his company? The form that people are given about the vaccine was written by the CDC. It does not address serious adverse reactions. When you look at the vaccine insert provided by the manufacturer, several adverse reactions are noted. I have since talked to many healthcare professionals who are also unaware of the potential adverse reactions listed on the vaccine insert. It makes me wonder why the pharmaceutical company representative that I talked with earlier, the one who was unaware of any adverse reactions, was unaware of what their own company's insert said. A vaccine that still has so many unanswered questions should not be mandated for children. It just does not make sense. The right to decide if it's in the best interests of the child should be made by the parents. After all, it appears that for the most part, when a child is severely handicapped by this vaccine, the parents are on their own. No one pushing the mandate is there for help or comfort. In an article on the hepatitis B vaccine that was printed in the Washington Post, a spokesperson for the CDC said that nothing unexpected had been observed in the way of adverse reactions. At first, I thought they meant that their position was that no adverse reactions had occurred. Now, I really don't think it was denial. Despite over 20,000 reports to VAERS for the two manufacturers, nothing unexpected had occurred. I really believe that the number and type of injuries is no surprise for the CDC. Maybe the only surprise to the CDC is just how hard the victims are fighting back. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared would like to thank all of our witnesses for their testimony this morning. I have a couple of questions, the first for Mr. Belkin. I believe you testified that you did not have any notice as to possible adverse reactions before the immunization? Mr. Belkin. Yes. We received no warning. Our pediatrician seemed to think this was like giving an Advil or Tylenol or something. No warning, no ``watch out, this is dangerous, this could cause convulsions.'' Nothing whatsoever in any way, shape, or form. Mr. Mica. Of course you have experienced a tremendous personal tragedy. Based on what you know now, do you think there should be some warning or some signoff by parents, such as informed consent? Mr. Belkin. Yes, absolutely. And I think the doctors should be held responsible. The bureaucracy should be held responsible. Right now, I have taken about 40 other reports from other parents where the same kind of thing has happened-- where they found about 10 other SIDS cases, and numerous other nurses that have the same kind of things as Betty. In every single case the doctors have denied responsibility. No, it's not the vaccine. It's happened over and over. Convulsion, oh, it is not the vaccine. Second time around, convulsions. No responsibility. As well as disclosure and choice, the doctors should be held responsible for reporting adverse reactions so when a dangerous medicine is out there, it doesn't keep happening. That's my only goal in doing this. Mr. Mica. Now, I know that they eliminated some factors for the cause of the death of your child. Was there a specific scientific or pathological forensic study that linked your child's death to this vaccination? Mr. Belkin. No, not yet. I intend to pursue that. I have not done that yet. I am going to take the autopsy results. I'm trying to find someone who knows and will not deny it. What I found is that the New York City medical examiner and every doctor, they call up Merck and Merck says, ``you are the first person that has ever called us, this has never happened before.'' So then they say, ``well, how can I say this child died from the vaccine?'' and it turns out there are 400- something other deaths in VAERS. So what is happening is, from the top down they are denying that this is happening. And the people at the bottom, the pediatricians, the people that are doing the autopsy say ``well, they say it's safe; it couldn't be the vaccine.'' There has to be some disclosure from the top down to the bottom. There is a huge body of evidence of brain swelling in causing encephalitis, which is basically the result which they are denying. So I still have to go forward with this to actually go to another neuropathologist, which I intend to do. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Ms. Converse, your child had reactions and you stated to the doctor, the physician, that your child was having reactions. Were you warned in advance that the child might have adverse reactions? Ms. Converse. No. Mr. Mica. Then, after you said that there were problems, you said that the doctor ignored those and went ahead with the vaccinations? Ms. Converse. Right. Because I knew that the pediatricians would be unsupportive if I mentioned that I suspected the vaccine, I never told them that. Mr. Mica. You did not tell them. Ms. Converse. I simply explained his symptoms. Mr. Mica. Each time your child was vaccinated, there were adverse reactions? Ms. Converse. Yes. But the most profound was with the hepatitis B. Mr. Mica. Do you have professional or scientific evidence that the vaccine has been the cause of your child's condition? Ms. Converse. The evidence that I am using is that he fits all of the criteria that the Federal Government describes. We do not have a blood test which I have just learned that we can get to--Myelin Basic Protein. I just learned of that. Mr. Mica. Have you taken advantage of or applied for compensation under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program? Ms. Converse. No, not yet because of the discouraging comments that my pediatrician gave me in terms of basically coming out and saying that we have had a reaction. But my position on that is changing. I think the other reason why we haven't is we have been very overwhelmed in caring for our son. Mr. Mica. In the reporting system that we have, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, do you know if your child has been included in that--either through doctors or your report? Ms. Converse. He has not. Mr. Mica. What about your child, Mr. Belkin? Mr. Belkin. Yes. Mr. Mica. Ms. Kirschner, were you warned in advance that your child might have an adverse reaction? How old was she when she had her shots? Ms. Kirschner. Lindsay was 14. I had no warning at all. In fact, on the appointment that she was vaccinated, the doctor didn't even see us. There was no consent form. Nothing. Even the day after we went back to him when she had flu-like symptoms, he told me she had the flu. I did not even make the connection that it was tied into the vaccine. When I called him every day because she was just getting worse and worse, he didn't know. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Ms. Hahn, you contracted hepatitis B and you said that you didn't know how you contracted it. You have heard some of the stories today about individuals who had their child vaccinated under the mandatory program. After your condition was discovered, you had your family vaccinated. Was that the case? Ms. Hahn. Yes, it was. Mr. Mica. So they hadn't been vaccinated before. You didn't experience adverse reaction in your family. First of all, what do you think about the additional requirement for informed consent before these vaccines are given, particularly for the parent since of course, the child can't give intelligent consent to vaccination? And do you think we should have some other limits on vaccination? Ms. Hahn. I can't speak for their situation. In mine, I had my doctors, who are with Group Health Associates of Cincinnati, and I have always been informed of every vaccination my children have received. We have had the same doctor all of their lives. My oldest is 27 and my youngest is 21. I have always been informed of the risk. My husband was even informed of the risk. Mr. Mica. How old were your children when they were vaccinated? Ms. Hahn. My youngest son was 16. Mr. Mica. But if they had been vaccinated--one of the questions we will get into a little bit later is how long this vaccine is effective for. So they might have to be vaccinated again if they were 16 and had it done at birth? Ms. Hahn. No one has ever informed me of that. I read a little bit on the Internet of some people suggesting it, so I can't answer. My doctors haven't seen any need. I believe before you would do that, from what I understand when I ask my doctor about that, is that you would do a simple blood test first to see if they needed to be, you know---- Mr. Mica. Finally, were they given any warning that there might be an adverse reaction or were you given any warning that your husband or children might have an adverse reaction to the vaccine? Ms. Hahn. Yes. I also encouraged all of my family members, my grandchildren who are all under the age of 4, my sister, and my brother to be vaccinated. I don't know of one of my friends yet that has had a problem. Mr. Mica. I have additional questions, but I will recognize Mr. Waxman. Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much. Let me thank all of the witnesses and tell you how sorry I am to hear about the misfortunes all of you have suffered, some from the vaccine reaction, apparently from the vaccine reaction, and some from hepatitis itself. We are dealing with a difficult issue. We want to control this disease, but evidently there are, in some cases, horrible reactions to vaccines and we want to be sure that they are minimal and that everything is being done to prevent those adverse reactions. Mr. Belkin, you showed us some charts that were pretty surprising. The question, of course, is one of causation, whether those lists of reactions were, in fact, caused by the vaccine itself. Have you conducted controlled research such as might be peer reviewed and published? Mr. Belkin. No, and I think that's exactly what should be done. You cannot go through--I encourage you to go through the VAERS reports and look at them yourself. I spoke at the New York City Rotary Club. I was invited to speak on this subject. A gentleman came up and refuted me and he said he had been sent by Merck. He was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is a major thing when Merck sends the chairman of the local district of the American Academy of Pediatrics. I asked him what he thought about VAERS, and he said that it's garbage. I said, what would you do to improve it? He said, there is no money for that. So what is happening is it is just going nowhere. Mr. Waxman. Let me interrupt you, because we have to have research done. Any manufacturer of any kind of pharmaceutical product has got to continually check, in my view, about adverse reaction reports. One of the concerns I have had is that the FDA is under such pressure to approve drugs, they get them approved, and we want to know before they are sending them out to be used widely that they check for all of the adverse reactions. And if they are out there and they learned about adverse reactions, they respond to it. We are going to hear from somebody from the FDA in a minute. I'm making that as a general statement. But the charts that you held up have not been peer reviewed themselves. They are the list of statistics of people who have had adverse reactions; is that right? Mr. Belkin. That's correct. Mr. Waxman. You haven't had anything peer reviewed or published in any scientific---- Mr. Belkin. No, I haven't. That needs to be done. Mr. Waxman. Do you have a dispute with the national statistics that show that a third of all hepatitis B cases occur in people who are not in high-risk groups? Mr. Belkin. Those studies are very interesting. Are they done on the basis of epidemiological study or are they done by questionnaires? That's the question. I think that the science really has not been done. I am not an expert on the subject, but from what I have heard, those little pie charts showing so many intravenous drug users, that's the result of questionnaires. I'm not absolutely certain about that. I think this whole area needs to be looked at by independent scientists without ties to drug companies or the government. Mr. Waxman. If you have people who are identified as high risk because of certain activities that they engage in, that's pretty clear. If you have people who never engage in those kinds of activities and whom you wouldn't consider high risk contract hepatitis B, we have to wonder why. The report that I am referring to indicates a third of all of the hepatitis B cases occur in people who are not considered high risk. I am sure it is based on some questionnaire, because how would you know whether somebody is in a high risk group or not? But that doesn't invalidate the conclusion. The reason that I raise this is that it has got to be of concern to all of us that hepatitis B is a pretty awful disease. It's not just limited to people who are high risk. If we can prevent this disease we ought to do so. The question is can we do it in a way without these costs? I have a letter from a woman in Santa Monica, which is in my district. She says, I understand your committee is hearing from individuals concerned about the dangers of immunization against hepatitis B. As a school nurse, I would like to urge you to keep in mind the devastating effects of this liver infection against which the vaccine protects both individuals and society in general by lowering the pool of infected people. It's true that a few people do suffer adverse reactions to various immunizations. Nevertheless, although it may seem harsh to say so, the public health benefits of preventing disease by immunization outweigh the relatively low risk of harm to the rare susceptible person. In California, the State requires hepatitis B immunization of public school students in specific grades, but allows waivers for individuals with personal beliefs or medical conditions which render them unwilling or unable to be vaccinated. The availability of such waivers should allow your vaccine critics to decline personal vaccinations without depriving other individuals in society as a whole of this life-saving protection. What do members of this panel think of that idea, allowing waivers? Ms. Converse. If I could respond to that, Mr. Waxman. I think it is very interesting to be here today because I am noticing that victims on both sides of this share a lot of problems, both the course of their illness--there is some cross-over, and there is cross-over in terms of isolation and lack of treatment. What this is telling me is, clearly we don't understand the whole picture of transmission and why there is this chunk of people who we can't identify as to how this is being transmitted. And the second thing, it is very clear that we don't understand who reacts adversely and why. My beef is that unless you profile criteria about who will react adversely and unless that is very much part of an informed consent--for instance, if you are of northern European extraction and you have a history of allergies in your family-- I am making that up. I don't know what the criteria would be-- that you should be informed that you may be adversely affected. That doesn't exist right now. Mr. Waxman. Do you think we even know that information? Ms. Converse. No, we do not know that. My point being that you cannot mandate this universally for newborns until you know who may be adversely affected because you will damage thousands of people. Mr. Waxman. We know with every immunization that we have there are going to be some rare cases where there is going to be an adverse reaction, sometimes horrible and even deadly. Ms. Converse. I think what is emerging with this one is a profile, if I might go out on a limb and say. I recently attended an autism parents support group on Cape Cod where I live, a small group, 10 parents. All of them had red hair. That is rare, and I think these are the kinds of things that might emerge that really should be looked into. That may be different from other vaccines. Mr. Waxman. I hope we can find a profile and find a reason for adverse reactions. We need to have it done, however, through scientific methods. Ms. Converse. But until that's done you cannot make it a law that a newborn get this shot because it's criminal. You have no way of knowing---- Mr. Waxman. You have no way of knowing, except we do know that the overwhelming majority of people are not adversely affected and the disease is prevented. On that basis, most people want their children to be immunized from polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and hepatitis B. Every single one of those immunizations has an adverse reaction with some individuals. If we knew why some individuals react that way, we wouldn't have them take the vaccine. But as a society, we do require people to be vaccinated. In Santa Monica, CA, according to this letter that I received, they allow people to opt out if they have this concern or fear. Ms. Converse. If I could just interject one more comment and then I will stop. Our experience--I'm assertive, educated. I have a public health background and very much accept immunization. I was persistent and tactful with our providers. I never told them I think the vaccine caused a problem because I knew that might be an inflammatory comment for them. They failed to recognize not just that it was a reaction, but that my son was even ill. So this experience tells me that there will be many, many children who don't get reported. So when you say there are a few that have a problem, I think it's the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Waxman. Did you ask your doctor about the possible risk of the hepatitis B vaccine or about any of the childhood vaccines that you put your child through? Ms. Converse. Yes, but we weren't aware that he was going to be given that shot at birth. It was not discussed at all. Mr. Waxman. So you were aware that there is a possible risk? Ms. Converse. I was aware through my public health training. Mr. Waxman. But you didn't talk to your doctor about it specifically? Ms. Converse. I wouldn't agree with that. Through my public health training, I was aware of other vaccines and the risks associated with them. Mr. Waxman. My question is, did you talk about it with your doctor? Ms. Converse. Yes, absolutely. Mr. Waxman. Why were you, as a public health person, afraid to tell your doctor that you thought your child was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine? Ms. Converse. Because my training taught me that these are very rare and there are a few sacrificial lambs for the good of the whole and that's just the way it goes. I wanted to encourage---- Mr. Waxman. I thank you very much for your---- Ms. Converse. I wanted to encourage my provider to help us, and I did not want to discourage them by antagonizing them. Mr. Waxman. I appreciate what you had to say, and I am sorry for all of the terrible things that you have gone through. Did you want to raise a comment? I think my time is up, but why don't you go ahead. Ms. Hahn. Chairman Mica and Congressman Waxman, the subject of the questionnaire about hepatitis--and it only asked questions. I have had the same health maintenance provider for over 20 years. He and they are very aware of my medical conditions. I was told that I would have preventive care and they would know anything before it happened. When I first became a little ill, or rather I was very ill--I lost 44 pounds--it was looked at first as just chronic diarrhea and stuff. Within a matter of a couple of weeks, hospitals. Then they were even telling me possibly cancer. They were going to remove my spleen for blockage. All of that got narrowed down after they did some tests. Then the very last thing they looked at and they said, Chaplain Hahn, you have a sexually transmitted disease. I believe that was more for the safety of my husband. They wanted to make sure that this didn't go any further. So even the best of prevention, best of care, best of trying to take care, you don't know. I worked with your children. I didn't know I had it for probably 20 years. The only way that I can prevent your children from getting it and trying to be the best at my universal precautions is for you to have your children vaccinated. Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mica. Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. I don't want to prolong this for any of you. I am really very sympathetic to all that you said, and I understand how difficult this must be for you. Particularly Lindsay, I want to say that your courage here today has been noted by everyone. Rather than going to a more extensive question, because I think that you have all been excellent in your testimony and very informed, I only want to pursue one area. I think, Ms. Converse, you made the statement, if I am correct, that you thought the effects of the vaccine wear off within a certain period of time. Ms. Converse. That's my understanding. Mr. Tierney. Could you expand on that a little bit and tell me where you get that information and that conclusion. Ms. Converse. I get that information from a Massachusetts Department of Public Health flyer on hepatitis B for parents, which says that your child will need a booster by the time they reach--I think it's either age 11 or 14. Mr. Tierney. I was thinking that you had excluded the booster part of it, including that the booster was going to wear off. Ms. Converse. Correct. Ms. Fluck. Can I say something, please? Mr. Tierney. Absolutely. Ms. Fluck. In regards to that question, my husband and I have done a lot of research since I have been stricken with this. We noted that in India where there is a very high rate of hepatitis B, that one of the hospitals there recommend boostering every 4 years for hepatitis B. That's a recommendation from a hospital in India where hepatitis B is very rampant. But what I'm saying is, they don't say how long these immunities will last for. But some places where they do have a very high risk, they boost every 4 years. Mr. Tierney. Are you saying that the entire Nation has a policy of boosting every 4 years or that single hospital? Ms. Fluck. In India, they do but that's their policy. Mr. Belkin. The Merck package insert says that the time is indeterminate. That's the way they define it on the package insert. Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Tierney. One last question, Ms. Fluck. Your particular affliction has been medically diagnosed and connected to the vaccination? Ms. Fluck. Yes, it has. Mr. Mica. Have you filed a claim in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program? Ms. Fluck. No, not as of yet. Again, part of the reason is, I guess, one of the things that happened, my husband made some calls to the CDC and he talked to Dr. Chen. Dr. Chen recommended that he talk to Dr. Evans. Dr. Evans called our house, and we had no idea who this gentleman was. So my husband really didn't want to give him too much information. We found out eventually that he is among the people who decide who gets what, and if they get anything from the claims. He seemed very proud of the fact that they hadn't paid out anything to any of the victims of hepatitis B unless they had anaphylactic shock. Over the phone, without any kind of information about me whatsoever, except for the fact that I can't walk, he told my husband, your wife did not have an adverse reaction to hepatitis B. That's what we are dealing with. I also told you in my testimony how I was told my problem is a political problem, not a medical problem. I have gone from doctor to doctor. It's like they are afraid to say anything. Mr. Mica. Well, I would like to thank you and all of our panelists for your testimony today, for coming forward and providing our panel with your personal experience and recommendations as we move forward in our oversight capacity. So I thank each of you, and I will excuse you at this time. Our second panel today---- Mr. Waxman. Mr. Chairman, just a word to Ms. Fluck. We are checking about the assertion about the vaccine compensation system. Don't be so trusting of a comment that you have heard. There is more data for the anaphylactic shock than any of the other adverse reactions, but the compensation system does look at other reactions. So I would urge you to pursue it if you feel there is a connection---- Ms. Fluck. I am diagnosed. I have all the medical testing and immunological testing. But what I'm saying is, this doctor seemed awfully proud to say that they have never paid out anything to anybody unless they have had anaphylactic shock. Mr. Waxman. You seem awfully willing to take what he has to say at face value, and you don't seem to be willing to take what others say at face value; and I think that you have had enough reason to be more independent-minded. I'm urging you to go ahead and pursue this vaccine compensation. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Again, I appreciate your providing us with your personal experience--each and every one of you--and we will excuse you at this time. I will now call our second panel, which consists of primarily government officials. Harold Margolis, who is the Chief of the Hepatitis Branch of the Centers for Disease Control. We also have Susan Ellenberg, Director of Biostatistics in Epidemiology Division of the Food and Drug Administration. If we could have them come forward. I would like to call the meeting back to order here. Those who are leaving, please do so and others cease conversation so we could proceed. Dr. Margolis, you have someone with you. Is that individual going to testify? Dr. Margolis. No, he is not. I will introduce him. Dr. John Livengood from the National Immunization Program. Mr. Mica. Thank you for identifying him. And as I mentioned to our other witnesses, this is an investigation and oversight panel under Government Reform. We do swear in our witnesses, so those two who are going to testify please, if you are going to answer questions, I will swear you in. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Mica. And we have another witness or somebody who may be answering questions. Could you identify yourself? Dr. Ellenberg, could you identify the individual? Dr. Ellenberg. This is Dr. Marcel Salive who is Chief of the Epidemiology Branch in the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Again, welcome each of you. If you have lengthy statements, we would like to make them part of the record. We do have a number of panelists today. If you have additional, information we will by unanimous consent make it part of the record within reason. So I would like to first recognize Susan Ellenberg, Director of Biostatistics and Epidemiology Division of the Food and Drug Administration. You are recognized and welcome. STATEMENTS OF HAROLD MARGOLIS, CHIEF OF THE HEPATITIS BRANCH, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL; JOHN LIVENGOOD, NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM; AND SUSAN ELLENBERG, DIRECTOR OF BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY DIVISION, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION Dr. Ellenberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. I appreciate the opportunity this morning to discuss the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS], with you. My written testimony is more detailed, and I'm pleased that you are willing to include it. Mr. Mica. Without objection that will be made part of the record. Dr. Ellenberg. Before I begin, I would like to say that as a parent I certainly have the greatest sympathy for those who have testified today in the previous panel. The job of the public health service is to investigate and hopefully prevent all of these kinds of problems. That's what we are dedicated to do. Vaccines are among the most significant public health achievements of all time and have been responsible for saving millions of lives and preserving health worldwide. They are extremely safe. Nevertheless, like all medical treatments, vaccines are not entirely risk free. Vaccines are unique in that they are administered to healthy individuals, often children, and in some instances are required by State law. While serious complications are extremely rare, they can occur. Because of the virtually universal exposure of our population to vaccines, it is important to identify even those very rare adverse reactions. VAERS was initiated in 1990 as a joint program of the FDA and the CDC. It receives reports from vaccine manufacturers, health professionals, State and local public health clinics, and vaccinees themselves or their parents or guardians. To encourage reporting of any possibly vaccine-induced adverse event, the criteria for reporting to VAERS are deliberately nonrestrictive. The system accepts and includes any report submitted, even when there is no obvious connection to vaccination other than timing. Such reporting systems are essential to the discovery of potential rare adverse consequences of medical product that may not become evident until millions of people have been exposed to them. There are important limitations, however, as I will discuss later, but first a brief overview. VAERS receives 11,000 to 12,000 reports a year. About 15 percent of these reports describe a serious event. Most of the remaining 85 percent of the reports describe self-limited transient events such as injectionsite reactions, irritability, prolonged crying, and fever. Currently, all reports of serious events and fatalities are followed up in detail by health professionals. Medical staff carefully monitor trends in adverse event reporting for vaccines. VAERS performs a critical function by generating signals of potential problems that may warrant further investigation. This is especially valuable in assessing the safety of newly marketed vaccines. As an example, a review of reports of adverse events in infants following the hepatitis B vaccine was performed by FDA staff several years ago. This comprehensive review concluded that no new concerns had emerged in the first few years following the recommendation for universal infant immunization. It's important to recognize that VAERS data alone are often inadequate for drawing firm conclusions or providing any basis for regulatory actions. Probably the most important reason is that it is unable to establish causality for most reports of serious adverse events, the issue that Mr. Waxman had alluded to. Most of the types of serious problems reported to VAERS occur in unvaccinated, as well as in vaccinated, individuals. With 4 million babies born each year in the United States and virtually all being vaccinated beginning at birth or shortly thereafter, almost any adverse experience in a child will follow a vaccination, and some of these will by chance follow within a few days of the vaccination. Thus, even if a vaccine was not the cause of certain rare medical problems, it is a certainty that some number of these problems will occur within a short interval following a vaccination. For this reason, the fact that an event, even a very serious event such as a death, happens to occur shortly after a vaccine has been administered cannot by itself lead to the conclusion that the event was caused by the vaccine. When the review of VAERS data identifies a signal of a potential new vaccine associated event, this association, therefore, must be further investigated in more rigorously controlled studies before causal conclusions can be drawn. VAERS data have contributed to our understanding of vaccine safety and vaccine risks. Several investigations of VAERS data have uncovered previously unrecognized problems that may occur rarely in vaccine recipients and examples of these are provided in the written testimony. Sometimes VAERS findings which we routinely publish in medical journals may provide useful and reassuring information that new problems have not been identified after additional exposure with a vaccine, as previously noted. I want to thank the committee and the chairman for this opportunity to discuss the VAERS system and will be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement you. We will defer questions until after we have heard from Dr. Harold Margolis, Chief of the Hepatitis Branch of the Centers for Disease Control. You are recognized, sir. Dr. Margolis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and our written testimony is submitted for the record. Mr. Mica. Without objection, that entire statement will be made part of the record. Dr. Margolis. I am here with Dr. John Livengood of the CDC's national immunization program. We are here to discuss the importance of the hepatitis B vaccination and the prevention of hepatitis B-related liver disease and cancer and the safety of the vaccine. I am both a parent and a pediatrician. Nothing matters more to me than the health and safety of my children and the children of others. Based on my 20 years of work in the field, I have concluded, first, that hepatitis B is a serious risk to infants, children, and adults; second, we have a safe and effective vaccine for addressing that risk; and, third, it is our responsibility to protect the health of our children and future generations by using this vaccine. Persons who become infected with hepatitis B either recover in several months or go on to have chronic infection. In the United States, one and a quarter million persons are chronically infected with hepatitis B and are at high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis B is a silent killer destroying the liver in someone who thinks they are completely well. When first infected, two-thirds of adults and more than 90 percent of young children do not have symptoms of hepatitis. Studies have shown that each year 20,000 to 25,000 children have been infected with hepatitis B in the United States. These children acquire their infections in their households as well as in their community. The importance of these childhood infections is illustrated in figure 1. If infected, 90 percent of infants and 30 to 60 percent of children less than 5 years of age, will remain chronically infected. Thus a large proportion of adults with chronic hepatitis B became infected as infants or young children. If we do not prevent childhood infections, we cannot control hepatitis B in the United States. Hepatitis B immunization prevents greater than 90 percent of infections. Studies have shown that routine vaccination of infants and children eliminates transmission of chronic infection and reduces liver cancer. They have also shown that vaccinated persons retain long-term immunity. The CDC vaccine recommendations are made with the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or the ACIP. Hepatitis B immunization issues have been discussed at ACIP meetings on 20 occasions since 1986. In 1991, a comprehensive immunization strategy to stop transmission of hepatitis B infection in the United States was adopted by the ACIP and recommends, one, prevention of perinatal hepatitis B infection; two, routine hepatitis B vaccination of infants and adolescents; and, three, vaccination of high-risk adolescents and adults. The decision to vaccinate a child protects that child and the community. Because hepatitis B produces a chronic infection, a decision not to vaccinate a child not only puts that child at risk of infection, but puts others in the community at risk as well. The CDC is strongly committed to ensuring the safety of vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccines are among the safest we have. Since licensure, the safety of the vaccine has continued to be monitored. Several reviews have been done and have not shown a causal association between hepatitis B vaccination and a variety of severe, neurologic adverse events. In addition, ongoing studies are investigating whether other alleged adverse events are associated with vaccination, including multiple sclerosis. As the FDA has discussed, case reports of serious adverse events following vaccination rarely provide a convincing link between the event and vaccination. Sudden infant death syndrome is such an example. Because almost 10 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine are administered to infants each year, some infants unfortunately will die shortly after vaccination by coincidence alone. Available scientific data do not support any causal role for vaccination in SIDS. As shown in figure 2, 1992 was the first full year that the hepatitis B vaccine was recommended for routine infant immunization. Vaccine coverage was 8 percent, and there were 4,800 SIDS death that year. In contrast, by 1996, when hepatitis B vaccination coverage had risen to 82 percent, there were only 3,000 SIDS deaths. These data are reassuring because if the hepatitis B vaccine was a major cause of SIDS, we would have expected an increase in cases, not a decrease. In summary, hepatitis B causes 4,000 to 5,000 deaths a year in the United States. If exposed to the virus, infants and young children are most at risk of chronic infection and death as adults 20 to 40 years later. Fortunately, we have a safe and highly effective vaccine to prevent the transmission of this deadly virus and to prevent liver cancer. Immunization of infants, children and adults is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Hepatitis Foundation International, and the American Liver Foundation, among others. Only by achieving high vaccination rates can we optimally protect Americans from this serious disease. Thank you for your attention. Dr. Livingood and I will be happy to answer questions. [The prepared statement of you both for your testimony. I have several questions. First of all, Dr. Margolis, you mentioned in your presentation that studies have shown that at least 25,000 children are infected with the hepatitis B virus each year. Is this an estimate or are these reported cases? Dr. Margolis. As I pointed out, infection in young children is rarely symptomatic. We have looked, using blood tests, at a very large sample of the United States, and this is an estimate from that large study called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and those estimates come from those surveys done actually on two occasions 10 years apart. Mr. Mica. So this is an estimate. If it is an estimate, what age group are you talking about in children? Dr. Margolis. The data comes from looking at children down to 5 years of age. The study didn't go below that, at least for hepatitis B, but repeated on two occasions, has again shown consistency of that estimate in terms of those numbers. Mr. Mica. Did it go below 5 years of age, 5 to what, teenage or 18? Dr. Margolis. It actually went through adults. The first study was done through 2 to 70-year-olds. The second study 10 years later---- Mr. Mica. So the figure is sort of an estimate and it doesn't deal with those under 5 and it includes adults, so it does not really deal with children? Dr. Margolis. No, it is a statistical sample of the United States. So it represents the U.S. population of children under 5 years of age. That was done in 1970--1979; and then in 1990 it also included children 6 years of age and over. So it is our best estimate with a valid scientific sample. Mr. Mica. So these are estimates. Can you tell me the number of reported cases of hepatitis B in children under the age of 1, for example, for say the last year? Dr. Margolis. Well, I can tell you reported cases. Now, one of the things, I have to go back 1 minute, from the estimate we then matched that with our reported cases, and we can put what we call a correction factor in there that takes into account that very high rate of asymptomatic infection. Mr. Mica. Reported cases under 1 in a timeframe like the last year? Dr. Margolis. Yes. In 1997 there were 95 reported cases of children under 2 years of age. Mr. Mica. Across the entire United States? Dr. Margolis. Yes. That has been since immunization began in 1991. So 1997, if we go back to 1990 before immunization began, there were 266 reported cases of children under 2 years of age. Mr. Mica. That is under 2? Dr. Margolis. That is the way that we have the data put together. Mr. Mica. And there were 87---- Dr. Margolis. Ninety-five in 1997. Mr. Mica. In 1997, there were 95 children reported? Dr. Margolis. Under 2 years of age. Mr. Mica. Under 2 years of age, and you are comparing apples and apples then? Dr. Margolis. In 1990, which was before immunization of children began, there were 266. Mr. Mica. I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement a study in New Hampshire. For example, there were 48 adverse reactions to the vaccine in children aged 1 to 10 in recent years. There were 16 times greater the number of cases of the disease--16 times more, I guess, adverse reaction than cases of the disease. There were three reported cases of the disease in children? Dr. Margolis. Correct. That is what you said in your opening statement. Mr. Mica. Well, is it possible that the preventive measure is riskier than the disease itself, given these statistics? Dr. Margolis. The first thing I would like to go back and readdress is, since an infant or a young child who becomes infected is very unlikely to be a case, to have symptoms and thus be reported, as we heard, this is a silent infection. As we heard today, many people did not know they were infected. That is the problem with early childhood infections. You can only discover the magnitude by doing these surveys with the blood test. So what I would say is, those three cases represent many infections and, in fact, the multiplier may be as high as 100. In other words, for a symptomatic case, you may see--90 percent are going to be asymptomatic and not reported. Mr. Mica. There were 3 cases of the disease and there were four times as many child deaths, 11 reported; is that correct? Are you aware of this New Hampshire study? Dr. Margolis. I am not aware of the New Hampshire data. Mr. Mica. If there were 11 reported deaths--and this brings me to the reporting system--what kind of statistics do you have in children 1 and under, or 2 if we can use 2 as a comparison-- I don't know if you would have the same timeframe--but how many died from adverse reactions? Dr. Ellenberg. Well, we cannot tell you from these data how many died from adverse reactions. What we can tell you is how many deaths occurring shortly after a vaccination were reported to our system. Mr. Mica. Can you give me that figure? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes. Mr. Mica. We have 95 reportable cases in children under 2 in 1997, is that correct, across the country? Dr. Margolis. Correct. Dr. Ellenberg. If you will give me just a minute--I have too many folders in here. Find the one with the deaths. We will give you the exact numbers in a minute, the number of deaths under a year of age, and you must remember that most of these-- -- Mr. Mica. We want to be fair. I think we are trying to compare 2 years. Dr. Margolis' statistics are 2 years. Dr. Ellenberg. The vast majority of the deaths in children are under age 1 because most of them are attributed to SIDS and that occurs only in infants, so there are very few deaths in children over the age of 1. 1997, is that the year? Mr. Mica. I think that is your year. I am just trying to get some idea. If, in the case of the New Hampshire data, you have four times as many child deaths as we have cases of the disease---- Dr. Ellenberg. Right. I can tell you the numbers, but the problems are all in the interpretation. In 1997, VAERS reported 41 deaths in children under the age of 1; two deaths in children aged 2; and two additional deaths in other children. Mr. Mica. So we are looking at about 43 deaths, and we had 95 reportable cases? Dr. Ellenberg. But it is important to recognize that these deaths have not been causally attributed to the hepatitis B vaccine. The bulk of these were reported after children received multiple immunizations with multiple vaccines. We have no way of knowing whether any of them had anything to do--this is simply an association in time that is reported. The number of deaths has been going down as consistent with the data that Dr. Margolis showed. In 1994 we had 64; this is, in age, under 1, we had 64. Then 60 in 1995, 48 in 1996, and 41 in 1997. The number of childhood deaths is going down, just as the increase in hepatitis B vaccine coverage in this age group is going up. Mr. Mica. Well, again we had the number of deaths that we think were caused by adverse reactions. Dr. Ellenberg. No, I have to take exception to that. We have no idea whether these--there is nothing in the medical record to indicate or suggest that these deaths were caused by anything in the vaccine. As Dr. Margolis said, we have 4 million babies a year vaccinated. Mr. Mica. So basically you are telling me we can't tell? Dr. Ellenberg. We can't, from what is in the medical record. The SIDS rate today is 1 in 2,000. Until the Back to Sleep campaign, the rate was about 1 in 1,000. You don't have to be a mathematician to see that with 4 million babies and the rate of 1 in 1,000 per year, you are going to have a certain number of deaths following vaccination. Mr. Mica. Well, you said that you also did a study. Was it in--sometime in the 1990's, about problems with adverse reactions, possible signals of potential problems, I think you said, and there was no new consensus as a result of that study about problems. When was that conducted? Dr. Ellenberg. We did a thorough investigation. This was several years ago, actually prior to some of these concerns being raised. We did a thorough review of all of the adverse reactions. Mr. Mica. What year was it? Dr. Ellenberg. 1996 it was published, so we were doing the study in 1995 or even earlier. And we have reviewed all of the data in VAERS from 1991 to 1994 in infants to see whether there were any patterns, any particular pattern of events that suggested that they might be associated with the vaccine--this is what we do with the VAERS data, we review them very carefully--and there was nothing. Most of the reports, as I indicated, were of transient, self-limited conditions, only about 50 percent. Mr. Mica. Is that a published study? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes, it is a published report. Mr. Mica. And peer-reviewed? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes, sir. Mr. Mica. There are 42 States that mandate this hepatitis B vaccination. Can you tell me how many children are getting this vaccination, say, at birth or how many are getting the vaccination at a later date? Because if they are not getting the vaccination, you might have lower figures. Dr. Ellenberg. I think that would be something that Dr. Margolis might better answer. Dr. Margolis. We know that approximately 85 percent of children are fully vaccinated--that is, as of this last year-- by the time they are 18 months of age. Thirty percent---- Mr. Mica. With the hepatitis B vaccine? Dr. Margolis. With the hepatitis B vaccine. And 30 percent of children begin their immunization some time within the first month of life. So ``near birth'' or ``at birth,'' the way that the question is asked. The schedule allows much flexibility to give the vaccine over the first 18 months. Mr. Mica. The vaccine hasn't been mandated by the Federal Government, but the States have instituted a requirement for entering public school or other public activities, I guess. We have 42 States, and I am trying to get a picture; was that instituted in 1991 or 1992, 1993, or has this been a transitional---- Dr. Margolis. That is correct. It has been transitional and evolving, and many States actually--now their school entry requirement is only beginning to happen in 1999, in 2000. As you see from that coverage data, that yellow line has a higher proportion of children. Remember, you are vaccinating in the first 2 years of life, and then they come into school. So the majority of these States now, by the year 2000 or 2001, will require a child to be fully vaccinated. Mr. Mica. The studies or reports indicated an increase in incidence of adverse reaction as we are having an increase in vaccination. Maybe you can answer that, Dr. Ellenberg? Dr. Ellenberg. No, I don't believe there has been any increase in the total number of adverse events. Well, I should back up because as a vaccine becomes--as the coverage increases, you will certainly have increases in the number of reports. Most of the reports in the system are actually of things that we can relate causally to vaccines, things like injectionsite reactions, running a fever, we know that vaccines can cause these problems. While we had very few reports involving hepatitis B in children in 1991 when the recommendation for universal immunization was first made, the numbers shot up in successive years because millions of children were then receiving the vaccine. But over the last few years, there has been a tapering off and a decrease in the total numbers of reports. Mr. Mica. So there was an increase in adverse reactions and reporting in the system, as there was an increase in the vaccination? Dr. Ellenberg. That is right. As one would expect. Mr. Mica. And now you have seen that trailing off? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes. Mr. Mica. One of complaints that we heard today is that individuals, parents or those who were inoculated as adults or later, did not feel that they had adequate warning about the adverse reactions. Today we have developed an incredible warning system. Cigarettes have warning systems on them. Every time you turn on the television, half the ad is the warning about the potential of the drug that you may be taking. From your experience and from seeing the statistics that we have seen here, it sounds like there are cases of adverse reaction. Does it not appear that there is inadequate warning either to the parents or those about to be vaccinated? Dr. Margolis. Well, I can speak both from the vaccine information statement that the CDC supplies--and again it is up to the individual to use that--where we say that a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of the hepatitis B vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small. As a clinician, when I talk to parents, I advise them of this potential. Mr. Mica. Is the warning adequate, given the numbers of adverse reactions? If we just take the New Hampshire incidence, we have more deaths from the vaccine than we have deaths from the disease. Dr. Margolis. The CDC and the ACIP, whom we go to with these potential or alleged adverse events, review the data in terms of association, scientific association and potential causality, and at this time there are no data that would show that these deaths, including the SIDS deaths or the other serious neurologic adverse events that we have heard about, are associated with the hepatitis B vaccination; and that is why at this time they are not included in the information statement. Mr. Mica. Dr. Ellenberg, did you want to respond about adequate warning? Dr. Ellenberg. Just to say that the adverse reactions that are known at the time that a vaccine is licensed are included in the label for the product. And as we learn new information about possible risks of the vaccine, those can be added to the label. Mr. Mica. Do either of you recommend additional studies? Another complaint we heard today and something that should be a concern to us is that we don't have enough data, enough studies, to find out what is really going on here. Dr. Margolis. Dr. Margolis. The CDC has seven studies ongoing at this time to look at the various types of adverse events which have been described, to see if there is---- Mr. Mica. What is the sequence of their being initiated? Is this recent or ongoing? Dr. Margolis. The first studies with the hepatitis B vaccine began in the mid eighties, and they were two reviews looking at neurologic events at that time; and then additional studies have begun, subsequent--there was an early study looking, soon after widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants in 1993-1994, and then these additional studies in the last several years for which data collection is still ongoing and final results are not in. Mr. Mica. So you think that this does need more study? Is it getting more study? And you recommend additional study? Dr. Margolis. Yes. It is part of our keeping vaccines safe. Mr. Mica. Dr. Ellenberg. Dr. Ellenberg. Vaccine safety is so important, I don't think that we can ever have enough studies. It is very difficult sometimes to uncover very, very rare risks because of all of the problems in interpreting data. So more studies, yes, would be very useful. Mr. Mica. We heard from Mr. Belkin, and he brought a chart up here that showed the sequence of events as he saw them. And when it got down to the VAERS study or repository, his chart indicated that the information went nowhere. What is the case with the reporting system? Dr. Ellenberg. Well, we have a staff that review these reports very carefully. There is more detail---- Mr. Mica. But beyond reviewing them, what happens? Is there anything happening with that information? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes. When we review them, when we do a thorough review, we provide this information to the medical community in the way of presentations and publications. If there is a need for making this information--putting this information on the label, we can work with the manufacturers to have that happen. I am not quite sure--that is our job, to see what information is in there that people need to know in order to improve everybody's understanding about vaccine safety. Mr. Mica. Dr. Margolis. Dr. Margolis. The other things that VAERS do, these case reports generate--these larger studies, one looks at vaccinated versus unvaccinated children to see if there is a true association. So it is fed back into a loop. Mr. Mica. Do we have information on that as it relates to hepatitis B? Dr. Margolis. Those are part of the seven studies that I described, but we don't have the complete information at this time. Mr. Mica. My last question deals with its efficacy, for how long the vaccines are effective. I have read 7 years in one report. The manufacturer says--indeterminable was something that was said, testified to. Someone else said 4 years in India. It doesn't sound like we know how long these vaccinations are effective for. Do we, Dr. Margolis? Dr. Margolis. Unfortunately, when we start out with any vaccine, we don't know how long it is going to be effective. Hepatitis B vaccine is one where we started following children and adults, and we are out now 15 years, to see how long the immunity will last. Yes, there has been controversy, and our friends in Europe and India, some have said we should test everybody and revaccinate every 4 years. There has been a change as data has become available. There are studies out 15 years showing that a child vaccinated either as an infant or a young child is still protected, including as they have grown up, become sexually active, and are exposed in settings where there is a high rate of hepatitis B. So we feel comfortable that we know about 15 years. We don't know about the future, but these studies are ongoing. They are part of CDC's program to follow this vaccine and determine if we need booster doses. Mr. Mica. Did you want to respond, Dr. Ellenberg? Dr. Ellenberg. No, that is a very complete answer. Mr. Mica. The hearing so far raises as many questions as I think we have had answers provided, but at this time I would like to yield to Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. In that vein, let me say that one of our colleagues, Rod Blagojevich, asked me to put a question to you on the record, Dr. Margolis. I think you have answered it, but in deference to him, I am going to ask it again. What efforts have been made to compare the overall outcomes of children who are vaccinated against those who are not vaccinated? Dr. Margolis. Again, there have been several long-term studies in populations. One is among the Alaskan native children and has shown the ongoing effectiveness of immunization now for 10 to 15 years. Mr. Tierney. The second part of his question, are there clinical trials, control groups or other ways of measuring the general health of the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated? Dr. Margolis. These again have been done in these large population-based studies, and especially where one is looking for a potential adverse outcome. Mr. Tierney. I want to pose to you a question one of the skeptics of the vaccine has published before. The question that this doctor says is worth asking is, does a baby born of stable parents in a good environment have enough chance of getting hepatitis B to warrant subjecting it to what he perceives as an unknown danger? Dr. Margolis. When we look at the 20,000 to 25,000 infections that occur in children in the United States, and the majority don't have a risk factor, there is not someone in their household who is infected, and so those are a very important group because if we don't prevent those, they are going to grow up and have chronic liver disease. Also, as people may have high-risk behaviors as adolescents or adults, we have found it very difficult to vaccinate before you get infected. There is that additional margin of protection that occurs. Subjected to a rigorous and peer-reviewed analysis of this, both in terms of prevention--and we were quite conservative in our prevention; we only said 60 percent of children would be vaccinated, we have done better--it becomes both cost-effective and prevention-effective to do this. Mr. Tierney. How many manufacturers produce the vaccine? Dr. Margolis. There are two that are licensed in the United States. There are many more worldwide. Mr. Tierney. Dr. Ellenberg, we have--I think you talked about one study that seemed to document people who use vaccines, and then looked at the reactions that were claimed. Do we actually ever do an analysis of VAERS, things that are claimed, to see if there are any common characteristics between the individuals who are making those reports? Dr. Ellenberg. You mean to see whether one could identify people who are particularly at risk for having reactions? Mr. Tierney. Yes. Dr. Ellenberg. We have done that, but we need to do more of that. It is something that with regard to--for example, the gender issue that was raised by a previous witness, this is something that we have studied. Mr. Tierney. You have studied the gender difference? Dr. Ellenberg. To some degree; not as intently--we have not completed our investigation. Mr. Tierney. Do you have any preliminary results on that? Dr. Ellenberg. With regard to the hepatitis B vaccine, I can say that there is a predominance of reports in females in the adult age group. That is because the largest group of people who get the hepatitis B vaccine as adults are healthcare workers, and this is a predominantly female occupation. When we look at the adverse events in children, there was no difference, males versus females, in the adverse events reports. But this is an important issue not just for vaccines, but for other medical products, and it is something that we hope to pursue in more detail. Mr. Tierney. What are we doing exactly to pursue it? Dr. Ellenberg. Trying to get additional resources. Mr. Tierney. You have made an application to Congress for that? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes. Mr. Tierney. Let me ask you, Doctor, are there any criteria for reporting to VAERS? Are there any conditions that have to be met before a report can be filed? Dr. Ellenberg. That is correct. Any time anybody feels that there might have been--a vaccination might have been implicated, they are encouraged, because we have found things that nobody would have thought were associated with the vaccine. And when we have a number of reports, we are able to see that maybe in some rare cases it is, and some of that example is in the written testimony. Mr. Tierney. Can you tell us what your datalink project is designed to do? Dr. Ellenberg. The Vaccine Safety Datalink is actually a program of the CDC, so they may want to elaborate on this. But it is a collaboration of four health maintenance organizations where you can link the vaccination history of children with their medical outcomes. And so we don't have some of the problems that we have in VAERS in terms of knowing how many people were vaccinated and how many people had certain kinds of events. One can construct rates in a way that you can't do with the VAERS system. When we identify a signal of a possible problem in VAERS, we can go to the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which met last week, and suggest that perhaps these things could be looked at in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and that has happened on numerous occasions. Mr. Tierney. Has there been a problem with the VAERS system for double counting? Dr. Ellenberg. Yes. We get duplicative reports. We have continued work to develop algorithms to sort these out. We don't want to discourage--we are more anxious to get the reports in the first place, but it is problematic. We have more duplicative reports of the serious events and fatalities; 10 to 15 percent of those are duplicates as compared to the less serious reports where there is not as much of a problem with duplicates. Mr. Tierney. Is there anything that Congress can do with that particular issue? Is that something that you are working with within the administrative end of it? Dr. Ellenberg. The issue of trying to do quality control of the data base is difficult. Anything that Congress can do to provide us additional resources to analyze these data bases and to do followup studies would be most appreciated. Mr. Tierney. Is it accurate to say that the majority of people that are contracting hepatitis are, in fact, infants or adolescents, or do you have it broken down? Dr. Ellenberg. That, I will have to defer to my CDC colleagues. Dr. Margolis. As that pie chart showed, still the majority who contract it are adolescents and adults. Mr. Tierney. That is diagnosed or contracted? Dr. Margolis. Both. If you look at it both in terms of reported, or if one goes to the surveys and the estimates, you see it both--you see it as being similar. Mr. Tierney. So there is no way to tell when someone contracted it once you have diagnosed it? Mr. Margolis. That is correct, but the two appear to mirror each other. You can use acute disease reporting to show you what happened in the past. Mr. Tierney. I have no other questions. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Let me go back if I can just a second. I discussed the number of cases of children under 2, and we got to 95 reported cases of hepatitis B nationwide. Was that right, Doctor? Dr. Margolis. Correct. Mr. Mica. That was in 1997. Then I asked Dr. Ellenberg the number of deaths attributed to adverse reactions in the same period, and we got to about 45? Dr. Ellenberg. Well, those were deaths reported to VAERS, but one could not attribute them to the vaccination. They are associated in time, but there is no way to determine that the vaccine was responsible for those deaths. Mr. Mica. They are attributable under some circumstance, in some way, or does the reporting make any sense if---- Dr. Ellenberg. As I have said, there is no restriction on reporting. If someone's child---- Mr. Mica. You said there was also underreporting? Dr. Ellenberg. There is underreporting---- Mr. Mica. And we don't have that causal evidence on other cases, so we are guesstimating that these 45 would be adverse reaction deaths, right? Dr. Ellenberg. No, we cannot draw that conclusion. Mr. Mica. Do you have any idea what is going on? Dr. Ellenberg. We have a nonrestrictive system so that anything that happens after a vaccine we can look at. We might be able to find some cluster of symptoms that does suggest that the vaccine was causal. But we don't have that. Mr. Mica. So our guesstimate is 45 adverse---- Dr. Ellenberg. That is not my estimate. I don't know how many of these deaths, if any, were related to the vaccine. Mr. Mica. How many deaths did we have in infants or children under 2 from hepatitis B, as reported--deaths? Now, if they have hepatitis B, we can probably get that in a task, and that would be reportable as a death, OK. Who can tell me? Dr. Margolis. Deaths from hepatitis B in children under age 2 or in children in general are very rare. Mr. Mica. I am trying to get one---- Dr. Margolis. There is---- Mr. Mica. We are looking at children under 2. Is there any evidence? I know that has to be reported somewhere, because we can definitely tell who has hepatitis B in children under 2. Dr. Margolis. I don't have that number. I can tell you---- Mr. Mica. Is it more than 45? Dr. Margolis. No, it is going to be less than that. That is again because as you have heard from me and other witnesses, that the deaths from hepatitis B occur many years later. They occur from the chronic liver disease. Death from acute hepatitis B, we estimate there are only 150 to 200 in all of the United States. That is from the new acute infection; fomenting hepatitis is rare. Mr. Mica. That is from hepatitis nationwide in 1997? Dr. Margolis. Yes. Mr. Mica. How many were there? Dr. Margolis. Around 100. That is acute. That is the new case. If one looks at chronic liver disease, that is the 4,000 to 5,000. Mr. Mica. Attributable to hepatitis B? Dr. Margolis. Attributable to hepatitis B. You asked me about new acute cases. That is what is reported to us or acute cases. People who get ill with hepatitis acutely, the new infection. Mr. Mica. Given some of what we have heard today and some of what you know, there are--currently 16 States have conscientious or philosophical exemptions available from the mandatory vaccination laws. Do you feel we should expand this? Sixteen States now have it--or redefine it? Mr. Livingood. This is John Livingood from the National Immunization Program. The construction and implementation of State laws for mandatory immunization has been entirely a State function and not a Federal function. We have been prepared to support States, however they chose to enact and implement their State law. Mr. Mica. We also penalize them---- Mr. Livingood. We do not penalize them for the content of their State law. States receive incentive funding based upon the amount of four doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine. Mr. Mica. So, in effect, they are not being financially rewarded? Mr. Livingood. Hepatitis B does not play a role in incentive funding. It is not included in the formula for incentive funding. Incentive funding is based on DPT, MMR, and polio containing vaccines. A State also measures immunization levels at the time of school entry, but we don't reward or allocate funds based on hepatitis B as a component of the immunization program in a reward or incentive way. Mr. Mica. So basically no one is going to commit to anything from this panel as far as any exemptions for conscientious or philosophical exemptions from the vaccine? Mr. Livingood. If States implement such a law, we will support them; and we are in complete agreement with however the States choose to do their own---- Mr. Mica. There are 16 States that have this exemption. Have we done any study, if there are any higher or lower vaccination rates or incidents? Is that part of any ongoing study, Dr. Margolis? Mr. Livingood. Not for hepatitis B, but there is an article that will be coming out in the next several months in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Not surprisingly, States that have persons who are allowed philosophic exemptions, those persons themselves are at increased risk of disease because they are not immunized compared to the other population. There is also a small increased risk that appears for the general population of those States, but it is not a major impediment to immunization coverage levels per se, since most States have rather low levels of philosophic exemptions by the time of school entry. It is usually in the single digit percentages. Mr. Mica. Well, I thank our witnesses. Did you have any additional questions, Mr. Tierney? We have been joined by Mr. Towns, the gentleman from New York. Did you have any questions at this time? Mr. Towns. I have a couple, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mica. Go right ahead. You are recognized. Mr. Towns. Let me also thank you for holding this hearing. Today it is fashionable, among teenagers in particular, to get tattoos and engage in body piercing, and also fraternities have fraternity brands. Knowing what you know about the transmission and effects of hepatitis B, what do you think about this trend from a health standpoint? Dr. Margolis. Well, anytime one puts a needle into their body, there is a potential for transporting blood-borne viruses. I had this discussion with this committee for hepatitis C and HIV. However, if you look at persons with acute disease where we do the surveillance to find out risk factors, we do not see this as a substantial risk factor. The potential is there and so we feel that if people choose to do it, they should do it safely. Mr. Towns. Don't you think we should be a little more aggressive about it in terms of getting information out, because nobody really talks about it? Colleges are doing it and they are doing it on university campuses. Don't you think some statement should be coming forth in terms of the possible risk here? Dr. Margolis. Actually, the CDC has made that statement as the possible risk. In information about hepatitis C, there have been a number of health education materials from non-CDC groups that point out that potential. And as information--and about all blood-borne infections, that that potential is there. We agree. Mr. Towns. One other question. I am concerned about daycare workers. Are there any Federal guidelines which require daycare workers, who have close contact with children by changing diapers and all of those other kinds of things, be tested for or immunized against hepatitis B? Dr. Margolis. In a number of studies---- Mr. Towns. By not doing this, are we jeopardizing our children? Dr. Margolis. For hepatitis B, many studies have shown there is not transmission either from the child to the daycare worker or from daycare workers to children. And at the time, the occupational safety and health regulation about blood-borne pathogens was developed and implemented in 1991, this actually had been looked at and so that is not considered an occupational risk and it is really not considered a risk from the daycare worker to the child. And there have been a number of studies that have looked at that. And so again, while this is a blood-borne infection that is relatively easily transmitted, it has not been transmitted in the daycare setting. Mr. Towns. Let me ask you this. Do you have any other feelings of explanation for that if that is actually true? Dr. Margolis. Well, we know actually in the hospital setting that a transmission, again more likely because of needle sticks and those kinds of sharp injuries, goes from the patient to the healthcare worker. Transmission from a possibly infected healthcare worker does not go to the patient. So again, those blood exposures are rarely there, and they are even more rare in the daycare setting. Mr. Towns. I just think that for some reason we are not paying enough attention to prevention. I could be wrong. In fact, I hope that I am wrong, but I am willing to bet that I am not wrong. Dr. Margolis. I think now children--because of routine childhood immunization, most children in daycare are vaccinated. So the potential for transmission between children or from a child to a daycare worker would even be rarer than it already is. Mr. Towns. My other question is, are we requiring this daycare worker to be immunized? Dr. Margolis. Not against hepatitis B. Mr. Towns. OK, I have no further questions. I just think, Mr. Chairman, that really once we--if we stressed it at the beginning, I think we might be able to solve some problems later on. There is not enough information out. I think that is a big problem here. Once a person has hepatitis B or C, there is no treatment for it. Dr. Margolis. It is largely treatment through interferon treatments. With end-stage liver disease, a transplantation is required. So prevention is the thing. Mr. Towns. Let me ask a question, what is the difference between B and C? Dr. Margolis. Two different viruses. Both live in the liver, but two different viruses in terms of their outcome. Mr. Towns. Can I say that C is much more aggressive and much more devastating? Dr. Margolis. There are more people infected with C, but they are actually both equally aggressive. Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Towns. We did hear today different instances about the effect on people's lives and some pretty dramatic testimony. You mentioned in your testimony about some studies that you are doing, and also I think you mentioned that the British and French have conducted studies. I have got a headline from an Associated Press wire story from October 1998. It says ``French Suspend Hepatitis B Inoculations,'' and it starts out, ``Faced with a potential health disaster, France has suspended hepatitis B vaccine inoculations of school children 4 years after mass immunization program began.'' I am just wondering if you would like to respond to what the French have done. Dr. Margolis. What I would like to do is clarify what happened in France, and several of us were involved with the World Health Organization and close to that issue. The French did not suspend infant, adolescent, or adult high-risk hepatitis B vaccination. What they suspended was vaccination of teenagers in schools, and what they said was, you as a teenager should be vaccinated in your healthcare providers' office, not in the school. Often in the translation--that was not there in the early headlines, but that is in fact the policy in France. Mr. Mica. I hate to say this, Dr. Margolis, that raises even more questions because now we have taken--well, we have questions already about the infant adverse reactions based on several studies, and we will hear some more about that; but this raises a whole new area of concern about teenage vaccination and why one country would suspend that. And it sounds like you---- Dr. Margolis. They did not suspend teenage vaccination. They suspended it in the schools. So the recommendation is still there, as we have in the United States, for routine vaccination of adolescents. What the French Minister of Health said is, go to your physician and have it done, do not come to the school and have it done. They did not do that because there were any data that showed that there was an association with adverse events. Mr. Mica. Well, I guess this is a hearing to be continued. We have gone on with this panel for some time. I will have additional questions that I would like to submit to you and ask that they be made part of the record, without objection. And if we have any other questions, we will submit them. We will dismiss you and thank you for your participation and call our third panel of experts on the subject. We have a series of doctors who will testify, including Dr. Samuel Katz, with the Infectious Disease Society of America; Dr. Bonnie Dunbar, a molecular biologist with Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Burton Waisbren, Sr., F.A.C.P., and Dr. Barthelow Classen, president and CEO of Classen Immunotherapies. With our witnesses in place, I would like to welcome all four of you as experts on the subject at hand. I would remind you that we try to limit your oral presentation before the subcommittee to 5 minutes, and if you have a lengthy statement, we will enter it as part of the record. This is an investigation and oversight subcommittee of Congress and so if you don't mind, please stand and we will swear you in. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Mica. The witnesses have answered in the affirmative. We are going to recognize Dr. Samuel Katz who is with the Infectious Disease Society of America. Dr. Katz, welcome. You are recognized. STATEMENTS OF DR. SAMUEL KATZ, THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA; DR. BONNIE DUNBAR, MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE; DR. BURTON WAISBREN, SR., F.A.C.P.; AND DR. BARTHELOW CLASSEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CLASSEN IMMUNO- THERAPIES, INC. Dr. Katz. Thank you, Mr. Mica. It is a pleasure to appear before you and Mr. Towns and Mr. Tierney. I also have submitted a more lengthy statement. Mr. Mica. Without objection, that will be made a part of the record. And if people in the audience have conversations, I would like them to take them outside so we can hear the witnesses. You are recognized, Dr. Katz. Dr. Katz. I am Dr. Samuel Katz, a pediatrician who has spent the last 42 years of my life working to develop the best vaccines in the world to protect the health of infants, children, and adults. I was privileged to be one of the two scientists who developed the measles vaccine more than 35 years ago that has saved tens of millions of lives of children in this country and around the world. Today, I was invited to speak on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, groups whose membership represent more than 55,000 pediatricians and 6,000 infectious disease experts who take care of patients, do research and teach, and participate in public health in the United States. Parenthetically, I would add in relation to an earlier discussion, that I am currently a member of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, the one that you discussed that was established by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and the membership consists of parents, attorneys, and physicians. Today, we are here to talk about hepatitis B, a particularly insidious disease, as you have heard, especially for children who acquire it within the first 5 years of life. Of those 25,000 hepatitis B-infected children, 30 to 90 percent are destined to acquire chronic hepatitis, which then leads to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer 30 to 40 years after they acquire the infection. However, we can prevent this disease with a vaccine that has been in use for more than a decade. It is effective and it is safe. It has been given to more than 500 million people around the world with the most striking results imaginable. The benefits of this vaccine are so impressive that more than 100 countries around the world routinely administer it, and in those countries the incidence of cirrhosis and liver cancer due to hepatitis B has plummeted. It is important, Mr. Chairman, to note that everyone is at risk for this disease. No matter their age, their race, their lifestyle or their socioeconomic status. As you have heard, at least 30 percent of people who have the hepatitis B virus have no idea how they acquired it. It is far more contagious than the virus that causes AIDS, and in this country it causes at least 5,000 deaths each year. The vaccine, like all recommended vaccines, has gone through rigorous, exhaustive processes of testing for safety and effectiveness by multiple groups, both within and outside our government, as well as in countries abroad. The safety systems currently in place are highly effective, and we persist in assessment of the safety of the vaccine, continually seeking new ways to decrease any possible risks. Parenthetically, Mr. Chairman, let me note that some of the statements you may hear in the media border on the irresponsible. The statements are not based on solid scientific facts, and they serve to shake the public's trust and threaten to reverse the incredible gains that this vaccine has provided. When you heard from parents today whose children have acquired hepatitis B, you can be certain there is nothing they want more than to turn back the clock so they might have made this vaccine available to their children. Parents can continue to have the utmost confidence in their pediatricians and other health professionals and rest assured that they are focused solely on providing the best health and happiness for these children in recommending the vaccine to prevent hepatitis B. Let me add, in closing, that I am a grandfather whose eight grandchildren ages 2 months to 4 years have all received hepatitis B vaccines, as their parents and their pediatricians strive to assure them the best in healthy and happy lives. Hopefully, all American children will continue to receive these same benefits. Hepatitis B is a serious, often life- threatening infection. The vaccine is both effective and safe. Pediatricians will continue to provide parents the most reliable information regarding all vaccines, including that to prevent hepatitis B. Time does not permit my answering many questions you may pose, but I will be happy to respond to any in the discussion. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Waisbren. Is that Waisbren? Dr. Waisbren. Waisbren. Mr. Mica. Senior, FACP. Thank you. Dr. Waisbren. I would like to thank this committee for the opportunity to share with them my concerns regarding the vaccination policies of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. I am a physician and clinical investigator who has practiced internal medicine, infectious diseases, and immunology in Milwaukee, WI, for 48 years. I am a member of the Infectious Disease Society of America, and I will point out that nobody asked me, as a member, my opinion about this subject. No ulterior motives or special interests are responsible for my being here. I am here because I feel an injustice has been done to the children of the United States. Included among these children are my 16 grandchildren. I want to make it clear from the onset that I fully support hepatitis B vaccination for individuals who have known risk factors for hepatitis B infection. My involvement in the field of vaccine toxicity began in 1979 when I discovered that central nervous system demyelination as evidenced by multiple sclerosis had been cause in some individuals by the swine flu vaccine. My involvement was heightened when I found the same thing occurred after hepatitis B vaccination. Incidentally, everything I am saying is documented in this material that I'm going to submit. These findings have been confirmed by many others and have been extended to include other untoward reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine. Reactions include other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, optic neuritis, postvaccinal encephalomyelitis, which one of the persons who talked to you has, and possibly juvenile diabetes which you will hear more about. An autoimmune disease is defined by the fact that it is caused by the body's immune system turning against its own tissue, be it the nervous system, the heart, or the cartilage. Since the discovery of the autoimmune aspects of vaccine complications and confirmation by numerous investigators, I have been searching the medical literature and studying a good number of patients to try to figure out the mechanism or mechanisms by which these autoimmune complications occur. While many explanations have been suggested, the exact mechanism is still unknown. However, this study of the medical literature of the patients and a great number of the reports sent to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS], has convinced me that a serious, probably unique, problem with that exists in regard to the hepatitis B vaccine. There are at least 16 articles in the peer-reviewed medical literature about the occurrence of diseases of autoimmunity, such as multiple sclerosis, after hepatitis B vaccination. The editors of these renowned medical journals in which these articles appear felt that these cases should be brought to the attention of the medical professions. There are thousands, yes thousands, of reports by health professionals to the VAERS that adverse events have occurred after hepatitis B vaccination. I am aware of dozens of cases brought against pharmaceutical companies because of damage due to the hepatitis B vaccination. Many of these cases have been settled out of court with the proviso that the settlements remain a secret. The fact that these well-established adverse reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine have not been acknowledged or are being denied by both the CDC and the FDA is the root cause of the concerns that I am to share with you now. The first concern is that caused by the experiment, not the strategy, sponsored by the CDC, which is designed to determine if vaccination at birth of all babies in the United States will eventually decrease the frequency of cancer of the liver caused by hepatitis B infection. To arrive at the end point of this experiment will take many years. This experiment is based on the following assumptions. One, the vaccine is safe and effective. While the vaccine is effective, we all know that no vaccine is entirely safe as evidenced by the above mentioned information. The second assumption: I have read that they say that 5 to 20 percent of the people in the United States will eventually contract the hepatitis B infection. I doubt these statistics as I doubt many of the other statistics that have been presented. They mentioned up to 25 or 30 percent of patients with hepatitis B infection cannot remember where they got the disease. Isn't it understandable that people with risk factors such as multiple sex partners and injected drug use will not be able to pinpoint where and when they were exposed to the disease? The fourth assumption, and they repeatedly say this: There is no other way to control hepatitis B infection in the United States. Does anyone in this room agree that there is ever only one way to accomplish a purpose? I hope this committee will ask for an independent analysis of the rationales for the universal hepatitis B vaccination. In looking at the data, they should remember that the reports by the CDC are not peer reviewed and are reports, and that much of the data that is cited were given at symposiums sponsored by medical journals by invited speakers. Therefore they were not peer reviewed. This brings up my second concern, that is, how can an experiment such as universal hepatitis B vaccinations be adopted nationwide without congressional involvement or approval? Apparently this was accomplished by the joint efforts of an official of an agency that stood to gain much influence and power by the program and by an executive of a drug company which stood to make billions of dollars by the project. The references in that regard are available to you. What techniques were used and were conflicts of interest involved? Were the rights of parents and children infringed upon? My third concern lies in the fact that the FDA has apparently not been reacting to the many theories in the medical literature regarding the causes of neurologic complications of vaccination. The FDA does not ask if proposed vaccines exhibit molecular mimicry with human tissue, a possible cause of the difficulty. They do not ask if a vaccine exhibits complimentarity with common viruses that may be in the patients. Again, a possible explanation. They have not demanded that HLA patterns of patients who have untoward results be determined. This would react to the question brought up here today of who would get reactions. They have not encouraged the development of synthetic vaccines that contain only immunogenic antigens and nothing else. I am very concerned that we may see the same or similar adverse reactions to new vaccines. The new Lyme vaccine is a case in point since that vaccine has more theoretic dangers than does the hepatitis B vaccine because of the autoimmune nature of the disease itself. When the material I have presented here is considered en toto, I believe that it indicates that the present universal hepatitis B vaccination experiment being conducted in the United States should be abruptly halted for the following reasons. It appears likely that serious untoward events, particularly of the nervous system, involve the vaccine. In view of this, is it reasonable to suppose that some babies who have little or no chance of getting hepatitis B will suffer unnecessary damage to their nervous system? Three, information regarding the risk-benefit ratio of this vaccine is not known and therefore cannot be given to parents in an informed consent. Four, there is some doubt as to whether the rights of babies are being violated when they are subjected to an experiment even with their parents' consent. France has already at least mediated their program of hepatitis B vaccine because of reports about multiple sclerosis following the vaccination. I hope this country will follow their lead. If not, I'm afraid that public confidence in our vaccination programs will decrease, and they are excellent as described by Dr. Katz. This would be detrimental to the excellent vaccination programs already in place in the United States. I would like to thank the committee again for allowing me to share my concerns with them. Documentation of all that I have said here is available in the supplemental material that I have given this committee. Thank you. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony and that supplementary material will be made part of the record. Thank you. We will withhold questions until we have heard from everyone. [Note.--Additional information provided by Dr. Waisbren may be found in subcommittee files.] [The prepared hear from Dr. Bonnie Dunbar, molecular biologist with Baylor College of Medicine. You are recognized. Dr. Dunbar. Thank you, Congressman Mica, for your invitation to speak to this committee. I also have a full report and some documentation that I would like to submit. Mr. Mica. That will be made part of the record without objection. Dr. Dunbar. Thank you. I have been a professor at Baylor College of Medicine for approximately the last 15 years, but I have been working in vaccine development for 26 years. I will get to why I am going to be speaking here, but inasmuch as this is my first time addressing Congress and my time is limited, I have taken the advice of my lawyer, Mike Butler, who is a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and who has testified on numerous occasions. He suggested I summarize the detailed report that I sent you and follow up with some questions. Mr. Butler and his wife are here at the hearing today, not as my legal counsel but as concerned grandparents whose grandchild was vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine against his mother's specific wishes and became subsequently vision impaired. With respect to your first question, on the FDA VAERS reporting system and how it works, I have a few comments. I got involved in this issue about 5 years ago when I reported serious and permanent adverse reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine by two individuals working in my laboratory. One of those is my brother, Dr. Bohn Dunbar, who is currently disabled and has been acknowledged by over 12 physicians to have permanent disabilities due to this vaccine. He could not be here today because of his serious reaction to one of his treatments. Despite the seriousness of these reactions, there has been no followup to my reports to the FDA adverse reporting system. I have also found that there is no scientific or official mechanism for research scientists studying these reactions to communicate with the FDA or to get adequate information. I did find out, however, that the thousands of reactions reported to the FDA show the overwhelming correlation with the reactions that I reported to the FDA. I have received hundreds of calls from patients and doctors now about their patients having similar reactions. What is interesting is that these reactions are also identical to the over 100 published reports of adverse reactions that are currently in the literature. Many of these are in excellent peer review articles, and I have submitted this for the committee's review. Finally, and I think a big concern, has come from communication with my former medical students. I have been teaching medical students basic sciences for over 15 years. A student told me in tears, on one occasion, that the supervisory physicians in the hospitals have told them not to report vaccine adverse reactions or to get involved. In one situation, two babies were dying and they were specifically told not to report it. I feel strongly that this reporting system needs to be improved so that we can have a greater impact on vaccine safety. With respect to the risk benefit issues of infants, you have heard much about this today and I won't reiterate. But from a scientific viewpoint, I challenge any of my colleagues, scientifically or medically, to claim that we understand the newborn immune system. Without detailed scientific studies to demonstrate vaccine safety, efficacy, and duration of protection for an adult behavior-associated disease, I find it hard to justify wide- scale immunization. In fact, in our animal models, we can easily perturb the immune system of the newborn to cause adverse immune reactions. With respect to the CDC and pharmaceutical company interactions in conflict, I as well as other people here have overwhelming documentation on organizations receiving funds from drug companies, doctors carrying out clinical trials while being paid handsomely as expert witnesses and consultants for promoting the vaccine, doctors who have switched from being expert witnesses for the plaintiffs that were injured by the vaccines when they got paid more money to become an expert for the drug companies. Lobbyists have been paid simultaneously by healthcare organizations and drug companies. I recommend strongly that your distinguished committee investigate and evaluate these conflicts of interest, and I have documentation on that that I will be glad to provide you. Finally, with respect to the informed consent issue, many of our current and former medical school curricula do not emphasize details of immunology, a scientific field which has expanded tremendously within the past two decades. This expansion includes many of the scientific hypotheses which Dr. Waisbren just discussed. These could easily explain the autoimmune problems that are associated with genetic groups of populations in particular. They can also explain what has not been brought up today by any of the speakers, which I find surprising: the fact that many individuals--depending on the publication as many as 10 percent, and in some reports 30 percent of people--don't even respond and make antibodies to this vaccine. Therefore, it may be that if we are not following up who is a nonresponder, we may not be affecting the incidence of the disease itself in some genetic populations. So in summary, no one, especially myself, would ever assert that the hepatitis B virus is not causing serious health problems in the world. However, if this or any other vaccine by nature of the proteins or the parts of that protein, native or produced from a recombinant cDNA protein, has the ability to adversely affect the immune system of large numbers of individuals resulting in severe adverse reactions, even if restricted to some genetic populations, then all of the public reaction to all vaccines including those that we don't have related adverse reactions will be doomed in the public's eye. This includes the development of vaccines to evolving airborne viruses that might become a serious threat to the world population. Thanks to the success of the Government-funded Human Genome Project and advances in our computer programs, it may soon be possible to evaluate potential molecular structures to predict these problems with the vaccines in advance or in early vaccine development. In addition to your investigation with adverse reactions to this vaccine, I would urge you to help provide research funds, which are certainly not available now, to study these serious and what appear to be very common adverse reactions to this vaccine as well as other vaccines. I thank you for your attention. [The prepared statement you for your testimony, and I now would like to recognize Dr. Barthelow Classen, president and CEO of Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. Dr. Classen. Thank you. I am going to talk about the link between the hepatitis B vaccine and the increased risk of insulin-dependent diabetes. Vaccine policy in the United States is based on safety followup of about 30 days or less, that is, the child is immunized and they are followed for about 30 days for the development of adverse reactions. We have been studying the long-term effects of vaccines, looking at the development of autoimmune diseases. In particular, our model is insulin-dependent diabetes, a model for other autoimmune diseases. This is some of our published peer review data. Shown here is a 60 percent rise in the incidence of diabetes in New Zealand following a massive hepatitis B immunization program. You would expect to see a large or significant rise in autoimmunity following an immunization program because vaccines are immune stimulants. They stimulate the immune system. And then when we expect it to cause a rise in autoimmunity, we see this as shown here. The CDC did some studies to verify our findings which are published. They found, in fact, in their small preliminary study, that hepatitis B immunization, when given after 2 months of life, was associated with almost a 90 percent increase in the incidence of diabetes, very similar to what we found in New Zealand, so confirming our studies. They also did some work to confirm another one of our studies showing that immunization starting early in life was associated with the decreased risk of diabetes, compared with getting it later in life. And in their study, they showed that the immunization before 21 days was associated with a decreased risk, compared to immunizations starting after 8 weeks of life. We are doing more studies on the hepatitis B vaccine, but we now have confirming data from other vaccines including the hemophilus influenza B vaccine, another relatively new vaccine. Shown here is one of our studies where we show the incidence of diabetes more than doubled in the United States following the introduction of the hemophilus influenza B vaccine in the Pittsburgh area. The FDA relies on the VAERS system as well as the Large Link Data base system to look for adverse reactions. Our studies, however, showed that vaccine induced diabetes may not occur until years following immunization as shown here from some data from Finland. The vaccine was given in the first year of life, but the extra cases of diabetes occurred many years later. As shown here, the red curve is higher than the yellow curve as extra cases of diabetes occurred later in life. Regarding risk benefits, we characterize this quite for hemophilus influenza B vaccine in Finland. We show that there are about three cases of diabetes for every child that would expect to benefit from the vaccine. The data is not as clear for the hepatitis B vaccine. We don't have as much data. It appears that there may be one case of death from diabetes for every life we save in the hepatitis B vaccine, from preventing hepatitis B with the vaccine. However, you have to remember the cases of hepatitis B are skewed into certain high-risk groups. So, in low-risk groups, the risk of diabetes, just one autoimmune disease, seem to exceed the benefit of the vaccine. Cost effectiveness studies do not involve vaccine-induced diabetes. We estimate that there may be 10,000 cases of vaccine-induced diabetes in this country every year costing over $10 billion a year, with cumulative liabilities reaching maybe $250 billion. Now, the U.S. law requires vaccine manufacturers to demonstrate safety prior to the vaccine being placed on the market. However, we have proven that safety has never been demonstrated for this vaccine, yet many kids are being forced to be immunized. We attribute this to conflicts in interest. Our proposal is that first of all, there needs to be equal access to the Large Link Data base. Scientists representing the parents as well as the established medical community need to have access to that Large Link Data base. There needs to be more testing on the effect of vaccines on diabetes and autoimmunity. Parents need to be aware of toxicity studies in animals and in humans linking vaccines to diabetes. Parents also need to be aware that funds are not available to cover many adverse reactions and the development of safer immunization technology that needs to be made a priority above developing new vaccines. Mr. Mica. Does that conclude your testimony? Dr. Classen. Yes. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Katz, you said that you felt there were some irresponsible statements being made, either in testimony or with this hearing. You have just heard several witnesses here testifying. Would you like to comment on anything they have said? Dr. Katz. I hate to be put in a position of being a critic, but let me give you one example. Mr. Mica. Go right ahead. That's why we have you here. Dr. Katz. Thank you. Dr. Classen quoted all of these data, for example, from Finland. A meeting was held sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, including the physicians and the epidemiologists from Finland who had accumulated those data, including experts on diabetes, experts on vaccines, experts on immunology, experts on genetics. There was unanimous agreement that there was no indication whatsoever that there was any relationship of immunization to the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Dr. Classen was a participant in that meeting. If there was a vote, it was 128 to 1, and he was the one. I am not one who is here to analyze Dr. Classen's presentation, but only to tell you that the government in the form of the NIH, and the CDC, the Vaccine Safety Institute of Johns Hopkins, the Infectious Disease Society's Vaccine Initiative, all put up the funds to sponsor that meeting. Everyone was given a chance to present, including Dr. Classen, and there was absolutely no support for his theory, his hypothesis. Hypotheses are fine, but you have to accumulate the scientific data to substantiate your hypothesis. At least with the diabetes data, Dr. Classen has failed to do that in the opinion of worldwide experts. Mr. Mica. I don't want to get into a debate, but I did want to hear your response on that. One of the things that you just mentioned is that we rely on data and the need to study and we had the CDC, Dr. Margolis, we had the FDA representative here. They said that they felt this whole matter about efficacy, about adverse effects and others, needs additional study. They said that there are some number of them going on, have been going on. I think they said seven, and additional. Do you support that continued review? Dr. Katz. Absolutely. I would be the last to say that there isn't information which we don't yet have regarding vaccines, regarding the etiology of autoimmune diseases, similarly to the multiple sclerosis question. The World Health Organization held meetings to discuss this very issue. They were attended by immunologists, neurologists, experts on multiple sclerosis, epidemiologists, vaccineologists. And they concurred that there was no evidence that multiple sclerosis was in any way related to the receipt of hepatitis B vaccine. Now, I would be very quick to say that if Dr. Dunbar or others have theories that they can put to scientific test, we should be supporting that type of experimentation. We don't ever have the ability to prove the null hypothesis. What we don't know today we may know tomorrow. I don't mean that we should be complacent, but until we have some scientific, concrete evidence to support these hypotheses, I don't believe that we should be taking actions based on these. Mr. Mica. In your written testimony, you said there is absolutely no need to set aside special funds for independent vaccine safety research, and you felt that there was also inadequate---- Dr. Katz. I think that you are taking that out of context, Mr. Mica. What I was saying was that money that is set aside for safety research should be set aside through the peer review process; that if the NIH or others have grants submitted to them to make these investigations that---- Mr. Mica. You felt that that was adequate---- Dr. Katz. That they provide the peer review. Mr. Mica. Again, I don't want to take anything out of context, but do you feel there is adequate funding, adequate opportunity for research for this area? Or is this something that Congress is neglectful of and that warrants additional attention? The reason for this hearing isn't to scare anyone about vaccines. The reason is to find out if we are doing what we need to do. I have been in Congress since 1993. I have never had so many requests to be heard on an issue since I came to Congress. We merely try to respond and try to do it in a balanced fashion and then see if we are doing our job. So my question is, are there adequate funds? Are there adequate resources? Funds, believe it or not--the NIH is in our oversight responsibility and legislative responsibility. What do you think? Dr. Katz. It's always easy to sit outside of Congress and tell you how to spend your money. Let me say this: as a member of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines--that is the committee that is the oversight committee for the program, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act--we report directly to Secretary Shalala. There is an excise tax that that act put forth which is levied on every vaccine that is produced and distributed. That excise tax is used to accumulate the funds to reimburse families and children who feel that they have, under the judgment of independent medical review, that these are legitimate adverse events that have happened due to vaccines. Those funds are managed very wisely and very judiciously to the extent that there has now accumulated over $1 billion in a trust fund which is apparently inviolate unless you do something in Congress to make that available. Those billion dollars could very well be used to fund a number of studies such as those you are hearing requested today. Mr. Mica. That's your suggestion. Now, Dr. Dunbar, you were very specific in your testimony when you advocated additional studies and research and funding. Dr. Dunbar. Well, first of all, I would like to make two comments about the studies that we have heard about all day including those I think a lot of scientists are calling, the ``phantom WHO meeting'' studies. For 5 years I have been asking questions of people and I have been quoting these studies. None of us scientists could get that data. If this committee could get that data for us, many of us would appreciate that. The other thing is that, in many of those studies, it has become a semantics game. For example, where everyone is saying that this is not multiple sclerosis. Most of these cases, thousands of cases, we are looking into are not MS. We have to look at the broad range of autoimmune diseases. Most importantly, from the grant funding point of view. I myself have been a standing member of NIH subcommittees and I am well aware of the politics right down the road here. When you send in a grant on this topic, it goes to one of the vaccine committees where everybody on the committee develops vaccines. Most of those people are working with the pharmaceutical companies. There is a great prejudice by many scientists on those committees against anyone saying anything negative about a vaccine. I believe strongly and so do my other colleagues, such as Ron Kennedy in Oklahoma and Willy Hildebrand, who is head of the National Bone Marrow Association Program, who are helping us, that funding is needed. Now, fortunately we have private funding for this. But I find it sad that we have to get private funding, and that government funding is not supporting this, particularly when there are so many vaccine mandates out there. Dr. Waisbren. May I just make a comment? Mr. Mica. Dr. Waisbren. Dr. Waisbren. I think we all agree there have to be more studies. But I think we have to admit that people like the vaccine advisory groups, the CDC, and the FDA have a conflict of interest. They have been pounding the drum for universal vaccination for 10 years, and they have made every attempt to denigrate results to the otherwise. They have used institutions, such as the Institute of Medicine, as their evidence that nothing has happened. I think that the hope would be that a committee such as yours would be able to have an independent investigation of the statistics upon which the universal hepatitis B vaccination experiment is based to see if you can believe that they are adequate by a statistical group that has no conflict of interest. Mr. Mica. Dr. Katz, we heard from some folks before in a panel, one lady in particular, who I think medically has been able to verify that through the vaccination she has suffered adverse reaction and it has caused some problems. Dr. Katz. Are you talking of Ms. Fluck? Mr. Mica. Yes. She has not applied to the fund account that was set up. Dr. Katz. I asked her husband why she hadn't. Mr. Mica. One of my concerns--and again I hope that we are not acting irresponsibly, but it's 13 years since we passed the legislation that provided compensation for those that are adversely affected. We have $1 billion in the funds, and we are getting complaints that people aren't getting compensated or feel that they have access to be compensated. That's one problem. The other problem is that they are saying they are having difficulty in determining the causal relationship and verifying that it is a result of the immunization. Maybe you could comment on this. Is the fund operating properly? And then the problem of getting access to the fund and verifying cases. Dr. Katz. I think it would be very helpful to you if you talked to the people who run the fund. The committee of which I spoke is actually called a commission, not a committee, and is chaired by a gentleman whose child was the victim of an adverse event. The parents who sit on that committee are all of that ilk. The attorneys who sit on that committee are the attorneys who pursue these cases on behalf of plaintiffs who feel that they have been injured. So, if it is a biased committee, it's biased in favor of those who feel that they have been adversely affected. There are only 3 of us out of 10 on the committee, actually 2 out of 10, who are physicians. So it's not a physician-dominated committee. There is only one from the pharmaceutical industry on the committee, one representative. So the majority are the very people from whom you heard today. I would urge you to talk to Dr. Geoffrey Evans and Mr. Tom Balbier who are the two people who run that program. They issue a regular report every 3 months documenting the number of cases heard, the adjudications, and the awards made. I think that the program is working very well. There is one problem, and that is, sometimes people aren't aware of it. Every effort is being made to promulgate the information so that families who feel that they have had an adverse event will know how to file before this committee. They have cutoff the grandfather clause. It used to be that you had to report within X number of years. They have extended that to longer and longer durations so that families that hear about it late are not cutoff because it's too late. I don't want to bore you with all of this. Mr. Mica. No, that's exactly what we wanted to hear. We set up the fund and want to know if it was working. Dr. Katz. I think it is working wonderfully well. Mr. Mica. And you have made some changes that you described at length in the eligibility. You also cited through your testimony that the fund has accumulated more funds than anticipated, and one of your recommendations--and I don't want to take words out of your mouth--is possibly some of these funds could be used for research. Is that correct? Dr. Katz. That's exactly what I hoped to say, yes. I think that the issues relating to the whole area are reviewed regularly. Dr. Waisbren mentioned the Institute of Medicine. The Institute of Medicine isn't funded by the pharmaceutical industry or by any other conflict. It is part of the National Academy of Sciences, which you and Congress set up under Abraham Lincoln, a Republican President, to provide advice to the government about unbiased scientific issues. Mr. Tierney. I just thought that he and Abe were working in tandem at the same time. Mr. Mica. I know him well. Dr. Katz. That group is one that reviews regularly the issue of vaccine-associated adverse events. It's so strict in its membership that any of us, if you will, us in an editorial fashion, who work with vaccines can't be members of that committee because they don't want to have the bias that Dr. Waisbren feels is exerted. There are immunologists, there are epidemiologists, there are people who are knowledgeable about science but who aren't biased by being proponents of vaccines. Mr. Mica. I want to give the others an opportunity to respond. Dr. Dunbar. Dr. Dunbar. Well, obviously, I am not a lawyer and neither is my colleague, Dr. Katz, but there are clearly some issues on the Vaccine Compensation Act, and there are some lawyers in the room who I know can deal with that issue. One point is, I believe, there is some problem with the fact that after this summer, people who had the hepatitis B vaccine are going to be restricted from even filing. So, there clearly are some problems. I am not familiar with that, and I think that might be a good subject for a whole other hearing. Mr. Mica. Dr. Waisbren, did you want to comment? Dr. Waisbren. I just wanted to make one comment about the Institute of Medicine. I have gone over their material carefully. They have said often, we cannot prove that the vaccine causes any difficulty. They also mention that they can't prove that it doesn't. So the question is open. But time and time again, I hear people saying the Institute of Medicine says that the vaccine doesn't cause any trouble. So they cover themselves with the fact that they haven't proved that it does occur. All their study is, if you read in their books, is they have not proven that it doesn't hurt anybody. In view of that, I think that the jury is out. As far as the members of that committee, I beg to differ. I corresponded with them, and there are vaccine proponents in Seattle and other places in the country. Mr. Mica. Dr. Katz, I see you nodding. Dr. Katz. I keep prolonging this. The Institute of Medicine task force categorizes vaccine-associated injuries in several ways. One is what Dr. Waisbren has said, that is, that we can't prove that this is associated or not. Those are obviously the ones where a red flag goes up and where further investigation is needed. There are others where they say, yes, definitely. This association is correct. Thrombocytopenia after measles and rubella vaccine is an example. There are others where they say, we can state definitively there is no association. So, they don't just categorize things one way or the other. They have a gradation. Mr. Mica. Thank you. I'm going to yield now to Mr. Tierney, the gentleman from Massachusetts, for questions. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the members of this panel for their testimony. Let me ask generally just to get a feel for your opinions on this. Assuming there were studies or studying whether or not the hepatitis B vaccine might cause other types of issues or problems, are you all of a mind that we should stop giving this vaccine in the interim period while waiting for the results of these studies? Dr. Classen. I believe very strongly. I am a physician. I have been immunized with the hepatitis B vaccine, and in certain high-risk categories I agree with Dr. Waisbren that, in fact, it may have some utility. However, I think the forced immunization of children which is going on when, in fact, the risk may exceed the benefit as some of the data suggest, that again, I think there is a real problem there with forcing people to be immunized. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Dunbar. Dr. Dunbar. I concur. I think there are some high-risk groups, particularly as we are looking into the genetic populations where in some particular parts of the world genetically, some people are more likely to have a reaction to the vaccine and others in other countries or parts aren't. But certainly for high-risk categories I see no problem. But we need to have more studies to find out who is going to be in the high-risk categories. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Waisbren. I believe very strongly that my grandchildren, who aren't as yet sexually active or alcoholics or any of those categories, do not have a significant chance of getting hepatitis B. And I think that the data that suggest that they are, when you examine it, is not there. If, at the age of 12, they are wild, I would have no objection to them getting it. But to assume that they are going to have trouble these first few years of life I think is fallacious. Mr. Tierney. Just before I left Dr. Katz, are you saying, Dr. Waisbren, that those are the only people that can contract hepatitis B? Dr. Waisbren. I say that the figure of this 30 percent is a red flag that cannot be established. I think it is done by a questionnaire of people who are blood donors. I suggest that a statistician go over the paper in which the CDC claimed that in 30 percent of hepatitis B cases, there is no evidence that risk factors are involved. The data in this regard appears to come from a questionnaire sent to hepatitis B patients in only four counties in the country. In my opinion, there is no credible evidence that what we call lateral spread of this disease occurs in any but extremely rare instances. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Katz, could you respond to both of those questions? Dr. Katz. Obviously, I disagree with my three colleagues. Let me see if I can remember the questions. First of all, regarding the use of the vaccine in very young children: I think I find Dr. Classen inconsistent. On the one hand, he is saying we should give the vaccine before 21 days of age. We give it to newborns. That's well before 21 days of age! I don't know how that adds up. That's apples and oranges. Second, I think the issue of the 30 percent is a very real one. You heard one parent today. But that's only one parent. There have been very good studies to which Dr. Margolis alluded. In Alaska, children under the age of 10 have a very high rate of carrying the hepatitis B virus before they were sexually active. They had no injectable drugs. There were no apparent causes other than close living quarters where there were a lot of people who were chronic carriers. Since the institution of the hepatitis B vaccine program in Alaska, which is 1 of our 50 States, there has been no child under the age of 10 in the 10 years since that program has been in place in the seven villages that they monitored, who has acquired hepatitis B carrier state. I think that the vaccine as it is currently available and utilized is appropriate. I do not say that we shouldn't continue to study, but I think to halt the program at this point, which is eminently successful, would be a serious mistake. Mr. Tierney. You mentioned, Dr. Katz, that the system to assure the vaccines are safe and effective is always improving. I think you said that during your testimony. What recommendations do you have to make to us about improving the system further? Dr. Katz. I think there is a vaccine branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. I think they have a vaccine study section to which Bonnie alluded. I think that an infusion of funds that were deliberately aimed and targeted--I know that you don't like to target funds at NIH--but if you spoke to Dr. Varmus and to Dr. Fauci and explained to them what you saw as to the severity of this problem, never mind its magnitude but just the severity of concern on the part of the people that we have heard today, that there has to be an acceleration of research aimed to investigate these hypotheses. Individuals who are proven investigators can conduct peer-reviewed research. Then you would get some further action much more rapidly. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Dunbar, am I correct in understanding that you believe, or have a belief, that Caucasians may be susceptible to the side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine? Dr. Dunbar. We are actually doing some genetic studies to try to nail this on the head, as it were. But of the literally hundreds and thousands of people who have contacted me or doctors, so far they are all Caucasians. I feel that if this is just vaccine hysteria, we wouldn't be seeing this kind of relationship. And they are all of the same types of people that I am studying. In particular, of the hundreds we have, they were perfectly healthy and they took the vaccine and now they are debilitated for life. The other concern is not just the people that are having the adverse reactions. Dr. Katz has alluded to the group in Alaska where there is a high group of chronic carriers. We also know in Asia, where a lot of the clinical trials were done, you don't see adverse reactions. But this is a different population that we know ``genetically'' responds differently to the virus itself. In fact, another point that was not brought out today is that 95 percent of the people that get the virus don't even have the flu or don't even know they are sick. So a lot of people respond normally without having any long-term side effects. What we don't know about the whole vaccine itself, which Mr. Mica referred to this morning. We don't know a lot about why the different genetic populations respond differently with respect to the disease itself, let alone why the people with adverse reactions that we are seeing are responding with respect to the genetics. It was curious to me at the Institute of Medicine meeting at which I was invited to speak that, when we asked about all of these new studies that are being done, I said ``great,'' we have the genetic data so we can break this out. They said, oh, no, we can't ask those questions. So even though these studies are ongoing, we are not going to get the data we need. We need to have those studies where we can take into account the genetic populations in what we are seeing. So from what I could see of what they outlined at the Institute of Medicine, the studies that are in the works or are being planned are not going to be sufficient to evaluate these serious adverse reactions. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. In the testimony there was reference to a molecular mimicry hypothesis. Could somebody there explain to me the relevance that that hypothesis has to the hepatitis B vaccine safety? Dr. Waisbren. When you look back as we developed--and I will try to make this brief--is that all living things have certain proteins that are of advantage to them whether they be viruses, bacteria, or humans. So we have to assume that certain proteins are held in common by humans and bacteria and viruses. If those proteins are similar enough, when you inject a virus into a person the body will mistake that protein for itself and make antibodies or T-cells against the body itself, rather than the proteins in the virus. It has been shown that in the hepatitis B virus, for instance, there is molecular mimicry between myelin, which is involved in multiple sclerosis, and the hepatitis B vaccine. There are studies that should be done and have been done by the people of Harvard in which if you give a vaccine, you can find out whether or not antimyelin T-cells are circulating. This would be one easy way of studying vaccine toxicity. I recommended that to the Institute of Medicine 3 years ago at one of their meetings, and it just fell on deaf ears. So those sorts of things should be done. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Classen. Can I add one point, though? Molecular mimicry is only one hypothesis. In fact, there are probably several mechanisms of reactions. We are seeing increases in diabetes with many different vaccines which suggest that, in fact, there are other mechanisms as well. Just giving Interferon, plain Interferon, to patients who are diseased increases the risk for autoimmunity including diabetes. Vaccines are known releasers of Interferon. So just by generally stimulating the immune system you would expect to see a wide range of autoimmune diseases following immunization. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Katz, would you like to say something? Dr. Katz. I was only going to say that there is no doubt, as Dr. Dunbar has pointed out, that there has been enormous advance in the field of immunology. There are now very large grants from the National Institutes of Health to diabetes centers around the country to look at the question of autoimmunity and what are the inductive factors. In other words, diabetes, childhood juvenile diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes may be an autoimmune disease. What is not understood is what is the trigger that sets off that autoimmune disease. We are being besieged day and night by things that you inhale, by things you ingest. It isn't just what you inject with a vaccine. There are all sorts of proteins and carbohydrates, all sorts of antigens to which you and I are subject day and night. To single out vaccines as the only target is being somewhat parochial. I assure you that these study programs that the NIH is now funding on diabetes will be looking at vaccines, at acquired infections and many other possible stimuli. To date there is no evidence that vaccines are the culprits. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Dr. Waisbren. There have been official pronouncements by the National Diabetes Association and by the Multiple Sclerosis Society that juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis do not occur after the hepatitis B vaccination. You wonder what influences these national organizations to make these statements in view of information discussed here and in the world literature. Dr. Dunbar. Just one quick comment, if I may. My medical student who has just taken her exam and is graduating today said that they had to learn an answer for the exam this year. The question in the study guide was, ``what is the safest vaccine ever made?'' and the answer was the hepatitis B vaccine. So it's already infiltrated. Even without saying we haven't done these studies, the medical students are already being told in their minds that this is the safest vaccine ever made, yet we don't have any long-term followup clinical trials. Dr. Classen. I would like to make one point. I submitted additional testimony, written testimony, which I hope you will accept, and also I hope that you will look into the conflict- of-interest issues, as well, as described in my testimony. [The prepared statement Thank all of you. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Dr. Katz, I have a question. In your testimony you said that hepatitis B--and I think I wrote this down--is far more contagious than AIDS? Dr. Katz. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, absolutely. Mr. Mica. I am not a scientist. I am just a Member of Congress and it is pretty scary, isn't it? I just wonder. We had Ms. Hahn here. She has hepatitis B. She lives with her husband and four children and yet none of them tested positive. I'm not sure if that same thing would happen with AIDS. Maybe it would. I don't know. Dr. Katz. I think that it's inappropriate to compare HIV and hepatitis B. I was only using that as an example of the contagiosity of hepatitis B. HIV is much more constrained in the way that it is passed by blood, by semen, by sexual encounter, by injectable drugs. Hepatitis B, I was trying to point out, doesn't need any of them. I think it was Ms. Hahn who pointed out how long the virus survives if you spill it on a table top. HIV is very fragile. In a very short period of time if you were to have an accident, it is no longer infectious. That was the gist of what I was trying to express. Mr. Mica. I'm not trying to put you on the spot, just a layman's question. Ms. Hahn. I will answer that. I praise the Lord. Mr. Mica. Maybe that has something to do with it, too. The other thing is based on the information that you all have. Do you think that we should provide additional warnings of adverse potential reactions based on your knowledge, Dr. Katz? Dr. Katz. I was a little bit chagrined and disappointed in listening to some of these presentations. Not in the presentations, but in what was said about physicians who had administered vaccines. We are required to provide the so-called vaccine information statements to parents and guardians or individuals who are old enough to read them for themselves. If physicians are failing to do that, then we have failed in getting the message across to them that this is important. Those statements are clear. They do outline both the benefits and the risks of the vaccine, and they should be given to parents before they even bring their child in so they have time to digest this at home and not in the rush of 5 minutes in the waiting room of the office. Dr. Dunbar. But these vaccines are being mandated. They are even being given by schools and school nurses. Once it's mandated by the States, you take away that liability. Dr. Katz. They cannot give them in school without the parents' permission. Mr. Mica. Again, is there adequate notice regarding the possible adverse effects, Dr. Waisbren? Dr. Waisbren. I would say that the fact is that the vast majority of babies are immunized in the hospital without the parents being consulted. This is based on my personal experience with my patients, my grandchildren, and so on. I think that one of the solutions to advising parents is to make their physician become responsible for any adverse reactions that happen even in the hospitals. They say, well-- the American Association of Pediatricians or someone said that it's OK, so it's OK. But I think if doctors have to take the responsibility for adverse results that perhaps they will look into the possibility and warn their patients more adequately. Mr. Mica. Dr. Classen, I didn't give you an opportunity to respond. Dr. Classen. Yes. I think absolutely more warning needs to be made, both in animal toxicity studies. You have a lot of epidemiology data and people who are always going to say, well, maybe it's not the causality. But animal toxicity data, I think, is crucial; and there is a lot of animal data, for example, with vaccines on different autoimmune diseases that they can exacerbate it. In that case it's clearly that the vaccines are causing and exacerbating autoimmunity in animals. I think that the parents should be warned of that. I do believe that there is a real problem with physicians not notifying the patients. I had one classical example where I saw a patient with a vaccine adverse reaction. I didn't immunize the child. It was clear to me it was a vaccine adverse reaction. It was shingles following the chicken pox vaccine. So I sent the patient back to the physician who had administered the vaccine for followup; and the physician who followed up, who administered the vaccine, denied that it was a vaccine adverse reaction. The parent had to go to a third physician to verify my diagnosis. And even when the result was overwhelming, the physicians want to avoid liability by never admitting they could have possibly harmed a child. I think this is a big problem. This is probably why vaccine adverse reactions are not reported to VAERS, because the physician doesn't want to admit that they may have harmed one of their patients. Dr. Katz. But under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program the physician is not liable. That's the whole point of the program, to take it out of the adversarial position of having to sue in a tort system. If the case is presented, it is sent to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. They have experts, whether they are neurologists or epidemiologists or pediatricians, depending on the particular type of case. They review it, and it is presented to a master. There is not the controversy. That was the whole point--not the whole point, but one of the points of the whole act, to take it out of the tort system and put it into something where parents and children would be treated fairly, whether they could afford a lawyer or not and whether they could get into the court system or not. Dr. Waisbren. This is the fatal error in your bill, if you will pardon me for telling you. Mr. Mica. It wasn't my bill. Mr. Waxman. Dr. Waisbren. Your brother's bill. The point is, when you take the responsibility away from the doctor and the hospital, the doctor is not forced to really think the thing over and he says, ``It's not going to hurt me.'' I would suggest that the bill be kept in, but that it should be clearly stated that the person could go to court. And I think it is in the bill to get justice if he feels the system did not work correctly. Mr. Mica. Dr. Katz is determined to get the last word in. Dr. Katz. Thank you, Mr. Mica. The physician is liable if what he commits is an act which is not within the recommendations of his State, his vaccine program. So that the physician can be sued if he has transgressed what is the recommended approach. On the other hand, the idea that the system allows the physician to get off stark free is inappropriate. If the case is heard before the Vaccine Injury Compensation Board and rejected, the family still has recourse to the tort system. It is just that they have to go to the compensation program first. Mr. Mica. I want to thank each of you for your testimony today. We have tried to conduct this in a responsible fashion. We have heard from representatives from the CDC, we have heard from representatives from the FDA. We have heard from Dr. Katz who is representing several very prestigious organizations. And we have heard from others. However, I do want to announce that I will keep the record open for at least--I'm going to keep the record open for 30 days, which is unusually long, for additional information. I know there are some controversial matters in this, but we want to make certain that the record is complete and balanced, and that we hear from folks. The reason for this hearing is not to excite anyone or as I said at the opening, to discourage anyone from vaccinating their children or anything of that sort. It's to, one, review the entire process. The law was passed in 1986. I wasn't here. I didn't pass the law. I didn't author the law. Once every 13 years we may look at these things whether we need to or not and then responsibly see that we are doing our job. Is the proper research being done? Is proper notice being given? Is the system working? And then also to hear from citizens. When a certain number of citizens want to be heard in a congressional process--and we do oversee the FDA and the CDC and MOPP--we have that responsibility. Without objection, I will leave the record open for 30 days for additional testimony or for input for the record. I thank each of you for your testimony today and excuse you at this time. Thank you. We have one final panel. That panel consists of Thelma Thiel, chairman and CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International. We also have Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center. This is our fourth and final panel today. I would like to welcome both of our witnesses. As I mentioned to our previous panelists, this is an investigation and oversight subcommittee of Congress. We do swear in our witnesses which I will do shortly, both Ms. Thiel and Ms. Fisher. We also ask that if you have a lengthy statement or additional information that you would like made part of the record, we will do that upon request. I would also ask you to limit your oral testimony to approximately 5 minutes. Again, I am pleased to welcome both of you, and if you could stand at this time and be sworn. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Mica. The witnesses answered in the affirmative and I am pleased to welcome to our subcommittee today our witnesses. First of all, we will hear from Thelma Thiel--I hope that I am pronouncing it right--chairman and CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International. You are recognized. STATEMENTS OF THELMA THIEL, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, HEPATITIS FOUNDATION INTERNATIONAL; AND BARBARA LOE FISHER, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL VACCINE INFORMATION CENTER Ms. Thiel. Thank you, Mr. Mica, for giving me this opportunity to share our concerns with you. I am representing 50,000 victims of hepatitis in this organization, plus 300 support groups with thousands of people who are concerned about this disease. I am also a registered nurse who lost a precious 4-year-old son 29 years ago to cirrhosis. I thought I would like to share with you some of the things that he endured with his cirrhosis. Because his liver was so badly damaged, even a bloody nose was a hemorrhage. When he tripped over a toy, he broke his hip, not once but twice. His tummy was terribly distended because he had an enlarged liver and spleen and excess fluid. His little arms and legs were scrawny because he couldn't metabolize proteins to build muscles. He was extremely jaundiced, almost to the point of looking green, but worst of all, he itched from head to toe, night and day. Can you imagine being in a body cast with a fractured hip and itching constantly? He asked me one day if I could take his foot off because it itched inside. Most people don't know that the liver is their internal chemical power plant, a very complex and noncomplaining organ that detoxifies everything that we eat, drink, breathe, and absorb through our skin. It helps us digest our food, stops cuts from bleeding and fights off infection. It makes hormones and muscles and maintains over 5,000 vital functions to keep us alive and alert. When this hepatitis virus gets into the blood stream through an open cut, a scratch, or a puncture with a contaminated sharp needle or an instrument such as those used in body piercing or tattooing that was previously used by an infected person, even in an abrasion of the mucus membrane or a splash of blood in the eye that could happen in the dentist's office, this virus makes its way to the liver. It quietly kills liver cells replacing them with scar tissue which is called cirrhosis. This virus can continue to assault the liver until there are so few good healthy liver cells remaining that the impact on body functions and healthy problems is devastated. I had a woman who called me because she had two children. She needed to put them in a daycare center. One of them had hepatitis B. When she told the daycare center, they wouldn't allow her to enter the child in the school. This mother had to go to work; and it was important that she get this child in daycare. She went to another daycare center, and didn't bother to tell them that the child was infected. Now, every time that child gets a bloody nose or scratch, everyone in that daycare center will be exposed to this insidious disease. I had a call the other day from a father who was very upset about his 13-year-old son, Rob. He had developed a severe case of diarrhea. There had been an E. coli outbreak, and he took him to a hospital. They did a thorough examination and found out that he had hepatitis B. He also had advanced cancer of the liver at the age of 13. The father was terribly distressed, however, because he wanted to know whether his child who was on the wrestling team, might possibly have infected other children. Occasionally they get bloodied up during a wrestling match. We advised him to tell the school. We also found out that his mom had hepatitis B and was a carrier and did not know it. Unfortunately, Rob had not been vaccinated at time of delivery. He had no signs or symptoms for 13 years with the potential to infect other children and now he was facing death. Hepatitis B is an insidious disease often called a silent killer largely because the liver is a noncomplaining organ. Individuals can have serious liver damage without any signs at all. With the estimated one and a quarter million carriers of hepatitis B in this country, how many of them are sitting in the classroom with your child or your grandchildren? Could a cut finger or a smear of blood on a page in a book shared with a classmate be a threat to your child? A little known fact is that the only treatment available for hepatitis B is chemotherapy. I can't imagine the guilt I would feel if my child became infected when he could have been vaccinated. If infected, he would have to go through chemotherapy given by injection for 6 months to a year, with only a 40 percent chance that he would have a positive response. If the treatment fails, they can develop cirrhosis and cancer of the liver, going through many of the horrible things that my son went through. The other option, of course, is a liver transplant. However, organs are in very short supply, and we also know that the virus that remains in the body attacks the new liver with a vengeance. Researchers are trying desperately to develop ways of controlling that virus, with limited success this process is very costly. Losing a child to an incurable liver disease is a heart- wrenching tragedy, but I can't imagine the overwhelming guilt that I would feel if my child became infected and I had had an opportunity to protect him and didn't. We who are well informed are aware of the risks that children can take. We don't always know when they are going to become sexually active. We have heard about children doing body piercing in the back room. We don't always know what risks they are taking. Many are not informed because there has been very little education to encourage our children to take responsibility for their own behaviors. Often their parents are uninformed. We have a long way to go, and we are depending on you to make certain that you weigh the scientific facts and the lives that will be saved by this vaccination against the unsubstantiated reports that we have heard today. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Mr. Mica. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared we will now hear from Barbara Loe Fisher, who is president of the National Vaccine Information Center. You are recognized. Ms. Fisher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Barbara Loe Fisher, and I am president of the National Vaccine Information Center, formerly known as Dissatisfied Parents Together, which I cofounded in 1982 with parents whose children had been injured or died from the adverse effects of the DPT vaccine. Our nonprofit organization represents tens of thousands of Americans, including families affected by vaccine reactions, healthcare professionals, and parents. We are working to prevent vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and to institute safety and informed consent protections in vaccination programs. Some of us worked with Congress in the early 1980's in a bipartisan effort to help create and pass the historic National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. One of our main goals was met in 1996 when a less reactive pertussis vaccine was licensed. I want to thank you, Representative Mica, for having the courage and the vision to hold this hearing. As you have heard, vaccine safety is an issue charged with emotion because whether death or disability is caused by a disease or a vaccine, the pain is the same. And when children are suffering and their parents are grieving for them, there are no words to make the pain go away. I think what is important at the end of the day is to acknowledge that we are all here because we love our children and we want to protect them from harm. We need to find ways to protect them from vaccine injury and death while we create public health policies designed to protect them from the ravages of disease. There is no reason why we cannot accomplish both of these goals if we embrace the principle that every child's life is important and no child is expendable. The National Vaccine Information Center has received hundreds of reports of injuries and deaths following hepatitis B vaccination. There is a clear pattern to hepatitis B vaccine reaction symptoms, just as there was a clear pattern associated with the DPT vaccine reactions, but unlike DPT vaccine where most symptoms usually occur within a few days of vaccination, hepatitis B vaccine reaction symptoms can take many days or weeks to develop and include fevers that come and go, open skin lesions and rashes, severe joint pain and head pain, loss of vision, muscle strength and memory and crushing, debilitating fatigue which leads to chronic disability. We have had reports of liver cancer developing in small children following hepatitis B vaccinations. There are families with two or three members who have become disabled after hepatitis B shots. Tragically, for newborns and babies under 2 months of age, a hepatitis B vaccine reaction can end in death. When parents look to the medical literature for answers, they find few studies looking into hepatitis B vaccine reaction reports. None deal with newborns. Most of the studies look at vaccine efficacy, not vaccine safety. A 1994 study by the Institute of Medicine, mandated by Congress under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, found that there have been no large controlled observational studies or clinical trials investigating clinical reports of arthritis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and other central demyelinating disease or sudden infant death syndrome after hepatitis B vaccination. What, then, will be the scientific criteria used to either award or deny children compensation for their hepatitis B vaccine-associated injuries under the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program? Serious questions remain about the quantity and quality of the scientific evidence used by Federal health agencies to license this vaccine for use in children and, in 1991, to recommend that all newborns receive their first dose just 12 hours after they take their first breath. Last Tuesday, I filed two detailed Freedom of Information Act requests with the FDA and the CDC to make this information a matter of public record. We hope this will lead to better public understanding of current standards used to license this first recombinant DNA vaccine and then recommend all newborn infants and children be required to use it. I will provide copies of what I receive from the CDC and the FDA to you, and I submit my FOIA requests as part of the record. Families with vaccine-injured children are trying to cope with the knowledge that they tried to do the right thing. They did what public health officials and doctors told them to do. Most of these children were exceptionally bright, healthy, and robust at the time of vaccination. They received a hepatitis B shot, and something went horribly wrong. In some cases, they were coerced into having more hepatitis B shots, even in the face of severe reactions because the push for a 100 percent vaccination rate has all but eliminated the right to informed consent when it comes to vaccination in America. This information sheet on hepatitis B produced by the Centers for Disease Control in compliance with safety provisions in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act does not come close to meeting the informed part of informed consent. Parents who want to make educated hepatitis B vaccine decisions for their children often are threatened when they even ask to delay vaccination if the child is sick. The lack of informed consent protections in mass vaccination programs is leading to fear and mistrust of the whole vaccination system. Bottom line, what we are hearing parents tell us is: show us the science and give us a choice. So we come before you today to ask for, first, an investigation into Federal health agency licensing and policymaking standards applied to the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine; and, second, consideration of special congressional appropriations to fund nongovernment, nonindustry conducted scientific research to identify genetic and other high-risk factors for reacting to hepatitis B vaccine; and, third, the institution of informed consent protections in current vaccine policies. Again, thank you, Chairman Mica and members of the committee, for demonstrating leadership by acknowledging these vaccine safety concerns, which is the first important step toward addressing them in a way that will save lives. You have listened and we are very grateful. [The prepared statement of thank both of you for your testimony. Ms. Fisher, you just testified that you felt the vaccine information sheets handed out on hepatitis B are inadequate as far as disclosing risks and benefits. What more can we do, or what more should we do, or what information should be included would be my first question? The second is, there are 16 States now that do allow sort of an opt-out. How would you go about changing that since you have a State-to-State requirement? Ms. Fisher. First, I would just like to read that the mild problems that are listed on this are soreness at the injectionsite and mild to moderate fever. The only severe problems listed are serious allergic reaction, and it says very rare. There is no description here of the kinds of symptoms that we have heard today. Mr. Mica. As far as severe, that is all that is on there? Ms. Fisher. Right. Serious allergic reaction they say is very rare. They describe serious allergic reaction as difficulty breathing, hoarseness, et cetera, which are symptoms of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs within a very short time period after a vaccination is given. So the people who testified today, who told you about these symptoms, they would be candidates for revaccination according to this vaccination sheet; and, in fact, this is part of the problem. We have heard from so many people who are being forced and threatened that they have to go forward with hepatitis B vaccinations, even after they have experienced fevers that come and go, skin lesions all over their body, severe joint pain, symptoms that--autoimmune symptoms and neurologic symptoms, and they are being ignored. Because there is this push for a 100 percent vaccination rate, these people are not being screened out. And they are not being given full information, and the doctors are not being given full information about what to look for after a hepatitis B vaccination. The manufacturers, frankly, in their product insert, have more of a description about some of the reactions that have been associated with the vaccine than this sheet. What I am concerned about, this sheet was mandated under this compensation program, and we fought very hard--the parents who were involved in the creation of the system, of which I was one, fought very hard for the safety provisions. And one of the safety provisions was that parents would get proper benefit and risk information prior to vaccination so they would know how to make informed decisions and also so they could monitor their children following vaccination for signs of a reaction so that revaccination would not take place and more serious reactions would occur that would end in disability and death; and we feel this is woefully inadequate. Mr. Mica. Ms. Thiel, do you want to respond? Ms. Thiel. Physicians have access to the drug insert. If they are giving the vaccination, they should be aware of those reactions. Also, the CDC puts out a publication called MMWR which identifies the fact that there should have been informed consent. There has been a great deal of effort on the part of the hepatitis B immunization programs and on the Internet to identify the fact that they should be asking the parents to sign consent forms. The Hepatitis Foundation International created a booklet that would go home with the consent forms to identify the importance of the liver, the importance of the vaccine, and some things parents should be concerned about. This has been an effective way of informing the parents of the benefits of the vaccine. Mr. Mica. What about the question of inadequate research that has been raised here today? Do you all have a position on that, Ms. Fisher? Ms. Fisher. First of all, there are two kinds of research that need to be done: basic science research that will look at biological mechanisms for hepatitis B vaccine-induced injury or death, which would include looking at what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the human body after the vaccination is given. The other concern is that this vaccine is often given with other vaccines. Part of my Freedom of Information Act request is that the CDC and the FDA go over the different studies that we would like to see that hopefully were done before this vaccine was recommended in 1991 for universal use in all children, particularly newborns. That would include such things as how many children were involved in these studies, the time periods for followup of vaccine adverse events. In the manufacturers' product insert, they list 4 to 5 day followup for studies that were used to license this vaccine, and yet the reactions we are seeing are taking sometimes longer than 4 to 5 days to occur. So have we missed in those studies, all of the people who testified here today? How good are those studies? Did they include racial diversity of infants and children enrolled in them? Particularly in light of what Dr. Dunbar said, if we have genetic predisposition here, if there are certain genotypes who are more susceptible to reacting to this vaccine than others and we have only done these studies in certain genetic populations, we don't really know what is going on. And when we give this vaccine and we mandate it and we haven't done the studies prior, it is an experiment and we cannot afford to do that. I think the FOIA requests are important to take a look at-- how was this vaccine licensed and policy made? But also, is the system that we use good enough or should we be raising these standards? Mr. Mica. Ms. Thiel, has your group taken a position as far as opting out of these vaccinations? Ms. Thiel. We feel very much if a person has an objection to being vaccinated, they have that right. Of course, it is going to be a problem if you get a lot doing that. You are going to have more exposure to other children if they are not vaccinated. Mr. Mica. But your group has basically supported the opt- out ability? Ms. Thiel. Right. Mr. Mica. One of the other questions that has come up in this hearing and also prior to the hearing is a review of the 1986 law and the access to compensation through that law for those who have some type of vaccine-related adverse reaction. You were involved in some of that, the development of that legislation, and I guess of monitoring, Ms. Fisher? Ms. Fisher. Yes. Mr. Mica. How do you feel about how that is working? Ms. Fisher. We are extremely disappointed in how this compensation program is being implemented. In fact, it is tragic. Those of us who came to the table in good faith in the early 1980's to work with Congress and work with the vaccine manufacturers and work with the American Academy of Pediatrics feel like we have been betrayed because three out of four children are being turned away from this system. And because all of the work we did, for example, to set up the table of compensable events for DPT vaccine injury and death so that this system wouldn't be like a trial and you wouldn't have to show the same type of proof and it wouldn't be expensive and traumatic--HHS came in and they gutted it. They gutted the provisions for awarding compensation for DPT vaccine injuries, and there is almost nothing now presumed to be associated with DPT vaccine. We were promised that it would be a fair alternative to the tort system, and we feel like we have been betrayed. And the fact that there is $1 billion in the trust fund is a disgrace because there are children out there who need that money because they have done what they were told to do by doctors and public health officials; and they are out there coping and suffering with vaccine injuries, and nobody is helping them because all the resources of HHS and Justice are brought against these plaintiffs. Justice represents Secretary Shalala in these cases, and it is not a level playing field. I think it is--we absolutely oppose the using of any of that billion dollars for anything other than compensating these children. The money for these studies needs to come out of the billions of dollars that are being given to HHS to fund new vaccine development and to set up tracking systems to track children in order to enforce vaccination and to promote vaccination. We have got to do a better job of looking at the existing vaccines that we have before we put other vaccines on the market, and we have to do a better job of taking care of the children who pay the price and are our casualties of our public health programs. Our children deserve no less. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Ms. Thiel, have you observed the operation of the compensation fund, and do you have any comments? Ms. Thiel. Well, I think it could be improved. I think we have to look at the fact that we have saved so many children and adults from the tragedies of this disease by having this vaccine that I think we have to continue. When you understand that we have given 10 million doses of the vaccine this year with a small number of adverse reactions that are very serious. I think we have to weigh the benefit to the masses against the unfounded concerns expressed. For years we were promoting vaccination for high-risk populations, mentioned earlier. This was an abysmal failure because we were not reaching those at high risk, many in urban areas. These are the children that are probably going to participate in high-risk activities. How can we protect them? We have to protect them when they are accessable, which is in the school system or requiring immunization before entering school. Otherwise, they will be missed. People continue being infected, with many developing serious cirrhosis of the liver and cancer. Children as young as 8 years of age have developed cancer of the liver having acquired this disease from their mothers, at the time of delivery. The baby's mucus membranes, in their eyes, nose, mouth, and genitals are exposed to infected blood through the birthing process. Because their immune systems are not fully developed, they have a 90 percent chance of developing the serious consequences of hepatitis B. There are major social factors related to hepatitis B infection. If, as a teenager, they become infected and go through the chemotherapy treatment and fail, they are going to remain infectious for the rest of their life. They must be concerned about infecting their sex partners if their partners are not vaccinated or immune. I think Barbara Hahn was very fortunate that her family did not become infected, because she was very careful of any blood or body fluid exposure that she had for her family. We also know that families living in the household with someone who is chronically infected is at higher risk of acquiring hepatitis B. I use the analogy in 1 teaspoon of blood for the AIDS virus, there are about 5 to 10 particles of the AIDS virus compared to 500 million of the hepatitis B virus. This gives you an idea of how infectious this disease is. Even blood on a dry surface can cause the transmission of hepatitis B to others. Ms. Fisher. I would like to say something to you Ms. Thiel, and I thank you very much for supporting the ethical concept of informed consent. I think this is really, really important because as you know, as a parent, you love your child more than anyone ever could. And when a child dies from a disease or from a vaccine, it is you, the mother and the father who lives with the consequences of that, and that is why the ethical principle of informed consent that is applied to every other medical procedure in this country that carries a risk of injury or death is so important to be applied to vaccination. We are not calling for the elimination of vaccine laws. We are calling for flexibility within the laws, a humane application of the laws. We are asking for the right to exercise conscientious belief exemption if we believe our children are at great risk of having a reaction. I come from a family of serious autoimmune disorders. My mother has lupus. I have one child who has reacted and has disabilities from a vaccination. How can the State possibly ask me to take a risk with another--a vaccine like this one--when I know that my children could either die or have autoimmune disorders from getting this vaccine? Parents have got to have the right to have the information and then make informed decisions for their children. Every parent wants their child to be healthy. They don't want their child to die from a disease or a vaccine. We have to believe that parents love their children. Ms. Thiel. I believe that we also have to receive informed consent. We also have to give them the information so they know how serious this disease can be to help them make an appropriate decision and not just respond emotionally to some of the misinformation they have been hearing about the adverse reactions. Ms. Fisher. I totally agree with you. Mr. Mica. Ms. Fisher, you advocated several specific recommendations. One was increased licensing standards; is that correct? Ms. Fisher. That's right. Mr. Mica. What are you talking about specifically? Ms. Fisher. The reason that I filed very detailed FOIAs with the CDC and the FDA on this was I was hoping--I don't know the answer to that question. I was hoping that the committee would help us get those answers and do a review of the licensing procedures and of the policymaking procedures. Mr. Mica. The other item you recommended was nongovernment studies. But if it is a recommendation to us, it is going to involve government moneys and we have a pretty--well, we have a pretty complex manner of funding studies that was made that way to keep the studies independent from undue outside influence. How can we have a nongovernmental study financed by government--I mean, do you have something specific in mind? Ms. Fisher. I am not really knowledgeable---- Mr. Mica. And then get an independent study. I think you are questioning the independence of these studies? Again, I don't see how we can accomplish that recommendation since it is government funding, the studies--unless you have some protection and barriers. Ms. Fisher. I am not knowledgeable about the grant structure at NIH, for example; but I understand there are some grants that are more independent. They are given to scientists, and they are more independent from control by the CDC or the NIH. I don't know exactly what they are called. But I understand that there are grants available where the--the problem is who is going to be on the peer review committee? Bonnie Dunbar has applied twice for an NIH grant to look at genetic predisposition to hepatitis B vaccine reactions. She has been a vaccine developer for 26 years. She knows what she is doing. You don't see these grants being given out to scientists who want to look at adverse effects. The grants are given out to develop new vaccines and look at the efficacy of vaccines, but not to look at clinical reports of adverse events to vaccines. The public is very suspicious of having industry and government be in total control of these scientific studies. And so, if there was a way to get the funding, and then have some autonomy. So yes, of course, to publish you have to be peer reviewed. I don't have the answers, but I would be happy to work with the committee to find one. Mr. Mica. Thank you. In conclusion, did either of you have any final recommendations, anything additional legislatively or administratively that we can promote to help address some of the problems we have heard described today? Ms. Thiel. Ms. Thiel. In response to---- Mr. Mica. This is additional. Ms. Thiel. The advisory committees that review the grants that are coming through have lay people on them--they are not just physicians who are reviewing these grant requests. They have very strict criteria to assess whether they are qualified and worthy of the funding that they receive. I think that there is a good review system there. Mr. Mica. Ms. Fisher. Ms. Fisher. We just touched on a few of the problems with the compensation program, the implementation of the National Childhood Injury Act, and I would just hope that we would have another opportunity to look at that program and talk about the issues surrounding that program. Mr. Mica. Thank you. Well, I would like to thank both of our panelists and everyone who participated today, our various witnesses, for their participation. As I said, we will leave the record open for 30 days. I have never extended the record that long; but since there is so much interest in this subject, we will accommodate additional interest for the record, and anyone interested should contact the subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources with their submission. Without objection, so ordered. There being no further business before the subcommittee, I will call this meeting adjourned, and I also will make an announcement here. There was a request for press availability after the hearing, and I will make a very brief statement here rather than go out to the Triangle. This meeting is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 2:34 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [Additional information "}
