Coming Soon Sign Up For the Next Upcoming Presentation! \"Understanding How Neurofeedback and a Healthy Gut Can Heal ADHD, Anxiety and More!\" OTHER SERVICES The practitioners at Body & Mind Consulting have significant experience working with whole-body approaches to care. Whole body health requires that the body and mind are aligned. Although pharmaceuticals and \"talk therapy\" can be beneficial we have found that these methods often fall short to address concerns that brought the individual to our office. Body changes are often missing. When one's body changes the mind can more readily integrate other parts of a person's approach to life. The result is integrative healing-oriented care that addresses aspects of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit).

Reviews are very helpful to our business! PATIENT REVIEWS AND FEEDBACK PATIENT REVIEWS AND FEEDBACK Dr. Webb is amazing at giving advice on how to handle different situations. Amazing listener and very good at explaining how to figure out certain behaviors or feelings one may be experiencing. R. B. I have been seeing Dr. Webb for some time now and cannot say enough about how grateful I am to have found her! She is professional and easy to talk to. She has established a warm and welcoming environment where you feel comfortable speaking freely. Dr. Webb is straightforward, which I LOVE! The receptionist is the sweetest! They are very accommodating and offer zoom sessions as well as in person. My daughter sees Dr Ledford which we have been happy with as well. I highly recommend this team! Ana D. I have not been to therapy in a long while and I really enjoyed the experience. I felt not only heard but also listened to. M. J. "}
