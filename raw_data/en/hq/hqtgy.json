Reasons why include that people with severe mental illness are more likely to smoke and be physically inactive as a result of social inequalities. Objectives: (1) Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of multiple risk behaviour interventions on behaviour change (e.g. smoking abstinence), and outcomes affected by behaviours (e.g. weight loss). (2) Compare the clinical effectiveness of interventions targeting multiple and single risk behaviours. (3) Examine the factors affecting outcomes (e.g. intervention content). (4) Assess the factors affecting experiences of interventions (e.g. barriers and facilitators). Data sources: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), MEDLINE, PsycInfo\u00ae(American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA) and Science Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) were searched from inception to October 2018, and an updated search was conducted in March 2020. An Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) search and an updated Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials search were undertaken in September 2020. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials targeting single or multiple health risk behaviours among people with severe mental illness were included. Qualitative evidence on factors affecting the effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions was included.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

The mean differences were estimated for continuous outcomes; if this was not possible, standardised mean differences were calculated. Thematic syntheses of qualitative studies were conducted. Results: A total of 101 studies (67 randomised controlled trials and 34 qualitative studies) were included. Most outcomes were smoking abstinence, weight and body mass index. Just over half of studies were rated as having a high overall risk of bias. Trials focusing on smoking alone led to greater abstinence than targeting smoking and other behaviours. However, heterogeneity means that other explanations cannot be ruled out. For weight loss and body mass index, single risk behaviour (e.g. physical activity alone) and multiple risk behaviour (e.g. diet and physical activity) interventions had positive but modest benefits. For example, any risk behaviour intervention led to a 2 kg greater weight loss ( -2.10 kg, 95% credible interval -3.14 to -1.06 kg) and approximately half a point (i.e. 0.5 kg/m2) greater body mass index reduction ( -0.49 kg/m2, 95% credible interval -0.97 to -0.01 kg/m2) than treatment as usual. There were potential synergies for targeting multiple health behaviours for reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. No evidence was found of a deterioration in mental health for people with severe mental illness engaging in interventions to reduce health risk behaviours. Qualitative studies found that people with severe mental illness favoured interventions promoting physical and mental health together, and that took their condition into account. However, trials focused mainly on promoting physical health. Limitations: Most quantitative studies focused on weight and body mass index; few assessed behavioural outcomes. Qualitative studies often addressed different aims. Conclusions: Multiple and single risk behaviour interventions were associated with positive but modest benefits on most outcomes. Interventions seeking to promote physical health were not associated with deterioration in mental health. There was a lack of overlap between quantitative and qualitative studies. Future work: Further research is needed to investigate whether or not health behaviour changes are maintained long term; tailoring weight-loss interventions for people with severe mental illness; and in terms of methods, co-production and mixed-methods approaches in future trials.

Many of us are unhealthy in several ways. Does tackling multiple health risks together lead to greater benefit? Intervention benefits This project reviewed 101 studies. Of these, 67 studies looked at the health benefits of interventions, and 34 studies asked about experiences of improving physical health. Just over half of these studies had important problems, so it may not be possible to trust their findings. Most health improvements were small. For example, people who took part in an intervention lost 2 kg more weight than those who did not receive an intervention. This weight loss is in line with the general population, but the starting weight of people with severe mental illness is often greater. Focusing on quitting smoking seems better than changing other behaviours (e.g. eating unhealthy food) at the same time. But more studies are needed. No evidence was found that trying to improve physical health worsened the mental health of people with severe mental illness. Experiences of interventions Interventions focused on promoting physical health. But people with severe mental illness preferred to manage mental and physical health together. People with severe mental illness should be more involved in future studies, as this would make the studies more relevant. People with severe mental illness also valued interventions that considered their mental he alth condition. Limitations Most studies looking at intervention benefits focused on weight and body mass index; few studies asked if people 's behaviour changed. There was also a lack of overlap between studies interested in intervention benefits and experiences of interventions. Conclusions Most health improvements were small. No evidence was found that people with severe mental illness trying to improve physical health made their mental health worse.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

We also need to see if people can maintain improvements long term. This may be difficult if people with mental health symptoms get worse or if they need to spend time in hospital.PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxScientific summary Background People with severe mental illness die 15 -20 years earlier than the general population and are two to three times more likely to experience long-term conditions. Health risk behaviours (e.g. smoking, physical inactivity) are associated with increased risk for developing long-term conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases). People with severe mental illness engage in multiple risk behaviours more frequently than the general population; for example, smoking prevalence is three times higher than in the general population. Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are also more likely. Reducing these health inequalities, the so-called 'mortality gap 'between people with severe mental illness and the general population, is a key priority for the NHS. Health risk behaviour interventions are a potentially important way to promote health among people with severe mental illness. But there are important questions relating to the evidence. For example, as most people with severe mental illness engage in more than one health risk behaviour, should we target the reduction of multiple risk behaviours in parallel (e.g. target two or more behaviours simultaneously), or target one behaviour at a time? Therefore, the aim of this review was to examine the clinical effectiveness of multiple risk behaviour interventions, compared with single risk behaviour interventions. We also aimed to identify 'active ingredients 'of these interventions, and to identify factors affecting the clinical effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions among people with severe mental illness using data from qualitative studies. Objectives The objectives were to: levaluate the clinical effectiveness of multiple risk behaviour interventions for behaviour change (e.g. smoking abstinence) targeted by the intervention, and for change in outcomes affected by these behaviours (e.g. weight loss) lcompare the clinical effectiveness of interventions targeting multiple and single risk behaviours on behaviour change and outcomes affected by these behaviours lexamine factors affecting outcomes, including intervention content and participant characteristics lassess what factors affect experiences of health risk behaviour interventions (e.g. barriers and facilitators) among people with severe mental illness. Methods Data sources We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), MEDLINE, PsycInfo\u00ae(American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA) and Science Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) in October 2018, and updated the search in March 2020. We searched Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), and conducted an updated Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials search, in September 2020.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Data extraction We categorised behaviour change techniques using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1. A risk-of-bias assessment of included randomised controlled trials was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. For included qualitative studies, quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitive studies and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) to assess the certainty of findings. Data synthesis Data from quantitative studies were analysed using network meta-analyses, which take into account all direct and indirect evidence within a network of interventions. Evidence proceeded in three stages. Model 1 investigated the clinical effectiveness of interventions targeting multiple and single health risk behaviours. Model 2 investigated if there were positive or negative synergies when interventions targeted multiple risk behaviours. Model 3 investigated the impact of behaviour change techniques on the clinical effectiveness of health risk behaviour interventions. Data from qualitative studies were analysed using thematic synthesis to identify recurring and em ergent themes, and were presented in a narrative synthesis. Initial coding was descriptive, remaining close to original reports and began without hierarchical structure. Translation of coding was iterati ve and analytical themes were developed through refining coding, comparing primary data with developing themes. We also investigated whether or not overall themes and subthemes from the synthesis of qualitative studies were investigated in quantitative data in a narrative synthesis. When qualitative and quantitative data overlapped, we assessed their relationship according to four categories: silence (no overlap ), partial agreement (complementary findings), agreement (coherence between quantitative and qualitative data) and dissonance (conflicting findings from quantitative and qualitative data). Results Quantitative data We identified a growing literature on smoking (eight trials were included in the narrative synthesis of smoking abstinence and seven trials for number of cigarettes smoked). Interventions focusing on smoking alone were more effective than controls in increasing the odds of abstinence, whereas studies targeting smoking in addition to other risk behaviours (e.g. unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and alcohol misuse) did not find evidence of increased abstinence. However, there was a great deal of conceptual heterogeneity, including the intensity of control groups and smoking interventions across trials. Data on reducing the number of cigarettes smoked varied widely between studies. For all other behavioural outcomes, data were limited. Just over half of included studies in the network meta-analysis were rated as having a high overall risk of bias.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxiiThe most reported outcomes were weight (30 trials included in the network meta-analysis) and body mass index (36 trials included in the network meta-analysis). Interventions targeting diet alone, physical activity alone or diet and physical activity concurrently all appeared to be effective in promoting weight loss (e.g. any intervention vs. treatment as usual: -2.10 kg, 95% credible interval -3.14 to -1.06 kg) and body mass index reduction (e.g. any intervention vs. treatment as usual: -0.49 kg/m2, 95% credible interval -0.97 to -0.01 kg/m2). The magnitude of weight loss and reduction in body mass index did not differ substantially between studies targeting diet or physical activity alone and studies targeting them concurrently. We also did not find evidence of positive synergies in targeting diet and physical activity to promote weight loss or reduction in body mass index. Improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol outcomes were modest (e.g. systolic blood pressure, any intervention vs. treatment as usual: -1.33 mmHg, 95% credible interval -3.13 to 0.44 mmHg). But, in contrast to the outcomes discussed previously, targeting multiple risk behaviours appeared to result in greater improvements. Targeting diet (e.g. systolic blood pressure: 0.25 mmHg, 95% credible interval -4.65 to 95% credible interval -5.58 to 4.76 mmHg) led to modest improvements, whereas effect estimates were higher in trials targeting diet and physical activity (e.g. systolic blood pressure: -1.64 mmHg, 95% credible interval -4.50 to 0.99 mmHg), and also in trials targeting diet, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking (e.g. systolic blood pressure: -2.26 mmHg, 95% credible interval -5.28 to 0.59 mmHg). This potentially reflects synergies in targeting multiple health behaviours in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Fewer data were reported on quality of life and mental health outcomes. We found no evidence that interventions aiming to reduce physical health risk behaviours in people with severe mental illness led to negative impacts on mental health (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score 0.03, 95% credible interval -2.56 to 2.65) or mental health-related quality of life (standardised mean difference -0.06, 95% credible interval -0.31 to 0.19). However, there was also no evidence that interventions promoted physical health-related quality of life (standardised mean difference -0.08, 95% credible interval -0.35 to 0.28). There was limited overlap between behaviour change techniques in included studies; this reduced our ability to assess the impact on clinical effectiveness and how behaviour change techniques interacted with one another. Goal-setting was associated with weight loss ( -2.22 kg, 95% credible interval -4.54 to -0.44 kg) and a reduction in body mass index ( -1.85 kg/m2, 95% credible interval -2.91 to -0.69 kg/m2). Instruction on how to perform the behaviour was also associated with weight loss ( -2.10 kg, 95% credible interval -3.42 to -0.45 kg) and a reduction in body mass index ( kg/m2, 95% credible interval -1.85 to -0.55 kg/m2). Self-monitoring of behaviour was associated with a reduction in body mass index ( -0.70 kg/m2, 95% credible interval -1.42 to 0.07 kg/m2), although it was not possible to rule out no benefit. Interventions focusing on delivery to individuals were more effective than group-delivered interventions on weight loss ( -2.70 kg, 95% credible interval -4.69 to -0.75 kg) reduction in body mass index -1.11 kg/m2, 95% credible interval -2.15 to Data were organised around four higher-tier themes: interaction of physical and mental health, motivational contexts for change, barriers to behaviour change, and experiences of interventions. All themes were rated to be of moderate certainty according to their Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) evidence profiles. Interaction of mental and physical health Engaging in health behaviours was reported to improve mental health and well-being, with mental health changes affecting the ability to engage in healthy behaviours.

There were also data reporting on 'self-medicating 'through smoking, alcohol use and drug use to manage mental health symptoms. Motivational contexts for behaviour change Holding on to a personal motivation was important, and reports varied from managing health and improving physical appearance, to working towards a positive future. Family and friends were an important source of social support and motivation, providing feedback and reinforcement of positive change. Interventions were interpreted as a safe and stable environment to create change from, offering accountability, which helped in making changes. Barriers to behaviour change Mental health symptoms affected the ability to engage with healthy behaviours, such as low mood and lack of motivation, challenging the ability to engage in physical activity. Social support from family and friends could also act as barriers, for instance encouraging engagement in alcohol use or unhealthy eating. A lack of social support was also a barrier to persevering with behaviour change. Environmental factors could act as triggers for unhealthy behaviours, such as living in group homes where peers shared their experiences of engaging in risk behaviours. Experiences of behaviour change interventions Tailoring interventions for people with severe mental illness was a prominent concern; it was suggested that tailoring could take the form of additional help in providing structure and organisation in the daily lives of participants. Interventions providing education and skills to promote healthy behaviours were also considered beneficial. Group interventions were helpful for building peer support and meeting others, and also as a point of comparison with others, which could be double-edged if used to police behaviour. Interventions that could adapt behaviour change according to needs, abilities and pr eferences were positively received. A wealth of data reported the impact of interventions reaching beyond health behaviours and into leading meaningful, active lives, which was highly valued in reports. Interventions also built confidence in the ability to make further positive changes beyond the intervention and in other aspects of life. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data The integrative synthesis generally showed limited overlap between qua ntitative and qualitative studies. Many of the themes in qualitative st udies, such as importance of interventions benefiting the person holistically, rather than specific health-related ou tcomes, were not directly a ddressed in quantitative studies. The lack of overlap between the quantitative a nd qualitative evidence may suggest the importance of people with severe mental illness contributing to the design and delivery of interventions. Such interventions may go some way to addressing the needs and preferences of people with severe mental illness, especially in relation to addressing both physical and mental health together. People with severe mental illness also valued interventions that took into account the challenges of their mental health condition. However, the quantitative data rarely reported on this. Quantitative and qualitative studies agreed on the importance of gaining knowledge and skills to live healthier lives. This theme from the qualitative literature was backed up by the component network meta-analyses that found that the behaviour change technique instruction to perform behaviour was associated with weight loss and reduction in body mass index. Limitations Most quantitative studies focused on weight and body mass index; few studies assessed behavioural outcomes. There was also a lack of overlap between quantitative and qualitative studies.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxivConclusions Implications for health care We found preliminary evidence that focusing on smoking alone may be more effective than targeting smoking along with other health risk behaviours, although heterogeneity in how studies were designed means confounding cannot be ruled out. The systematic review found no evidence that interventions promoting health behaviours were associated with deterioration in mental health symptoms or mental health-related quality of life. Group discussions and polls from our webinar suggested that this was a key finding. This was rated as the key implication for practice and was a common theme in discussions. Another key implication from the systematic review was the need for communication between staff and people with severe mental illness on the goals of health risk behaviour interventions. Qualitative data found that people with severe mental illness favoured holistic approaches to well-being that integrated the promotion of physical and mental health, whereas the quantitative data, mainly led by researchers and health-care professionals, consisted of trials focused on weight loss and smoking cessation. This may reflect important differences in the aims of such interventions between people with severe mental illness and professionals delivering interventions. In addition, this may reflect a distinction between how services are currently configured (i.e. physical and mental health care often treated separately) and how people with severe mental illness would like to receive their health care (i.e. integration of physical and mental health care). Future work The lack of overlap in findings between the quantitative and qualitative studies is an important gap. Therefore, more mixed-methods approaches are needed that include substantial input from people with severe mental illness in the design and evaluation of interventions. Identifying how best to adapt interventions for the needs of people with severe mental illness was the key research recommendation identified in our webinar poll, and a common theme in group discussions. Although qualitative data showed that people with severe mental illness valued the availability of choice and the potential adaptation of interventions, the trial data rarely investigated how best to tailor interventions (particularly in trials aiming to promote weight loss). A recent trial has shown the benefits of adapting smoking cessation interventions for people with severe mental illness. A qualitative investigation of adapting and tailoring interventions to people with severe mental illness would address a gap in the literature and inform any quantitative analyses. Benefits and consequences of interventions reach beyond the quantifiable, so a qualitative study could capture these effects. We also found few studies with follow-up data of 12 months post intervention, although current data suggest that, at 6 months 'follow-up, body mass index and weight loss are maintained. These findings need to be confirmed in future research assessing the long-term benefits of health risk behaviour interventions, as well as potential barriers, such as the impact of episodic depression and anxiety or periods spent as an inpatient in a psychiatric facility. We found few trials that directly compared interventions targeting multiple health risk behaviours with interventions targeting single health risk behaviours. Targeting smoking alone may be more effective than targeting smoking in combination with other behaviours. Future research is needed to clarify which combinations of behaviours to target for interventions.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Smoking is the single largest directly avoidable cause of death in the UK, and a major cause of respiratory disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease.1Physical inactivity and unhealthy diet are strongly associated with weight gain, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.2Excessive alcohol consumption is also associated with greater risk for cancer, liver disease and cardiovascular disease.3Drug use is associated with greater risk of developing human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C and tuberculosis infections.4 There is good evidence, both in the UK and internationally, that health risk behaviours cluster.5 The majority of adults report engaging in two or more risk behaviours, and approximately one-quarter engage in three or more risk behaviours.6A 2017 Norwegian population-based cohort study7of >30,000 participants found a -response relationship between number of risk behaviours and all-cause mortality (i.e. increase in risk of all-cause mortality of 1.55-fold for two behaviours, 2.26-fold for three behaviours and 3.16-fold for four behaviours). There was a similar dose -response effect for risk of stroke in a large UK study of >20,000 participants: the relative risks for people who engaged in four risk behaviours were 2.31 when compared with people who engaged in no risk behaviours, 2.18 when compared with people who engaged in one risk behaviour, 1.58 when compared with people who engaged in two risk behaviours and 1.15 when compared with people who engaged in three risk behaviours.8There is strong evidence that social and health inequalities are associated with engaging in multiple risk behaviours. People in the UK who do not complete secondary school or who have an unskilled occupation are three to five times more likely to engage in multiple risk behaviours.9 Multiple risk behaviour interventions in general populations were associated with small reductions in smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, but there is currently insufficient evidence for reductions in alcohol and drug use.10In addition, small benefits were found in terms of reductions in weight, blood pressure and total cholesterol in the general population.10 Health risk and inequalities in severe mental illness populations Preventing long-term conditions has been a key policy priority for some time, and people with severe mental illness (SMI) constitute a particularly vulnerable subgroup of the population. Risk of cardiovascular mortality is two to three times higher in people with SMI11and life expectancy is 15 -20 years lower than that of the general population.12This substantial risk is probably driven and sustained by complex interactions between social inequalities13, genetics, neurobiology, psychosocial impairment and symptoms associated with SMI,14side effects of medication15,16and a lack of access to physical and mental health interventions.13 Smoking is the largest cause of premature mortality in the UK, and the biggest contributor to health inequalities among people with a mental health condition.17Therefore, it is particularly concerning that smoking is up to three times as prevalent in SMI populations than the general population, and even higher in certain subgroups (e.g. mental health inpatients). Although the prevalence of smoking in the general population has reduced by one-quarter in the past 25 years, the change in prevalence for smoking among people with a mental health condition in the same period is negligible.1This means that 42% of all cigarettes in the UK are now smoked by people with a mental health condition,1who have been shown to lose, on average, 17 years of life as a result of tobacco smoking.18DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

For example, a systematic review estimated an average 12-kg weight increase in the first 24 months of taking antipsychotics.21Similarly, Kahn et al.22found that people with first-episode psychosis experienced a 7% increase in body weight during the first year of treatment. However, it should also be noted that, although antipsychotic use may increase risk of cardiovascular disease, there is also evidence that antipsychotic use overall may be associated with improvements in mortality in people with schizophrenia.23 People with SMI are also substantially more likely to engage in substance use. A large US study of >20,000 participants found that people with psychosis were four times more likely to engage in heavy alcohol use, cannabis use and use of other recreational drugs.24A UK study found that 30% of people with first-episode psychosis engaged in illicit drug use, 25% engaged in both alcohol misuse and illicit drug use and 10% engaged in excess alcohol consumption.25 People with SMI are more likely to engage in multiple health risk behaviours. For example, in one study, on average, people with SMI were found to engage in five risk behaviours.26Therefore, an important question is whether to target these risk behaviours concurrently (i.e. multiple risk behaviour interventions) or to focus on a particular behaviour alone (i.e. single risk behaviour intervention). Why this research is needed Reducing risk behaviours in people with SMI is a clear priority for the NHS. These aims relate to wider initiatives such as the Mental Health Taskforce 'sFive Year Forward View for Mental Health ,27 which highlights the importance of integrating physical and mental health care. However, there are key evidence gaps that are important in informing practice: lMost people with SMI engage in multiple risk behaviours -a key question is whether interventions should target multiple risk behaviours in parallel or target single behaviours. lThe importance of investigating factors that are likely to influence the clinical effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions in this population (e.g. intervention delivery, frequency) has been recognised. Multiple compared with single risk behaviour interventions There are several systematic reviews that have focused on the effectiveness of interventions among people with SMI for particular behaviours: smoking,28unhealthy diet and/or physical activity.29-31 Despite a relatively developed literature of primary studies in this area, to our knowledge, there are currently no systematic reviews specifically focused on multiple risk behaviour interventions in people with SMI. It is not possible from current systematic reviews to delineate the benefits of focu sing on a particular risk behaviour, compared with targeting multiple behaviours concurrently, in a SM I population. Risk behaviours cluster; therefore, it is important to question whether services should seek to re duce risk behaviours in parallel or to target risk behaviours one at a time, as interventions to promote ch ange in a health risk behaviour have important implications for engaging in other behaviours. For ex ample, our systematic review of multiple risk behaviour interventions in general populations10found that changes in diet were positively associated with changes in physical activity, and that both, in turn, wer e associated with increased weight loss. This is consistent with evidence from qualitative studies; fo r example, people with diabetes reported that improvements in physical activity acted as a 'gateway 'to changes in diet.32 Conversely, changing some risk behaviours may have negative consequences for engaging in others.BACKGROUND NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk2Identifying 'active ingredients 'of risk behaviour interventions Behaviour change interventions are typically complex with multiple interacting components. Therefore, behaviour change technique taxonomies (BCTTs) have been developed to help identify the effective components in these interventions to help inform future research [e.g. which behaviour change tech niques (BCTs) should be included in future trials] and implementation in services.33We are unaware of any systematic reviews that have investigated the impact of intervention content using these methods in SMI populations. Qualitative studies on barriers to and facilitators of change and experiences of risk behaviour interventions There is an important need to synthesise qualitative data on the experiences of people with SMI to inform interpretation of the quantitative data and future trial design. For example, qualitative data are important for identifying barriers to and/or facilitators of behaviour change. This enables us to compare which barriers or facilitators were addressed in trials and to identify intervention content for future trials. Similarly, we can compare the extent to which the reported experiences of people with SMI in the qualitative data reflect findings from the quantitative data. As far as we are aware, this is the first systematic review to have synthesised this literature specifically focused on multiple risk behaviour interventions, especially in a SMI population.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Objectives We aimed to provide a comprehensive and objective summary of available primary research about the clinical effectiveness of health risk behaviour interventions in people with SMI. More specifically, the objectives of the systematic review were to: lprovide a descriptive overview of all the evidence for multiple health risk behaviour interventions on behaviour change (e.g. fat intake, smoking abstinence) targeted by the intervention, and change in outcomes affected by these behaviours [e.g. weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure] lexamine the clinical effectiveness of multiple risk behaviour interventions, compared with single risk behaviour interventions, using network meta-analyses (NMAs), in terms of their impact on b ehavioural outcomes (e.g. smoking abstinence) and outcomes affected by changes in behaviour (e.g. weight, BMI). lexamine the effect of study-level intervention content (e.g. using BCTTs) and participant char acteristics (e.g. targeted by study for physical comorbidities) as moderators of effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions using meta-regression and component NMAs. lexplore, through qualitative evidence, factors affe cting the clinical effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions (including barriers and facilitators) for people with SMI. Literature searches Searches were carried out i n October 2018 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE(Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), MEDLINE, PsycInfo\u00ae(American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA) and Science Citation Index (Clar ivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). The date range searched was inception to October 2018. The searches identified 27,795 records, which was reduced to 18,513 records after deduplication using EndNote (Clarivate Analytics) bibliographic software. Updated searches were carried out in March 2020 in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and the Science Citation Index; these identified a further 2822 records, which was reduced to 1433 records after deduplication. It was not possible to download records from CENTRAL owing to issues with the database at the time of the updated search (28 March 2020). We sea rched Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) (date range inception to September 2020), and conducted an updated CENTRAL search in September 2020. The updated search of CENTRAL identified a further 1843 records, which was reduced to 1579 after deduplication. The search of ASSIA identified 658 re cords, which was reduced to 151 after deduplication. The strategies used for both the original and updated searches are reproduced in Appendix 1 . Study selection Population Adults (aged 18 years) diagnosed with SMI (defined as schizophrenia or other psychoses, depression with psychotic features, or bipolar disorder) were included. Interventions aimed at people with SMI who were overweight or obese, had long-term conditions or risk factors for long-term conditions (e.g. high blood pressure, high cholesterol) were also included.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

For some health risk behaviours (e.g. smoking, excess alcohol consumption, opioid use), pharmacological treatment may be a component of standard care. When this was the case, behavioural interventions in combination with standard pharmacological interventions were included. However, studie s were excluded if they primarily aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. Single health risk behaviour interventions were included if they aimed to change one of the following risk behaviours: smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption or drug use. Multiple health risk behaviour interventions were included if they aimed to change two or more of these behaviours. Comparators lNo intervention. lTreatment as usual (TAU). lTreatment as usual with additional active control elements (e.g. attention control). Outcomes For quantitative studies, we included data on the following outcomes: lchanges in behaviours directly targeted by the intervention (smoking, diet, physical activity, alcohol use, drug use) lanthropometric measures [weight (kg), BMI] lmetabolic outcomes (systolic blood pressure, diastol ic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol) lquality of life lmental health symptoms. Study designs For the clinical effectiveness analyses, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In addition, we included qualitative studies assessing the experiences of behaviour change in people with SMI (including barriers and facilitators). Methods of effectiveness review and meta-analysis Data extraction and screening Data extraction, screening and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer if necessary. The data extraction form was piloted on a selection of studies by three reviewers to ensure consi stency. Data from multiple publications of the same study (or data set) were extracted and reported as a single study. When there were data from multiple time points, we grouped these data into the following categories: end point, 6 months post intervention, 6 -12 months post intervention, and 12 months post intervention.METHODS OF EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW, META-ANALYSIS AND QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk6Two reviewers extracted information about the content of each intervention and control, including which risk behaviours were targeted, whether the choice of risk behaviour was fixed or tailored to the individual, background/expertise of the intervention provider, mode of delivery (e.g. group or individual focused), intensity of intervention (duration of sessions, duration of intervention, etc.), setting (e.g. outpatient, inpatient), and adaptation of content for people with SMI. BCTs were categorised using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTT v1).33 The participant characteristics extracted included men tal health diagnoses, whether or not the intervention was given at first initiation of antipsychotics, antipsychotic use (proportion of participants receiving antipsychotics, and which type of antipsychotic), physical health comorbidities, age, sex and ethnicity. Risk-of-bias assessment The risk of bias of the individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 for RCTs.34As per recommendations, we conducted separate risk-of-bias assessments for the key outcomes: the most widely reported behavioural outcomes (smoking abstinence) and the most widely reported outcomes affected by behaviour (weight and BMI). Data analysis All analyses were performed in a Bayesian framework with a random-effects model using WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK),35taking into account the correlation between multiarm trials when appropriate. However, when there were sparse networks (and potentially insufficient data to reliably estimate between-study heterogeneity), we compared the goodness of fit of fixed-effect and random-effects models and used data from the better-fitting model. When both models fitted equally well, we selected the simpler model. A binomial likelihood was used for dichotomous data and a normal likelihood for continuous data. We assumed a common between-study heterogeneity variance of the relative treatment effects for every treatment comparison. We used vague prior distributions for trial baselines, heterogeneity and relative treatment effects. For WinBUGS code (including prior distributions), see WinBUGS code for models (see the National Institute for Health Research Journals Library projects web page; URL: www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/programmes/hsdr/170588/#/). Network geometry for NMAs was illustrated using network diagrams (see Appendix 7 ). We assessed convergence of two chains based on visual inspection of history, Brooks -Gelman -Rubin and autocorrelation plots. Network meta-analysis enables the estimation of indirect comparisons not addressed in the primary trials.36Such analyses assume consistency in the evidence network between indirect and direct evidence. Unfortunately, few trials compared single or multiple risk behaviour interventions directly; therefore, there were insufficient data to assess the consistency of direct and indirect evidence. Intervention effects were estimated along with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Continuous outcomes were usually pooled mean differences (MDs) on natural units such as number of cigarettes, weight (kg), BMI (kg/m2) and blood pressure (mmHg). Some outcomes, such as physical activity and alcohol use, were measured in various ways across studies, so we used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to analyse these data. The analysis proceeded in three stages. Model 1: intervention effects model Across studies, interventions targeted a range of single (e.g. unhealthy diet alone, physical inactivity alone) or multiple health risk behaviours (e.g. unhealthy diet and physical inactivity). We used NMAs to assess the effectiveness of targeting these different combinations of risk behaviours.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Therefore, we extended the model to include covariates estimating the association between these participant and intervention characteristics and intervention effectiveness. Model 1a: effectiveness of targeting different combinations of risk behaviours 1. Targeting any risk behaviour. We used a random-effects NMA model to compare any health risk behaviour intervention with TAU. Studies with TAU with additional active components (hereafter referred to as TAU +)a sa comparator were also included in the network to inform estimates. 2. Targeting combinations of risk behaviours. We used a similar random-effects NMA model, as model 1a:1, but, instead of comparing any intervention with TAU, we assessed the impact of targeting different health risk behaviours compared with TAU. Model 1b: impact of intervention and participant characteristics Second, we assessed the impact of intervention and participant characteristics on effectiveness estimates by adding the following covariates to model 1a: lparticipants selected for physical comorbidities delivered (yes/no) lintervention setting (inpatient or not inpatient) lauthors reported tailoring the intervention for people with SMI (yes/no). We assessed the impact of these intervention and participant characteristics by assessin g the magnitude of the covariate estimate, along with its 95% CrI. In addition, we conducted a more global assessm ent, comparing the goodness of fit of model 1b with covariates and model 1a without covariates in terms of deviance information criterion (DIC), total residual deviance and between-study standard deviati on (SD). Model 2: does targeting multiple risk behaviours lead to positive or negative synergies (interaction model)? Model 1 gives some insight into the benefits of targeting different combinations of risk behaviours. But it does not directly assess whether or not targeting multiple risk behaviours leads to positive or negative synergies (e.g. does targeting diet and physical activity together result in greater or fewer benefits than expected from the sum of their effects?). There were sufficient data to conduct interaction models for weight and BMI models only. We used a components NMA approach,37where \u00b5jis the mean weight (kg) or BMI (kg/m2) for the TAU group biin trial j.jkis mean weight (kg) or BMI for any risk behaviour intervention kfrom trial j: jk=n\u00b5j, bj jkNormal ( dkdbj),2/C0/C1.

(3) Model 2 allowed for each component to have its own independent impact on the MD. For example, targeting diet and physical activity together may each have contributed separately to reductions in weight or BMI. The model also allows components to interact with each other. For example, targeting diet and physical activity may lead to greater reductions (positive synergies) in weight or BMI than would be expected by the sum of these components. Model 2 also allowed for lesser reductions in weight or BMI than would be expected if the components were summed (negative synergies). We did not include targeting alcohol or smoking as separate effects as all interventions in the analyses targeting one of these behaviours also targeted diet and physical activity: dk=ddiet+dPA+ddiet\u00d7PA+ddiet\u00d7PA\u00d7smoking \u00d7alcohol, (4) where PA=physical activity. Model 3: effectiveness of behaviour change techniques Risk behaviour interventions vary not only in terms of which behaviours are targeted, but also in terms of the BCTs included in these interventions. We therefore fitted models that classified interventions in terms of BCTs (using the BCTT v1).33We fitted two models and compared them in terms of goodness of fit (total residual deviance, between-study SD and DIC). As above, there were sufficient data to conduct these analyses for only weight and BMI. Model 3a: additive model (independent model) Similar to model 2, we fitted a model that allowed each BCT to have an independent impact on the MD ( dk) between any risk behaviour intervention compared with TAU. The BCTs included in the weight and BMI models were largely the same, but with slight variation, depending on what studies reported these outcomes. For weight, the following BCTs were independent components contributing to the MD between any intervention and TAU: dk=dgoal+dprob+dfeedback+dmon+dsocsup+dinst+dinfo+ddemonst . (5) For BMI, the following BCTs contributed to the MD between any intervention and TAU: dk=dgoal+dprob+dfeedback+dmon+dsocsup+dinst+dinfo+daction. (6) The models included a total of nine v1: 1.1 2.2 feedback ( 'feedback '), 2.3 self-monitoring of behaviour ( 'mon '), 3.1 social support (unspecified) ( 'soc_sup '), 4.1 instruction on how to perform a behaviour ( 'inst '), 5.1 information about health consequences ( 'info ') and 6.1 demonstration of the behaviour ( 'demonst ')] that were used in at least five studies. Model 3b: two-way interaction model (interaction model) We extended model 3a to allow for pairs of BCTs to interact with one another. There was little overlap between BCTs used across studies, which limited the extent to which we could explore interactions.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Quality assessment Established guidelines by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group [www.gradeworkinggroup.org (accessed 3 February 2020)] and the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group [cqim.cochrane.org (accessed 3 February 2020)] were followed, to implement the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual)38 approach to assess both the methodological limitati ons of individual studies and the coherence of our review findings. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool [https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/ (accessed 3 February 2020)] was used to assess limitations of the methods used in included studies, per GRADE -CERQual guidance. The CASP tool is not a rating system, but facilitated transparent assessment across 10 prompts relating to the quality of the design and reporting of studies. Each prompt on the checklist was answered with a 'no','yes ',o r 'cannot tell '.'Cannot tell 'was allocated when authors 'reporting did not allow reviewers to make a clear decision. The CERQual approach is similar to GRADE in that both approaches aim to assess the certainty of (or confidence in) the evidence, and both also rate this certainty for each finding across studies, rather than for each individual study. Unlike GRADE, which is only relevant to evaluations of effectiveness, CERQual offered a framework to evaluate the certainty of evidence that addresses questions beyond effectiveness of interventions, such as acceptability. Coherence of the review was assessed by identifying patterns across the data contributed by each of the individual included studies, for example wh en findings are consistent across multiple settings or different subgroups of people with SMI. The certainty of evidence in each individual study was rated as being high, moderate or low, and ranked according to the methodological limitations and coherence of each finding of our review. Data analysis Papers were read in detail to identify core ideas for comparison across studies based on quotations from participants. Interpretations from authors of the included studies were not extracted unless required to contextualise an abbreviated quotation from a participant.METHODS OF EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW, META-ANALYSIS AND QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk10Drawing on guidance for qualitative syntheses to inform policy-making and research prioritisation, a narrative synthesis approach was used.39This approach gave a descriptive account that forms the basis of an interpretative synthesis. Published data were analysed using principles of thematic synthesis, as described by Thomas and Harden,40to facilitate the identification of recurring and emergent themes. Themes within and between transcripts were categorised, with iterative classification, development and refining of categories.41 Initial line-by-line coding of participant quotations was undertaken in NVivo version 12 (QSR International, Warrington, UK) by one reviewer, and data extraction was a function of coding. The data could be used to support the development of different, but overlapping, themes. Initial coding was descriptive, re maining close to original reports and began without hierarchical structure. Translation of codings was iterative. Analytical themes were developed through further refinement of coding, comparing primary data with developed themes. This process was repeated within themes to draw out subthemes. A second reviewer helped reduce repetition and overlap, thereby producing more focused themes. Greater emphasis was placed on studies with in-depth examinations of user experience. Studies that lacked this detail were used to augment and contextualise the findings. The relative contribution of individual studies, the impact of methodological limitations and certainty on the findings were su mmarised narratively, in line with the CERQual approach. Methods for integrating quantitative and qualitative data There remains a lack of consensus on the most appropriate methods for integrating quantitative and qualitative data. Our approach used methods commonly used in systematic reviews that were also appropriate for the nature of our data.42,43 The overall themes and subthemes identified in the synthesis of qualitative studies were used as the basis for examining whether or not the findings from the quantitative data approximated those found in the qualitative data. For example, when a particular factor was identified as a barrier or facilitator in the qualitative data, we examined whether or not intervention content seeking to address this barrier or facilitator affected the effectiveness estimates using meta-regression analyses (based on the magnitude of the covariate and precision of the 95% CrI). If these meta-regression analyses were unplanned, we conducted these analyses post hoc, when possible. For each theme, we investigated whether or not we could identify an analogue of this theme in the included quantitative studies. We then categorised the relationship between findings from the qualitative and quantitative data according to four categories adapted from a recent study:44silence (no overlap between quantitative and qualitative data), dissonance (conflicting findings), partial agreement (complementary findings, but limited overlap) and agreement (convergence in the data). However, when there was overlap in quantitative and qualitative findings, but the data were insuf ficiently precise to categorise, the finding was labelled inconclusive. Methods for patient and public involvement People with lived experience of SMI and carers contributed significantly to all stages of the project. Sophie Corlett (Director of External Relations, Mind) was a member of our advisory group that provided oversight on the progress of the project.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

One group began meeting in York and consisted of four members. The group was chaired by a relative of a person with SMI (DS), and also included one peer researcher (CD) and a peer researcher who is also a carer (HK). One further group member (a carer) was no longer able to attend after the first meeting because of other commitments. We also regularly met with two peer researchers (MS and GJ) who are members of the Lived Experience Research Collective hosted by the Mental Health Foundation. All the members of our PPI groups were included as authors of the report, reflecting their substantial contribution to the project. The PPI groups decided on the name of the project (HEALTH study), provided extensive comments on the protocol, contributed to interpretations of the study results, played a key role in disseminating the findings of the project, participated in the webinar and provided feedback on an animation summarising the findings of this project.

The date range searched was inception to October 2018. The searc hes identified 27,795 records, which reduced to 18,513 records after deduplication using EndNote bibliographic software. Updated searches were carried out in March 2020 using EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and the Science Citation Index; these identified a further 2822 records, which reduced to 1433 after deduplication. An updated search of CENTRAL in September 2020 identified a further 1843 records, reduced to 157 9 after deduplication. A search of ASSIA in September 2020 identified 658 records, reduced to 151 after deduplication (the date range searched was inception to September 2020). An additional record was located through reference-checking. Therefore, 21,677 titles and abstracts were screened in total. Of these, 436 full-text records were then double-screened, and 276 were subsequently excluded, as summarised in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram in Figure 1 .

Of these, 67 were RCTs included in the effectiveness review,45-111 and 34 studies (reported in 36 records) using a qualitative study design were included in the review of qualitative studies.112 -147 Characteristics of the randomised controlled trials included For detailed summaries of population characteristics of included RCTs, see Appendix 3 ; for detailed summaries of intervention characteristics, see Appendix 4 . Descriptions of the interventions are provided inAppendix 5 . The majority were conducted in the USA 81,83,84,89,95,96,103,105,10 8,111) and the and Brazil ( n=145). Of the included trials, 43 investigated multiple health risk behaviour interventions, and 24 investigated single health risk behaviour interventions. Risk behaviours were mostly targeted in pairs ( n=33), with few studies targeting three or more risk behaviours ( n=10). The most commonly targeted risk behaviours were physical inactivity ( n=48 studies) and unhealthy diet ( n=41 studies), which were also commonly targeted in combination. Across included studies, the most commonly reported BCTs were instruction on how to perform behaviours (emotional) (BCTT v1: 3.3; n=10). The totals reported here are much greater than the number of included studies as most interventions used several BCTs. For details of all BCTs reported across studies, see Appendix 4 . Fifty-two RCTs were included in the meta-analysis (see Figure 1 ).45-49,54-56,59-64,67-70,72-76,78-87,89-91,93,94,96-99,101,102,104-111 Characteristics of the qualitative studies included The flow of studies can be seen in the PRISMA diagram in Figure 1 . Thirty-four studies (from 36 reports) were included;112 -147three records were based on the same cohort and so represent one study,126 -128and four conference abstracts were also included in the systematic review, but not in the synthesis, owing to limited data.112 -115Therefore, 30 studies were included in the synthesis. Included studies used qualitative designs such as interviews and focus groups, and applied qualitative data analysis techniques such as the interpretative phenomenological approach and thematic analysis. Further details on population characteristics and study designs can be found in Appendix 6 . Multiple risk behaviours were considered in 18 -131,134,138,142 Multiple risk behaviours in pairs (14/18 studies);116,117,122,126,132,133,135 -137,140,141,145 -147the most common combination of risk behaviours was physical activity and diet (11 studies).116,117,122,126,135,137,140,141,145 -147 Two studies139,143 addressed risk behaviour outcomes in a way that did not appropriately fit with the risk behaviour targets of this review and, therefore, were classified as 'other '. One considered health promotion (classified as a multiple risk intervention)143and the other considered weight loss (also classified as a multiple risk behaviour intervention).139The most commonly addressed single risk behaviour was physical activity (6/11 studies).118 -120,124,125,134 SeeAppendix 6 for further details.SEARCH RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk14Chapter 4 Results of effectiveness review Summary of network meta-analyses results Model 1: intervention effects models Network diagrams for all outcomes are provided in Appendix 7 . Although most trials aimed to change behaviour, few studies directly reported behavioural data. Weight and BMI were, by far, the most commonly reported outcomes. Smoking-related outcomes (quit rates and number of cigarettes smoked) were the most common behavioural outcomes reported. However, these data were too heterogeneous to combine in NMAs, so we conducted narrative syntheses for smoking outcomes. There were insuffici ent data to conduct NMAs of multiple and single risk behaviour interventions (i.e. model 1a:2) for diet, physical activity, alcohol use and cannabis use outcomes. Table 1 summarises the results of the NMAs (model 1a) where it was possible to assess the clinical effectiveness of multiple and single risk behaviour interventions. All models converged after 20,000 iterations. Effect estimates are based on a further 60,000 iterations after discarding earlier iterations.

Figure 2 summarises the risk-of-bias judgements across studies measuring smoking abstinence. Just over half of included studies in the NMA were rated as having a high overall risk of bias. The most common reason for studies being judged to have a high risk of bias was missing outcome data (e.g. uncerta inty over whether or not missing data depended on the outcome 's true value). Bias arising from the randomisation process was the next most common risk of bias (e.g. allocation concealment not reported and important baseline differences between groups). Given the diversity of the data, we conducted narrative syntheses rather than NMAs on smoking abstinence. Five trials targeted smoking alone.46,55,68,69,148 Controls ranged from very low intensity46 and low intensity69,148 to high intensity.55,68Interventions in all five trials were high intensity. Four of these trials found that interventions targeting smoking alone may be more effective tha n controls (Figure 3 ) in promoting smoking abstinence.46,55,69,14 8Odds ratios (ORs) for these studies ranged from 1.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 2.82]69to 5.99 (95% CI 0.64 to 55.94),55but effect estimates were imprecise for all studies. One trial68targeting smoking alone did not favour the intervention over the control, although the CI was very wide (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.58). This trial included a high-intensity control, which may potentially explain different effects, compared with other included studies .TABLE 1 Model 1a: interventions compared with TAU at the end point -effect estimate (95% CrI) ( continued ) Risk behaviours 0.01 pressure.

ORs ranged from 1.05 to 1.09, suggesting that there may be no difference between intervention and control in promoting smoking abstinence, although 95% CIs were consistent with both increased and reduced odds. Number of cigarettes smoked Seven trials47,55,59,67,69,73,148 were included in the narrative synthesis for assessing the number of cigarettes smoked. There was a high level of variability between studies ( Figure 4 ). Similar to Smoking abstinence , trials focusing on smoking along with other risk behaviours showed limited evidence of effectiveness in reducing the number of cigarettes smoked. Trials focusing on smoking alone found mixed evidence for reducing the number of cigarettes smoked. Two studies found evidence of effectiveness in reducing number of cigarettes,55,59whereas two other studies did not.69,148 Cannabis Four trials, with 716 participants providing data, were included in the NMA on cannabis use.47,49,67,74 Each trial targeted a different combination of risk behaviours: alcohol, drugs or both;49diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol;47physical activity, smoking and alcohol;73and smoking, diet, physical activity, alcohol, any drug use.67 Therefore, there were sufficient data to only compare any intervention with TAU at the end point.

PA, physical activity.RESULTS OF EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk18Goodness of fit was acceptable for the model (total residual deviance was 3.14 data points, compared with 4 data points). There was no evidence that interventions reduced cannabis use (SMD -0.05, 95% CrI -0.25 to 0.15). However, CrIs were relatively wide, indicating uncertainty about this effect estimate. Alcohol misuse Five trials (731 participants) were included in the NMA on alcohol use.47,49,67,73,78 Trials targeted a range of combinations of risk behaviours: alcohol alone;78alcohol, drugs or both;49diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use;47physical activity, smoking and alcohol use;73and smoking, diet, physical activity, alcohol use and drug use.67 There were sufficient data to only compare any intervention with TAU at the end point. Goodness of fit was acceptable for the model (total residual deviance was 5.25 data points, compared with 5 data points) and the between-study SD was 0.36 (95% CrI 0.02 to 2.01, SMD scale). There was no evidence that interventions reduced alcohol misuse (SMD 0.14, 95% CrI -0.71 to 1.00). CrIs were very wide, indicating considerable uncertainty about this effect estimate. Physical activity Seven trials45,67, 86,89, 105,109,149 reported data on physical activity. Most of these trials measured total physical activity (including self-report measures, such as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and objective measures, such as an accelerometer). Five trials45,75, 86,89, 105targeted diet and physical activity; one trial targeted physical activity and sedentary behaviour;109and one trial targeted diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol misuse and drug misuse.67 Therefore, there were sufficient data to conduct only meta-analyses of any intervention and TAU. Goodness of fit for this model was acceptable [total residual deviance was 8.51 data points, compared with 7 data points and between-study SD was 0.23 (95% CrI 0.01 to 0.96)]. Evidence was very limited for the effect of any interventions compared with TAU for improving total physical activity (SMD 0.10, 95% CrI -0.25 to 0.49).Study WMD 4 Summarising effect estimates of the number of cigarettes smoked at the end point for studies targeting smoking alone or with additional risk behaviours.

Diet was measured using a diverse range of outcomes: calorie intake,89fat intake45,67, 93and fruit and vegetable intake.47,88We considered these outcomes too diverse to combine in meta-analyses. Therefore, despite an unhealthy diet being one of the most commonly targeted health risk behaviours, it is difficult to conclude how effective interventions are at promoting a healthier diet. Anthropometric outcomes Weight (kg) Thirty trials45,47,48,54,56,60 -64,76, 80,82,84,85,87,89,91,96,97,99, 101,102,104,105,107,108,110,149,150 with data from 2614 participants were included in the NMA of weight outcomes at the end point. Figure 5 summarises the risk-of-bias judgements across studies measuring weight loss. Just over half of the included studies in the NMA were rated as having a high overall risk of bias. The most common reason for studies being judged to have a high risk of bias was missing outcome data. Bias arising from the randomisation process was the next most common. Figure 6 illustrates the different risk behaviours targeted b y weight loss interventions and their comparators. By far the most commonly targeted risk behaviours for intervention were diet and physical activity compared with (17 trials)45,54,56,6 0-62,70,75,76, 84,87,91,96,104,1 05,107,1 08or TAU+(five TAU in two trials,99,104and diet alone and TAU +in one trial.101Three trials targeted physical activity alone and TAU,48,85,97and none targeted physical activity alone and TAU +. Interventions targeted diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use and TAU in two trials,63,102 and diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use and TAU +in one trial.47 Total residual deviance did not suggest problems with model fit (mean 59.5 data points, compared with 63 data points) and between-study SD was 0.71 [95% CrI 0.04 to 1.89, MD on weight (kg) scale]. Targeting diet alone was the most effective intervention, although it was not possible to rule out a lack of effectiveness or weight gain (MD -2.27 kg, 95% CrI -6.22 to 1.60 kg). Targeting both diet and physical activity was a little less effective at reducing weight than TAU (MD -2.12 kg, 95% CrI -2.94 to-1.34 kg). However, CrIs were narrower, as more studies directly compared these interventions with TAU. Targeting physical activity alone was the next most effective strategy for reducing weight, compared with TAU (MD -1.40 kg, 95% CrI -6.00 to 2.99 kg). Interventions targeting diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol misuse were unlikely to be effective on weight loss, compared with TAU (MD 1.27 kg, 95% CrI -1.46 to 3.42 kg), and may potentially lead to a mild weight increase. The effect estimate comparing any risk behaviour intervention with TAU was similar to that found for interventions targeting diet and physical activity (MD -2.10 kg, 95% CrI -3.14 to -1.06 kg). This is probably because interventions targeting these risk behaviours had most weight in the NMA (see Figure 6 ). Follow-up data were relatively sparse; there were sufficient data to only assess effectiveness at 6m o n t h s ' follow-up.

Just under half of the included studies in the NMA were rated as having a high overall risk of bias. The most common reason for studies being judged to have a high risk of bias was missing outcome data. Bias arising from the randomisation process was the next most common reason. Figure 8 shows that most data were available for the comparison of interventions targeting diet and physical activity (17 trials) with TAU.45,54,61,62,70,75,76, 84,86,87,89,91, 104,105,107,108,111 A further five RCTs compared diet and physical activity with TAU +.64,80,82,90, 110Interventions targeting diet, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking were next most common (four trials compared such interventions with TAU60,63,73,102 and two trials compared them with TAU +47,102). There were very limited data on interventions targeting physical activity alone (five trials48,79, 83,85,97 compared such interventions with TAU and one trial101compared them with TAU +) or diet (two trials99,104 compared such interventions with TAU and one trial101compared them with TAU +). The total residual deviance suggested that there were no problems with model fit (mean 71.77 data points, from 75 data points), and between-study SD was 0.89 (95% CrI 0.57 to 1.36; BMI scale). Interventions targeting physical activity alone were most effective, compared with TAU, in reducing BMI (MD -1.23 kg/m2, 95% CrI -2.63 to 0.20 kg/m2). Interventions targeting diet and physical activity were the next most effective (MD -0.53 kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.07 to 0.04 kg/m2), compared with TAU. There was no evidence that either targeting diet alone (MD -0.04 kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.72 to 1.65 kg/m2) or targeting diet, physical activity, alcohol misuse and drug misuse concurrently (MD -0.02 kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.05 to 0.98 kg/m2) were effective reducing BMI.

In contrast to the risk behaviours and anthropometric outcomes, studies targeting multiple risk behaviours were more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure than those targeting single behaviours.

Total residual deviance did not identify any problems with model fit (mean 26.78 data points, compared with 27 data points), and between-study SD was 1.78 (95% CrI 0.16 to 4.27; MD scale on diastolic blood pressure). Credible intervals were wide for all comparisons, indicating uncertainty about their effectiveness. The most effective interventions in reducing diastolic blood pressure targeted diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol misuse (MD -2.04 mmHg, 95% CrI -5.76 to 1.23 mmHg). The next most effective intervention targeted diet alone (MD -1.60 mmHg, 95% CrI -6.37 to 2.94 mmHg), followed by targeting diet and physical activity (MD -1.06 mmHg, 95% CrI -4.04 to 1.48 mmHg), and, finally, interventions targeting physical activity alone were not associated with any benefit (MD 0.34 mmHg, 95% CrI trials45,61,63,64,67, 83,89,93,97,98, 101,102,104,149,150 were included in the NMA, with data from 2121 participants.

Physical activity alone (MD 2.99 mg/dl, 95% CrI -1.42 to 7.26 mg/dl) was the next most effective intervention, but the 95% CrI was wide. Targeting diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol misuse was a little less effective (MD 2.59 mg/dl, 95% CrI -0.53 to 5.78 mg/dl). There was limited evidence for the benefits of targeting diet and physical activity (MD 0.15 mg/dl, 95% CrI were included in the NMA, comprising 1071 participants. Given the sparse nature of the network, and concerns over whether or not there were sufficient data to estimate between-study heterogeneity, we compared the goodness of fit between a random-effects and fixed-effects model. The greater complexity of the random-effects model did not result in a better fit (random-effects model: DIC =111.65, data points; compared with 18 data points); therefore, we used a fixed-effects model for the analysis of LDL cholesterol. Data were imprecise for all interventions; therefore, it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of reducing LDL cholesterol. Total cholesterol Eleven trials,45,61,67, 83,86,89,93,9 7,101,149,150with 1727 participants, were included in the NMA. Both the fixed-effects and random-effects models we re an acceptable fit total deviance 22.36 data points; compared with 22 data points). But the greater complexity of the random-effects model meant that the fixed-effects model was preferred (random-effects model DIC =138.95, fixed-effects model DIC =137.99).DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Quality of life Quality-of-life data help to assess the overall self-reported benefits of interventions to physical health. In addition, these data help to assess if there are any self-reported benefits or deterioration to mental health-related quality of life. Physical health Nine trials,45-47,67,69, 81,86, 107,148 with 1853 participants, were included in the NMA. Three trials targeted smoking alone and TAU; intensity of TAU was judged similar enough to be included in the NMA. Interventions targeted diet and physical activity and TAU in three trials, and diet and physical activity TAU +in one trial. One trial targeted diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use and TAU, and a further trial targeted these behaviours and TAU +. Total residual deviance was low for the random-effects (6.21 data points, compared with 9 data points) and fixed-effects (5.72 data points, compared with 9 data points) models, possibly indicating overfitting. Because of the greater complexity of the random-effects model, we preferred the fixed-effects model, as there was no difference in goodness of fit (random-effects model DIC =-5.68, fixed-effects model DIC=-7.43). Interventions targeting smoking alone improved physical health-related quality of life (SMD 0.19, 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.34). There appeared to be no difference between interventions targeting diet and physical activity and TAU in physical health-related quality of life (SMD 0.02, 95% CrI -0.14 to 0.18). Interventions targeting diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol misuse may have led to a small reduction in physical health-related quality of life (SMD -0.21, 95% CrI -0.43 to 0.02). Mental health Nine trials45-47,67,69, 81,86, 107,148 were included in the NMA, with 1853 participants. Total residual deviance was low for the random-effects (6.09 data points, compared with 9 data points) and fixed-effects (5.31 data points, compared with 9 data points) models, possibly indicating overfitting. Because of the greater complexity of the random-effects model, we preferred the fixed-effects model, as there was no difference in goodness of fit (random-effects model DIC =-5.72, fixed-effects model DIC=-7.74). Three trials targeted smoking alone and TAU;46,69,148 the intensity of TAU (i.e. low to very low) was judged to be similar enough to be included in the NMA. Interventions targeted diet and physical activity and TAU in three trials,45,86,107and diet and physical activity TAU +in one trial.81One trial targeted diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use and TAU,67and one trial targeted these behaviours and TAU +.47 There was no evidence that either single (interventions targeting smoking alone: SMD 0.01, 95% CrI -0.14 to 0.16) or multiple risk behaviour (interventions targeting diet and physical activity: SMD -0.09, 95% CrI -0.25 to alcohol misuse: SMD -0.09, 95% CrI -0.32 to 0.14) interventions led to a reduction in mental health-related quality of life. This is an important finding, given concerns that trying to promote physical health may lead to deterioratio n in mental health. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was the most commonly reported mental health outcome measure; it is designed to monitor symptom severity in people with schizophrenia. We used these data to assess whether or not risk behaviour interventions had adverse effects on mental health for people with SMI.RESULTS OF EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk26There were insufficient data to assess the impact of which behaviours were targeted; therefore, we assessed differences between any risk behaviour intervention and TAU on the PANSS. As there were only two comparisons in the network, this was equivalent to conducting a pairwise meta-analysis. In addition, only data on the PANSS total score51,54,6 0,67,79were sufficiently reported to conduct meta-analyses. Given that only five trials were included in the analysis, and concerns about whether or not there were sufficient data to estimate between-study heterogeneity, we compared the goodness of fit between a random-effects and a fixed-effects model. The greater complexity of the random-effects model did not result in a better fit with the data (random-effects model DIC =56.91, total residual deviance =10.25 model DIC =56.63, total residual deviance =11.09 data points, compared with 10 data points); therefore, we used a fixed-effects model for the analysis of the PANSS total score. There was no evidence on the PANSS total score (MD 0.03, 95% CrI -2.56 to 2.65) that any risk behaviour intervention had a harmful effect on mental health in people with schizophrenia, although the CrI was wide, suggesting uncertainty on estimating the true effect. Model 1b: meta-regression analyses to investigate the impact of intervention and participants characteristics on effectiveness There were only sufficient data to conduct meta-regression analyses for weight and BMI outcomes ( Table 2 ). Weight We investigated the impact of including five study characteristic covariates to NMA m odel 1a: behaviour change intervention at initiation of antipsychotic treatment, if participants were targeted for specific comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes), if the intervention was delivered to individuals, if the intervention was delivered in an inpatient setting and if the intervention was tailored for people with SMI. We then compared the goodness of fit of this covariate model with model 1 without covariates. We compared model 1b (covariate model) with model 1a (model without covariates). Total residual deviance showed that goodness of fit was acceptable in both models (model 1b =55.30 data points, model 1a=60.00 data points, compared with 63 data points). The DIC did not substantially differ between models (model 1b =279.52, model 1a =282.17). However, the inclusion of covariates in model 1b explained some of the heterogeneity, indicated by a reduction in the between-study SD (model 1b: SD 0.44, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.54; model 1a: SD 0.69, 95% CrI 0.04 to 1.78).

In addition, interventions delivered in inpatient settings were less effective than interventions delivered in community settings (beta 3.18, 95% CrI 0.21 to 6.12). CrIs were very wide for all other covariates. Body mass index Differences in DIC values indicated that the covariate model (model 1b: DIC =186.91) fitted the data better than the model without covariates (model 1a: DIC =196.76), although the covariates included in the model reduced the between-study SD only a little (model 1b: SD 0.83, 0.46 to 1.40; model 1a: 0.88, 95% CrI 0.56 to 1.35). Total residual deviance was acceptable for the covariate model (mean 68.53 data points, compar ed with 70 data points). Similar to weight outcomes, interventions delivered to individuals were more effective than those delivered to groups (beta -1.11, 95% CrI -2.15 to -0.01). All other covariates had very wide CrIs. Model 2 (interaction model): does targeting multiple risk behaviours lead to positive or negative synergies? The preceding analyses provide some insight on how tar geting particular risk behaviours affects outcomes. A different way of exploring that question is to assess whether or not targeting risk behaviours together results in positive (i.e. larger benefits than would be expected from the sum of their effects alone) or negative synergies (i.e. less benefits than expected from the sum of their effects). There were sufficient data to explore these interactions on weight and BMI only ( Table 3 ). Weight Model fit was acceptable (mean total residual deviance =58.42 data points, compared with 63 data points). The findings were similar to those of model 1. We did not find evidence of positive interactions. There did not appear to be additional benefits of targeting diet and physical activity concurrently, compared with summing the effects of targeting each of these behaviours alone (MD 1.88 kg, 95% CrI -4.02 to 7.57 kg). There was evidence of negative synergistic effects when targeting diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol misuse and drug misuse. Benefits on weight loss were less than would be expected if these behaviours were targeted alone (2.97 kg, 95% CrI 1.03 to 4.84 kg). Body mass index Model fit was acceptable (total residual deviance was 71.78 data points, compared with 75 data points). Targeting physical activity was associated with a small reduction in BMI (MD -1.08 kg/m2, 95% CrI -2.28 to 0.13 kg/m2). There was insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of targeting diet alone (MD -0.01 kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.65 to 1.67 kg/m2).

Model 3: effectiveness of behaviour change techniques We fitted component NMA models to evaluate the effectiveness of BCTs in models assuming these BCTs affected outcomes independently of one another (independent model) and in models allowing for interaction effects between these BCTs (interaction model) ( Table 4 ). Weight Goodness of fit was acceptable for both models (independent model: total residual deviance =59.42 data points, interaction model: total residual deviance =58.46 data points, compared with 63 data points). The DIC values (independent model: DIC =281.67, interaction model: DIC =282.37) and between- study SDs were similar (independent model: SD 0.81, 95% CrI 0.03 to 2.22; interaction model: SD 0.91, 95% CrI 0.04 to 2.43). This may reflect that there were sufficient data for only two interactions to be included in the interaction model and that both covariates were very imprecise. Therefore, the summary of results will focus on the simpler independent model.

In addition, problem-solving was associated with weight gain (MD 3.61 kg, 95% CrI 1.18 to 5.32 kg). Body mass index Goodness of fit was acceptable for both models (independence model: total residual deviance =77.86, interaction model: total residual deviance =73.31). The interaction model (DIC =192.86) fitted the data better than the independent model (DIC =198.84) and explained more of the heterogeneity [between-st udy SD: interaction model, 0.21 (95% CrI 0.01 0.55 (95% CrI 0.12 to 1.07)]. Ther efore, the summary will focus on results from the interaction model. Similar to the weight NMA, the strongest evidence was found for goal-setting (behaviour) (MD -1.85 kg/m2, 95% CrI -2.91 to -0.69 kg/m2), instruction perform a (MD kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.85 95% CrI -1.42 to 0.07 kg/m2), although it was not possible to rule out negligible benefits for self-monitoring of beh aviour. As for weight, problem-solving was associated with a worsening of BMI outcomes (MD 1.46 kg/m2, 95% CrI 0.11 to 2.67 kg/m2).RESULTS OF EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk30Chapter 5 Results of the qualitative review Quality of included studies Methodological limitations of included studies were assessed using the CASP tool. Reporting was generally acceptable across studies, allowing for consideration of most, if not all, prompts in the CASP tool for each study. However, authors 'consideration of the relationship between researcher and participant (question 6) was consistently poorly addressed. Only 4 of the 25 included studies addressed this issue adequately. One consideration that was addressed well was ethics issues (question 7), which require sufficient detail in gaining ethics approval and informed consent of participants. When this did not score 'yes ', it was because of an apparent lack of reporting. Results of the GRADE -CERQual assessment per subtheme can be found in Appendix 8 . There was moderate to high confidence in the evidence presented by the subthemes reported here. The four components of CERQual also raised only very minor to moderate concerns. Methodological limitations (as assessed by the CASP tool) were not a general concern: coherence was largely assessed as a minor concern; adequacy was mostly assessed as a very minor to minor concern; and relevance was a slightly larger concern, predominantly assessed as being of minor to moderate concern. Narrative synthesis Here we are going to address the question: what are service user perspectives on the acceptability and feasibility of using risk behaviour interventions to change behaviour and improve physical health-related outcomes, with specific reference to intervention uptake, adherence and service user experience? Data from primary studies organised around four higher-tier themes: interaction of physical and mental health, motivational contexts for change, barriers to behaviour change, and experiences of interventions. Interaction between physical and mental health Across the studies, data highlighted the reciprocal nature of physical and mental health. Participants reported the impact of mental health states on their engagement in healthy behaviours, and there was an emerging consensus that physical health risk behaviours had the potential to affect mental health negatively. Healthy behaviours improving mental health and well-being People with SMI reported that physical activity was helpful in changing mental health. But, overall, mental health and a sense of well-being were valued more than changes in activity. When discussing physical activity, data gathered around two core ideas: physical activity to refresh the mind and physical activity for symptomatic relief. Engaging in activity was frequently reported to result in mental clarity: ...I 'd notice, after I 'd done the gym sessions, I felt really fresh. Like, afterwards, like my mind felt kind of washed, if you like.

Firth et al. ,119SRB, physical activity An overarching concept from this theme related to participants 'desire to find a suitable space to bring about positive mental change: [The gym] gives me somewhere to go to vent out stress. Jimenez et al. ,127multiple risk behaviour intervention (MRB), physical activity and diet Similarly, reports of physical activity to relieve mental health symptoms spoke of exercise as a mental release, and relieving SMI symptoms: Exercise relieves stress, sweat relieves stress; those two things, I really use them. There 's all kinds of ways you can relieve stress. I think exercise helps me to relieve stress. Jimenez et al. ,127MRB, physical activity and diet The voices, I do not hear them as much. Forsberg et al. ;121MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol, drug use, smoking There was also widespread recognition that exercise could have immediate impact on well-being, as well as physiological benefits: . . . physical exercise, it lets endorphins off in your brain, doesn 't it. So even if you are a bit depressed, it can, erm, make you not depressed [laughs], or make you slightly more happy. Firth et al. ,119SRB, physical activity Being considered more holistically One of the core components of participants 'preferences and expectations for engaging with behaviour change revolved around their desire to be treated as a whole person. In studies, participants wanted to be recognised in totality as individuals, rather than as a collection of risk behaviours to be changed. According to authors in one study, participants expressed dislike for the term 'intervention ',p e r c e i v i n gi ta s : Someone else intervening. Bauer et al. ,117MRB, physical activity and diet When trying to improve health risk behaviours, there was a sense that outcomes such as weight loss were secondary to the overarching idea of well-being: Even if I don 't necessarily lose so much weight, but just living healthier, eating healthier, being healthier is enough. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Mental and physical health were not necessarily viewed as separate, which may be critical to multiple risk behaviour interventions: [M]y big goal is to be fully recovered from all the physical and psychological problems I 've got. That 'sm y goal, to be fully recovered. Forsberg et al. ;121MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol, drug use, smokingRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk32Self-medicating Smoking, drug use, and/or alcohol use emerged as key behaviours that typified the ways in which participants sought relief from symptoms or were proactive in trying to change unhelpful mental states. Behaviours related to addictive substances were used to cope with, and manage, mental health symptoms. In one study, engaging in a risk behaviour was experienc ed as taking positive action to change health state: [Smoking] gives you the feeling that you 're doing something about it. Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking Smoking was sometimes interpreted as a coping strategy for mental health symptoms, which can be considered a misattribution of relief from nicotine withdrawal, and viewed as a 'high[ly] addictive antidepressant ',142and was perceived to be used to provide immediate relief of depression: [I]t gives you that instant effect that you 've had some sort of mood relaxant . . . a bit of a stress relief against depression . . . Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking For some participants, addictive behaviours were part and parcel of their existence and biographical memory, and were perceived as reliable, and even comforting, behaviours: With the bipolar illness, it 's hard for me to remember things, but something that I 've always done is smoke and that 's something that I 've, you know, it 's just been there all along. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking Other studies also mirrored this supportive role of risk behaviours; in one study, such behaviours were conceptualised as a companion: You have nobody to talk to, you have nobody to do things with. All you have is that drug; that drug keeps you company. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use The stable support that risk behaviours can offer was exemplified as something to retreat to, when managing schizophrenia and depression: I find myself escaping back to drugs. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use There were also reports that highlighted that, for some participants, their relationship with addictive substances was driven by their mental health: [T]he stress that I 'm under, the anxiety that I 'm under all the time just forces me right back to drink again. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use Motivational contexts for change Motivations and motivational contexts for change were broadly grouped into three subthemes: individual factors, social factors and environmental factors. Individual factors Various personal motivations to change were reported. Identifying and holding on to a personal motivation was noted as an important guiding light: I think it 's important to, you know, like, have a, like, a north star like that to look at, like, this is why I 'm doing it and this is why it 's important. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smokingDOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

I felt as though I took it serious and I wanted to do it, and then something would come along and sort of like take my mind off everything. Knowles et al. ,131SRB, smoking Motivation stemming from concerns with physical appearance and weight were reported in some studies: 'I'm a bit fat and have a big stomach. '(Forsberg et al.,121MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol, drug use, smoking), and they remember being 'skinny . . . proportioning '(Jimenez et al.,127MRB, physical activity and diet). Concerns over personal appearance could also affect concerns for romantic lives (related to concepts of confidence and acceptance; see Valued benefits of behaviour change interventions ): I want to get married one day or have a girl and girls don 't like fat guys. I want to be able to have a girl and be confident. Jimenez et al. ,127MRB; physical activity and diet This sense of participants wanting to promote a more positive future version of themselves extended to how they looked to protect themselves from the negative health outcomes associated with long-term conditions and ageing: I will soon be over 50 years old; you must be aware of the blood sugar and such values . . . It can change. It gives the desire to keep good values and not to get diabetes and other diseases. R\u00f6nngren et al. ,140MRB, physical activity and diet For others, motivations to change to healthier patterns of behaviour stemmed from an awareness of familial risks and the impact of witnessing others suffer health consequences of weight gain a nd smoking: It seems there 's a lot of health issues with family and that plays a part in wanting to exercise and lose weight because I 'm at severe risk of getting all these things. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and diet My dad, as he 's got a diseased lung . . . he smokes a lot and just watching him, cos he 's a pack a day smoker, I don 't want to be that. Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking In contrast to these direct health concerns, one study reported motivation stemming from particular scenarios, such as avoiding associated risks of possible surgery for weight loss: I don 't want to have to go through any weight loss surgery and stuff like that. That 's stuff I worry about. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Social factors Feedback and reinforcement of positive messaging from family and friends was also critical to some participants 'motivations to engage in more positive health behaviours: 'Gee, you look better ',s oI 'm on the right road. Aschbrenner et al. ,116MRB, physical activity and diet My family is starting to notice that I 'm losing weight. I like the positive comments. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and dietRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk34A sense of belonging could also be found in motivation from peers, and group interventions were reported as a good starting point to engaging in exercise: Exercise in a group could be a good way to start when it comes to engaging in physical activity. R\u00f6nngren et al. ,141MRB, physical activity and diet The presence of help suggested increased engagement with support. Having 'someone to call and talk things over with . . . 24 hours a day every day '(Maisto et al.,133MRB, alcohol and drug use). The idea of the intervention as a constant to return to was also present: So maybe if you just keep . . . keep going back to them. You 're saying 'look, we 're here and we 'll keep letting you know we 're here '. Knowles et al. ,131SRB, smoking However, verbal support alone did not necessarily translate into helpful actions (needing to be seen as credible), as, in one study, someone reported: My husband verbally supports me but he eats whatever he wants to eat and has it in the house. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet The presence of key others could positively support behaviour change, but not always, with some studies reporting that goals to enact behaviour change were viewed with scepticism: [W]hen I was talking about quitting there was [sic] a couple of people that were like would verbally basically be like, 'Yeah, right, I 'll believe it when I see it. '. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking Accountability to friends, family and intervention groups was a prominent component of this subtheme. Group interventions offered inherent accountability among peers. Interpersonal relationships with family and friends offered the ability to monitor behaviour, which was supportive of positive efforts made by individuals.133In one study, participants arranged accountable relationships between themselves, calling each other.126 Peer support was important for some participants, who derived a sense of accountability to each other by their membership and participation of intervention groups: The accountability of being part of the group is very important. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet This level of accountability to the group often translated into supporting each other to adhere to positive behaviour change: He 'll ask, 'Did you go to the gym? 'If I say no, he 'll say, 'I'm disappointed at you. '. But you see, that 's all we got, is this friendship. We have nothing, so we make the best of nothing. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and diet In another instance, the support of friends was often experienced in direct and instructional ways: I have this friend, she has this attitude, if I say that I 'm not going somewhere she 's like, 'You 're so going. Get dressed. '. Then I have to go. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and dietDOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.35Another component of this subtheme was surveillance and scrutiny from others. Familial involvement or surveillance could stir individuals into action, not necessarily for themselves, but to appeal to the desires and wishes of others and preserve good relations with significant others: . . . my parents told me that this treatment was a gift -the sort of habits and things that I was getting into wasn 't something that my parents could tolerate forever. Luciano et al. ,132MRB, alcohol and drug use In another study, motivation to change stemmed from a desire to not become stigmatised or attract negative attention: I don 't want to have to deal with people 's negative comments about me smoking because I already feel that in other areas. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking Environmental factors Having a safe and stable place might be the foundation for people with SMI to consider the challenges of behaviour change: Safe environments are the most important thing to people with mental illness. Huck et al. ,125SRB, physical activity Therefore, environmental factors refers to the external context of an individual on a micro level, for example where they live, and structures created by, or imposed on, a person. Creating schedules was an important means to shape and structure environments for individuals. Scheduling also offered accountability and was interpreted as motivating. This included scheduling intervention meetings or even behaviour change activities. For physical activity, this notion of environmental scheduling related to practical elements such as specific times, locations and goals that could be set objectively. By structuring their environments through scheduling, participants were, in some senses, bound to complete tasks linked to behaviour change: I guess it 's because it 's a little motivator. It 's like I can 't get away with it [skipping the gym]. Aschbrenner et al. ,116MRB, physical activity and diet Pacing the frequency of intervention meetings was an important consideration. Meetings may prompt behaviour change, rather than just acting as check-in points. For one participant, if the meetings were too infrequent, then they would engage in risk behaviours and: . . . a week later [as the monthly meeting approaches] I 'll try to improve on it. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet A feature of environmental factors contributing to motivation to change were interactions with formal health care. Appointments with intervention providers were another form by which environmental scheduling drove engagement with positive health behaviours. Here 'providers 'refers to those providing, organising and/or delivering the intervention, whether medical professional or community organiser. The authority held by a provider could increase the sense of accountability felt by participants to stick to their schedules. One participant stated: You see, when I got an appointment or something I 'm very faithful to that. Like he tells me, 'Come tomorrow ', I got it in my mind I gotta come to him tomorrow. So I won 't miss that appointment. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and dietRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk36Providers could set the tone and make participants feel welcome and bring a sense of humanity: I enjoyed the warmth of the welcome I got from the staff and the interest they showed. Roberts and Bailey,139MRB, other -weight My therapist, even though I 'm a mentally ill psychiatric patient in a mental institution, she still treats me like everybody else. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use In one instance, a provider was described as confrontational, but also as a source of stability to promote change: She used to confront me on it like that . . . she didn 't push me away . . it helped me quit. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use Positive relationships with providers were interpreted as supportive. Providers could be personal cheerleaders or provide a touchpoint for change: He was like persuading us on like 'come on you can do it, you can do it! 'when he says things like that it makes me more activate. Firth et al. ,119SRB, physical activity [O]nce [the exercise physiologist and nursing staff] helped me out I began to get fitter, not a great deal fitter, just enough to get through the day. Fogarty and Happell,120SRB, physical activity A positive relationship could also benefit perceptions of intervention providers, as one participant was unaware of their positive impact: I didn 't know they could do some good things, some of them, I didn 't really know that. Forsberg et al. ;121MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol, drug use, smoking Barriers to behaviour change As with motivations to change, we found that barriers to behaviour change were broadly grouped under three subthemes: individual factors, social factors and environmental factors. Individual factors One of the main contributors to individual barriers to change was SMI symptoms. Across studies, SMI symptoms presented challenges to engaging in behaviour change interventions, as exemplified in participants 'accounts about difficulties with concentrating and difficulties accepting information when delusional: Many of us can get tired and lose concentration . . . When you 've had a psychosis you work a lot with thoughts darting around inside your head. W\u00e4rdig et al. ,144MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol use and smoking [I] probably just think it 's a load of rubbish or, you know . . . Because like when you 're delusional you don 't, well I know that . . . I don 't believe anything. Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smokingDOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.37Deteriorations in mental health were often emphasised by participants as their main concern; therefore, enacting positive behaviour change was of secondary importance: It's hard to make changes in your diet and follow the routine . . . when you 're at a point where you just don 't care. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Mental health treatments were also identified as restricting the scope to change behaviours through their impact on bodily systems: When I am feeling down or depressed, I have almost no energy. In these periods, I have to take more psychotropic drugs, resulting in even less energy. Verhaeghe et al. ,143MRB, other -health promotion Poorer mental health on the part of participants had the capacity to magnify barriers that might have ordinarily been surmountable: My husband drives me there [to the gym] even when I don 't want to be there. I can walk. It 's not that far from my house to the gym [. . .]. Aschbrenner et al. ,116MRB, physical activity and diet However, reluctance to engage in physical activity was not always associated with mental health status: I just get lazy sometimes. I just don 't want to do it, so I sit on the couch and watch TV. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Another feature of individual barriers to behaviour change was derived from participants 'responses about their self-efficacy to enact change. A lack of knowledge or skill affected participants 'capability to carry out healthy behaviours. For example, not understanding how to use exercise equipment as part of a gym routine was cited as a block to effectively engaging in physical activity: [Knowing] how many repetitions and how to use the handles and set the chair and everything, that would 've made it a lot more enjoyable for me. Huck et al. ,125SRB, physical activity In the case of taking exercise in public, stigma around body image was prohibitive of activity: I hate getting into that pool because I think people are staring at me . . . but it 's that whole confidence thing . . . you see those skinny people . . . that 's what helps to put you . . . Roberts and Bailey,139MRB, other -weight Physiological as well as psychological barriers emerged as common factors in this theme about individual-level barriers to behaviour change. Cravings for addictive substances were commonly reported among participants with histories of addictive behaviours such as smoking, alcohol use and drug use. Cravings appeared to be powerful and intangible, described as 'screaming '(Thornton et al.,142 SRB, smoking) and like a 'forcefield '(Maisto et al.,133MRB, alcohol and drug use) that could trap people in cycles of negative behaviours. An element of timing was also present, as cravings were reported at the beginning of a transition: The first week I felt like every cell in my body wanted a cigarette. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smokingRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk38Distractions were used in response to a craving to engage in a risk behaviour, and building a resilience over time was described: Maybe call a sponsor, call a friend, go for a walk, and go to the gym. The cravings do pass, and they do pass more easily when you have longer-term sobriety under your belt. Luciano et al. ,132MRB, alcohol and drug use This progression was challenged in one report, as overcoming cravings was described as 'almost impossible ',142even when presented with visual consequences of smoking: [E]ven with those pictures sitting right in front of me because my body is asking me for that. Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking Social factors Influences of the social and cultural contexts were a rich subtheme of data. People with SMI reported the benefits of positive peer support, but also the difficulties with negative peer group pressure. Participants typically remarked that obligations to family and the cultural significance of dietary be haviours could prevent behaviour change. Eating together was seen as part of their 'identity 'in a study of a Latino subpopulation: . . . being together, eating our traditional food with our family, and remembering. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and diet Such family gatherings were an example of social challenges to healthy diet and alcohol consumption: 'One plate isn 't going to hurt you ', but the plate is like this [gestures] big, and it 's all mounded, it 's huge, and then everyone had to have a drink, and I 'm like, 'I don 't drink anymore '. Aschbrenner et al. ,116MRB, physical activity and diet Engagement in risk behaviours (such as smoking) was often encouraged rather than restrained by others: People are just like, 'Dude, if you need to smoke, smoke. '. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking The absence of social support was also detrimental to healthy behaviours. In a few studies, there were reports of the negative impacts of loneliness: The biggest culprit is loneliness, a terrible problem, I think. Nobody feels good when they 're alone. R\u00f6nngren et al. ,141MRB, physical activity and diet Interventions that built in behaviour change activities into people 's schedule interrupted the sense of loneliness felt by some: [I]t just helps to get me out really, that 's what it does, for people that are isolated like me, that do suffer from mental illness and do find it hard to go out and about. Hodgson et al. ,124SRB, physical activity Environmental factors The subtheme of environmental barriers to behaviour change emerged from reports about how certain environments induced rather than prevented health risk behaviours.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.39In some situations, environments were sources of behavioural triggers that were difficult to avoid and promoted engagement in risk behaviours: You 're sitting there watching it and it 'll come on and triggers cigarette thoughts and . . . instead of putting you off, it would make you want to have a cigarette . . . Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking I'd been smoking for so many years that there 's so many situations where it was extremely automatic for me to smoke. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking In one study, there were reports of individuals seeking new residences to change environmental triggers around them. However, group homes could also be a trigger, as occupants 'shared experiences made for talking points with unintended side effects: [A]ll those war stories used to get me excited about [using alcohol and drugs]. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use Another component of environmental barriers to behaviour change was the interface with formal health care. Intervention providers and prescribers are gatekeepers for interventions, with the power to bestow decisions on who gets access to opportunities and support to promote positive behaviour change. This was illustrated through reports of the difficulties participants faced in being prescribed antismoking treatment, as well as in collecting prescriptions: 'We 're not putting you on the Champix '[Champix\u00ae; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA] and the other one as well, 'Not putting you on them '. And that was it. I was out the door, gone. Knowles et al. ,131SRB, smoking Providers may be considered a natural authority in an intervention, which lends their advice legitimacy, as providing advice suggests that there is improvement to be made: When she [nurse] gives me advice how to cook using healthy ingredients or to go to the fitness, I would follow this advice. The fact that she mentions it means for me that here is a problem. Verhaeghe et al. ,143MRB, other -health promotion However, the naturally authoritative role of providers was sometimes perceived by participants as obstructive. This was especially true when participants perceived that providers lacked knowledge about their lived experience and were guilty of poorly expressing instructions: How do they know it does that? You ever took drugs? Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use [H]e [therapist] says 'that 's because you eat too much and don 't get enough exercise '. That 's pretty blunt, isn 't it? If you 're overweight, the last thing you want someone to tell you is that you 're fat. Roberts and Bailey,139MRB, other -weight Support from health-care providers could also be construed as too sparse and restricted to addressing risk behaviours in isolation from other issues, thereby limiting the relevance of advice: [O]nly really advice they give is, one time they said, 'Now really try this time, [patient name]. Really try '. And I was like 'alright '. They just signed the prescription and I take it away and try, so that was that. Knowles et al. ,131SRB, smokingRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk40In a rehabilitation centre, a typically intense setting, care was not perceived as being supportive enough: All they did was throw books and papers at you and told you to do this and talk about health, health food, and nothing about yourself. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use Access to appropriate resources and practical barriers were other features of environmental barriers. The cost of healthy food was raised as a barrier to changing dietary behaviours. This may be common among a SMI population on a fixed income: If you buy fresh, raw vegetables, they 're expensive. And I 'm on a fixed income. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and diet Locating suitable spaces for physical activity was also a common problem that affected participants ' ability to regularly and effectively take part in physical activity: When we 're at [nursing facility], you could go on a long walk, but it 's all the way around the building and then you can 't really stop anywhere to rest. Huck et al. ,125SRB, physical activity Barriers can mount up and environmental constraints can be multiplicative, such as when bad weather impeded taking outdoor exercise among those with a relatively low tolerance for exercise: . . . I was out walking and focusing on my diet. And then I got sloppy with that. I don 't like to walk in the mall, and I don 't like to walk in the cold, the rain. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Experiences of behaviour change interventions and success This theme draws together data on participants 'experiences of behaviour change interventions. In addition, more general benefits beyond the duration of a behaviour change intervention are also incorporated. Tailoring interventions to severe mental illness populations The most prominent intervention consideration reported by people with SMI was the role of mental health and SMI symptoms in behaviour change, as described in the subtheme of individual barriers to behaviour change. Symptoms of paranoia and delusion were highlighted as challenging for receiving information in one study that investigated perceptions of a population health intervention, for antismoking, in people with SMI.142This was the only study to consider the impacts of a population health intervention in this group. People with mental health problems are just as willing to bring about positive behaviour change as the general population. However, for some people with SMI, assistance in organising and structuring their lives to help them engage in positive behaviour change was seen as a vital first step: [Talking in third person] because it 's not that they can 't think for themselves in the same way as other people, but it 's more a case of they can 't organise themselves or their thoughts in the same way as other people. Knowles et al. ,131SRB, smoking In this sense, the structure and organisation of interventions themselves were positively associated with a greater sense of order and regularity on the part of participants. Engaging with an intervention created a basic schedule for participants: [G]roups run regularly . . . there 's a schedule every week. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug useDOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.41The structure provided by this was touched on in different ways, and described as helping to provide order to life more generally: It means, how shall I say it? Maybe a bit more order in my life. You see, I have Tuesday and Thursday and I know that time I will . . . That will be, yes . . . Forsberg et al. ;121MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol, drug use, smoking A feature of structure that was present in some interventions was record keeping, particularly for diet and physical activity, but also applied to other behaviours. Having this organisational reference point seemed to link with self-education about personal health: Well, it wasn 't until I started writing things down that I realized my intake was terrible. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Participants suggested that the routine and structure gained from interventions were important to continuing progress beyond the intervention: Some of the most helpful things, it 's a combo, the structure and the day-to-day routine that I developed there. It has helped me for when I 'm on my own. Luciano et al. ,132MRB, alcohol and drug use Such organisation was also interpreted as applicable to participants 'cognitive approach: [B]y maintaining an active, healthy lifestyle, helps me take the reins of my life [. . .]. Jimenez et al. ,127MRB, physical activity and diet Knowledge and skills to enact behaviour change Psychoeducation and knowledge provision components were common among interventions. In studies, individuals reported awareness of the consequences of risk behaviours: As [service provider] has told me, if I don 't start [exercising], COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], and that 's all I got to say. Huck et al. ,125SRB, physical activity However, people with SMI may be less informed about behaviour change strategies and healthy choices. Some participants found education necessary, and being taught skills to practice healthy behaviours was enabling and enhanced their self-efficacy. While in a physical activity intervention, fear of incorrectly implementing change as a result of a lack of knowledge was prohibitive to taking action: SMART [self-management and recovery training] gave me the information I needed no matter what I did. Penn et al. ,138SRB, alcohol There are different ways to walk. It was a big step because I have a lack of knowledge of what is good. R\u00f6nngren et al. ,140MRB, physical activity and diet The way in which knowledge was imparted by providers was also crucial to how participants responded to advice and encouragement. Non-tailored communication was especially obstructive and led to disengagement from positive behaviour change: Sometimes I don 't understand [my therapist]. I let her say what she 's got to say, and I just stay quiet. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug useRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk42In other instances, participants recalled that providers had withheld information and not prepared them for what was to come, leading to only partial engagement in activities that they would have preferred to excel at: I wish I had been pushed more, it would have been good if I could have been on Survivor on TV. W\u00e4rdig et al. ,144MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol use and smoking Physical activity was often referred to as a work in progress, that led to incremental change over time: We did some small things and then we built up . . . we just walked around the back alley way quite a few times . . . flat ground so we didn 't have walk up hills . . . Fogarty and Happell,120SRB, physical activity Being prepared to experience physical exertion was cited as a necessary precursor to taking exercise, as individuals who were not comfortable might disengage before starting. Other paths to exercise were reliant on taking personal responsibility for following advice: The program works if you follow the steps and the things you do. You get what you put into it I guess. Luciano et al. ,132MRB, alcohol and drug use Intentions to enact behaviour change were also prompted in response to receipt of educational interventions that focused on the poor health consequences of negative health behaviours: I learned a lot of stuff from the group . . . like body . . to be more careful . . . Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use Finding out that I 'm a borderline diabetic . . . about six months ago . . . was also a push too. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet A counterpoint to this sense of personal responsibility to change was noted in responses to public health antismoking campaigns, whereby shocking facts and imagery did not prohibit smoking; instead, people interpreted the risks as possible outcomes that were unlikely to affect them: One 's [antismoking campaign] sitting right in front of me and I 'm still smoking a cigarette, but yeah there is a lot of campaigns to scare people from smoking. Thornton et al. ,142SRB, smoking For others, the risk of poorer health outcomes was divorced from a sense of responsibility for their own health; instead, they perceived the likelihood of being unwell as being inevitable: [S]ometimes I think it 's in my DNA that . . . everything has been harder for me. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking Group delivery formats A subtheme emerged about the merits of group delivery of interventions, and is related to broader themes about social motivations for behaviour change. This subtheme particularly highlighted the importance of how group formats fostered peer support and engendered a sense of togetherness: I think a big part, if you 're going to deal with this, is to have people in the same boat with you. That helped -I didn 't know anyone else that would have been a dual diagnosis.

For example, in one study, it was reported that one individual experienced panic attacks during sessions. Peers understood their reactions and knew 'to leave me alone in that situation or come over and have a quick word or maybe give me a quick nudge to get back on the pitch, and I just think it 's cus they know [pause] about your needs '(Hodgson et al.,124SRB, physical activity). Put simply, peers 'know where you 're coming from '(Maisto et al.,133MRB, alcohol and drug use). Another feature of group-based interventions was the point of comparison they provided. Within a group of peers experiencing the same intervention, there is an inherent comparison: [M]eeting once a week and comparing notes with people, and knowing that I 'm not alone with all these obstacles, and that there are people that care. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet This could be a negative, as peers may also police engagement in interventions, as reported in a lifestyle intervention: Half of them don 't listen. Many of them didn 't even wear that pedometer, and I always wore mine. Even when I slept I wore it. I think I was the most diligent one of us all. W\u00e4rdig et al. ,144MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol use and smoking Choices and adapting interventions to suit the individual In the context of group interventions, it was apparent that, for some participants, the chance to draw up personalised approaches to behaviour change was an important driver for success. This was especially apparent among those taking part in physical activity interventions: It was good that we got to choose something out of like a list. We could have done all different things . . . I thought the options were quite good. But I would have like to have done boxercise as well. Firth et al. ,119SRB, physical activity Forewarning about the nature of interventions was also highlighted as critical to making informed choices about taking part in interventions: [P]eople turn up and then it 's not right for them . . . if they 'd had the information . . . they wouldn 't have come, well waste their time really . . . Roberts and Bailey,139MRB, other -weight Because individuals favoured interventions that offered choice, they adapted activities to suit their needs and capabilities, for example incorporating physical activity into their daily routine: This [exercise] is a really challenging thing for me. What I do is doing errands. I walk from place to place rather than take the bus and the train. Jimenez et al. ,126MRB, physical activity and diet Providers can help facilitate the tailoring of activities so that they are suitable for each individual: The health co-ordinators were great people who made everything feel spontaneous. They were good at finding the right level for each and every one. W\u00e4rdig et al. ,144MRB; physical activity, diet, alcohol use and smokingRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk44There were instances, however, when interventions had competing priorities owing to the focus on multiple risk behaviours; the delivery of such interventions did not always map to individual needs and preferences: [T]he walking [is helpful]. The exercise portion of the group, that can get set on the back burner. And I don 't think it should be. Yarborough et al. ,147MRB, physical activity and diet Purpose to activity Among studies, a subtheme on intervention activities providing a sense of purpose emerged: It's just that I 've got an activity for the afternoon that I 'm not sat watching TV, something like that. Carless and Douglas,118SRB, physical activity Similarly, in two studies, interventions were seen as providing something to look forward to: [G]roup gives you a place to be, a reason to be there. Maisto et al. ,133MRB, alcohol and drug use It's a routine you get used to I think. It 's like football, I get excited about football on a Monday. Carless and Douglas,118SRB, physical activity More broadly, the purpose of activity also related to the concepts of loneliness (see Barriers to behaviour change ,Social factors ). Purposeful activity could help resolve loneliness. Valued benefits of behaviour change interventions Across studies, the benefits of behaviour change interventions extended beyond health outcomes, with participants reporting improvements in well-being and ability to navigate day-to-day life. Interventions featuring physical activity were particularly prominent in this subtheme. Cognitive benefits of behaviour change interventions included memory and decision-making: My memory has returned. R\u00f6nngren et al. ,140MRB, physical activity and diet I wouldn 't make any decisions, I was too worried about making the wrong one. I was very scared [pause] of stepping on people 's feet and just everything like that, . . . now I just get on with it. Hodgson et al. ,124SRB, physical activity Valued benefits of intervention experiences also included opening doors for individuals 'everyday functioning and socialising, with greater control over their lives. As interventions were structured, this, in turn, gave individuals a sense of order over their lives. It can be through simple routine to daily life, or returning to education, work and hobbies: I'm going to school, I 'm looking for work, I go home every other week to see my family. I run, I 've really gotten into that. I have friends now, I go fishing twice a week . . . Luciano et al. ,132MRB, alcohol and drug use [B]y maintaining an active, healthy lifestyle, helps me take the reins of my life and have a connection with the outside and inside world.

Confidence was described as part of a package of cognitive and emotional changes: I think I 'm in a much better mood . . . I am up, I 'm confident, I 'm sleeping well, my appetite is good, my self-esteem is healthy . . . I have a brighter outlook, you know. Heffner et al. ,123SRB, smoking SMART [self-management and recovery training -the intervention] gave me pride. It showed me how to get self-worth. It was basically building me up in order to be receptive to everything else. It started with me. Penn et al. ,138SRB, alcohol Participants 'expressions of excitement and fulfilment in achieving change could bring about greater confidence that, in turn, acted as a spur to continue to engage with interventions: I love it. It 's just like, thinking yeah, I couldn 't do this 4 months ago, now look at me doing it comfortably. Let 's throw it up a gear! Firth et al. ,119SRB, physical activity This positive change, was summed up in feeling the beginning of a fresh start: I feel like this program has benefited me and I feel like I 've got my second wind out of this program. Fogarty and Happell,120SRB, physical activityRESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE REVIEW NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk46Chapter 6 Integration of quantitative and qualitative findings Table 5 presents a matrix comparing the findings of the qualitative and quantitative studies included in our systematic review. We investigated whether or not overall themes and subthemes from the synthesis of qualitative studies were investigated in the quantitative data. We noted narratively if there was any overlap and investigated whether or not it was possible to conduct meta-regression analyses, component NMAs or multivariate meta-analyses related to these themes. When qualitative and quantitative data overlapped, we assessed the relationship according to four categories: silence (no overlap), partial agreement (complementary findings), agreement (coherence between quantitative and qualitative data) and dissonance (conflicting findings from quantitative and qualitative data). When there was overlap in quantitative and qualitative data but the relationship between the findings was unclear, we categorised this as inconclusive.

However, interactions between these outcomes were not assessedPartial agreement: NMAs of mental health-related quality of life included nine trials that targeted smoking alone; diet and physical activity; or diet, physical activity, alcohol and smoking.

Trials did not directly assess the impact of improved physical health on mental health outcomes. Another way of looking at this relationship between physical and mental health is to assess whether or not engaging in a behaviour change intervention is associated with a deterioration of mental health outcomes. Importantly, neither the quality of life nor PANSS outcomes found evidence that interv entions targeting smoking; diet and physical activity; or diet, physical activity, alcohol and smoking led to deterioration of mental health symptoms or quality of life. However, as acknowledged previously, the data are currently limited and future research could change these conclusions. Being considered holistically The primary outcome in most intervention studies was either behavioural (e.g. smoking) or primarily related to markers of physical health (e.g. weight, BMI, blood pressure). This focus reflects the importance that researchers have placed on tackling the public health challenge of improving the physical health of people with SMI.TABLE 5 Comparing the overlap and agreement between included qualitative and quantitative data ( continued ) Themes from qualitative studiesWere the themes from the qualitative studies addressed in the quantitative studies?Comparing quantitative and qualitative data Group delivery formats: some reported that group-based interventions promoted peer support, a feeling of belongingness and togetherness, and a useful point of comparisonSeveral quantitative studies were group focused and others were largely individual focused, providing opportunities to compare the impact on effectiveness of these delivery methodslDisagreement/partial agreement: meta-regression analyses found that individual-focused interventions were associated with greater weight loss ( -2.70 kg, 95% CrI although quantitative data highlight the benefits of individually based interventions, they cannot rule out benefits of group interventions Choices and adapting the intervention to suit the individual: the importance of adapting interventions for the needs and preferences of those participatingPartially: a small number of interventions sought to tailor intervention content and risk behaviour targets to the individualSilence: there were insufficient studies to explore the impact of such approaches on effectiveness Purpose to activity: some reported that interventions provided an overall sense of purpose beyond changing specific targeted behavioursNot specifically addressed Silence: no overlap between quantitative and qualitative studies Valued benefits of behaviour change interventions: some reported experiencing additional benefits beyond the interventions, including greater confidence and wanting to build on what they 'd already achievedNot specifically addressed Silence: minimal overlap between quantitative and qualitative studies N/A, not applicable.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Many people with SMI reported more holistic goals for well-being encompassing both physical and mental health. Attempts to change risk behaviours sit in a complex context of mental health, lifestyle and environment that interact with behaviours and affect the individual experience of change. This difference in emphasis in the quantitative studies is reflected in the focus on outcomes related to those behaviours targeted in interventions. For example, quality of life was rarely a primary outcome (Gaughran et al.67was an exception). Mental health outcomes were even less often reported in health risk behaviour intervention studies, once more reflecting a slightly different focus in these interventions than that reported in the qualitative data. The lack of overlap between the experiences of people with SMI and intervention design suggests that future intervention trials may benefit from greater input from people with SMI in both designing and delivering interventions. Self-medicating Another subtheme from the qualitative studies was the perception among participants that smoking, alcohol use and drug use played a role in managing their mental health symptoms (i.e. 'self-medicating '). This was indirectly targeted in some studies (e.g. by including BCTs related to mental health symptoms such as reducing negative emotions) or assessing whether or not participants increased cannabis use after quitting smoking.69However, interventions rarely reported strategies for tackling the problem of self-medicating directly. Motivational contexts and barriers to change For the sake of brevity, we considered motivational contexts and barriers to change in combination in this analysis, as there was a large overlap in content between the quantitative and qualitative findings. Individual motivations and barriers to change Evidence from the synthesis of qualitative studies identified a range of individual factors that acted as motivations or barriers to change. Several trials sought to address these factors using BCTs such as problem-solving, and pros and cons. We investigated the impact of BCTs on outcomes using component NMAs. There were sufficient data for only weight and BMI outcomes. The component NMAs were inconclusive in terms of whether or not including these BCTs was associated with effective reduction of weight or BMI. Social motivations and barriers to change Evidence from the synthesis of qualitative studies identified a range of social factors that acted as motivations or barriers to change. Family and friends, as well as fellow participants in interventions, were often identified as sources of motivation to engage in behaviour change. However, these same people could also be unsupportive and overly critical, and their presence could act as barriers to change. Several quantitative studies sought to use social support as a positive factor for encouraging behaviour change. These interventions included BCTs such as social support (unspecified), social support (practical) and social support (emotional). There were sufficient data to explore the impact only of social support (unspecified) in component NMAs of weight and BMI. However, these analyses were inconclusive on the benefits of this BCT.INTEGRATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk50Environmental motivations and barriers to change Qualitative studies reported the importance of environmental factors acting as barriers to change (e.g. participants sharing 'war stories 'about previous use of alcohol and other drugs). We did not identify any quantitative studies that specifically addressed these barriers. In addition, it was not pos sible to assess if such barriers lead to unintentional adverse effects in interventions. Participants also reported interventions as providing a helpful structure and accountability that helped them to engage in healthier behaviours. Although this was not specifically assessed in quantitative studies, the qualitative data provide further insights into contextual factors associated with intervention delivery that may have an impact on effectiveness. This further highlights the importance of including process measures in assessments of the delivery of BCT interventions. Experiences of behaviour change interventions Tailoring interventions to people with severe mental illness One of the subthemes from qualitative studies was the need to tailor interventions for people with SMI. Various aspects of tailoring were discussed, including additional help to organise thoughts. Some reported difficulty with concentrating and also the challenge of accepting information when exper iencing delusions. Others reported that interventions provided structure, routine and accountability th at helped them to put into practice what they had learnt. Although some quantitative studies reported tailoring interventions for people with SMI, often, little detail was reported. Therefore, although we could assess the impact of tailoring of interventions in the meta-regression analyses, it was difficult to tell the extent to which types of tailoring reported in qualitative studies mapped onto those reported in quantitative studies. The meta-regression analyses found that there was insufficient evidence from quantitative studies to confirm that studies reporting tailoring of interventions for people with SMI were more effective in reducing weight or BMI. Knowledge and skills to enact behaviour change There was clearer agreement between the quantitative and qualitative evidence on the need for knowledge and skills acquisition as part of a behaviour change intervention. Qualitative studies found that people with SMI valued learning how to engage in more healthy behaviours and how to build on incremental changes. This was confirmed in the component NMAs in which the BCT instruction on how to perform a behaviour was associated with effectiveness in reducing weight and BMI. However, the impact of the BCTs 'information about health consequences 'and 'demonstration of the behaviour 'were inconclusive in the component NMAs. Group delivery formats Data from qualitative studies identified several benefits of group interventions, including fostering peer support and providing a point of comparison to assess progress in changing a behaviour. However, a disproportionate number of included studies in the synthesis of qualitative studies were focused on experiences of group interventions. Therefore, the reported benefits of these interventions may have been over-represented in the review. The meta-regression analyses that focused on delivering interventions to individuals were found to be more effective than interventions that focused on group delivery to reduce weight and BMI. This does not necessarily rule out the benefits of group interventions, but it may suggest that the benefits of group interventions (in terms of outcome) are different from those of individual interventions.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Choices and adapting the intervention to suit the individual The value of adapting interventions to the needs and abilities of the person was commonly reported in qualitative studies. However, there were insufficient studies that reported choice of which behaviours/activities to focus on, or adaptation of intervention content, to assess their impact on outcomes. Qualitative studies may have identified subtle distinctions in delivery between individuals that are not straightforward to quantify, but that may still be important when supporting people with SMI to change their behaviour. Purpose to activity Another subtheme from qualitative studies was that interventions provided a sense of purpose and routine to life. These wider benefits of interventions are difficult to quantify and, therefore, tend not to be addressed in quantitative research, although literature on the importance of purpose and its association with health outcomes is beginning to emerge.151 Valued benefits of behaviour change interventions Other wider benefits of behaviour change (e.g. improvement in memory and cognition, self-esteem) were reported in qualitative studies. These broader outcomes were not commonly measured as part of quantitative studies, so we know little about these broader impacts in controlled studies.INTEGRATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk52Chapter 7 Patient and public involvement and dissemination of findings Patient and public involvement People with lived experience of SMI and carers significantly contributed to every stage of the project. Sophie Corlett (Director of External Relations, Mind) provided oversight on the progress of the project as a member of our multidisciplinary advisory group (including Dr Ian Kellar, health psychologist, University of Leeds; Dr Peter Coventry, health services researcher, University of York; D r Stephen Wright, psychiatrist, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust; and Professor Paul Fre nch, psychiatrist, Manchester Metropolitan University). In January 2019, we presented the aims of the project and received feedback on the protocol from the York Service User Network (a PPI group connected to Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust). We also formed two PPI groups that met throughout the course of the project. One group began meeting in York and consisted of four members, chaired by a carer for a relative with SMI (DS), one peer researcher (CD) and a peer researcher who is also a carer (HK). One further group member (a carer) was no longer able to attend after the first meeting because of other commitments. We also regularly met with two peer researchers (MS and GJ) who are members of the Lived Experience Research Collective hosted by the Mental Health Foundation. All the members of our PPI groups were included as authors of the report, reflecting their substantial contribution to the project. The PPI groups decided on the name of the project (HEALTH study), provided extensive comments on the protocol, contributed to interpretations of the study results, played a key role in disseminating the findings of the project, participated in the webinar and provided feedback on an animation summarising the findings of this project. Dissemination activities A study-specific Twitter account (@UoY_HEALTH_SMI, run by HM) (www.twitter.com; Twit ter, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) was created and has developed a presence over the course of the study, engaging in promotion and dissemination activities, which are reported below. On 2 March 2020, we published an article in The Conversation on the mortality gap in people with SMI.152At the time of writing (June 2020), the article had been read 14,742 times, with an audience mainly from the UK (1205 reads), USA (6785 reads) and India (2512 reads). The article was also widely shared on social media such as Twitter (14 times) and Facebook (737 times) (www.facebook.com; Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). We organised a webinar to communicate the findings of the study to people with SMI, carers, health and social care professionals, and researchers. To promote the webinar, peer researchers Gordon Johnston and Michel Syrett published a blog article in June 2020 on physical activity among people with SMI for the Mental Elf website.153 In addition, peer researcher Ceri Dare (see Patient and public involvement ) was interviewed by Andre Tomlin for the Mental Elf website on 23 June 2020.154DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Most were the UK ( n=116). We posted the recorded webinar on YouTube155and received a further 100 views, at the time of writing. We registered a hashtag (#HealthSMI) to monitor engagement with the webinar on Twitter. More than 100 people participated in the Twitter conversation. The webinar generated >200 tweets and >3,500,000 impressions. The event was chaired by Andre Tomlin (the founder of the Mental Elf website) and included presentations from the research team (NM and HM), including a peer researcher (MS). There was a panel discussion with a carer, former general practitioner and researcher (DS); peer researcher (GJ); and a physiotherapist and researcher (Brendon Stubbs). Audience members were also assigned to one of nine 'breakout rooms 'for small group discussions on the implications for practice and research, facilitated by members of the research team (NM, HM, PC, ER, DS, SD and RC) and peer researchers (GJ and MS). Summaries and feedback from each small group were used to inform conclusions of the study. The webinar concluded with two Zoom polls (audience members rated their key implications for practice and further research) and a reflection from peer researchers (MS and GJ). Equal access for people with SMI to health risk behaviour interventions was, by far, the most popular implication for practice. Identifying how best to adapt health-promoting interventions for people with SMI was the most popular research recommendation. We commissioned a production company to develop an animation summarising the findings of the study; this was disseminated through YouTube and Twitter from 7 July 2020.156 Through links with the UK Research and Innovation Closing the Gap Network, we have written an article summarising the findings from the synthesis of qualitative studies for the Equally Well blog, published on 11 August 2020.157 We also plan to continue disseminating the findings of the study in peer-reviewed publications in 2022.PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk54Chapter 8 Discussion Summary of findings Summary of synthesis of quantitative studies We identified a growing literature on smoking (eight trials were included in the narrative synthesis of smoking abstinence and seven trials were included in the narrative synthesis for number of cigarettes smoked). Interventions focusing on smoking alone were generally more effective than controls at increasing the odds of abstinence, whereas studies targeting smoking in addition to other risk beha viours (such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse) did not find evidence of increased odds of abstinence. However, there was a great deal of conceptual heterogeneity, including the intensity of control groups and smoking interventions across trials. Data on reducing the number of cigarettes smoked varied widely between studies. This made it difficult to draw conclusions on the clinical effectiveness of risk behaviour interventions for this outcome. For all other behavioural outcomes, data were limited. By far the most commonly reported outcomes were weight (30 trials included in the NMA) and BMI (36 trials included in the NMA). Interventions targeting diet alone, physical activity alone or diet and physical activity concurrently all appeared to be effective in improving weight loss (e.g. any intervention vs. TAU: -2.10 kg, 95% CrI -3.14 to -1.06 kg) kg/m2, 95% CrI -0.97 to -0.01 kg/m2). The magnitude of weight loss and reduction in BMI did not appear to differ substantially between studies targeting diet or physical activity alone and studies targeting diet and physical activity concurrently. We also did not find evidence of positive synergies in targeting diet and physical activity to promote weight loss or reduction in BMI. Improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol outcomes as a whole were modest (e.g. systolic blood pressure, any intervention vs. TAU: -1.23 mmHg, 95% CrI -3.34 to 0.68 mmHg). However, in contrast to the other outcomes, targeting multiple behaviours appeared to result in greater improvements. Targeting diet (e.g. systolic blood pressure: 0.42 mmHg, 95% CrI mmHg, 95% CrI -5.43 to 4.97 mmHg) led to modest improvements, whereas effect estimates were higher in trials targeting diet and physical activity (e.g. systolic blood pressure: -1.56 mmHg, 95% CrI -4.42 to 0.98 mmHg) and also in trials targeting diet, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking (e.g. systolic blood pressure: -2.17 mmHg, 95% CrI -5.46 to 0.59 mmHg). This potentially reflects synergies in targeting multiple health behaviours in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Fewer data were reported on quality of life and mental health outcomes. We found no evidence that interventions aiming to reduce physical health risk behaviours in people with SMI led to negative impacts on mental health (PANSS total score: 0.03, 95% CrI -2.56 to 2.65) or health-related of life (SMD -0.04, 95% CrI -0.14 to 0.06). However, there was also no evidence that interventions promoted physical health-related quality of life (SMD 0.06, 95% CrI -0.04 to 0.16). There was limited overlap of BCTs in included studies, which reduced our ability to assess the impact on effectiveness and how BCTs interacted with one another. Goal-setting was associated with w eight loss (-2.22 kg, 95% CrI -4.54 to -2.91 to -0.69 kg/m2). Instruction on how to perform the behaviour was also associated with weight loss ( -2.10 kg, 95% CrI -3.42 -0.70 kg/m2, 95% CrI -1.42 to 0.07 kg/m2), although it was not possible to rule out no benefit.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

However, all estimates of interactions were very imprecise, so we could not draw any conclusions on how the effects of specific BCTs interacted with each other. Similarly, lack of reporting of data limited our abilities to explore the impact of other intervention and participant characteristics. However, we found that interventions focusing on delivery to i ndividuals were more effective on weight loss than group-delivered interventions ( -2.70 kg, 95% CrI -2.15 to -0.01 kg/m2). of synthesis of qualitative studies We used the CERQual approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. All themes were rated to be of moderate certainty. Interaction of mental and physical health Participants reported that engaging in health behaviours improved their mental health and well-being, and mental health changes affected their engagement with healthy behaviours. Participants in the included studies wanted to be treated holistically, and sometimes felt that interventions had an impersonal focus on behaviours rather than people. There were also data reporting the use of smoking, alcohol use and drug use to help manage mental health symptoms. Motivational contexts for behaviour change A range of individual factors were reported to be personally motivating. These included ma naging health, improving physical appearance and working towards a positive future. Family and friends were also an important source of motivation, providing feedback and reinforcement of positive change. However, others could also be discouraging when they were careless with their words or actions. Interventions were interpreted as a safe and stable place to work on changing their unhealthy behaviours, also providing a schedule and accountability, which helped to make changes. Barriers to behaviour change Mental health symptoms affected individuals 'ability to change. For example, it can be difficult to engage in physical activity when feeling a lack of motivation and low mood related to mental health state, likewise with difficulty concentrating when receiving information related to health. However, mental health symptoms were not the only factors affecting motivations. A general lack of motivation to change unhealthy behaviours was also unrelated to mental health for some. Stigma about body image was another factor considered to act as a barrier to change. Social support from family and fri ends, although often a positive influence, could also act as a barrier. For example, some family members encouraged unhealthy behaviours. Alternatively, a lack of social support was a barrier for persevering with behaviour change. Environmental factors could act as triggers for unhealthy behaviours (e.g. advertisements on television), as could living in group homes where peers shared their experiences of engaging in risk behaviours. Experiences of behaviour change interventions It was suggested that people with SMI needed additional help providing structure and assistance in organising their lives. This was considered an important aspect of tailoring interventions for people with SMI. Interventions providing education and imparting skills to promote healthy behaviours were also considered beneficial. Group interventions were helpful for building peer support and also as a point of comparison with others, which could be double-edged if used to police behaviour. Interventions that took into account the needs, abilities and preferences of participants were felt to be beneficial. A wealth of data reported that interventions had an impact on individuals 'lives beyond just improving their health-related behaviours. For example, interventions sometimes provided a structure and purpose to everyday life. Interventions also helped to build confidence: if positive changes were made in one area of their lives, then it was thought possible in other aspects of life.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk56Integrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies The integrative synthesis generally showed limited overlap between quantitative and qualitative studies. Many of the themes in qualitative studies, such as importance of interventions benefiting the person as a whole rather than just specific health-related outcomes, were not directly addressed in quantitative studies. Similarly, qualitative studies reported that people with SMI engaging in physical activity interventions experienced wider benefits than simply improving their physical activity. Interventions often provided purpose and organisation to people 's lives that affected their overall well-being. Although this was captured by trials measuring broader outcomes (such as quality of life) to some extent, interventions were rarely designed to take advantage of these benefits valued by many people with SMI. The lack of overlap between the quantitative and qualitative evidence may suggest the importance of people with SMI contributing to the design and delivery of interventions. Such interventions may go some way to addressing the needs and preferences of people with SMI, especially in relation to addressing both physical and mental health together. Quantitative and qualitative studies agreed on the importance of gaining knowledge and skills to live healthier lives. This theme from the qualitative literature was backed up by the component NMAs that found that the BCT instruction to perform behaviour was associated with weight loss and reduction in BMI. Strengths and limitations of the review Strengths This systematic review had a number of strengths. As far as we are aware, this is the first systematic review comparing the clinical effectiveness of multiple and single health risk behaviour interventions among people with SMI using NMAs. This is also, to our knowledge, the first systematic review to examine the effectiveness of BCTs using component NMA in people with SMI. In addition, as far as we are aware, this is the first systematic review of qualitative studies on experiences of a broad range of multiple risk behaviour interventions in people with SMI. This is also the first systematic review, to our knowledge, to have integrated quantitative and qualitative studies on this range of health risk behaviours in people with SMI. Limitations As noted previously, there were very limited data for most behavioural outcomes [diet, physical activity, alcohol use and drug use (e.g. cannabis use)]. This is surprising, given that these interventions are designed to change behaviour. Even if the primary outcomes of most trials were weight, BMI or clinically related outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol), the mechanism by which interventions aimed to affect these outcomes was mainly through behaviour. Most studies targeted diet and physical activity; therefore, we have limited data on studies targeting a single risk behaviour (e.g. unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption or drug use). Similarly, we have limited data on studies investigating the effects of interventions targeting a more extensive combination of risk behaviours. This limits our ability to draw conclusions on the comparative benefits of targeting risk behaviours in isolation or in combination. There were sufficient data to compare any risk behaviour intervention with TAU for quality-of-life outcomes. However, the more complex models, with separate nodes for interventions targeting different BCTs, lacked data. Similarly, there was limited overlap in the BCTs targeted between studies. This limited our conclusions on what BCTs were more effective and the extent to which their effects on outcomes interact.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Therefore, it is unclear whether or not ethnicity has an impact on the effectiveness of interventions. There was a lack of overlap between quantitative and qualitative evidence. Therefore, it was difficult to assess the relationship between these sources of data. A further limitation is that we did not search specifically for grey literature (other than conference abstracts indexed in electronic databases), and we were only able to assess studies in languages understood by the project team (i.e. English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese). Comparison with previous systematic reviews One way to compare our findings is with systematic reviews of multiple risk behaviour interventions in the general population. A 2017 systematic review10in the general population found a more developed literature on behavioural outcomes. Multiple risk behaviour interventions were associated with improvements in fruit and vegetable intake, fat intake, total physical activity and moderate/vigorous physical activity. However, the current review found very limited reporting of behavioural outcomes. In both reviews, comparable data were available on weight and BMI. However, the method of analysing multiple risk behaviour interventions differed a little. The general population review combined all interventions targeting weight ( -0.59 kg, 95% this current review, among people with SMI, we assessed the effectiveness of interventions targeting diet and physical activity for weight ( -2.12 kg, 95% -1.07 to 0.04 kg/m2), which suggested a slightly larger improvement in both than was observed by combining all interventions targeting these outcomes in the general population. We also assessed the effectiveness of interventions targeting diet, physical activity, alcohol misuse and smoking concurrently. This review found that these sorts of interventions resulted in a smaller reduction in weight (1.27 kg, 95% CrI -1.46 to 0.98 kg/m2) than was observed in the general population. Taken together, interventions among people with SMI appear at least as effective on weight loss and reducing their BMI as those among the general population. It is also important to compare our findings with systematic reviews specifically on trials of people with SMI. A 2019 review158focusing on weight management in people with SMI found similar results to our current study. As above, methods of pooling data were a little different. Speyer et al.158conducted an analysis combining all interventions with all controls. They also found similar modest benefits on weight (-2.25 kg, 95% CI is a much wider literature on pharmacological interventions for promoting smoking cessation among people with SMI.28Although many of these trials provide addi tional behaviour change interventions (along with pharmacological interventions), the content is usually the same for both intervention and control groups; therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions in this context. However, our findings are consistent with broader reviews of pharmacological and/or behavioural interventions28of smoking cessation, which also found that smoking cessation interventions were of similar effectiveness to those found in general population samples. Systematic reviews of qualitative studies in this area on people with SMI have mainly focused on smoking cessation.159Despite the wider range of risk behaviours included in our review, there were many overlapping themes such as the importance of tailoring interventions, addressing the common perception that smoking helps manage mental health symptoms (when the relief experienced is likely attributable to relieving symptoms of nicotine withdrawal: the 'misattribution hypothesis ') and the importance of social support.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk58Chapter 9 Conclusions Implications for practice This review found preliminary support for focusing on smoking alone rather than targeting smoking in combination with other behaviours. For weight loss and reduction in BMI, there did not appear to be evidence of synergies when targeting more than one health behaviour at a time, although targeting multiple health risk behaviours appeared to be more beneficial in reducing blood pressure. These findings are consistent with group discussions in our webinar on the importance of setting realis tic targets for behaviour change. Targeting multiple risk behaviours may have the potential to make some feel overwhelmed. This systematic review found no evidence that interven tions promoting health behaviours were associated with deterioration in mental health symptoms or mental health-related quality of life. Group discussions and polls from our webinar suggested that this was a key finding. This was rated as the key implication for practice and was a common theme across our discussion groups. Many webinar participants noted that this evidence challenged the tendency towards a risk-averse approach that had low expectations of people with SMI making positive changes to health risk behaviours. Another key implication from the systematic review was the need for communication between staff and people with SMI on the goals of health risk behaviour interventions. Qualitative data found that people with SMI favoured holistic approaches to well-being that integrated the promotion of physical and mental health, whereas the quantitative data, mainly led by researchers and health-care pro fessionals, consisted of trials focused on smoking cessation and weight loss. This may reflect important differences in the aims of such interventions between people with SMI and professionals delivering interventions. Our webinar group discussion also provided important context to these challenges. Several webinar participants pointed out potential barriers to a more holistic approach. Mental and physical health care in many services are often provided separately, which makes it difficult to deliver holistic approaches, because of a lack of multidisciplinary teams. In addition, some staff spoke of the training needs of delivering integrated interventions that aimed to promote both mental and physical health. Providing choice and adapting interventions for the needs of the individual were key implications from the qualitative data. These included taking into account the preferences and capabilities of each individual and taking into account the challenges of managing a mental health condition. Webinar group discussions emphasised the importance that 'one size does not fit all 'and the importance of adapting interventions to best reflect the person. Suggestions for further research Identifying how best to adapt interventions for the needs of people with SMI was the key research recommendation identified in our webinar poll. Although qualitative data showed that people with SMI valued the adaptation of interventions, the trial data rarely investigated how best to tailor interventions (particularly in trials aiming to promote weight loss). A recent trial has shown the benefits of adapting smoking cessation interventions for people with SMI.69The many gaps between findings from the qualitative literature and the quantitative literature suggests the importance of future research being co-produced by people with SMI. Future quantitative research should take advantage of qualitative evidence to inform future trials, as well as how to develop these. Elements of co-production were missing from the evidence base, and discussion with our PPI group highlighted the importance of stakeholder engagement from the beginning.DOI: 10.3310/NFIZ5916 Health and Social Care Delivery Research 2022 Vol. 10 No. 6 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2022.

Epidemiological evidence shows that weight gain increases exponentially in the first year after diagnosis. However, few trials in this review targeted participants at this stage in their lives. Future trials are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of health risk behaviour interventions among people with SMI who have recently received a mental health diagnosis. We also identified a lack of studies with follow-up data of at least 12 months post intervention, although current data suggests that, at 6 months 'follow-up, BMI and weight loss are maintained. These findings need to be confirmed in future research to assess the long-term benefits of health risk behaviour interventions, as well as potential barriers such as the impact of episodic depression and anxiety or periods spent as an inpatient in a psychiatric facility. We found few trials that directly compared interventions targeting multiple health risk behaviours with interventions targeting single health risk behaviours. As seen previously, targeting smoking alone may be more effective than targeting smoking in combination with other behaviours. Future research is needed to clarify which combinations of behaviours to target for interventions.CONCLUSIONS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk60Acknowledgements We would like to express our gratitude to the members of our advisory group for their support and contribution to the review: Dr Ian Kellar (University of Leeds), Dr Peter Coventry (University of York), Sophie Corlett (Mind), Dr Stephen Wright (Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust) and Professor Paul French (Manchester Metropolitan University).
