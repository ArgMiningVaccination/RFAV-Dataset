I get yearly medical physical, & my lab work was lower than 4 years ago, My cholesterol level was rising. I could not tolerate statins because of severe muscle cramping. After total cleanse, my cholesterol level dropped drastically. Lower than 4 years ago. I will purchase total cleanse again. *1 - The Power of Cleansing (EBook)PorshaI brought the book by mistake and when I called they wouldn't refund my money, I breezed through the book, the most interesting part was when it talked about what foods should be combined. *0 - The Power of Cleansing (EBook)AlexisI ordered The Power of Cleansing eBook along with the Full Body Cleanse and just finished reading it. It is a short 14-page eBook that basically answers the questions why adults and children alike need to cleanse. Quite frankly, it's disgusting to think of all of the toxins that we unknowingly put into our temples/bodies. It gave me even more motivation to live wiser and healthier as this will be my first time ever doing a cleanse. *1 * Testimonials are NOT intended for the advertisement, promotion, or marketing of our herbs, compounds, formulas, and cleanses but exclusively to give the people a medium to express their personal experiences under the right of \"free speech\" protected by U.S.Const.Amend.1.
