FEMAIL meets the Australian woman behind the successful Hanako Therapies to find out how such an unbearable moment helped Rachel Holm to grieve and later grow as a person. New passion: While she has always been in tune with her gut, it wasn't until Rachel Holm's (pictured) first baby was stillborn at 39 weeks in 2009 that she really discovered her passion for alternative healing Horrible time: The devastating tragedy (pictured) ignited a drive in her to discover more about alternative health, culminating in the foundation of her spiritual business, Hanako Therapies, which sells natural remedies ALTERNATIVE HEALTH - THE FACTS * Alternative therapies have been used for thousands of years. * Alternative therapy is defined as any form of medical treatment not covered by top medical school courses. * Alternative therapies can offer relief from a wide range of health problems. * The World Health Organisation estimates that between 65 and 80 per cent of the world's population rely on alternative medicine as their primary form of health care. * Half of all medical schools today now offer courses in alternative medicine. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Holm said she first discovered the powers of alternative therapy when she was in her twenties and working as a professional dancer. 'I'd been on tour for six months, I was tired and headache-y,' Ms Holm said. 'And so I decided to get some acupuncture and a massage. During the massage, I felt my body almost jump off the bed. It was incredible, but also incredibly strange. 'It was from that point that I knew my body responded to that sort of thing.' But it wasn't until she became pregnant in 2009 with her husband Jeff, that Ms Holm turned, once again, to alternative healing. 'My belief when I was pregnant grew and grew,' she said. 'I could feel this baby in my stomach, I was meditating and seeing an energetic healer at the time. 'But when I was given the news two days before my daughter Sierra was due to be born, my daughter had passed away. I was in so much shock I didn't understand what was going on. 'I needed my meditation and my energetic healer to help me process that intense, unbearable grief.' Out of body experience: Ms Holm says she first discovered the powers of alternative therapy when she was in her twenties and working as a professional dancer - she had an out-of-body experience during a massage When offered the opportunity to spend time with her stillborn baby daughter, Ms Holm agreed to bring little Sierra back to their family home in order to get some photos and video footage she could later look back on. 'It sounds weird, and it's not as though you're going to look at pictures of your stillborn baby all the time,' Ms Holm said. 'But it's all about making your baby real for you in order to help you grieve. 'We spent eight hours each day with Sierra for three days and during that time I did so much writing,' she continued. 'Every day I'd write pages and pages of how I felt. It was hard, but it helped. 'I really believe that if you take some time to sit in the heaviness of something that's happened to you rather than pretending it isn't real, you heal much faster in the long run.' Tragic shoot: But after her first baby was stillborn (pictured), Ms Holm agreed to bring little Sierra back to their family home in order to get some photos and video footage she could look back on Grieving process: 'It sounds weird, and it's not as though you're going to look at pictures of your stillborn baby all the time,' Ms Holm says - but it helps a mother to realise how real her situation is and come to terms with it And, somewhat miraculously, Ms Holm fell pregnant again ten months later. 'For those ten months, all I could think about was having another baby,' she said. 'But I needed time to grieve. When I became pregnant for the second time, with Willow, I got into alternative health even more. I sat in on an open day for energetic healing and felt totally inspired. 'I started taking a diploma course while I was expecting - in Energetic and Spiritual Healing. It really helped me to come to terms with Willow's pregnancy and how different it was from Sierra's. It felt earthy and gave me loads of energy.' How she healed: During the time of grieving for her stillborn daughter, Ms Holm did lots of meditation and yoga - she also turned to writing, where she says she wrote pages each day about how she felt Second joy: She later became pregnant for the second time ten months later, with Willow (pictured, right), whose pregnancy was 'earthy' - during this period, Ms Holm became even more interested in alternative health And when baby Willow was born in 2011 and Ms Holm finished her diploma course, the family of three moved over to the USA, where her business was later created. As they undertook a road trip across the country, Ms Holm struggled to find something that was child-friendly and natural that could help with Willow's carsickness - and so she set about putting together her own blend of essences. It was these essences that provided one of the first blends for Hanako Therapies - the 'Happy Tracks' essence. Major trip: When the family went on a road trip across the USA a few years later, Ms Holm's daughter, Willow, was carsick - Ms Holm used natural essences to restore Willow's health, which later formed the product 'Happy Tracks' in her business line Hanako Therapies now sells many natural essences made from substances from the earth, and, according to Ms Holm: 'For me, they're healing in a bottle. Before we set off each day, I would rub some on to Willow's wrists, feet and stomach. The result? No bucket, no tears...' And while she is the first to admit that not everyone wants something healing from an essence, she says that for her, the essences have helped her through many life events. 'I made one on the fourth anniversary of Sierra's death, called I am... Supported,' she said. 'For me, when I spray it, it provides a mindful moment that helps me deal with grief and shock. 'I am... Bliss, on the other hand, has helped me when as a mother I'm a little overwhelmed.' Tragedy into opportunity: Ms Holm later founded Hanako Therapies, which is her line of essences made from substances from the earth - 'Happy Tracks' (left) is good for restoring health, while 'I am...Bliss' is ideal for new mothers who are overwhelmed Sky's the limit: For Rachel Holm, she only wants her business to grow and grow - she is currently working on lip balms, body butters and a children's range According to the mother of two, there is something for everyone. 'A friend of mine spritzed a little handkerchief with I am... Bliss when her kid was missing her at school,' she said. 'Now he just smells it when he misses her and told my friend he instantly feels better.' As for the future, the sky's the limit for Ms Holm's business that has long since shed its tragic roots. 'At the moment, I'm experimenting with lip balms, body butters and a child range,' she said. 'My life inspires everything I do. When I first moved to the States and was out of my comfort zone, I needed essences that helped me to regain my balance. 'These days it's all about the children!'
