The absurdity of homeopathy simply can't be pointed out enough. The rise of homeopathy, crystal healing, and all that jazz are worrisome, and their increasing popularity says a lot about the poor state of science education and the loss of faith in the health care industry. I also think that it has a lot to do with the wall of separation between science and spirituality [that doesn't need to exist](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/09/07/the-theology-of-science-and-the-internet/). That wall of separation is a bad thing. It makes the spirtual wary of the sciences but overly credulous of non-scientific therapies. And it makes the sciences wary of anything that smacks of the spiritual, regardless of evidence of efficacy. Case in point: yoga and meditation often get lumped in with nonsense like homeopathy and chakras. That leads a lot of otherwise very good scientists to turn skeptic to dismiss legitimate studies regarding the efficacy of yoga and meditation as being harmless at best, and \"woo\" at worst. Meanwhile the actual woo peddlers use legitimate research in those realms to justify whatever crazy thing they feel like justifying, with nobody in the scientific community really giving any measured response. Moreover, the lack of respect means that it can be an uphill battle to do more legitimate research, and harder for reliable peer review. Which means that while there are definitely some good, reliable, reproducible yoga and meditation studies, there are also more than a few with poor methodologies. It's frustrating to me because while I'm very much in favor of science-based medicine, and very much opposed to pseudoscience, I think that there's something of a cultural bias - especially against meditation -that's unjustifiably dismissive. There are sound studies for its use as a legitimate therapy for pain relief, and lots of suggestive results that warrant a more rigorous inquiry. The complete dismissal of anything that smacks as \"spiritual\" as being legitimate therapy opens the door for every snake oil salesman to peddle their wares. Or worse - the perceived \"harmlessness\" or complementary nature of meditation can lead some practitioners to assume that things like crystals, etc. are equally harmless and encourage their patients in using them, figuring that \"they can't hurt.\" That undermines the legitimacy of real therapies vs. pseudoscience, and might mislead people into thinking that so-called \"alternative medicines\" can be used to treat more serious conditions like cancer or asthma because \"my doctor said it was okay!\" I get the apprehension of the skeptics, I really do. But just because a medical method may have its roots in religion or a non-scientific spiritual practice shouldn't make its scientific bona fides suspect if there are legitimate, repeatable studies about its efficacy. Should we start throwing out astronomical observations made hundreds of years ago because they were made in the service of astrology? Should we throw out the work of Jbir ibn Hayyn, the father of Chemistry, because many of his methods were employed to alchemical ends? That's absurd. Observations, especially observations gathered through controlled study through the scientific method, are data. Even if its data about something the hippies on campus are into, too. Now, back to homeopathy in particular, I can't really add much to my colleagues' comments, but I do think that no conversation about homeopathy should be allowed without reference to this brilliant skit by That Mitchell and Webb Look. That skit never fails to crack me up. "}
