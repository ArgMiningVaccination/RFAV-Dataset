IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH AND LIFE HEALING. MEDITATION. CHAKRA BALANCING. Improve your physical health, calm nerves, sleep better, raise your energy, reduce anxiety and stress, aid memory and focus, improve your mood Healing Vibes helps recalibrate the cells of your body to be back into balance by using color, sound, sacred geometry, affirmations and meditations to help you heal your body, mind and spirit. Your body is programmed to heal itself. You see this when a cut heals. This knowledge is within every cell of your body, but when your emotions, thoughts and soul are out of balance, those energies get stored and create ripples through your system which lead to dis-ease. Healing Vibes is a tool for you to use to help you get realigned. Use Healing Vibes daily and get your health back. Start your day off with wellness by listening to one of the healing tones or meditations. Then, use it throughout your day to help you reset when you notice fear, anxiety or stress creeping in. If you want to get well, you need to make changes in your life. There is no magic pill. Healing Vibes is a wellness tool to help you correct the imbalances and get your health back! ~ \"I LOVE this app! I love the affirmations! I am deleting Calm!\" ~ Shondra ~ \"Wow, this app really helps me calm and refocus at work!\" ~ Erin ~ \"The music is comforting & relaxing.

It is Amazing!\" ~ Kristine THE SCIENCE: Each of your cells is made up of energy which has been shown to have its own frequency of sound and light. When any part of your body deviates from its optimum frequency, that part of the body is out of balance or dis-eased and ultimately not functioning at its fullest. Sound and color therapies work by generating electrical impulses of energy which activate biochemical and hormonal processes in the human body to help bring balance back to the cells, systems and organs.
