Although patient-clinician communication research traditionally has focused on outcomes such as patient satis\u00adfaction, comprehension, and adjustment, we need to strengthen our understanding of how these impact health behaviors and dis\u00adease outcomes. As emphasized in the recent NCI-designated cancer center directors' report, Accelerating Success against Cancer, \"Patient-provider commu\u00adnications play a critical role in determining who will engage in health-enhancing lifestyles that reduce cancer risk. They impact the likelihood that a person at risk for cancer will seek and engage in appropriate screening, and they also determine whether appropriate pharmaco-therapies are used, and used appropriately to effectively blend with critical behavioral and lifestyle changes.\" Highlighting the need to integrate social, psychological, and commu\u00adnication research with biomedical research, NCI's Strategic Plan for Leading the Nation calls for research assessing the delivery and impact of patient-centered commu\u00adnication across the cancer care continuum, as well as inno vative measurement approaches and study designs to help monitor and track the success of communica\u00adtion efforts over the course of the patient, family, and health care provider experience. Since its creation in 1997, the Di vision of Cancer Control at the NCI has played an important lead\u00adership role in this essential area of research. Originally under the leadership of Dr. Barbara Rimer (now at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), we funded a major research initiative, the Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research, and a new surveillance tool, the Health Information National Trends Survey. As we celebrate the 10\u00adyear anniversary of the division and identify research priorities for the future, we continue to empha\u00adsize research on communication that is customized to patients' needs. To further our goals in this direction, we commissioned the following monograph, Patient- Centered Communication in Cancer Care: Promoting Healing and Reducing Suffering . Authors Ronald Epstein and Richard Street, Jr , propose a conceptual framework and describe the state of the science in patient-centered communication, noting several gaps in the research and the need to impro ve and diver\u00ad sify study designs and methods. Their thoughtful analysis chal\u00adlenges the research community to undertake more ambitious studies of communication processes that address the temporal and contextu\u00adal complexities of cancer care over the course of treatment and sur\u00advivorship. This will require the development and use of more sophisticated measurement and analysis techniques, and NCI remains committed to supporting this essential work. Understanding how to optimize the communication process between patients/f amily and the health care delivery team is essential to our goal of reducing the burden of can\u00adcer. We look forward to continued collaboration with researchers and practitioners to improve patient-centered cancer communication strategies and hope that this mono\u00adgraph will help to inform your own work in communication science. Robert T. Croyle, PhD Dir ector Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences National Cancer Institute x 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page xii Preface When faced with a cancer diagnosis, patients often experience significant emotional distress and feelings of uncertainty about their future. They have to deal with complex medical information and make dif\u00adficult, life-altering, treatment deci\u00adsions. Patients with cancer and their family members hope to receive care within a health care system that would provide them with an environment of unfailing support and focus on meeting their needs as best as possible. To facilitate the delivery of such \"patient-centered\" care and to enhance the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) mission of reduc\u00ading suffering due to cancer, the Outcomes Research Branch and the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences at NCI, have identified the assessment, monitor\u00ading, and improvement of the deliv\u00adery of patient-centered communication between patients/family and health care delivery teams across the cancer care continuum as a key research priority. Our prior work in the area of patient-clinician communication led us to identify the need for a comprehensi ve conceptual frame\u00ad work that would define core elements of patient-centered com\u00admunication that could then be operationalized into standardized metrics for collecting data in diverse cancer care delivery set\u00adtings. We also recognized the rela\u00adtive lack of understanding in the current literature on potential mechanisms by which patient-cen\u00adtered communication is lik ely to result in optimal patient health out\u00adcomes. To address these issues and to lay the foundation for future innovative research in this area, we commissioned this monograph, Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Car e: Promoting Healing and Reducing Suffering . The authors of the monograph, Ronald M. Epstein, MD, and Richard L. Street, Jr , PhD, have created a valuable piece of scholar\u00adship that has resulted from a criti\u00adcal synthesis of existing literature, the authors' personal research experience of more than 25 years, as well as discussions with a number of internationally recognized experts in the area of communication, oncology, health care delivery, quality of care assessment, and patient advocacy who participated in a symposium on patient-centered communication in cancer care that was organized by NCI during the course of the monograph project. Readers of the monograph should note that its focus is on optimizing communication processes between patients/f amily and health care delivery teams and not just the patient-physician dyad. Consequently, the authors' conception of the term \"patient-clinician communication\" in this monograph is very broad, with the term \"clinician\" referring to all professionals who provide care to patients within the cancer context, not just physicians, and the term \"patient\" being used as a proxy for both the patient and their family members who are involved in their care. This monograph is a critical first step in our ef forts to plan future NCI-funding opportunities that will facilitate innovative research studies in the area of patient-cen\u00adtered communication and patient outcomes. We hope researchers, practitioners, and policy makers will find it as beneficial in their respective work. Neeraj K.

Among the distinct features of cancer care that affect communication are that few other illnesses are both life-threatening and potentially cur\u00adable, that care involves numerous clinicians and multiple treatment modalities (such as oral and intra\u00advenous medications, radiation, and surgery); that there is often a long period of uncertainty after treatment, and that the patient's health care team often changes over time. In particular, communi\u00adcation in the cancer care setting must help patients: Receive bad news Handle the emotional impact of a life-threatening illness Understand and remember comple x information Communicate with multiple health professionals Understand statistics related to prognosis Deal with uncertainty while maintaining hope Build trust that will sustain long-term clinical relationships Make decisions about treat\u00adment, possibly including par\u00adticipation in clinical trials Adopt health-promoting beha viors As acknowledged by the American Society of Clinical Oncology 1 and Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports, 2-4 communication is a key clinical skill. Unfortunately, few guidelines exist to help clinicians and health care systems communi\u00adcate effectively with patients who have cancer. This monograph addresses com\u00admunication between patients and clinicians that embraces three core attrib utes of \"patient-centered\" care: consideration of patients' needs, perspectives, and individual experiences; provision of opportu\u00adnities to patients to participate in their care; and enhancement of the patient-clinician relationship. 5 In a 2001 IOM report, patient-centered\u00adness is noted to be a quality that relates not only to individual clini\u00adcians but also to the health care system (Figure 1.1). 4 That is, patient-centered care depends col\u00adlectively on clinicians, patients, relationships (clinical and social), and health services. The interac\u00adtions among these elements are complex, and the shortcomings of any one element can significantly decrease the quality of care a patient receives. 1 1 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 2 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Figure 1.1 Clinicians, patients, relationships (clinical and social), and health services are all integral to patient-centered care. The interactions among these elements are complex 5 and deficits in any one area can significantly decrease the quality of patient care. Patient-Centered Care Improved Communication Improved Health Outcomes Informed, activated, participatory patient and family Accessible, well- organized, responsive health care system Patient-centered communicative clinician We define patient-centered com\u00ad munication in terms processes and outcomes of the patient-clini\u00adcian interaction: 5 Eliciting, understanding, and v alidating the patient's perspective (e.g., concerns, feelings, expectations) Understanding the patient within his or her o wn psycho\u00ad logical and social context Reaching a shared understand\u00ading of the patient' s problem and its treatment Helping a patient share power by of fering him or her mean\u00ad ingful involvement in choices relating to his or her health Patient-centered communication also b uilds a stronger patient-clini\u00adcian relationship characterized by mutual trust, respect, and commit\u00adment. Ho wever, the outcomes of patient-clinician communication must extend beyond the interac\u00adtion; ideally, communication must also contribute to enhancing the patient's well-being and to reduc\u00ading suffering after the patient leaves the consultation. For exam\u00adple, a patient-clinician encounter that meets the four criteria noted here may do little to enhance the patient's well-being if a medical error occurred, if treatment was unacceptably delayed, if access to needed services was not available, or if subsequent family decisions undermined the intentions and decisions reached in the consulta\u00adtion. A model of patient-centered communication in cancer care not only must describe the process of ef fective communication between clinicians and patients but also must identify, account for, and/or control for contextual factors mediating and moderating the link between communication and health outcomes. 1.1 Process of Communication. I: Capacity for Effective Patient- Clinician Communication For communication to contribute to healing and reduced suffering, clinicians, patients, and their fami\u00adlies must have the capacity to engage in communication behav\u00adiors that contribute to the objec\u00adtives of patient-centered care. As individuals, clinicians and patients will communicate competently when each is motivated; has suffi\u00adcient knowledge, understanding, and self-awareness of what is required to communicate effec\u00adtively; and has suitable perceptual and linguistic skills to produce effective communication behaviors and adapt them appropriately. 6,7 1.1.1 Role of motivation Simply put, competent communi\u00ad cators w ant to be so. Although it is reasonable to believe that clini\u00adcians typically have a strong moti\u00advation to provide high-quality health care, several factors can interfere with this desire. As with many types of skills, an individ\u00adual's effort often wanes when experiencing fatigue, a factor that may contribute to medical errors. Some clinicians may set priority for their own needs over those of 2 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 3 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research patients; for example, rushing through a consultation to get back on schedule or avoiding a discus\u00adsion about uncomfortable or emo\u00adtionally laden topics. The commitment to patient-centered communication appears to be stronger for clinicians who value caring and sharing in the patient-clinician relationship 8,9 and approach communication as not simply the transfer of information but also as the formation of rela\u00adtionships. 10,11 Patients, too, must be motivated to talk openly and honestly about their concerns, fears, expectations, and preferences. Some patients may deliberately avoid topics they find embarrassing or uncomfort\u00adable to discuss (such as sexual activity), that they think the clini\u00adcian would disapprove of (such as disagreement with the clinician's recommendation), or that they believe are not pertinent to the interaction or the clinician's role (such as family relationships). 12 1.1.2 Role of knowledge Effective communication in health care settings requires that the clini\u00adcian and patient ha ve sufficient understanding of one another's perspectives, the health condition, and the purpose of the interaction. They also should share conversa\u00adtional norms and an understanding of each other's role in the interac\u00adtion. With respect to knowledge, a significant challenge for clinicians is having an accurate understand\u00ading of the patient's perspective, including his or her concerns, feel\u00adings, preferences, beliefs, and val\u00adues. With such an understanding, clinicians are better positioned to personalize treatment recommen\u00addations, use language the patient understands, provide clear expla\u00adnations, and validate or address the patient's emotional state. 12,13 Some research indicates that problems of misunderstanding may contribute to bias, especially when the race or ethnicity of the clinician and patient differs. 14,15 Although such knowledge can be learned through direct experience or vicariously through observation or experiential training, research indicates that clinicians often mis\u00adjudge patients' perspectives, including their preferences, 16,17 like\u00ad lihood to follow treatment, satis\u00adfaction with care 18 understandings and beliefs about health,19-21 or emotional states.22 With respect to patients, perhaps the greatest knowledge barriers are related to health literacy. This includes having an accurate under\u00adstanding of health in general, as well as of disease states, the care process, and health-related termi\u00adnology. 23 For example, with some understanding of health concepts and terminology, patients are better able to understand and talk about various topics that arise in cancer consultations. 24 This, in turn, increases the likelihood that patients can contribute to decision-making to the degree they wish and more capably provide informed consent. 23,25,26 Thus, patient education interventions aimed at increasing patient involvement not only should encourage patients to be more acti ve communicators (i.e., the motivational aspect of capacity) but should also provide patients with cognitive resources (e.g., con\u00adcepts, terminology) related to their health concerns. 26 1.1.3 Role of skill: clinicians The capacity to produce patient- centered communication also depends on tw o types of skills: behavioral and perceptual. Several clinician behaviors can be consid\u00adered \"patient-centered,\" given research that shows them to fre\u00adquently correlate with patient satis\u00adfaction, adherence, and improved health outcomes (Table 1.1). 27-30 Some behaviors, especially those in the nonverbal domain, are directly a function of one's motivational state and orientation toward the patient. For example, a clinician who cares about the patient and is genuinely interested in what the patient has to say will naturally have eye contact, be nonverbally attentive, and talk about topics raised by the patient. Other behav\u00adiors may require more cognitive effort, especially if they are not part of the clinician's communication style, such as avoiding interrupting the patient early in the consultation. Still other behaviors may be quite novel for clinicians\u2014such as explaining disease processes in everyday language\u2014and consider\u00adable training and practice may be necessary before these behaviors can be carried out effectively. From a communication perspec\u00ad ti ve, the most effective clinicians 3 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 4 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Table 1.1 Examples of Patient-Centered Clinician Behaviors Nonverbal Behaviors Maintaining eye contact Forward lean to indicate attentiveness Nodding to indicate understanding Absence of distracting movements (e.g., fidgeting) Verbal Behaviors Avoiding interruptions Establishing purpose of the visit Encouraging patient participation Soliciting the patient's beliefs, values, and preferences Eliciting and validating the patient' s emotions Asking about family and social context Providing sufficient information Providing clear, jargon-free explanations Checking for patient understanding Offering reassurance Offering encouragement and support are those who have a patient-cen\u00ad tered communication \"style\" that they use across their consultations and in multiple contexts. 30 For example, research shows that some clinicians routinely provide more information; engage in partnership building; use supportive communi\u00adcation, including reassurance and encouragement; and are more will\u00ading than other clinicians to talk about psychosocial topics. 31-33 A clinician's style of communicating emerges from a variety of sources, including socialization (e.g., as related to gender 33,34 or culture35); repeated experience with certain kinds of patients, such as children or individuals older than 65 years; medical training; 35-37 and philoso\u00ad phy of care.8 Clinicians also must have observa\u00adtional skills and an appropriate level of self-awareness. Few stud\u00adies have focused on clinicians' mindfulness and self-monitoring, but the lack of these skills may lead to unexamined biases, careless errors in clinical practice, 38,39 and confusion between the emotional needs of the patient and those of the clinician. 40,41 Patient-centered clinicians presumably would be more successful when monitoring the dynamics of the interaction, including their role in the encounter, the patient's role, and the way in which the encounter is unfolding. These clinicians also are aware of differences between the patient's and their own explanatory model of the patient's health and will explore the patient's model in order to identify potentially prob\u00adlematic incongruities. 21,42 Because they have a more general orienta\u00adtion to the patient's perspective, as well as an awareness of their own feelings, patient-centered clini\u00adcians should be able to accurately assess the patient's needs and be less likely to act on the basis of perceptual bias and stereotyping. Perceptual and self-a wareness skills that recognize and prevent bias are particularly important in light of research indicating that physicians perceive some patients less favorably than others 43,44 and that these attitudes may affect the quality of care patients receive. 43,44 The principles of self-monitoring, self-calibration, and self-awareness during clinical practice have been formalized in discussions of mind\u00adful practice\u2014practice character\u00adized by the capacity for attentiveness to one's own internal processes, curiosity in the face of disconfirming data, informed flexi\u00adbility, and presence. 45-47 Some train\u00ad ing programs for cancer clinicians have incorporated self-awareness activities. 48-52 However, few empiri\u00ad cal studies have explored how self-awareness enhances clinical practice. Admittedly, there may be some sit\u00aduations\u2014such as a medical emer\u00adgenc y or a self-destructive patient\u2014that call for clinicians to use a communication style in which they strictly control the con\u00adtent of the interaction, focus on biomedical issues, interrupt, use closed-ended questions, and make decisions for patients. However, as a general rule, \"clinician-centered\" communication does little to enhance care or bring the patient's perspective into the encounter. 1.1.4 Role of skill: patients To achieve patient-centered care, patients with cancer must commu\u00adnicate in a w ay that reveals their needs, preferences, expectations, 4 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 5 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research concerns, and perspectives. Particularly important are active communication behaviors such as asking questions, expressing con\u00adcerns, being assertive in stating opinions and preferences, introduc\u00ading topics for discussion, and telling their \"health stories\" (Table 1.2). 53 These behaviors are \"active\" forms of communication because they interject the patient's perspective into the interaction and have the potential to influence the clini\u00adcian's behavior and decision-mak\u00ading. 32,33,54-56 By contrast, a patient who remains passive during the interaction does little to convey his or her needs, fears, expectations, beliefs, and preferences. Health outcomes may be at risk in these situations, and the encounter will not satisfy the patient's need to feel known, understood, or heard or satisfy the clinician's moral obliga\u00adtion to address the patient's under\u00adlying concerns in order to maximize healing. Patients vary in their abilities to be acti ve communicators. Although we are aware of no studies that have examined the communication of a particular patient across inter\u00adactions with different clinicians, research indicates that patients' communicative styles are associ\u00adated with social, cultural, and personality factors. For example, the degree to which patients with cancer are active participants in consultations has been linked to their level of education 24,57,58 and ethnicity.59 In other clinical set\u00ad tings, more active patient participa\u00adtion is associated with orientations to the patient-clinician relation-Table 1.2 Examples of Active Patient Communica\u00adtion Behaviors Asking questions Communicating assertively Offering opinions Stating preferences Interrupting, if necessary Sharing beliefs about health Introducing topics for discussion Expressing concerns and feelings Expressing emotions Disclosing fears and worries Noting frustration Telling one's health \"story\" in the context of everyday life ships (e.g., shared control vs. physician control),60 gender,61 and personality.62 1.1.5 Implications for improving patient-clinician communication Future research should focus on the most ef fective and efficient ways to expand clinician and patient capacity for patient-cen\u00adtered communication, particularly in the skill domain. Because per\u00adsonality and socialization are rela\u00adtively stable attributes of individuals after age 30, 63 skill- building in communication style and observation is particularly important early in a clinician's medical training, before these beha viors become more habitual and intractable with age and repeated performance. More research needs to be done on the pedagogical methods that can help clinicians acquire and efficiently deploy patient-centered behaviors, develop the perceptual acuity to assess the patient's situation accu\u00adrately, maintain a sense of self-awareness, and monitor the course of the encounter. To be effective, the instruction will need to use multiple techniques, such as role-playing, group discussion, testimo\u00adnials, patient or expert feedback, self-assessment, and practice. 64-66 Given that misunderstanding and subconscious bias are particularly problematic when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds, research is especially needed to develop models for cul\u00adtural competency training involv\u00ading patient-centered care. An individual patient, on the other hand, has fewer encounters with clinicians than an individual clini\u00adcian will have with patients. Thus, patients' communication behaviors are conceivably more modifiable. Patient \"activation\" interventions are most successful when patients 65-68 Believe in the legitimacy of their participation in care Have some information about their health condition and treatment options Learn specific communication strate gies and behaviors to use in their interactions with clinicians 5 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 6 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Receive the intervention in a timely f ashion so that they have an opportunity to imple\u00adment the suggestions Culturally appropriate resources are important for patient interv entions as well, as research has shown that patients in minority groups and with lower socioeconomic back\u00adgrounds are often less participatory than their counterparts 24,59 and that some patient education interven\u00adtions are less effective for such individuals. 69,70 Clinician and patient interventions are reviewed in greater detail in Appendix E. 1.2 Process of Communication. II: Aligning Patient and Clinician Perspectives Although the behaviors listed in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 often character\u00adize patient-centered communication at the level of the individual com\u00admunicator, effective (or ineffective) communication is fundamentally an outcome of the interaction between the clinician and the patient and family members. Thus, patient-centered communication occurs when both parties communicate in a way to reveal, understand, and, ideally, align their respective per\u00adspectives on the patient's health. We use the term \"alignment\" to capture the fact that effective com\u00admunication is a process that requires cooperation, coordination, discovery, negotiation, and recon\u00adciliation in order to achieve mutual understanding, an accur ate diagno\u00ad sis, shared goals, an appropriate treatment plan, and a stronger patient-clinician relationship. Three issues are most relevant to the alignment process: communi\u00adcation is a process of mutual influ\u00adence, clinicians and patients need to ha ve common goals for the encounter, and clinicians must make appropriate adaptations to meet the patient's needs. Although individual behaviors have been the subject of communication research, the process of alignment rarely has been studied. 1.2.1 Communication as a process of mutual influence As with all communication encoun\u00ad ters, the clinical consultation is jointly constructed by the partici\u00adpants as the y weave together com\u00ad municative actions to create the conversation. How one participant communicates will affect the com\u00admunication of the other. 71 The fact that interpersonal communication is a process of mutual influence has important implications for patient-centered communication. If a patient believes that his or her per\u00adspective is not being addressed, he or she can use active communica\u00adtion tactics such as asking ques\u00adtions, interrupting, and expressing worries that may elicit more interest and inquiry from the clinician. For example, by asking a question, stat\u00ading an opinion, or expressing con\u00adcerns, the patient explicitly provides information that the clinician can use to meet the patient's needs more effectively. This approach also serves to introduce conversational content the clinician is expected to address. Indeed, clinicians often are more informative, accommodative, and supportive with patients who are forthcoming with questions, concerns, opinions, and prefer\u00adences. 32,33,54,56,60 Similarly, if a patient with cancer is passive, a clinician could use partnering and other facil\u00aditative behavior such as asking for the patient's opinion or concerns, or offering encouragement. Such behaviors generally elicit greater patient involvement because the clinician's communication both legitimizes and specifically asks for the patient's views. 24,59,60,71,72 In short, many of the behaviors listed in Table 1.1 can elicit those in Table 1.2, and vice versa. 1.2.2 Aligning communication goals Within any clinical encounter, both the clinician and patient ha ve goals for the interaction. These goals are related to each person's expecta\u00adtions, preferences, and perceived purposes of the consultation. Sometimes these goals may be quite specific and explicit, such as deciding on cancer treatment, or discussing the side effects of radia\u00adtion. Other goals may be more gen\u00aderal and vague; for example, a patient may want to avoid dis\u00adcussing sexual dysfunction as a side effect of prostate cancer treatment, or a clinician may hope that the patient does not get \"emotional.\" Communication goals can be prob\u00ad lematic in consultations for se veral reasons. First, clinicians and patients often assume that the other shares the same goals, an assump\u00adtion that may be erroneous because clinicians and patients may have different expectations, preferences, 6 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 7 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research and needs during the encounter. A large body of research demon\u00adstrates that concordance between patients' and physicians' goals is generally poor unless these goals are made explicit, preferably early in the interview. 17,73-76 Patient and clinician concordance on shared understanding of goals and expec\u00adtations is important, as research links the lack of concordance to lower patient satisfaction and adherence. 18,76 Also, not all patients may have the same goals. For example, some patients want to talk to their clinicians about family and work relationships; others think these topics are not pertinent to the consultation. 77 Physicians may assume that a patient wants diagnostic testing for reassurance, but the patient may not necessarily want more tests. 78 Without verify\u00ad ing that the clinician and patient share the same goals, the consulta\u00adtion may unfold with the clinician accomplishing his or her agenda, believing it is the patient's agenda as well. The patient may appear to be listening cooperatively, while in reality he or she may be frustrated by the course of the consultation but does little to communicate that frustration to the clinician. In a particular series of consulta\u00adtions, an indi vidual patient may seek many different things: Care for routine surveillance Test results Discussion of treatment options Evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment Relief of symptoms Causal explanation about the disease or symptoms Dispelling of fears (the patient' s or the family's) that serious disease is present Consideration of decisions about current and future care Administrative purposes (work e xcuse, prescription refill) In addition, a patient may simply w ant to be understood. On the other hand, clinicians make choices about what to discuss. As mentioned previously, they may avoid some topics in an attempt to stay on schedule. They also may consider some issues, such as mak\u00ading sure that the patient under\u00adstands the treatment options, more appropriate than others, such as discussing the patient's family problems. On an individual level, a clinician or patient may ha ve multiple, sometimes conflicting goals. As an example, a patient with cancer may want to talk about his or her feel\u00adings of losing hope, yet want to be perceived as strong and a fighter; a clinician may want to be support\u00adive but feels a need to scold a self-destructive patient. Moreover, these goals and preferences may change during the course of the consultation (e.g., a patient ini\u00adtially wants to make a treatment decision but then wants the clini\u00adcian to decide; a patient does not want chemotherapy but decides to schedule it after hearing the clini\u00adcian's reasoning). Patients with multiple and conflicting goals may communicate with some degree of inconsistenc y or vagueness, thus highlighting the need for the clini\u00adcian and the patient to make explicit the goals relevant to the consultation. More research is needed to understand the impact of incongruity and malleability of cli\u00adnician and patient goals on the communication in the consultation, the decisions reached, and the sub\u00adsequent follow through. 1.2.3 Adapting to meet the patient' s needs While communication is character\u00ad ized by mutual influence, these influences are often belo w the level of awareness. One key defining ele\u00adment of effective patient-centered communication is the clinician's ability to monitor and consciously adapt communication to meet the patient's needs. The observational and perceptual skills described ear\u00adlier provide guidance for how clini\u00adcians can appropriately adapt their communication. An obvious, but important, form of adaptation is presenting information in a way the patient understands. For example, when discussing diagnostic infor\u00admation, an observant clinician will detect subtle, nonverbal cues of patient confusion and either rephrase or restate the information. Also, periodically checking for patient understanding will help the clinician determine whether com\u00admunicative adaptations are needed. A clinician may approach the dis\u00adcussion of cancer treatment options in a cognitive, rational way but notice that the patient is emotion\u00adally distraught. In this circum\u00ad 7 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 8 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care stance, a patient-centered clinician would validate and explore the patient's emotions before continu\u00ading the discussion of treatment options and may decide to spend more time at that particular visit offering reassurance or support. A second area important for align\u00ad ment is disco vering the way in which patients want to be involved in decision-making. Clinicians are not particularly good judges of patients' preferences for involve\u00adment in decision-making in the cancer setting. 16,17,73 Thus, it is important to identify these prefer\u00adences and make appropriate adapta\u00adtions. An oncologist who routinely solicits and encourages patient involvement in decision-making may take more responsibility if he or she senses that the patient wants this. This clinician may still actively encourage the patient to talk about his or her concerns, how\u00adever. Conversely, clinicians who have limited perceptiveness or a fixed communication style will have less adaptability and will find they interact with some patients effectively but have considerable difficulty with others. Lastly, communication errors and misinterpretations are quite com\u00admon in con versation and even more likely in cancer settings, where cognitive complexity and emo\u00adtional intensity are particularly common. Thus, conversation repair is a normal and expected form of communication adaptation. Conversation repair is needed when there is a difference between how the clinician and the patient define or interpret words or concepts. For example, a clinician may describe a potential side ef fect of a medication as \"rare,\" considering it to mean a 5% chance of occurrence; however, most patients would consider \"rare\" to indicate a probability of 24% (standard deviation, 30%). 79 Similarly, in discussions of advance directives and resuscitation, the question of \"doing everything\" often arises; 80 yet, families and patients may not have the same understanding as the clinician about the extent of \"everything.\" These kinds of miscommunications are even more likely when clini\u00adcians and patients are not of the same race, ethnicity, or socioeco\u00adnomic status. 14,15,81 On discovering these misinterpretations, clinicians can adapt their communication by simply rephrasing the information or perhaps engaging in a detailed discussion to unravel the miscom\u00admunication about therapeutic goals or actions. 9,82-84 The key skills for clinicians are to recognize these miscommunications and make appropriate conversational repair. 1.2.4 Implications for improving patient-clinician communication Clinicians vary their communica\u00adtion with dif ferent types of patients. Studies have shown that clinicians often talk more about relationships and feelings with female patients 85 and give more information to better educated patients, 33,35 and white patients.86 In addition, clinicians sometimes talk in more simplistic terms to older patients 86 and vary the tone and length of their consultations depending on the nature of the patient's illness. 87,88 An important direction for future research is to evaluate whether these adaptations are appropriate responses to the patient's needs or inappropriate responses that are driven by clini\u00adcian bias or prejudicial attitudes. Lastly, little is known about how patients monitor , adapt, and respond to specific situations. Apter's rever\u00adsal theory 89 suggests that in situa\u00ad tions of low emotional distress, patients make communicative adap\u00adtations to meet their information needs, emotional needs, or treat\u00adment preferences. For example, a patient who has accepted the fact of a cancer diagnosis might bring con\u00adcerns about the side effects of chemotherapy to the clinician and discuss different management options with few emotional over\u00adtones. This patient might be able to interject his or her perspective when given the explicit opportunity in response to a question or a clini\u00adcian's partnering behavior. More assertive patients may introduce a new topic of discussion even with\u00adout the clinician's invitation. However, in situations characterized by high levels of physical discom\u00adfort, anxiety, cognitive complexity, and/or ambiguity, the same patient may become overwhelmed because the cognitive and emotional burden exceeds his or her capacity to adapt to the requirements of the situa\u00adtion. 90 In those cases, clinicians may need to adopt a different communi\u00adcation style than would ordinarily work well for that patient. 8 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 9 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research Similarly, clinicians can become overwhelmed, and as a result, dis\u00adtance themselves from the patient and fail to elicit and respond to the patient's needs. Of particular con\u00adcern are communicative adjust\u00adments clinicians make in response to ambiguous symptoms or poor prognoses. Recent findings suggest that when patients present symp\u00adtoms that do not conform to typical disease patterns (\"medically unex\u00adplained symptoms\"), physicians tend toward premature closure, explore those concerns less thor\u00adoughly, and offer less validation and empathy. 91 When encountering a patient with an incurable cancer, a sympathetic clinician may attempt to reduce his or her own anxiety or the patient's anxiety by inflating estimates of a favorable prognosis. 92 The clinician's task, then, is to restore sufficient comfort and order so that the patient can participate to the degree that he or she is capable. 1.3 Communication and Outcomes of Car e Patient-clinician communication may contribute directly or indi\u00adrectly to a number of outcomes, a partial list of which is presented in Table 1.3. From a patient-centered care perspective, patient-clinician communication should contribute positively to at least one of three sets of outcomes; the first two, quality of the encounter and inter\u00admediate outcomes (e.g., adherence, self-care efficacy), may contribute to the third, health outcomes (improved survival, subjective well-being, and functioning). 1.3.1 Quality of the encounter Judgments of effective patient-cli\u00ad nician communication and quality of care can come from multiple perspecti ves\u2014the patient, the clini\u00ad cian, and third parties. These per\u00adceptions are not necessarily congruent and often are highly Table 1.3 Outcomes of Effective Communication subjective. For example, an oncol\u00adogist may believe that his or her performance was effective because he or she provided the patient with extensive treatment information and was optimistic about the prog\u00adnosis. However, the patient may have been dissatisfied because the oncologist dominated the conver- Communication outcomes Strong patient/family\u00ad clinician relationships (trust, rapport, respect, involvement of family and caregivers) Effective information exchange (recall of information, feeling known and understood) Validation of emotions (e.g., empathy) Acknowledgment, understanding, and tolerance of uncertainty Patient participation in decision-making Coordination of care Intermediate outcomes Strong therapeutic alliances Patient knowledge and understanding Emotional self-management High-quality medical decisions (informed by clinical evidence, concordant with patient values, and mutually endorsed) Family/social support and advocacy Patient self-efficacy, empowerment, and enablement Improved adherence, health habits, and self-care Access to care and effective use of the health care system Health outcomes Survival and disease-free survival - Prevention and early detection of cancer - Accurate diagnosis and completion of evidence-based treatment - Maintenance of remission Health-related quality of life - Functioning: cognitive, physical, mental, social, and role - Well-being: physical, emotional - Health perceptions Societal outcomes Cost-effective utilization of health services Reduction in disparities in health and health care Ethical practice (e.g., informed consent) 9 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 10 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care sational floor and did not let the patient fully discuss his or her fears. Both clinician and patient may believe they had engaged in collaborative decision- making even though there may be no behavioral evidence of such when a video recording of the encounter is evaluated. 93 Lastly, the clinician and patient may believe they had a high-quality encounter although a chart audit finds evidence of inade\u00adquate care. Although a patient-cen\u00adtered care perspective might emphasize the patient's judgment of quality, our contention for can\u00adcer care is that the perspectives of all stakeholders\u2014patients, clini\u00adcians, relevant third parties (e.g., family members, clinic administra\u00adtors)\u2014must be recognized and, when discrepant, aligned. From the patient's perspective, ef fective cancer communication should promote overall satisfaction with care as well as satisfaction with the clinician's technical skills, the clinician's communication, and the decision reached. Other indicators of high-quality care from the patient's viewpoint might be considered proximal outcomes of communication, such as the following: Feeling understood by his or her clinician Actively participating in the interaction Gaining an improved under\u00adstanding of the diagnosis and treatment options Obtaining help in coping with uncertainty Establishing trust in his or her clinicians and the health care system These outcomes are tied directly to the quality of patient-clinician communication, both past and cur\u00adrent. In other w ords, positive or negative experiences in the past may influence how the patient per\u00adceives the quality of the current encounter. Although much less studied, the clinician' s perceptions of effective communication are also important. These outcomes include the fol\u00adlowing: Satisfaction with the encounter Sufficient understanding of the patient' s perspective (beliefs, values, concerns, preferences) to guide further medical care Sense of having provided high- quality health care (e.g., the patient is satisf ied, is committed to a treatment plan, and leaves the interaction with a sense of purpose, hope, and optimism) Rapport with the patient (trust, cooperation) While the patient's judgment of quality of care may be related to intermediate patient outcomes such as self-care skills and adherence to a treatment plan, the clinician' s judgment of quality relate to job satisfaction and a lower level of burnout, 94 both of which may affect the quality of future interactions with patients, 95 attitudes toward patients (including bias), patient adherence, 96 and even quality of care delivered.97,98 Quality of the encounter also can be assessed from the viewpoint of other stakeholders. Family mem\u00adbers' perceptions of quality of care are important because their views may reinforce or contradict the patient's judgments. When a fam\u00adily member's views differ from those of the patient, family rela\u00adtionships may be strained, perhaps lowering the patient's quality of life or becoming a barrier to the patient's commitment to treatment. Administrators and insurers have a perspective on the patient-clinician encounter (e.g., guideline adher\u00adence, evidence of medical errors), especially as it relates to assessing quality of care, efficient and appro\u00adpriate use of resources, and reduc\u00ading risk of litigation. These perspectives are often not aligned, yet there is little research on how the alignment might be improved. More studies are needed to com\u00adpare the patient's, family's, clini\u00adcian's, and other stakeholders' assessments of quality of care, and, importantly, to evaluate the com\u00admunication factors that affect their respective judgments and the degree of congruence among them. 1.3.2 Communication and intermediate outcomes For patient-clinician communica\u00ad tion to contrib ute to healing and reduced suffering in cancer care, it must activate mechanisms that directly affect health. In this mono\u00adgraph, we propose that most of the health benefits of effective patient-clinician communication are from its role in accomplishing intermedi\u00adate outcomes (Table 1.3). These 10 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 11 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research intermediate outcomes include appropriate medical decisions and patients with a stronger sense of agency, self-care skills, and com\u00admitment to treatment. For example, a patient-clinician encounter that produces greater patient under\u00adstanding of the benefits of tamox\u00adifen should lead, in turn, to better adherence to a therapy that has proven effectiveness in preventing breast cancer recurrence. If a patient with prostate cancer leaves a con\u00adsultation with an accurate under\u00adstanding of the risks and benefits of brachytherapy and feels involved and satisfied with a decision to undergo this treatment, he may be better prepared to cope with the potential side effects and thus have better emotional well-being. If, dur\u00ading a consultation, a patient with colon cancer learns sufficient self-care skills for managing a colostomy, he or she may be better able to cope with the day-to-day management of fecal discharge in a way that did not interfere with social functioning. These potential pathways that link communication to improved health are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. Clinician and patient perceptions of ef fective communication can con\u00ad tribute to, but do not guarantee, actual improvement in patient's health or health behavior. Kinmonth et al. 99 found that patients more sat\u00ad isfied with their diabetes care (an indicator of quality of care) actually gained more weight following the visit (an indicator of poorer diabetes management) than did less satisfied patients. Perhaps satisfied patients were less vigilant of their own self-care responsibilities. In most cases, acti ve patient participation is a posi\u00ad tive feature of patient-clinician interactions, but some negative con\u00adsequences may emerge. For exam\u00adple, when patients made explicit requests for antidepressant medica\u00adtions they saw advertised on televi\u00adsion, physician prescribing increased not only for patients with major depression but also for patients with questionable clinical indications. 54 1.3.3 Communication and health outcomes The two primary outcomes of ef fective communication should be improved survival and improved quality of life, particularly health-related quality of life. Even though, theoretically, better communication can lead to better treatment choices, the e vidence is scant for direct links between spe\u00adcific patient-clinician communica\u00adtions and measurable changes in survival or the biological course of disease. However, there is growing evidence that communication can directly affect the patient's emo\u00adtional well-being and psychologi\u00adcal symptoms. For example, adults with cancer have reported more hope, 100,101 and children with cancer have experienced less anxiety and depression 102 when physicians were open about the diagnosis and prog\u00adnosis. According to Schofield et al., 103 communication that may lower anxiety included preparing the patient for diagnosis, giving the patient clear information, provid\u00ading written information, discussing questions and feelings, and being reassuring. Additionally , empathy reduces patient anxiety and emo\u00adtional distress. 104,105 However, the relationship between patient-clini\u00adcian communication and patient's emotional states can be quite com\u00adplex. For example, patients with cancer are often very anxious about common physical symptoms (i.e., the fear these symptoms might be related to the cancer) and the clinicians' use of reassurance can reduce this anxiety. In some cases, however, providing reassur\u00adance may worsen outcomes if it appears to avoid the focus of the patient's anxiety or is offered before the patient can express his or her concerns. 106 Little is known about how the patient's communication during a consultation affects emotional well-being. Some studies indicate that a patient's participation in decision-making may result in greater levels of anxiety, 107 perhaps due to a greater sense of responsi\u00adbility for treatment outcome. On the other hand, patient involvement may lead to greater satisfaction, which, in turn, is associated with less emotional distress. 105,107,108 In short, much more research is needed on how patient-clinician communication and clinician-fam\u00adily communication affect health outcomes directly and through var\u00adious mediators. We will address some of these issues in Chapters 3 and 6. 11 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 12 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care 1.4 Understanding the Importance of Context As with all forms of communica\u00ad tion, patient/family-clinician inter\u00adactions are situated within multiple layers of context, including the fol\u00adlowing: Disease factors (e.g., type of cancer , stage of disease) Family and social environment Cultural context Media environments (e.g., co verage of health topics, access to information through the Internet) Health care system Societal factors (e.g., laws, socioeconomic status) Obviously, an attempt to account simultaneously for all elements of conte xt that potentially affect all aspects of communication and can\u00adcer outcomes would be futile. Hence, in this monograph, we adopted the following as a way to make the role of context manage\u00adable. First, context is important for can\u00ad cer communication because it is a source of potentially po werful mediators and moderators of patient-centered communication processes and outcomes (discussed in Chapter 3). Second, we hold that the primary conte xt for the processes of patient-centered communication is the interpersonal context\u2014the actual encounter among clinicians, patients, and families. In other words, what unfolds in these encounters is a function of the par\u00adticipants' goals, perceptions, and communication capabilities, as well as the communicative actions of the other participant(s) in the encounter. 71 The type of health care system; media coverage of a can\u00adcer issue; cultural aspects, such as the degree of fatalism and spiritu\u00adality; and insurance coverage can influence whether clinician and patient even have a consultation at all. However, once the patient and clinician interact, these contextual factors influence communication through their effect on the interac\u00adtants' goals, perceptions, and behaviors. For example, a clinician and patient may discuss experi\u00admental treatment as one option only if the patient lives in a loca\u00adtion where phase 3 clinical trials are being conducted. Family mem\u00adbers may pressure a patient toward unconventional therapies which, in turn, may affect how the patient discusses treatment options with the clinician. Third, as will be discussed in Chapter 3, conte xt is a source of moderators that reinforce or con\u00adstrain the various pathways linking communication to improved health. Examples of such effects include a patient's stronger intent to follow through on a treatment decision when family members support such a decision; a patient's decision to stop chemotherapy because of news stories of miracu\u00adlous recoveries from herbal treat\u00adments; or a patient's decreased sense of personal control because of a spiritual belief that his or her fate rests in God's hands. Lastly, the communication issues of importance and the rele vance of certain outcomes depend heavily on whether the patient is at a par\u00adticular phase of the cancer care continuum: prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, or end of life. In Chapter 4, we will examine cancer communication processes and outcomes within each of these phases. 1.5 Conclusion This chapter provides an overview of patient-centered communication with a specific focus on how effec\u00adtive communication depends not only on clinicians' and patients' individual capacity for competent communication but also on their abilities to adapt behavior and align their perspectives to accom\u00adplish shared goals. We identified several levels of outcomes that can be linked to effective communica\u00adtion, ranging from quality of care within the encounter itself to health improvement long after the consultation is over. However, it is also important to recognize that patient-clinician communication is embedded within multiple layers of context that can moderate and mediate the relationships between communication processes and out\u00adcomes. Future research must lead to an understanding of the ecology of cancer communication to pro\u00advide insight into how best to design interventions to improve cancer care. 12 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 13 Chapter 1: A Patient-Centered Approach to Cancer Communication Research References (1) American Society of Clinical Oncology .

How breast cancer outpatients percei ve interac\u00adtions. Patient Educ to 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 17 A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Our goal in this and the next three chapters is to develop a framework that can guide future research in patient-clinician communication in cancer settings. The framework should have sever\u00adal qualities; it should be Simple enough to be generally understood and useful Complex enough to account for clinical reality Designed to involve all relevant players, including dif ferent types of patients, families, cli\u00adnicians, and health care systems Applicable to the relationship between clinical communica\u00adtion and rele vant patient health outcomes Furthermore, the framework should contain measurable com\u00admunication behaviors and mean\u00adingful links between the players, functions, and desired health out\u00adcomes. Our framework for patient-cen\u00ad tered communication processes and outcomes in cancer care is organized around six core func\u00adtions of patient-clinician commu\u00adnication (Figure 2.1): Fostering healing relationships Exchanging information Responding to emotions Managing uncertainty Making decisions Enabling patient self- management These functions, however, are nei\u00ad ther independent nor hierarchical. Rather , they overlap and interact to produce communication that can affect important health out\u00adcomes. Consider the situation of a woman with breast cancer who has been advised to take tamox\u00adifen for five years after initial treatment. Several factors are nec\u00adessary to maximize the likelihood that she will follow through with this recommendation. She should trust her clinical team, have infor\u00admation about side effects, know ways to manage her fears and anxiety, understand the uncertain\u00adties implicit in any treatment rec\u00adommendation, have participated in the decision to take tamoxifen, and remember to take the medica\u00adtion. Interactions among these functions can be complex and recursive. For example, clinicians who provide high-quality infor\u00admation may be more trusted, which, in turn, may reduce patient anxiety. Conversely, patients who are excessively anxious may have difficulty assimilating informa\u00adtion, which, in turn, may affect trust. Far more is known about some of these functions than others. There are hundreds of articles and sever\u00adal reviews of patients' information 2 17 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 18 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Figure 2.1 The six core functions of patient-clinician communication overlap and interact to produce communication that can affect important health outcomes. Responding to Emotions Exchanging Information Making Decisions Fostering Healing Relationships Enabling Patient Self-Management Managing Uncertainty Health Outcomes needs and sources and on patients' preferred roles in decision-making. There are also published articles about responding to patients' emo\u00adtions and the patient-clinician rela\u00adtionship in general. The literature on uncertainty and enablement is sparse, but the absence of prior studies should not diminish the importance of the role of these factors in effective communica\u00adtion. Research to date pertaining to these communication functions is summarized briefly here, with more extensive literature reviews and references in Appendices A through D. In this chapter, we describe the six functions and associated commu\u00adnication behaviors for both clini\u00adcians and patients. In the next chapter, we discuss various \"path\u00adways\" through which these func\u00adtions affect outcomes of care and factors that moderate the relation\u00adships between communication and outcomes. In Chapter 4, we dis\u00adcuss each of the functions and pathways within the context of each phase of the cancer care continu\u00adum. As previously noted, we use the words \"clinician\" and \"patient\" to refer to all relevant members of the health care team and patients' family units, respectively. 2.1 Fostering the Patient- Clinician Relationship Patient-centered cancer care requires patient/family-clinician relationships that are characterized by trust and rapport. Furthermore, all parties should have a mutual understanding of each other's roles and responsibilities. Relationships are stronger when clinicians work to maximize the likelihood that patients and families will partici\u00adpate actively in clinical encoun\u00adters. This may involve addressing issues that can create disparities in care, such as those related to race, ethnicity, language, and literacy. Fostering effective relationships 18 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 19 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care between clinicians and patients also requires clinician self-aware\u00ad ness and is related to clinician well-being. Appendix A contains a detailed literature review of rela\u00adtionship factors in cancer commu\u00adnication. Healing relationships are more than sources of information and e xpertise; they also provide emo\u00ad tional support, guidance, and understanding. 1-3 These relation\u00ad ships can help patients adjust bet\u00adter to their illnesses, 3-6 perhaps par\u00ad tially by increasing social support, by providing early recognition of symptoms and emotional respon\u00adsiveness, and by attenuating the effects of uncertainty. When inter\u00adviewed, patients with cancer and their families say that they value clinicians' enduring characteris\u00adtics\u2014caring; trust; continuity; and feeling known, acknowledged, and connected\u2014more than specific communication techniques. 4,7-11 Patients' perceptions of their physicians' overall interpersonal style can be quite nuanced, 12 yet patients' questionnaire ratings about their health care experiences tend to reflect an underlying glob\u00adal sense of the physician rather than specific behaviors. 13 In the following discussion, we focus on several factors that contribute to strong relationships, including trust, respect, and mutual under\u00adstanding about roles and responsi\u00adbilities, as well as the clinician-related factors of self-awareness and well-being. The patient's and family's trust in the clinician is a perception that the clinician will be present, com\u00admitted to the patient's best inter\u00adests, and technically competent. P atients with cancer have reported greater trust in their physicians following consultations in which they perceived the physician to be informative, they were allowed to participate in the decision-making process, and they believed that the physician was sensitive to their concerns. 14,15 However, the rela\u00ad tionship between trust and the patient's communication can be complex. On the one hand, a patient may be more open and willing to discuss personal and sensitive topics with clinicians they trust. 16 On the other hand, patients who are trusting may feel less of a need to seek information and be involved in decisions, instead leaving these matters to the clinician. 7 A trusting relation\u00ad ship can both depend on and facil\u00aditate communication. Less is known about clinicians' trust of patients, but trust arguably must be mutual to have a committed and functional relationship in can\u00adcer care. Rapport is a perception of connec\u00ad tion with another indi vidual based on respect, acceptance, empathy, and a mutual commitment to the relationship. 17 Rapport is accom\u00ad plished both verbally, by express\u00ading interest in another's views, dis\u00adcussing shared goals and interests, and responding to emotions, as well as nonverbally, through directly facing another, using facial expressions of attentiveness, and speaking in an appropriate tone of voice. 18 A sign of rapport is reciprocity of positive affect and mutual engagement. For example, a clinician' s question may signal interest and concern, which, in turn, helps the patient elaborate on sensitive issues. 19 Rapport enhances the strength of relation\u00adships and leads to more satisfacto\u00adry interactions. One of the most important tasks in cancer care is for the clinician, patient, and f amily to establish and negotiate, if necessary, their respective roles in the relationship . Patients and clinicians have expec\u00adtations for each other's role and behavior in the encounter. 20-22 Sometimes the roles are clear and mutually agreed upon at the outset of the interaction, as would be the case when both clinician and patient prefer greater clinician control of the consultation and decision-making. Sometimes the expected roles are discrepant and must be reconciled, such as when both clinician and patient want more control over the decision-making process. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the alignment process is often successful when clinician and patient cooperate and coordi\u00adnate their communication to estab\u00adlish mutually agreed upon norms for their relationship. Regardless of their preferences for the clinician' s communication style, patients and their families generally want to be involved in the process of care, be informed of all the treatment options, feel lis\u00adtened to, and feel that their physi\u00adcians know them as people, not simply diseases. 23-25 In order to be involved and to feel understood, patients must be able to effectively 19 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 20 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care and actively communicate their needs, concerns, and perspecti ves. Many of the features of patient communication that facilitate involvement were discussed in Chapter 1, such as an assertive communication style, linguistic skills (e.g., health literacy), and belief in the legitimacy of patient participation. 26,27 Correspondingly, clinicians can facilitate patient involvement in the relationship by engaging in the following: 28-30 Partnership building and encouragement Joint agenda setting Active listening Taking measures to ensure patient understanding Nonverbal behaviors convey\u00ad ing empathy and w armth Some researchers have examined congruence between what patients with cancer prefer re garding their involvement in medical decisions and what physicians perceive patients' preferences to be. 31,32 However, few studies have been carried out in the cancer setting to compare the preferences of clini\u00adcians and their own patients about each other's roles in the decision-making process. More research needs to be conducted on these issues, as discrepancies between the expectations of a clinician and patient for their relationship may lead to frustration and misunder\u00adstanding. Clarification, open dis\u00adcussion, and accommodation can repair misunderstanding, 33 but often, misunderstandings remain unaddressed. Often the discordance between cli\u00adnicians' and patients' expectations is subtle, especially when the clini\u00adcian is not carefully monitoring the interaction and the patient does not actively state his or her own views and expectations. These fac\u00adtors may explain why clinicians are not very accurate judges of patients' preferences, a situation further complicated by differences in race, language, ethnicity, or educational level. 34 Alignment of clinicians' and patients' expecta\u00adtions likely occurs when clinicians are more aware of and attentive to patients' needs and when patients express their beliefs about the rela\u00adtionship openly. When patients and physicians are aligned in their preferences for control in the rela\u00adtionship, patients report greater endorsement of the physician, sat\u00adisfaction with care, and intent to adhere to treatment. 21,35 To date, little research has exam\u00adined the effect of clinician well\u00adbeing and self-awareness on com\u00admunication and healing relation\u00adships and the effect of the patient-clinician relationship on clinician satisfaction, attitudes, and behav\u00adior. As noted in Chapter 1, com\u00admunication requires clinicians' ongoing capacity for attentiveness and self monitoring 36,37 in order to identify patients' perspectives and distinguish them from their own. 38 Clinicians' ability to be attentive is also related to their own well\u00adbeing. Clinicians who report burnout or job dissatisfaction also report lower quality of clinical care and demonstrate decreased capacity for empathy. 39-48 With these factors in mind, self-aware\u00adness, sharing of feelings and responsibilities, self-care, develop\u00ad ment of a personal philosophy, and limit-setting have been incorporat\u00aded into some clinician training programs. 40,46,49-54 Because many cli\u00ad nicians find relationships with patients to be a major source of meaning in their work, 55 stronger patient-clinician relationships will likely contribute to higher job sat\u00adisfaction and less burnout, and, in turn, higher quality of care. 2.2 Exchanging Information Patients with cancer and their fam\u00adilies seek information about the cause, diagnosis, treatment, prog\u00adnosis, and psychosocial aspects of the illness. Attending to informa\u00adtion needs is important not only to help the patient gain knowledge about his or her illness, but also to develop a strong patient-clinician relationship, to assist patients with decision-making, and to reduce patients' uncertainty. 56-58 Providing patients with information tends to increase satisfaction, 59 facilitate participation in the consultation, decrease anxiety, and increase ability to cope. 60 Patients with can\u00ad cer and their families often use their information resources not only to understand the disease but also to find hope. 61-63 A review of selected literature on information exchange in cancer settings is pre\u00adsented in Appendix B. Important changes have occurred in the process of information e xchange over the past four decades. Historically, the clini\u00ad 20 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 21 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care cian's role has been to provide disease-related information and recommendations, and the patient's role has been to share symptoms and concerns. However, increased attention has been given to patients' opinions, needs, beliefs, values, and prefer\u00adences. In addition, patients bring disease-related information to the consultation, often from discus\u00adsions with other health profes\u00adsionals, lay informants, family members, media sources, and, especially, the Internet. Thus, there is a need to rethink research on patient-clinician information exchange, which has largely taken the deficit model. With a focus on insufficient information, the deficit model emphasizes that patients with cancer want as much information as possible 64,65 and do not receive enough information from clinicians. 66 However, we embrace a process model of infor\u00ad mation exchange that focuses on the reciprocal efforts of both cli\u00adnician and patient to manage information and achieve, even negotiate, a shared understanding of the medical and personal issues underlying the patient's health condition. The wide availability of health information on the Internet can cause patients to become frustrated by information \"overload\" and their inability to clearly understand their health status and appropriate course of treatment. 67 Clinicians must help patients filter and understand clin\u00adical information, a sine qua non for informed or participatory decision-making. 58,68,69 Moreover, information content varies accord\u00ading to the phase on the cancer care continuum: Prevention: discussing risks and benef its of screening with asymptomatic patients Diagnosis or recurrence: shar\u00ading bad ne ws and explaining test results Treatment: Interpreting results of clinical trials for making decisions These information-sharing tasks are challenging. Related issues that are critically important to ef fective information management include uncovering the patient's information needs and understand\u00ading what the patient knows and believes about health, including the meaning the patient ascribes to the illness. 2.2.1 Patients' information needs The information needs of patients with cancer dif fer among patients, change over time,68,69 vary depend\u00ad ing on the type and stage of can\u00adcer, and persist throughout the cancer care continuum. 70 Most patients report that they want to know as much information as pos\u00adsible about their type of cancer and the treatment options 71,72 but often are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information pro\u00advided by clinicians, the mass media, and the Internet. 67 However, some patients do not want infor\u00admation and use avoidance as a coping mechanism. 73 At the same time, the family also may be requesting information. The diffi\u00adculty in effectively managing information is further compounded by the f act that clinicians often feel uncomfortable providing information about sexuality and inquiring about psychosocial and emotional needs. 62,71,74-78 Clinicians do not always appreciate the com\u00adplexity of patients' and families' concerns 79,80 and thus may not get to the \"heart\" of the matter. The absence of perceptual skills (Chapter 1) to detect the patient's expressed needs may explain in part why many patients and family members remain dissatisfied with the timing and amount of informa\u00adtion they are given by clini\u00ad cians. 62,66,75,76,78,81 As discussed in Chapter 1, asking patients about their information needs, providing clear explana\u00adtions, avoiding medical jargon, and checking for understanding are patient-centered communication behaviors that facilitate effective information management. 81-83 Ideally, when patients perceive they are not getting sufficient or clear information, they should ask questions or express their views or concerns, actions that typically elicit more information from clini\u00adcians. Correspondingly, clinicians should realize that patients want information and should find ways of eliciting their information needs. Asking about information needs is especially important for patients with cognitive deficits or limited health literacy, as such patients may want information but be less assertive and take more time with their physicians in get\u00adting it. 84 Health care systems can also help address the patient's 21 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 22 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care information needs by providing the following: Audio recordings of clinical consultations to help patients with cancer recall and assimi\u00adlate information 85 Multimedia resources that help e xplain complex features of disease and treatment options29 Educational resources that pro\u00advide instructions for patients and their f amily members on how to use the Internet to get the most useful information 86 2.2.2 Understanding what patients kno w and believe about health Clinicians, patients, and families often ha ve very different illness representations,87 otherwise known as explanatory models,88 or \"lay\" or \"common sense\" models of health and illness. 89-91 Illness repre\u00ad sentations consist of ideas and expectations about causality, time course, treatment, and prognosis and shape how patients respond to illness. These representations are the ways in which patients make sense of and react to their experi\u00adences of the illness. However, there are often unexplored differ\u00adences between clinicians' and patients' illness representations, which can lead to misunderstand\u00adings and may lower quality of care. For example, a patient who believes that pain is an inevitable feature of cancer may not report new painful symptoms, thus delay\u00ading diagnosis of a potentially treat\u00adable recurrence. Because commu\u00adnication- related disparities in health care may stem from cultur\u00adally mediated misunderstandings, clinicians should mak e particular efforts to understand patients' ill\u00adness representations during cross-cultural health care encounters. Illness representations are learned from a variety of sources, includ\u00ading mass media, the Internet, fami\u00adly, friends, and coworkers. 92 One of the factors contributing to differences in patient and clinician understanding of health informa\u00adtion is that existential aspects of illness shape how patients interpret and use the information they have. Uncovering the meaning of the ill\u00adness to the patient is an important part of the information-exchange process because patients with can\u00adcer often find that information not only helps them to understand the disease but also helps them to find hope, 61-63 to feel known and under\u00ad stood by their caregivers,10 and to ascribe spiritual and other mean\u00adings to illness. 93 This understand\u00ad ing can, in turn, enhance patient's sense of self, peace, and well\u00adbeing. Although patients most often prefer to get information from their health care providers 92 and trust such information, clini\u00adcians should not assume that patients have a similar understand\u00ading of clinical information, even when they are well educated, are likely to have greater health litera\u00adcy, and are familiar with medical terminology. 94 Hence, an important communicative task for the clini\u00adcian is to uncover the meaning of the illness to the patient through empathy, active listening, and encouraging patient expression. By so doing, the patient feels under\u00adstood and the clinician acquires v aluable information about the patient's perspective, which the clinician can use to align the respective illness representations and to provide more personalized cancer care. 2.2.3 Communicating clinical inf ormation Communicating clinical evidence is challenging and requires that clini\u00adcians ha ve skill in offering explana\u00ad tions the patient understands, in framing information, and in using visual aids. 95 Communicating quan\u00ad titative information is particularly challenging. Patient understanding of statistics may be limited, and misunderstandings about absolute and relative risk or means and stan\u00addard deviations, may result in over\u00adly concrete interpretations. Graphical displays, especially 100\u00adperson diagrams, are increasingly being used to improve patient understanding of statistical data, but the findings of at least one survey suggested that patients preferred words to pictures. 96 Not only does the content of clinical evidence change across the cancer care con\u00adtinuum, but the intended goals of sharing the information vary as well. For example, clinicians may provide statistics on the accuracy of mammography in detecting cancer in order to persuade a patient to have a mammogram. A clinician may present information about the risks and benefits of various prostate cancer treatments in order to have patients articulate their 22 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 23 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care preferences and values. For exam\u00ad ple, while most patients would rather know that they have cancer even if treatment is ineffective, oth\u00aders might prefer not to know. Because patients tend to favor esti\u00admates that are framed in positive outcomes (a 60% chance of sur\u00adviving for five years) rather than estimates that are framed in nega\u00adtive outcomes (a 40% chance of dying within five years), clinicians should frame the information in both ways to avoid having the information be perceived as overly hopeful or pessimistic. In short, communicating clinical e vidence is more than just \"stating the facts.\" Patients make subjective sense of the information through their own interpretive lens, and these interpretations are influenced by past experiences, their own ill\u00adness representations and beliefs, 90,97 the experiences of others, their emotional states, and their goals. Patient-centered communication skills that can help clinicians man\u00adage clinical information include the following: 61,98 Use everyday language as much as possible Repeat and summarize Ask patients to restate infor\u00ad mation as a w ay to ensure they understand Encourage patients to ask questions Engage in active listening Allow adequate time for dis\u00ad cussion with the patient Be honest 2.2.4 Sharing bad news and prognostic inf ormation Although patients and clinicians in the United States and other English-speaking countries o ver\u00ad whelmingly endorse honest disclo\u00adsure of a cancer diagnosis, 99 the delivery of bad news continues to be stressful for clinicians and inef\u00adfective and/or traumatic for patients and their families. 100 Patients report feeling upset or overwhelmed after they hear the devastating news of a cancer diagnosis; such anxiety makes assimilation and recall of further information difficult. Although no communication inter\u00advention can eliminate the life-changing impact of a cancer diag\u00adnosis, the effective delivery of bad news can at least help patients become the following: Better informed More motivated to follow through with further e valuation and treatment Less emotionally distressed Better able to ask questions and participate in the clinical encounter Better prepared to make treat\u00adment decisions Better able to navigate the health care system Clear about the level of uncer\u00adtainty of the diagnosis The difficulty in managing bad news may be further compounded by a patient' s psychological and emo\u00ad tional factors, cognitive impair\u00adment, and low health literacy. 94 Cultural factors also play a role, especially the interface between mainstream American culture and cultures in which families play a central role in managing health-related information. Clinicians, too, have considerable dif ficulty delivering bad news com\u00ad passionately and clearly. Despite a large body of literature with seem\u00adingly sensible recommendations for delivering bad news, and an increasing number of courses for students and residents, clinicians often deliver diagnostic information without prior training or support. 101 Many physicians report having felt overwhelmed and traumatized by their early experiences at delivering bad news. 102 They may know how bad news should be delivered, but they may be unable to carry out the process effectively because of their own discomfort, fear, anxiety, 103,104 and lack of forums to deal with their own feelings. Correspondingly, it is not surprising that the popular press and the medical literature still includes patient reports of cold, impersonal, blunt, evasive, tactless, indirect, jargon-laden, and poorly timed delivery of bad news. Clinicians' actions at times favor their needs to reduce their own anxiety and uncertainty and bring the visit to closure, rather than address such patient needs as the desire to understand and be under\u00adstood, to gain emotional support and hope, and to be reassured that they are getting the best available treatment. 105 Uncertainty is implicit in discus\u00adsions of prognosis. Patients gener\u00adally state that they want an accu\u00ad 23 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 24 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care rate prognosis but also want to be given hope.98,106 Generally, the more serious the prognosis, the fewer the number of patients who want an honest assessment of life expectan\u00adcy. 96,107 Many patients prefer to be asked what information they wish to hear before it is disclosed, as well as when the disclosure should take place. 96 However, physicians' prospective estimates of prognosis are usually more favorable than the actual course of the disease, 108 and many intentionally exaggerate prognosis when communicating with patients and families, 109 proba\u00ad bly because of their own discom\u00adfort. 110 Correspondingly, patients frequently report not knowing their prognosis 111,112 or they overestimate their prognosis, even when they have been given accurate informa\u00adtion. 111,113-119 As with bad news, cul\u00ad tural factors may be paramount. One recent review of interventions designed to help clinicians better inform patients about their prog\u00adnoses and plan for end-of-life care indicated that most clinicians have not been successful with this task, perhaps because of inadequate attention to communication factors. 120 2.3 Responding to Emotions The threat, diagnosis, and treat\u00adment of cancer elicit a range of emotions in patients that include fear, sadness, anger, anxiety, and depression. Often, there are corre\u00adsponding reactions in friends and family members. In clinical encounters, patients and families express these emotions in a variety of ways: fear, 121 humor,122,123 nerv\u00adousness, worry, sadness, or fatalis\u00adtic thinking. 124,125 Moreover, these emotions are rarely static; rather, they ebb and flow over the course of the cancer experience. It is particularly important to rec\u00ad ognize and respond to patients' emotional states, gi ven that depres\u00ad sion, anxiety, and adjustment disor\u00adders have major effects on the quality of life of patients with can\u00adcer. 126-129 These emotions also can affect response to chemotherapy130 and the experience of pain.131 Clinicians can appropriately and directly address patients' emotional distress by using verbal expres\u00adsions of understanding, legitima\u00adtion, empathy, and support, which, in turn, can lead to improvements in physical symptoms, 132 alleviate the negative effects of inadequate social support, 133 and foster a per\u00ad ception of being understood.134 Moreover, by recognizing serious levels of emotional distress, anxi\u00adety, or depressive disorders, clini\u00adcians can prescribe medications or offer referral for psychotherapy that could directly improve the patient's well-being, 2,6,135 lead to mobilizing social support,136 and increase the likelihood that cancer treatment is completed. Attention to family members' emotions can prevent caregiver burnout. Further discussion and a literature review on recognizing and responding to emotions in cancer settings can be found in Appendix C. Given the magnitude of patients' and f amily members' emotions generated by a cancer diagnosis, clinicians should be able to recog\u00adnize a patient's emotional state, ask the appropriate questions to under\u00adstand it, communicate that under\u00adstanding to the patient, and respond with empathy or tangible help. Unfortunately , clinicians typically are not adequately cognizant of patients' emotional cues, nor are they effective at uncovering patients' fears and concerns. 121,137 Fewer than one-third of emotional\u00adly distressed patients are recognized as such by their physicians. 138,139 In general, clinicians rarely initiate conversations about emotions, and, correspondingly, some patients learn not to bring up these issues at all. Part of the difficulty is that, while some patients express emo\u00adtions explicitly (\"I'm frightened that ...\"), others are more willing to disclose physical symptoms than psychological problems, 140 and yet others reveal their fears and con\u00adcerns indirectly 80 or not at all, unless prompted by the clinician. These direct and indirect cues to emotional distress are often ignored, displaced, or dismissed rather than being met with empathic responses that ackno wl\u00ad edge cognitive and the patient's experi\u00adence. 141,142 Paradoxically, reassur\u00ad ance can be counterproductive. Although reassurance usually reduces anxiety initially, anxiety may rebound to even higher levels after clinicians' attempts to reas\u00adsure, especially if the patient feels as if his or her concerns were addressed superficially and if the clinician did not provide an ade\u00adquate rationale for reassurance. 143-146 Effective responses to emotional expression include the following: 24 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 25 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Legitimation: \"It's only natural to feel that.... \" Validation: \"Yes, this is a very anxiety-pro voking time for you.\" Empathy: \"This is making you both w orried and sad, is that right?\" Tangible help: \"I think I can help by.... \" In contrast, less effective respons\u00ades are asking leading questions, focusing on the physical aspects of health, and prematurely gi ving advice and reassurance. The absence of communication skills described in Chapter 1, as well as lack of time, environmental noise, and lack of privacy can be addi\u00adtional barriers to clinicians' vali\u00addation of and responsiveness to patients' emotions. 147,148 Educational interventions can help clinicians address patients' emotional needs 149,150 and the effects of inter\u00ad ventions can be long-lasting.151 Before leaving the discussion of responding to patients' emotions, it is important to recognize that cli\u00adnicians, too, experience a variety of emotions as they treat their patients, especially when con\u00adfronting patients with life-threaten\u00ading illnesses and patients for whom treatment is not always effective. 40,43,47,48,152 Clinicians should have self-awareness of their emotions and must ackno wledge and manage their emotions effec\u00adtively; an important aspect of man\u00adaging emotions is finding the right balance between involvement and distance to provide appropriate care. Clinicians frequently do not e xplore their own emotions about patients or their own emotional needs, leading to confusion between the patient's emotional needs and those of the clinician. 36 Unexamined negative emotions, in particular, can create distance between clinicians and patients that may be interpreted by patients as lack of caring. 2.4 Managing Uncertainty We separate management of uncer\u00adtainty from information exchange and decision-making because information, emotional support, and mutual understanding between clinicians and patients do not nec\u00adessarily mean a reduction of uncer\u00adtainty. Uncertainty is particularly salient in cancer care because the outcomes of cancer usually occur closer to the time of diagnosis (e.g., within five years) and cancer is often curable; in contrast, other major causes of death, such as dia\u00adbetes, emphysema, and coronary artery disease, have more protract\u00aded courses and are usually not eradicated. According to Mishel, 153,154 uncertainty in illness occurs when a person perceives aspects of the illness, treatment, and recovery as inconsistent, ran\u00addom, complex, and unpredictable. Uncertainty can have negative con\u00adsequences, such as emotional dis\u00adtress, a loss of sense of control, and lower quality of life. 155,156 However, maintenance of uncertainty may have self-protective value for some patients and families by allowing space for hope. 157 Although uncer\u00ad tainty may stem from a lack of information (Does the patient have cancer?), it can also be created when there is too much informa\u00adtion (Which treatment re gimen is more appropriate for the patient?) or when the available information may be interpreted in many ways (Is no change in tumor marker level a positive sign?). Uncertainty is particularly salient in discussions of prognosis, which usually in volve the presentation of statistics. Many patients have diffi\u00adculty understanding statistical esti\u00admates and often interpret them as precise predictions. It is sometimes difficult to convey that statistical estimates are no more than a prob\u00adabilistic structuring of uncertainty. Furthermore, physicians have long been perceived to have an exces\u00adsive need for certainty 158 and for maintaining an illusion of certain\u00adty. 159 Few empirical studies have focused on the effect of sharing uncertainty with patients and fami\u00adlies, and no study has been specif\u00adic to cancer settings. Some vignette studies in primary care settings suggest that expressions of clinician uncertainty in the form of \"I don't know\" or \"Let's see what happens\" or the use of vague lan\u00adguage may have detrimental effects on patient confidence. 160,161 In other studies,162 however, expressions of uncertainty in the context of an otherwise patient-centered style correlated with improved patient satisfaction. Patient-centered communication should not only reduce uncertain\u00adty b ut also help patients with can\u00ad cer manage uncertainty.68 In many situations, patients appreciate 25 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 26 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care when the clinician can acknowl\u00ad edge that uncertainty is unavoid\u00adable and can frame information in terms of what is known and what is unknown. Cognitive-behavioral techniques for patients facing uncertainty can improve under\u00adstanding and probabilistic think\u00ading, help maintain a positive out\u00adlook on future treatments and developments, and engage patients in vigilant self-monitor\u00ading for emerging symptoms. These interventions may improve communication and quality of life. One cognitive-behavioral intervention for patients with breast cancer, for example, improved cognitive reframing, cancer knowledge, communica\u00adtion skills, and coping. 153 Similar interventions for men with prostate cancer led to improved psychological, sexual, and urinary functioning after prostatectomy. 163 A similar intervention led to bet\u00adter quality of life for men who chose \"watchful waiting\" without treatment. 164 Internet resources may also help patients manage uncertainty, especially when the information and support received is perceived to be trustworthy and of high quality. 165 In addition, health care systems can greatly assist the management of uncer\u00adtainty by providing patient educa\u00adtion resources and access to cog\u00adnitive interventions. Although theories about the man\u00adagement of uncertainty ha ve been proposed and psychological inter\u00adventions based on those theories have been successful, little is known about what can be done as part of routine clinical care to lo wer the burden of anxiety related to uncertainty experienced by patients and families. Patients need information, cognitive strategies, and skills to manage emotions in order to handle uncertainty effec\u00adtively, yet it is not clear whether these resources can be provided during routine clinical care or if specialized psychological interven\u00adtions are necessary. Clinicians' actions to reduce uncertainty or provide reassurance have the potential to backfire, further raising patient anxiety and distrust. 143-146 These issues are paramount in the survivorship phase and will affect an increasing number of patients, including patients who do not have a guarantee of cure on the immedi\u00adate horizon or who have oncoge\u00adnetic mutations. These issues also affect patients for whom the man\u00adagement of long-term sequelae of treatment may introduce new uncertainties. 2.5 Making Decisions Decision-making is a communica\u00adtive task that is important in all phases of the cancer care continu\u00adum. A high-quality decision is one that is based on the patient's values and understanding of the evidence and rationale for the decision. To achieve a high-quality decision, the patient's needs, values, and prefer\u00adences should be articulated and taken into account. However, achieving the best decision possible is often difficult for several reasons: Clinicians are often unaware of the patient' s needs, values, and preferences Patients have not necessarily considered all of the options prior to the medical visit Patients and clinicians often hold dif ferent beliefs about health Patients are often not familiar with the clinical reasoning supporting a preferred option An additional complication in the process is that patients v ary greatly with respect to their preferred degree of involvement in decision\u00ad making, 32,64,65,166-170 Clinicians are often unaware of patients' prefer\u00ad ences for in volvement32,171 and the patient's preferred level of involve\u00adment and decision may change during the course of the consulta\u00adtion or from one visit to the next. 172 Most of the literature on decision-making assumes a dyadic patient-clinician relationship, despite the fact that most important decisions in cancer care involve at least one other accompanying family mem\u00adber. A detailed literature review on decision-making in cancer care settings is in Appendix D. We find the model of treatment decision-making proposed by Charles et al. 173 to be a particularly useful starting point because it helps distinguish active patient participation from control of deci\u00adsion-making. The model presents three types of decision-making that lie along a spectrum: Paternalistic: clinician decides treatment Shared: clinician and patient together decide treatment 26 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 27 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Informed: patient decides treatment based on informa\u00adtion from the clinician and other sources Although each type of decision-making process dif fers with respect to the degree of patient or clinician control over the decision, each type proceeds through the same three stages\u2014information exchange, deliberation, and mak\u00ading the final decision . Regardless of who is responsible for the final decision, the process is one that is ideally characterized by mutual engagement and participation at both the information-exchange and deliberation stages. Information exchange involves the clinician and the patient seeking and giving their respective viewpoints on the patient's health condition. The cli\u00adnician discusses clinical findings, options for treatment, the proce\u00addures involved, and his or her experience with these conditions. The patient discloses his or her needs, questions, preferences, con\u00adcerns, and his or her knowledge about health and treatment. As discussed in Chapter 1 and ear\u00ad lier in the section on information e xchange, clinicians and patients may need to help one another be accountable in the information-exchange process. If information presented by a clinician is difficult for the patient to understand or seems counter to what the patient knows, an educated, activated and motivated patient would normally ask questions and offer his or her own perspective. 26 However, patients are often passive and intimidated by the clinical setting. In those cases, the clinician may need to use partnership-b uilding and 30,174 Clinicians' use of partner\u00ad ing behaviors will also help uncov\u00ader the reasons for the patient's treat\u00adment preferences, which are often not readily apparent. For example, clinicians often have little under\u00adstanding of patient's reasons to forego mainstream therapy, and these reasons can be quite varied, including having a close friend/rel\u00adative who died from cancer when receiving conventional treatments, a need for control, fear of side effects of conventional treatments, poor communication with clinicians, and expected benefits of treatment. As they work toward mutual or shared understanding of the situation dur\u00ading the deliberation stage, clinician, patient, and family identify similar\u00adities in their viewpoints and resolve any differences. In short, even if the final decision is made unilaterally, the decision-making process itself should still have been characterized by active engagement by all parties in the information-exchange and deliberation stages. In most cases, the quality of the decision reached will depend on ho w well four tasks were accom\u00ad plished: Perspectives of both clinician and patients were v oiced and understood Differences were reconciled satisf actorily Mutual agreement was achie ved regarding the best course of action Decision was supported by current clinical e vidence Each of the steps in decision-mak\u00ading\u2014information e xchange, delib\u00ad eration, and the final decision\u2014is critical for effective decision-mak\u00ading. For example, some research indicates that the greater the match between the preferences of patients with breast cancer to be involved and their perception of actual involvement, the less deci\u00adsional regret and greater satisfac\u00adtion with care. 173,175 Patients' evalu\u00ad ations of care are better predicted by perceptions of having had a shared role in decision-making than by their initial preferred role; 173,176 this may in part be due to their feelings of being involved in the process. Physician support of patient participation can increase the participation of patients with cancer, 29,177 foster a sense of having a choice of treatment, and lead to greater satisfaction with care. 24 This adaptation of the model by Charles et al. 173 is useful in that it makes an important distinction between patient involvement in the decision-making process, which a number of studies indicate is a positive feature of patient-centered care, and the issue of who assumes responsibility for making the deci\u00adsion. This model would account for findings indicating that most patients want to be involved in decision-making, want to know all of their options for treatment, and want the decision to take into account their needs and values. Yet, many of these patients may choose not to have sole or even partial responsibility for the final 27 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 28 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care decision, instead deferring that to the clinician. This model also highlights the fact that a 'shared decision' is not inherently a posi\u00adtive outcome of the decision-mak\u00ading process. Instead, the quality of the patient-clinician interaction, and not the patient's role per se in deciding treatment, is arguably the most important factor affecting the quality of decision-making. Specific communication strategies that could f acilitate patient/family\u00ad clinician communication about treatment include the following: Setting an explicit agenda Listening actively Checking understanding Offering opportunities for in volvement Endorsing patient participation in discussions and the decision Accommodating patients' preferences Communicating empathy and w armth both verbally and nonverbally Health care systems also have a role in supporting decision-making by f acilitating access to informa\u00ad tion and providing decision aids and other resources. Decision aids, in the form of booklets, prompt sheets, video recordings, and inter\u00adactive Web-based formats, can help patients understand and take an active role in decision-making. 178,179 Decision aids increase patients' knowledge about options, lower decisional conflict, and reduce the proportion of patients remaining undecided about the treatment, but fe w studies have addressed the impact of decision aids on patient-clinician communication. 2.6 Enabling Patient Self-Management A sixth function of communication in cancer care deals with the prac\u00adticalities of following through with care, helping patients to enhance their ability to solve health-related problems and to take actions to improve their health. This function is somewhat different from infor\u00admation management because it comprises recommendations ('should do' to patients' perceived ability to self-manage important aspects of their illness, which includes their ability to find information about the illness, cope with treat\u00ad ment effects, and seek appropriate care when needed. Implicit in enablement is the ability to adhere to treatment, navigate the health care system, and garner resources. 181-183 Enablement includes things that clinicians can do for patients to remove barriers to self-management, as well as ways clinicians can help patients be more autonomous and capable of caring for themselves. The con\u00adcept of self-management was advanced by Bodenheimer et al. and has been formalized into a chronic care model to be applied in primary care settings. 184,185 Enablement includes both things that clinicians can do for patients to remove barriers to self-manage\u00adment, as well as helping patients be more autonomous and capable of caring for themselves. The concept of self-management has been e xpanded and applied to chronic disease management in primary care settings. 184,185 The chronic care model emphasizes collaboration in which the patient and the team of health profession\u00adals each identifies problems and sets goals. Clinicians provide information but also teach patients how to gain access to and utilize knowledge. Education and infor\u00admation may come directly from the health professional and also from other patients (in group set\u00adtings), peers, or family members. Each contributes expertise and shares responsibility for problem-solving, the achievement of health outcomes and caregiving. In con\u00adtrast to a paternalistic approach, professionals help the patient make informed choices. Clinicians understand that their responsibility is to help patients find internal motivation rather than to dictate a course of action. The clinician's role is to teach problem-solving rather than solve all problems for patients\u2014with an explicit goal of enhancing self-efficacy. Self-management leads to impro ved health outcomes and reduced hospitalizations for patients with chronic disease. 186 However, the idea that patient-clinician com\u00admunication can enhance self-man\u00adagement is relatively new to cancer settings. Patient-clinician communi\u00adcation about self-management can focus on any number of issues, but 28 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 29 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care we believe that three are particular\u00ad ly important in cancer care: advo\u00adcating and navigating, supporting patient autonomy, and providing guidance, skills, and access to resources. 2.6.1 Advocating for patients and helping to navigate the health care system Patients often need advocacy, or actions tak en on their behalf. Advocacy often includes interac\u00adtions between clinicians and others within as well as outside the health care system. Some examples of advocacy are contacting insurance companies to provide needed care, personally coordinating care with another specialist, and making sure that a terminally ill patient has adequate home care services. Advocacy also includes interac\u00adtions with the family to support the patient's healing efforts. Navigation is a special form of adv ocacy. More so than with care of other illnesses, cancer care typi\u00adcally requires that patients navi\u00adgate a complex health care system in which they interact with a vari\u00adety of health professionals per\u00adforming specialized services at multiple locations. Navigating the health care system is particularly challenging in the trajectory from detection of cancer to initiation of treatment but is also important in accessing services related to sur\u00advivorship issues and end-of-life care. In some settings, specially trained \"navigators\" assess patients' needs and, in collabora\u00adtion with the patient, develop a plan to address these needs and assist patients in o vercoming vari\u00ad ous barriers to obtaining timely, high-quality care. 187 Although navi\u00ad gator programs are increasingly used, there are limited data regard\u00ading their effectiveness or costs. Some ways in which clinicians can contribute to navigation include the following: Help patients obtain confirma\u00adtory testing for suspected can\u00adcer in a timely f ashion Tell patients how to get to a specialist' s office Explain clearly about when and with whom to follo w up Arrange referrals for psy\u00ad chotherap y, support groups, and/or social work Coordinate care among spe\u00adcialists for hospitalized patients Provide palliative/end-of-life care or direct patients to resources for such care, as appropriate 2.6.2 Supporting patient autonomy Autonomy requires motivation and self-ef ficacy. Motivation has been studied in other settings, using self-determination theory to predict and influence patients' motivation for change. Self-deter\u00admination theory suggests that autonomy-supportive clinician behaviors tend to foster patient motivation. 188 In contrast, when clinicians are directive and con\u00adtrolling, motivation tends to diminish. Autonomy-supportive beha viors include exploring patients' ambivalence about tak\u00ading action, providing several options for achieving the same goal and giving patients time to consider choices rather than forc\u00ading a premature decision. This approach has been applied with success to smoking cessation, weight loss, adherence to treat\u00adment, and exercise, topics that are related to cancer prevention and quality of life. 28,189,190 Autonomy- supportive clinician behaviors can also enhance a patient's sense of self-efficacy, 186,191 but, as is the case with motivation, self-efficacy is a prerequisite for enablement but is not synonymous with that concept. While navigation is a form of adv ocacy for the patient, activa\u00ad tion is a form of self-advocacy by the patient. Patient activation inter-ventions, 192 however, have mostly focused on training patients about how to get their questions answered and how to participate in decision-making. Interventions can help patients with the following: Find their way through the health care system Obtain access to the best clini\u00adcians for their particular condi\u00adtion Recognize gaps and lapses in care and bring them to clini\u00adcians' attention Improve adherence to treatment Become educated consumers of health care 29 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 30 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care 2.6.3 Providing guidance, skills, and access to resources By providing access to resources, clinicians can help patients direct\u00adly or help patients help them\u00adselv es. In addition to motivation and confidence (self-efficacy), patients also need the knowledge, skills, and resources to be able to follow through. Clinicians still need to provide recommendations, instruction, advocacy, and support. Even if a patient feels empowered and enabled, situations with regard to the patient's illness change over time. Recommendations should be clear, with nontechnical language and simple sentence structure. Recommendations should be accompanied by recall-promoting behaviors such as repetition, sum\u00admarization, categorization, and asking the patient to repeat com\u00adplex recommendations so that it is clear that they understand. 193-199 Instruction helps patients do things for themselves. Instructions should include clear explanations on ways the patient should manage pain and other symptoms and how to follow through with a mutually agreed upon plan that might include scheduling medications, having an x-ray done, or talking to a social worker. Instruction also can include telling the patient and the family how and when to con\u00adtact the clinician, how to make sure that the right people are pres\u00adent during family meetings, and what websites will provide rele\u00advant information. Self-management needs vary great\u00adly among patients. All aspects of self-management take the patient and clinician outside the confines of the clinical office or hospital room to involve other settings, peo\u00adple and organizations. In particular, health care systems have an impor\u00adtant role in supporting patients' self-management by providing easy access to personnel, experts, programs, and media that can guide and inform self-manage\u00adment. Some supportive resources that have been discussed in the lit\u00aderature include the following: Use of lay health educators 200 and interactive media201 to help patients be more proactive in controlling pain and other can\u00adcer-related symptoms Training patients how to use the Internet more ef fectively to access health information202 Sponsoring of community-based programs for the man\u00adagement of cancer -related symptoms203 Assistance for patients regard\u00ad ing the use of complementary and alternati ve medicine204 Toolkits for learning self\u00ad adv ocacy205 Few studies of enablement per se have been carried out in cancer settings, and navigation studies are just now being conducted. It is clear, though, that enabling patients to take a more active role in managing aspects of their own health care should be a focus for future communication research. 2.7 Conclusion In this chapter, we outlined six functions of communication in cancer settings that likely have an impact on important intermediate and health outcomes. Fostering healing relationships emphasizes the importance of mutual trust, rapport, understanding, and com\u00admitment, as well as agreement about each others' roles and expec\u00adtations as both requirements and results of effective communication. Exchanging information empha\u00ad sizes the importance of recogniz\u00ad ing patients' information needs, integrating clinical information with the patient's illness represen\u00adtations (explanatory models), acknowledging both the content and process of information exchange, recognizing that dis\u00adease-related information now is more available through the Internet, communicating prognos\u00adtic information accurately while also providing hope, and overcom\u00ading barriers related to low health literacy and poor understanding of statistical information. Responding to emotions requires clinicians to elicit patients' emo\u00ad tional distress; communicate an understanding of the patient's emotions to him or her; and respond with legitimation, valida\u00adtion, empathy, and support. Managing uncertainty emphasizes that uncertainty often cannot be eliminated b ut can be managed by providing information, support, and cognitive strategies to help 30 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 31 Chapter 2: A Framework for Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care patients and families deal more ef fectively with the anxiety related to uncertainty. Making decisions involves consid\u00ad eration of both the acti ve involve\u00ad ment of the patient and family in the information exchange and deliberation stages of the decision-making process and the identifica\u00adtion of the person responsible for the final decision. Lastly, enabling patient self-man\u00ad a gement involves advocacy for the patient, including navigating the patient through the health care sys\u00adtem; supporting patient autonomy; and providing guidance, skills, and access to resources.

Much of the current literature on cancer communication focuses on imme\u00addiate, proximal outcomes of com\u00admunication, such as whether patients recall clinician recommen\u00addations, and intermediate out\u00adcomes, such as whether patients follow through with treatment (Table 3.1). The outcomes of great\u00adest relevance to patients and their families, however, are health, sur\u00advival, and quality of life. Survival 3 Table 3.1 Pathways from Patient Needs to Communication to Outcomes: Mediators Communication outcomes (also mediators of relationships between communication and intermediate and primary outcomes) Strong patient/family-clinician relationships (trust, rapport, respect, patient participation in the visit, involvement of family and caregivers, patient feels known and understood) Effective information exchange (e.g., patient asks questions) Validation of emotions (e.g., clinician expresses empathy) Appropriate acknowledgment, understanding, and tolerance of uncertainty Patient participation in decision-making Patient self-management, navigation of health care system, and coordination of care Intermediate outcomes (also mediators between proximal communication outcomes and primary outcomes) Patient knowledge and understanding Access to care Therapeutic alliances Emotional self-management Family/social support and advocacy High quality of medical decisions (e.g., informed, concordant with patient values, and mutually endorsed) Patient agency (self-efficacy, empowerment, and enablement) leading to improved treatment adherence, health habits, and self-care Health outcomes Survival and disease-free survival - Cancer prevention - Early detection of cancer - Accurate diagnosis - Completion of evidence-based treatment - Maintenance of remission Health-related quality of life - Functioning: cognitive, physical, social, and role - Well-being: physical, emotional, energy - Health perceptions Other aspects of suffering (meaning, spirituality , etc.) Societal outcomes Cost and utilization of health services Disparities in health and health care Ethical practice (e.g., informed consent) 39 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 40 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care (with or without disease) and qual\u00ad ity of life are considered primary because they reflect the patient's experience in the world, not just in the clinic. In addition, societal out\u00adcomes, such as reduction in health disparities, are important on a pop\u00adulation level. Many of the media\u00adtors and moderators between communication behavior and these outcomes and between intermedi\u00adate and primary health outcomes are poorly understood. Broadly speaking, the relationships between communication and sur\u00adviv al (and disease-free survival) are likely to be mediated by patient access to and completion of rec\u00adommended health care. Markers of disease such as blood tests, radi\u00adographic studies, and physical signs are commonly used to judge the effectiveness of treatments and are sometimes used as surrogate markers for survival. Although dis\u00adease markers and adherence to treatment have been used in com\u00admunication research in the settings of diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic illnesses, 1 these markers have been used much less frequently in communication research in the cancer setting. The construct of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is increas\u00adingly being used to measure subjec\u00adtiv e outcomes of care (Table 3.2). HRQOL refers to the impact of an individual's health on his or her ability to function and on his or her perceived well-being, in physical, mental, and social domains of life. The functioning aspect of HRQOL includes basic activities, such as self-care, cognitive ability, and abil\u00adity to perform at work, and the extent to which one is able to inter\u00ad act with f amily and friends. The well-being component of HRQOL relies almost exclusively on the per\u00adceptions of the patient and is there\u00adfore more subjective than the functioning aspect. Included in the well-being component is the degree to which the person has symptoms (physical well-being); feels happy, sad, depressed, or anxious (emo\u00adtional well-being); and feels ener\u00adgetic or lethargic. Comprehensive HRQOL measures address multiple domains of function and well\u00adbeing. Cancer can affect non-HRQOL domains as well, such as earning potential and standard of living, but the impact of communi\u00adcation on these domains is more Table 3.2 Domains of Health-Related Quality of Life Domain Examples* Functioning Physical Mobility, bathing, dressing Cognitive Problem-solving, memory Social Interacting with friends and family Role Performing job, housework, hobbies Symptoms General Pain, nausea, fatigue, weakness Disease specific Itching, breathlessness, constipation, urinary frequency Emotional Anxiety, depression, hopefulness (body image) Social Enjoying friends and family (Spiritual) (Personal meaning, transcendence) General health Self-reported overall health perception *Items in parentheses are encountered less frequently. speculative.2,3 Elements of HRQOL that have been assessed in commu\u00ad nication studies in cancer and non-cancer settings include emotional and social well-being, and in some cases, symptoms and physical func\u00adtioning. 4,5 Very few cancer commu\u00ad nication studies have focused on the effects of communication on socie\u00adtal outcomes such as costs and health care disparities. In this chapter, we discuss the links between communication, proximal outcomes, intermediate outcomes, and health outcomes, with particu\u00adlar attention to the v arious path\u00ad w ays through which the communication functions described in Chapter 2 can lead to improved health. The chapter also 40 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 41 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators addresses various moderators of these relationships. In addition, we explore ways in which health care systems can provide resources that facilitate more effective communi\u00adcation and facilitate the links between improved communication and health outcomes. 3.1 The Fundamental Task: Explaining the Link between Communication and Outcomes In this chapter, we discuss ways in which communication can lead to improved survival and quality of life either directly or through the mediating effects of proximal and intermediate outcomes. However, much of what we present is specu\u00adlative, because very little is known about the mechanisms by which communication affects health out\u00adcomes. It is clear, however, that in some instances patient-clinician communication directly improves well-being. For example, a clini\u00adcian who is encouraging and reas\u00adsuring and offers clear, understandable explanations may help an anxious patient in the hos\u00adpital to have a lower level of anxi\u00adety, sleep better, and have an improved appetite immediately after the clinical encounter. However, in most situations a more complex series of mechanisms links communication to health out\u00adcomes. 6 Collectively, these links constitute particular pathways to better health through immediate outcomes such as greater mutual understanding, trust, and patient involvement in decision-making and through intermediate outcomes such as changes in patient health behaviors, self-care skills, social support, and quality of care. An initial task for researchers is to determine whether patient-clinician communication is actually a reason for a particular observ ed outcome. A clinician's efforts to inform a patient about the benefits of treat\u00adment can increase the likelihood that the patient adheres to a poten\u00adtially curative treatment regimen through several pathways. Those pathways might be mediated by increased trust and/or increased understanding. To study whether these pathways explain an effect of communication on health outcomes would require measures of the pur\u00adported mediators: information giv\u00ading, trust, understanding, and adherence. Although the cancer communication literature includes relatively few examples of studies in which mediation hypotheses have been tested, such hypotheses have been examined in communi\u00adcation studies in other settings. 7 Future studies should include measures of the elements necessary to establish whether a proposed factor is indeed a mediator of patient-clinician communication and health outcomes (Figure 3.1). Consider one of the few studies in which patient acti vation interven\u00ad tions have been evaluated in cancer settings. Oliver et al. 8 examined the effects of interventions in which patients were coached to ask ques\u00adtions about the management of cancer-related pain. Patients in the activation group reported less can\u00adcer-related pain at follow-up than did patients in the control group. Changes were not mediated by patient knowledge or adherence, as the tw o groups did not differ with respect to those measures. Questions remain about the reason for the difference in pain. Was the decrease in pain related to the effects of the intervention on patient-clinician communication? Did the intervention improve the patient's information-gathering skills so that he or she knew how to self-manage pain more effec\u00adtively? Did the intervention pro\u00admote a sense of self-efficacy and confidence to use existing knowl\u00adedge? Did the intervention lead the patient to disclose more informa\u00adtion about the pain so the clinician could provide a personalized pain management plan to which the patient could adhere more easily? Without evidence of mediating fac\u00adtors, we can only speculate about why a patient intervention led to improved health. Before discussing pathways that link patient-centered communica\u00adtion to outcomes, we should ackno wledge some controversial philosophical and theoretical issues that are often embedded in the discussion of the relationship between patient-centered commu\u00adnication and outcomes. First, opin\u00adions differ regarding whether communication is a means to an end or is simply an end itself. The instrumental viewpoint holds that communication is considered to be important only when it can be linked to changes in intermediate or distal outcomes. Alternatively, the deontological viewpoint holds that communication can be consid\u00adered to be an important feature of 41 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 42 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care care that has intrinsic value regard\u00ad less of other outcomes. Krupat et al. 9 reported that most patients endorse this latter viewpoint. Second, the same communication beha viors may improve some out\u00ad comes but worsen others. Patients' perspectives about the quality of care (e.g., as reflected in satisfac\u00adtion measures) are particularly problematic because the clinician behaviors that enhance patient sat\u00adisfaction are sometimes distinct from those that improve health out\u00adcomes. Patients who value patient-centered communication and who trust and endorse their physicians may be no more satisfied than patients who do not. 10 In some situ\u00ad ations, improved patient satisfac\u00adtion may even mask deficiencies in other domains of practice. For example, patients who are more satisfied with their care sometimes have poorer intermediate out\u00adcomes, such as less healthy behav\u00adior, as indicated in a study in which diabetic patients who were more satisfied with their care maintained poorer weight control than did less satisfied patients. 11 Also, some forms of active patient participa\u00adtion, such as question-asking and assertiveness, may produce more friction in the patient-clinician relationship, which, in turn, may decrease patient satisfaction. 12 Yet, active participation in communica\u00adtion may result in better under\u00adstanding and self-management. We would argue that, in these circum\u00adstances, patient activation was not the problem; rather, the patient may have achieved better clarity about his or her own values, and the lower level of satisfaction reflects the dif ficulty that the clini\u00ad cian and patient had in aligning their perspectives (see Chapter 1). In summary, outcomes of effective communication are man y and, as noted in Chapter 1, may differ based on patients' and clinicians' values and goals. Moreover, some outcomes, such as satisfaction with care, may work against others, such as healthier behaviors. Communication, outcomes, and some mediators of the two are complex constructs, and each desired outcome will be affected by certain domains of patient-cen\u00adtered communication more than others. 13 Ideally, relevant health outcomes should be defined through dialogue between patient and clinician. In this way, patient preferences can be clarified and the clinician can avoid mistaking a self-defined \"good outcome\" for what the patient really wants, as well as avoiding confusion of true disagreements in values or inten\u00adtions with \"poor adherence.\" 14 3.2 A Conceptual Model of Communication and Outcomes The pathways linking the effects of communication with outcomes have not been explored in detail, but studies on communication in both cancer and noncancer settings suggest several common mediating pathways (Figure 3.1). By media\u00adtion, we refer to the steps between two components of a causal path\u00adway that are necessary for proceed\u00ading from one level of the pathway to the next. Proximal and interme\u00addiate outcomes (Table 3.1) become mediators only when the y are proved to be important steps along the pathway from communication to more distal outcomes. Links, indicated by the letters B through G in Figure 3.1, are components of larger pathways that start with communication and end with the most distal outcomes. Mediation may involve one, two, or many more steps, but the conceptual model shown here is simplified to illustrate two steps between a com\u00admunication act and distal health and societal outcomes. Some path\u00adways may terminate at proximal or intermediate outcomes when credi\u00adble links can be found for initial steps B and C, but evidence is lack\u00ading for step D or F (Figure 3.1). At the top of the conceptual model are patients' and families' health- related communication needs, which include the following: Development of a trusting relationship Access to disease-related information Response to their emotions Help with decision-making and management of uncer\u00adtainty Being empowered and capable of self-care Although some of these needs can be met without in volving commu\u00ad nication with clinicians (link G), we will focus on the needs that require some form of clinical com\u00admunication, whether encounter-based, asynchronous, or otherwise. 42 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 43 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators Figure 3.1 Our conceptual model includes several mediating pathways that link the effects of communication with health outcomes. Links (B through G) are components of larger pathways that start with communication and end with the most distal outcome. Link E suggests that sometimes communication can have a direct therapeutic effect on patients and families. For example, by providing information that a test result is nor\u00admal, a clinician may directly reduce anxiety and thus contribute to improved HRQOL. In contrast, links B through F suggest that the pathway between communication and outcomes is mediated by a more complex series of steps. For exam\u00adple, a patient with breast cancer who is reluctant to take tamoxifen may first need to feel empowered to ask questions during a clinical consultation (a communication A B C D E F Patient/Family Needs Communication Between Clinicians and Patients/Families Fostering healing relationships, exchanging information, responding to emotions, managing uncertainty, making decisions, enabling patient self-management Proximal Communication Outcomes Mediators of the relationships between communication processes and intermediate and health outcomes Intermediate Outcomes Mediators of the relationships between communication outcomes and health outcomes Health Outcomes Survival, health-related quality of life behavior). In response to the patient's questions, the clinician is more likely to provide information about the overall benefits compared with the risks in a way the patient understands. The clinician's provi\u00adsion of information leads to greater trust (a proximal outcome) and a greater willingness of the patient to follow through with recommended therapy (an intermediate outcome), which, in turn, may affect survival. However, development of the patient's trust in the clinician and the health care system may involve not only the provision of informa\u00adtion but also other kinds of commu-G nication behaviors, such as empa\u00adthy and asking for the patient's per\u00adspective. 15 Furthermore, the establishment of trust may facilitate future communication about differ\u00adent topics in different contexts; thus, the effects of communication are both recursive (link G, Figure 3.1) and cumulative across time. The first set of mediators consists of proximal outcomes of communi\u00adcation, depicted by pathw ays that include link B (Figure 3.1). This step is explicit in the causal path\u00adway because one should not assume that the performance of a communication task\u2014the exchange 43 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 44 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care of information\u2014will necessarily result in effective communication; that is, the patient becomes more knowledgeable. A patient may not gain knowledge or understanding of the illness if a clinician uses excessive jargon or if the patient forgets, misunderstands, or misin\u00adterprets the clinician's statements. Patients also vary in how they inter\u00adpret emotional messages. A state\u00adment intended to convey empathy (e.g., \"This must have been difficult for you.\") may be comforting to one patient but be experienced as insincere or patronizing by another. The social, psychological, and demographic factors that influence the pathway between communica\u00adtion and proximal outcomes is dis\u00adcussed in greater detail when we describe moderators of the relation\u00adships between communication and outcomes. The second set of mediators com\u00ad prises at least se ven pathways that form important steps between communication and health out\u00adcomes, providing improvements in the following: Access to care Patient knowledge and shared understanding Therapeutic alliances (i.e., patient and clinician commit\u00adment to the relationship) Emotional self-management Family/social support and adv ocacy Quality of medical decisions (e.g., informed, clinically sound, concordant with patient v alues, and mutually endorsed) Patient agency (self-efficacy, empo werment, and enablement) These pathways link effective communication to impro ved qual\u00ad ity of care, adherence, health habits, and self-care, which, in turn, can contribute to healing and reduced suffering. We do not imply that these are the only mediators of these relation\u00adships. We propose these pathways as a conceptual starting point and will describe them in greater detail. It must be emphasized that the rela\u00adtionships between intermediate out\u00adcomes and health outcomes comprise a vast body of literature encompassing adherence, social support, and health services deliv\u00adery. Moreover, the relationships between adherence, social support, and treatment outcomes are not straightforward. For example, adherence to ineffective therapy may have positive benefits such as lowered anxiety and symptoms, and lack of adherence to recommended therapy with serious side effects may involve value-driven tradeoffs between quality of life and survival. There is a large body of literature on social support and health, yet the mechanisms whereby social support confers improved well-being are poorly understood but likely involve neurohumoral, psychological, and instrumental factors. 16 Also, social support can affect adherence. We do not attempt to provide a survey of this literature, but it is important to mention these factors here in antici\u00adpation of a more detailed discussion later in this chapter. We also acknowledge that the pathways sometimes are bidirectional. For example, information is a precondi\u00adtion for , as well as a consequence of, effective communication, and effective management of informa\u00adtion may uncover additional infor\u00admation needs. 3.2.1 Improving access to care Helping patients get the care they need is the f irst pathway by which communication can improve health. Access to care is poor for a large percentage of Americans, especially racial and ethnic minori\u00adties, individuals of lower socioeco\u00adnomic status, and individuals with low health literacy. 17 Some aspects of poor access are due to lack of insurance and availability of serv\u00adices, but other aspects are remedia\u00adble through patient education and patient navigation programs. Encouraging patients to report bar\u00adriers to care, enabling patients to take the first steps in gaining access to health services, and facilitating collaboration among health profes\u00adsionals are three communication activities that can help patients get the care that they need. Hence, cli\u00adnicians must not only communicate the need for a test, treatment, or referral; they must also help patients actually get such services. This pathway is accomplished pri\u00admarily through links B, C, and D (Figure 3.1): link B suggests that informative communication helps patients understand the kind of care that is needed; link C connects this understanding to utilization of appropriate procedures and treat\u00adments; and link D connects utiliza\u00adtion of appropriate services to improved health. However, as is the 44 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 45 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators case with providing emotional sup\u00ad port, clinicians' instrumental help also may directly promote emo\u00adtional well-being (link E) by reducing patients' distress resulting from worry and confusion as they move through a complex health care system. Health care systems, hospitals, and clinics can f acilitate patient-cen\u00ad tered communication in cancer care by providing patients with naviga\u00adtion programs and other instrumen\u00adtal resources. Busy physicians may need social workers, navigators, interpretators, or other professionals to help patients learn about and gain access to needed health services. Given the complexity of different insurance plans and eligibility requirements for government-spon\u00adsored health plans, electronic resources (such as websites and automated telephone systems) that provide easy access to integrated and comprehensive information about these services would greatly assist clinicians in helping patients to get access to the care they need. 3.2.2 Improving patient kno wledge and shared understanding Contextualized disease-specific kno wledge and shared understand\u00ad ing are precursors of many of the other pathways. Knowledge and shared understanding are essential ingredients of informed decisions, 18 enhancing patients' sense of con\u00adtrol, facilitating adherence, and reducing anxiety. In order to be fully knowledgeable, patients and family members should have timely access to information, the ability to recall it, and an under\u00adstanding of the meaning of the information in the conte xt of their particular illness, values and life circumstances. Knowledge can lead to shared understanding that builds patients' trust in their clini\u00adcians and enhances participation in clinical encounters. However, clinicians, patients, and f amilies see illness through the lenses of their particular health beliefs. The self-regulation theory by Leventhal and Carr 24 and the explanatory model theory by Kleinman 25 both suggest that patients have illness beliefs and models that are in part conditioned by their culture and prior experi\u00adences and, more currently, the Internet. These illness representa\u00adtions are often dynamic and com\u00adplex, based on \"common sense\" rather than empirical research or scientific theory, and sometimes reflect a pseudoscientific aura. Nonetheless, they create a sense of threat and imply certain means for reducing that level of threat. Leventhal and Carr further suggest that patient decisions and actions that may seem irrational to clini\u00adcians actually may be attempts of the patient to reduce the threat of illness perceived on the basis of his or her own illness representations. These observations provide an explanation for why patients may take medications for hypertension only when they feel \"tense\" 26 or why patients who believe that sur\u00adgery spreads cancer 27 may choose radiation or natural treatments. Clinicians also hold some of these common-sense belief models when it comes to their o wn or their patients' health.28 Clinicians often do not uncover these illness repre\u00adsentations, and even when clini\u00adcians attempt to initiate discussion of these beliefs, patients may not have a coherent way of articulating them. Thus, shared understanding depends on making sure rele vant information is exchanged, evincing patients' and clinicians' illness rep\u00adresentations, and, when the repre\u00adsentations are in conflict, reconciling them. The mediating effect of shared understanding on the relationship of communication to outcomes, then, is due to knowl\u00adedge and shared understanding, not simply the exchange and recall of information. 3.2.3 Enhancing therapeutic alliances A dependable, trusting patient-cli\u00ad nician relationship is particularly important for patients with cancer because of the threat of the illness and the fear it e vokes.29,30 In cancer care, the patient and his or her family typically encounter physi\u00adcians, nurses, technicians, and other health professionals from multiple disciplines, including radiology, primary care, medical oncology, and surgery. The thera\u00adpeutic alliance includes the interre\u00adlationships among multiple health professionals, the patient, and members of the patient's family. Indicators of a strong therapeutic alliance include mutual trust as well as the patient's perception of 45 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 46 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care feeling respected and supported emotionally . These alliances are \"therapeutic\" because the quality of the patient-clinician-family rela\u00adtionships affects health outcomes in two respects. First, a direct link (E in Figure 3.1) suggests that a strong relationship can lead to reduced suffering and increased healing by decreasing anxiety and promoting the patient's sense of feeling known and understood. 31,32 Second, an indirect link suggests that communication that estab\u00adlishes and reinforces a strong ther\u00adapeutic alliance leads to continuity of care, patient satisfaction, and commitment to treatment plans that can reduce rates of morbidity and mortality (links B, C, and D). Although we will discuss modera\u00ad tors later , two are worth noting here. First, social distance is an important moderator of the effectiveness of the therapeutic alliance. Patients appreciate clinicians who can understand and have empathy with their life circumstances. This fact may provide an explanation about why some patients are more satis\u00adfied in race-concordant relation\u00adships. 33 Length of relationship is also a moderator of the therapeutic alliance. Patients tend to choose to remain with physicians whom they trust and tend to seek a different physician when trust is lacking. 34 3.2.4 Enhancing patients' ability to manage emotions Patients with cancer and their fami\u00adlies often e xperience a plethora of terrifying emotions as they face the potential for death and suffering and the fear that help may not be a vailable.35 Clinicians can help patients manage these emotions in several ways, all depicted by path\u00adways B through E (Figure 3.1). First, when a clinician provides dis\u00adease-specific information and helps the patient understand the health care system, the patient may experi\u00adence a greater sense of control, hopefulness, and/or peace. 36 Validating patients' emotional expe\u00adriences and encouraging them to express these emotions have been linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. 37-40 Communication that enhances patients' self-confidence, sense of worth, and hope may con\u00adfer meaning, motivation, and energy needed to pursue work or leisure activities and allow them to enjoy greater quality of life despite the cancer and its treatment. Although patients' emotional distress can originate from many nonclinical sources (e.g., living alone), poor communication with their clinicians can compound this distress. 41 Thus, patient-clinician communication can promote emotional well-being directly or through enhancing the patient's ability to cope with stress, uncertainty, and unexpected set\u00adbacks outside of the consultation setting. 3.2.5 Improving family/social support and adv ocacy Social support can have a major impact on physical health 16 and quality of life42 and may improve survival among patients with can\u00adcer. 43-47 Social support likely improves health outcomes through several mechanisms (Figure 3.2). 16 First, social support can reduce physiological arousal, in turn, reducing morbidity and, perhaps, mortality through the hypothala\u00admic-pituitary axis and immunomodulators. 16,48,49 By enhancing a sense of connectedness and providing opportunities to process, share, or discuss difficult situations confronting the patient, family, and friends can help the patient with emotional self-man\u00adagement, which may result in lower levels of anxiety and arousal and associated neurohumoral changes. Second, family and social networks can provide instrumental help, encouragement, and advocacy in gaining access to and effectively utilizing health services and finan\u00adcial resources to accomplish health-related goals. Family members and friends can provide direct (when they are present with the clinician) or indirect (when they suggest top\u00adics for the patient to discuss) input into clinical conversations to facili\u00adtate communication between clini\u00adcians and patients. 50,51 Third, family and social support networks can enhance patients' efforts for achieving self-care, such as getting information about the illness that can be used as a basis for decision-making, quitting smoking, or adhering to treatment. Sometimes families and friends provide help actively and explic\u00aditly, and sometimes their effect is indirect and tacit and is achieved by setting implicit norms for social behavior. All of these pathways may increase self-esteem and reduce feelings of depression for the patient. Few studies have been 46 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 47 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators designed to simultaneously exam\u00ad ine these multiple mechanisms of social support, to explore which aspects are linked to specific health outcomes, and to understand which features are more important in dif\u00adferent settings; 42 rather, studies have tended to be designed to examine individual aspects of social support (information 52 or emotional53,54) or to create global55 or aggregate scores.56-58 Patient-clinician communication can contribute to improved health through the social support pathway in several ways. First, patient-clini\u00adcian communication itself is a form of social support that decreases social isolation and pro\u00advides encouragement and facilita\u00adtion. Health care facilities can sig\u00adnificantly help patients tak e advantage of social support resources by providing access to social workers, family therapists, and support groups. Second, clini\u00adcians and patients can discuss ways of reinforcing patients' social envi\u00adronments and the resources avail\u00adable within these networks (e.g., transportation, emotional support). Third, because cancer survivors with close supportive relationships often adjust better to the disease, clinicians can help direct patients to support groups and other resources, especially when a patient's networks have failed to provide needed support. 59 Face-to\u00adface support groups are inconven\u00adient for man y cancer survi v ors because of the time needed to travel, physical incapacity, or scheduling conflicts, and health care facilities can help overcome these barriers by directing patients to online support groups, which have much greater reach and often produce benefits that are compara\u00adble to those of face-to-face groups. 60 Lastly, because some forms of social support may be \"negative\" (promoting unhealthy behaviors such as smoking or well-intentioned nagging that creates more stress), 61 clinicians can dis\u00ad cuss with patients the nature of negative support and ways to man\u00adage these problems or can even Figure 3.2 Several clinician communication behaviors can enhance social support, which improves health outcomes through several mechanisms. Clinician Communication Behaviors Strengthen Clinician-Patient Relationship Reinforce Existing Social Networks Direct Patients to Formal Support Groups Attenuate \"Negative\" Social Influences Social Support Reduced Psychological Arousal Instrumental Help and Advocacy Enhanced Self-Care Improved Survival and Health-Related Quality of Life 47 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 48 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care talk directly to family members about ho w best to support a patient's needs. 3.2.6 Improving the quality of medical decisions Patient-clinician communication also can impro ve health to the extent that it leads to the best pos\u00adsible medical decision for the patient. High-quality decisions are characterized by communication that achieves the following: 62-64 Elicits the patient's needs Presents relevant clinical evi\u00addence in a w ay that the patient understands Effectively addresses the emo\u00adtional aspects of decision-making Aligns clinician and patient perspecti ves so that the deci\u00ad sion reached is concordant with the patient's values and with clinical evidence (link B in Figure 3.1) High-quality decisions ideally impro ve both survival and multiple dimensions of quality of life.65 The path to high-quality decisions is not always straightforward. First, decision-making is difficult when a patient's wishes are unclear or ambivalent, such as when a patient with recurrent cancer wishes to decline additional chemotherapy that has limited effectiveness but does not want to \"give up.\" Second, experts may give conflicting rec\u00adommendations, forcing patients to choose among different sources of authority. This situation is fre\u00adquently encountered in the setting of prostate cancer treatment, with urologists f avoring surgery and radiation oncologists favoring radi\u00adation therapy. Third, the quality of decision-making may be compro\u00admised when a patient's decision preferences are in response to \"common sense\" notions about dis\u00adease causation 24 and not based on scientific understanding. Patients may choose less effective herbal treatments rather than chemother\u00adapy, for example, because they are \"natural.\" 66 Fourth, difficulties arise when clinicians try to communicate risk, 67-69 as many patients have diffi\u00ad culty understanding numerical pre\u00adsentations of risks and benefits. A lack of understanding may lead patients to make choices that are unlikely to help them achieve their goals. Use of graphical displays can augment clinicians' efforts to explain and understand risk; one especially helpful graphic is the 100-person diagram, in which the proportion of positive and negative results is displayed in the form of stick figures of different colors or faces with happy or sad expres\u00adsions. These tools improve patient understanding and their ability to use data to guide their choices. 70-73 Measurable indicators of better medical decisions include the fol\u00adlowing: Consensus on treatment Clinician and patient/family satisf action with their respec\u00ad tive involvement in the deci\u00adsion-making process Concordance of the decision with the patient' s values Adherence to evidence-based guidelines Feasibility of implementing the decision, gi ven the avail\u00ad able resources and the patient's means and capabilities Patient-centered communication can produce a decision that meets these criteria, b ut the ultimate out\u00ad come of the decision will be mod\u00aderated by a number of variables, including unanticipated clinical developments, such as drug intoler\u00adances; availability of treatments in the patient's home town; insurance coverage; and members within the patient's social network, who may or may not approve of a particular treatment. Little is understood about the role of regret and risk-taking in decision-making, but both are likely to influence choices. 3.2.7 Enhancing patient empo werment and agency Patient-clinician communication also can impro ve health by empowering patients to be active, capable agents in managing their health. Agency is a psychological construct that describes the ability to work within one's environment to do things on one's own behalf. Agency incorporates motivation, self-efficacy, empowerment, and enablement (Table 3.3) and is a precondition for behavior change, adherence to long-term outpatient treatments, and self-care. The sense of control that patients with cancer feel has been linked to emo\u00adtional well-being and coping dur\u00ading survivorship. 74,75 In chronic diseases, such as diabetes,76 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 49 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators management strategies have led to better control of outcomes, improved functioning, and, in some cases, reduced health care costs. Admittedly, some patients are overwhelmed with their disease or other life circumstances that limit their ability to self-manage. In such cases, social support inter\u00adventions beyond those offered by the patient-clinician relationship may be necessary to develop or restore more effective coping and problem-solving strategies. O'Hair et al. describe a three-stage process through which communi\u00adcation can enhance patients' sense of agency.77 At the first stage, patients are confronted with uncer\u00adtainty as they try to find their paths through unfamiliar and often terri\u00adfying circumstances. By managing uncertainty, the problems acquire a structure; they appear manageable rather than chaotic and random. The second stage involves empow\u00aderment, which requires advocacy on the part of others (clinicians, family members, support groups, etc.), as well as patients finding and having a voice in the clinical environment, whether that involves seeking information, participating Table 3.3 Agency in decisions, or simply expressing feelings. The third stage, agency, involves action, self\u00addetermination, 78 self-efficacy in managing one's health,79 enable\u00ad ment,80-82 a sense of control, and assertion of one's perspective in both clinical and nonclinical set\u00adtings. 83 Patients and families who are enabled have the ability to solve problems and cope with health-related complications and to seek and interpret health-related information. They also have the ability and volition to follow through with appropriate treatment recommendations. Clinicians can help patients acquire agenc y through many of the compo\u00ad nents of patient-centered communi\u00adcation, including the following: Supporting patient 84,85 Building partnerships83 Managing uncertainty86 Facilitating information e xchange Providing access to educational and problem-solving resources Assisting with effective naviga\u00ad tion of the health care system Agency Ability to work within one's environment to do things on one's own behalf Motivation Willingness to work toward a goal Self-efficacy Belief that one can accomplish a particular goal Empowerment Permission and encouragement to accomplish a personal goal Enablement Possessing the skills, tools, and abilities to accomplish a goal The Internet is a potential resource for self-care, as it provides access to decision-support tools, informa\u00adtion, chat rooms, and other forms of assistance that can enhance (but occasionally complicate) patients' ability to solve problems. 60,87 3.3 Moderating Factors Affecting Communication Pr ocesses and the Relationship of Communication Process to Outcomes Our model (Figure 3.1) highlights the main effects of communication on proximal, intermediate, and dis\u00adtal health outcomes, as well as the pathways through which communi\u00adcation achieves these outcomes. However, we recognize that the experiences of patients and their families over the course of the cancer care continuum are both dynamic and complex. Hence, any number of variables may moderate relationships between communica\u00adtion and various outcomes. A moderator is a qualitative or quantitati ve variable that affects the direction or strength of the relationship between an independ\u00adent variable and a dependent vari\u00adable. 88 Moderators themselves may or may not have independent effects on the dependent variable. A variable is considered to be a moderator when its interaction with a main independent variable can predict the outcome variable. For example, if a patient who has considerable trust in his or her cli\u00adnician was not as anxious as a less trusting patient when the clinician expressed reassurance about a favorable prognosis, then the rela\u00ad 49 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 50 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care tionship between reassurance and lo wer anxiety would have been moderated by trust. Although in this context trust is considered to be a moderator, in other contexts trust may be a mediator or an inter\u00admediate outcome. We have noted that the research on communication and outcomes in cancer settings is limited, and e ven fewer studies have been conducted on moderators of these relation\u00adships. Moreover, much of the research has been superficial at best, focusing most often on indi\u00advidual differences among clini\u00adcians and patients rather than on theoretical reasons explaining why these individual differences have a moderating effect. As a case in point, suppose an investigation found that the relationship between a clinician's advice and the patient's subsequent commitment to chemotherapy was moderated by whether the clinician and patient were of the same race. Although racial concordance mod\u00aderated the effect of communication on adherence in this study, it is not clear why. The patient may have perceived a clinician of the same race to be more trustworthy or empathic and/or similar with regard to language use; each of these factors could account for the moderating influence of racial con\u00adcordance. Importantly, one could easily identify other variables that may render racial concordance insignificant, 89 such as the duration of the patient-clinician relation\u00adship, similarity in age or religion, or clinician skill at finding com\u00admon ground with the patient. Moderators rarely operate in isola\u00adtion of other moderators, although researchers typically focus on only one or tw o. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the influence of gender on patient-clinician com\u00admunication and outcomes in the noncancer setting, and the findings have indicated that female clini\u00adcians and their female patients talk about psychosocial topics more often than male clinicians and their male patients. 90,91 One might infer from this finding that patient-clini\u00adcian communication about emo\u00adtional well-being and social functioning may lead to better out\u00adcomes for women than for men, but other moderators may be equally or more influential, such as the stage of the cancer, the type of cancer, the patient's age, the patient's social support, the degree of patient-clini\u00adcian familiarity, the type of clinician (nurse, oncologist, family physi\u00adcian), the clinician's age, and/or the patient's personality. An important challenge for researchers is to unco ver the cogni\u00ad tive, emotional, and behavioral processes accounting for the effects of variables moderating the relationship between communica\u00adtion and outcomes, as well as to identify the reasons some modera\u00adtors are more important than others in certain contexts. Demographic information is easy to acquire, and its moderating influences are easy to analyze. In the absence of other measures, however, researchers often resort to speculation to explain the influence of demo\u00adgraphic moderators. To make sig\u00adnificant progress in understanding how patient-centered communica\u00adtion can promote healing and reduce suf fering from cancer, researchers must have empirical evidence and theoretical explana\u00adtions for the variables that moder\u00adate the relationship between communication and outcomes. Within the context of our model, moderators operate at multiple le v\u00ad els, influencing the link between communication and its antecedents, as well as the relation\u00adships between communication and proximal, intermediate, and distal (health) outcomes. Although a comprehensive review of potential moderators of patient-centered communication in cancer care is beyond the scope of this chapter (see Appendices A through D for more detailed reviews), we provide an overview of some of these vari\u00adables, particularly those that we see as particularly important and in need of further study. We place moderators along two dimensions (Figure 3.3), with one dimension related to the de gree to which the factor is intrinsic or extrinsic to clinicians, patients, and their relationship, and the other related to the degree to which the factor is mutable. Intrinsic modera\u00adtors (Table 3.4) are characteristics of individuals and relationships that either directly or implicitly tap into affective and cognitive processes (Table 3.4). These mod\u00aderators include the patient's emo\u00adtional state, health literacy, perceived threat of illness, knowl\u00adedge about the illness, goals, moti\u00advation, and self-efficacy, as well as corresponding clinician factors. 50 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 51 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators Figure 3.3 In a two-dimensional model of moderation of the communication-outcome relationships in cancer, moderators along one dimension are related to the degree to which the factor is intrinsic or extrinsic to clinicians, patients, and their relationship. The other dimension represents the degree to which the moderator is mutable. Intrinsic * Stable *Intrinsic to clinicians, patients, and other relationships Extrinsic moderators include disease factors (e.g., type of can\u00adcer, prognosis, and stage of dis\u00adease), the family and social environment, cultural values and beliefs, the health care system, and economic factors. The stable-muta\u00adble dimension reflects the degree to which the moderator is suscepti\u00adble to change. Understanding which factors are changeable and which are not is crucial in cancer care because interventions can be targeted to modifiable factors to increase the likelihood that com\u00admunication will accomplish desired outcomes. Factors that are more stable (i.e., less modif iable) impose constraints or opportunities that must be taken into account. For example, health literacy (dis\u00ad cussed later) is apt to be an impor\u00adtant moderator of the relationship between patient in volvement in decision-making and adherence to treatment. Patients who have a bet\u00adter understanding of the disease, their options for treatment, and the risks and benefits of different treat\u00adments will probably participate more effectively in the decision-making process. Because health Age Personality Race Gender Education Primary Language Family Structure Income Cultural Values Type of Cancer Regulatory Factors Family Functioning Social Support Network Access to Care Media Coverage Stage of Cancer Illness Representations Social Distance Self-Awareness Clinician Attitudes Emotional Disorder Perceived Risk Self-Efficacy Health Literacy Extrinsic Mutable literacy is to some degree mutable, clinicians providing patient educa\u00adtion interventions prior to decision\u00admaking 92 can optimize the patient's capacity to participate effectively. This enhanced participation could lead to a greater likelihood of com\u00adpleting treatment and thus, longer survival. The importance of identifying mutable moderators of communica\u00adtion-outcome relationships points to the shortcomings of focusing solely on demographic f actors as moderators. Demographic variables are, for the most part, stable.

Consider, for example, the common research finding that older patients prefer to be less involved in decision-making than younger patients. 93-97 It is unclear whether the relationship between age and preferences for involvement is due to expectations based on previous experience (a modifiable factor), traditional beliefs about control in the patient-clinician relationship (a potentially modifiable factor), or cognitive impairment (a stable fac- tor). It would be important to dis- cover the reason for an older patient's preferences in order to determine whether the clinician should take control of decision-making (if the preference was firmly held) or offer the patient an educational intervention that, in addition to providing information about treatment options, legit- imized the patient's involvement and encouraged the patient to par\u00ad 52 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 53 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators ticipate to the degree he or she wished.92 Moreover, many older patients do want to be involved in exchanging information and delib\u00aderating (see Section 2.5 of Chapter 2), even if they prefer that the clini\u00adcian makes the final decision. 98 3.3.1 Intrinsic moderators of patient-clinician communication and outcomes It is beyond the scope of this chap\u00adter to pro vide a comprehensive review of potential moderators of the effect of communication on outcomes. However, we discuss here four intrinsic moderators that are particularly important in cancer care and that are, to varying degrees, modifiable: health literacy, social distance, clinician attitudes toward different patients, and patient pref\u00aderences for clinician and patient roles in cancer care. We emphasize that these moderators serve as exam\u00adples from a longer list of modifiers and that these moderators overlap considerably in certain contexts. Health literacy Health literacy refers to a person's capacity to obtain, process, and communicate information about health. 99 Health literacy is an impor\u00ad tant moderator of relationships between communication and out\u00adcomes because it affects patients' ability to understand clinical and health-related information. 100 Low health literacy also may restrict a patient's ability to be an active par\u00adticipant in medical consultations because of limited familiarity with health-related terms 83,92,100 and the embarrassment of limited under\u00adstanding.101 Hence, several of the pathways linking communication to improved outcomes, such as improved patient knowledge and shared understanding, better med\u00adical decisions, and enhanced patient agency, may be less effective for patients with low literacy. The communication challenges fac\u00ading people with limited health liter\u00adac y may account for some of the disparities related to race,102 access to care,103 and poorer health out\u00ad comes among individuals with chronic disease, such as diabetes. 104\u00ad 106 Moreover, low literacy is associ\u00ad ated with lower rates of cancer screening and utilization of health care services. 107,108 Interestingly, Lindau and colleagues109 found that patient adherence to attending a follow-up visit for abnormal find\u00adings on Pap smears was not related to objective assessments of health literacy but was related to physi\u00adcians' perceptions of low health lit\u00ad eracy. These findings suggest that communication-related factors (e.g, patient participation, clinician atti\u00adtudes toward patients) may play an important role in how literacy and related perceptions interact in con\u00adsultations. Health care facilities can help address barriers related to low literacy by providing patients with educational resources specifically developed for low-literacy popula\u00adtions. Health literacy may relate not only to low educational level but also to culturally reinforced health beliefs. Thus, in addition to includ\u00ading easy-to-understand language, educational interventions also should be culturally appropriate. 110,111 Although we consider health liter\u00adacy a mutable moderator, some patients' beliefs may be harder to change, especially those related to long-held illness representations (e.g., \"Surgery to remove cancer makes it spread throughout the body.\") and mistrust of the health care system (e.g.,\"The medical industry is withholding cancer cures for profit.\"). 27 Social distance Although social distance has been conceptualized in a number of dif\u00adferent w ays, for our purposes it refers to the number and importance of dissimilarities between clinicians and patients. Social distance may be a perception or be based on objective indicators, and the two may or may not correlate. For example, a clini\u00adcian and patient from different cul\u00adtural backgrounds may have very real differences in their respective illness representations, primary lan\u00adguage, beliefs about personal con\u00adtrol over disease, and treatment goals. 112 These differences can cre\u00ad ate communication problems and may account for situations in which clinicians have difficulty under\u00adstanding the life circumstances of patients who have cultural and edu\u00adcational differences. On the other hand, differences in race, gender, and cultural background may not translate automatically into perceived social distance. A black female patient with children may find that she has much more in common with a white female clinician of the same age who also has children than with a much younger, single black male clinician. Social distance is an important moderator of the relationship 53 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 54 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care between communication and out\u00ad comes for several reasons. First, patient-clinician differences in ill\u00adness representations, use of lan\u00adguage, and health-related values create greater risks for misunder\u00adstanding or bias (discussed later) that could lead to situations in which patients' needs are not understood and for false assump\u00adtions about their values, needs, and capabilities. 113,114 In these situations, communication related to informa\u00adtion exchange and decision-making may not involve the patient under\u00adstanding and shared knowledge pathway to immediate outcomes (knowledge, satisfaction with care) or intermediate outcomes (adher\u00adence, high-quality decisions). Second, social distance can make it dif ficult to establish effective patient-clinician relationships. Patients appreciate clinicians who can understand and have empathy with their life circumstance 115 and provide them with a sense of being known. 32 Clinician communication intended to enhance the relation\u00adship, such as expressions of empa\u00adthy and shared understanding, may not be as effective in building the therapeutic alliance if the patient does not perceive the communica\u00adtion as sincere or believes the clini\u00adcian is not capable of empathic understanding. In these situations, the clinician may be less able to comfort the patient and ease his or her distress. Third, although objective markers of social distance may be dif ficult to change, perceived social dis\u00adtance is mutable, especially with the effective and sincere use of patient-centered behaviors (see T able 1.1 in Chapter 1). For exam\u00ad ple, through nonverbal signals of attentiveness, avoidance of inter\u00adruption, and questions about the patient's beliefs and values, clini\u00adcians communicate concern and an interest in the patient as a person. In turn, when patients share their beliefs, values, and preferences, they are sharing information that provides opportunities for the cli\u00adnician to understand the patient better and for both parties to dis\u00adcover common ground. The power of effective communication in decreasing perceived social dis\u00adtance is suggested in studies that have shown that patient trust increases during the consultation when clinicians are perceived as more informative, caring, and interested in the patient's views. 15 An increase in trust, in turn, leads to more continuity in the patient-clinician relationship in that patients choose to remain with physicians whom they trust. 34 Clinicians' attitudes toward patients Although most clinicians are not deliberately biased in their vie ws about different kinds of patients (according to race, sex, or age), they may have subconscious atti\u00adtudes that influence how they per\u00adceive and communicate with patients. 116 Multiple factors, includ\u00ad ing power and social roles, lead to unconscious stereotypes and biases that affect clinicians' interpreta\u00adtions of patients' capabilities, char\u00adacter, and symptoms. 114,117 These interpretations, in turn, influence clinician communication, such as following up on the concerns of some patients but not others, the detail with which clinicians pro\u00advide e xplanations about disease and treatment, and the degree to which they offer encouragement and support. Although many of these attitudes may relate to social distance, other factors, such as per\u00adsonality, likeability, and interac\u00adtional style clearly have a role. Clinicians' attitudes toward patients may af fect the degree to which communication accom\u00adplishes desired outcomes in several ways. First, stereotypic attitudes toward patients are overly simplis\u00adtic. For example, a clinician who assumes a patient is not capable of understanding complex informa\u00adtion (an assumption that may be based on the demographic charac\u00adteristics of the patient) may auto\u00admatically conduct the consultation in a more controlling manner, especially if pressed for time. Very little of the communication would be patient-centered, thus limiting the potential of activating various pathways toward better outcomes. In addition, many biases are asso\u00adciated with negative perceptions of patients, and thus less likeability. The degree to which clinicians like their patients has been associated with greater patient and clinician satisfaction with their encounter. 118 Negative attitudes about patients may be revealed subtly in nonver\u00adbal behavior, such as vocal tone and body orientation. 119 Such non\u00ad verbal behavior diminishes the value and sincerity of verbal behaviors that otherwise might be considered patient-centered, such as building partnerships and shar\u00ading information. 54 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 55 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators Moreover, clinicians' attitudes toward patients also may bias their medical judgments, and in such cir\u00adcumstances, there is a greater need for patients to communicate effec\u00adtively. In one study using hypothet\u00adical patients, 9 researchers found that physicians recommended more intensive cancer diagnostic proce\u00addures for a white woman regardless of her communication behavior but recommended the same procedures for a black woman only when she was assertive in asking about the tests in the scenario. Clinicians' negative attitude toward certain types of patients may be the reason for the higher number of black patients and poor patients who report that a positive self-presenta\u00adtion is important in getting good medical care compared with white patients and patients of higher socioeconomic status. 120 As a con\u00ad sequence, patients who are socially disadvantaged and are less inclined to assert themselves in clinical situ\u00adations bear a greater burden for achieving effective communication than do their more socially privi\u00adleged counterparts. 74,121 Studies using vignettes often demonstrate evidence of clinician bias. However, several studies of actual consultations have shown that clinicians' communication with and perceptions of patients are more a function of patient par\u00adticipation than demographic attrib\u00adutes, although the latter may have some effect. 122,123 This finding sug\u00ad gests the need for health care facil\u00adities to develop educational resources that facilitate active patient participation. Also, inter\u00adventions aimed at enhancing clini\u00adcian self-a wareness and cultural competence may help to alleviate unintended consequences of clini\u00adcians' attitudes toward patients. Patients' preferences for clinician and patient r oles Patients have expectations for their o wn role and the clinician's role in cancer care, especially with regard to what issues are discussed and who has control over decision-making. Patient preferences may be an important moderator of com\u00admunication-outcome relationships in several respects. First, a substan\u00adtial number of patients with cancer do not achieve their desired level of participation in the decision-making process, 95,124 which, in turn, can lower satisfaction with care and increase decisional regret and anxiety. 125,126 Thus, a clinician's well-intentioned but mismatched communication behavior, such as partnership building with a patient who prefers clinician control of decisions or assuming decisional control for a patient who wants to be involved in decision-making, may interfere with pathways to better outcomes, such as high-quality decisions, the patient's ability to manage emotions, and a strong therapeutic alliance. Patients vary with regard to their e xpectations for clinician and patient roles, a finding often asso\u00adciated with demographic variables. For example, older and less edu\u00adcated patients are more likely to prefer paternalistic decision-mak\u00ading models, whereas younger and more educated patients desire active and collaborative roles. 93-97 Some evidence indicates that women prefer explicit emotional support from clinicians, whereas men need emotional support but may depend on information for such purposes rather than dis\u00adcussing their feelings directly 127,128 Patients' preferences are somewhat mutable, as they may change depending on the nature of the ill\u00adness, the relationship with the cli\u00adnician, and psychological distress; preferences also may change over the course of consultations. For example, when a patient is sicker or more distressed, he or she may prefer to relinquish decisional con\u00adtrol to the clinician. 95,129 Also, patient preferences may change during a single consultation. In one study, patients' perceived role in the consultation\u2014not their pre\u00adferred role, was the stronger pre\u00addictor of evaluations of care. 130 Patients who reported a shared role with their physicians were more satisfied and evaluated their physi\u00adcians' communication more favor\u00adably than did patients who perceived that their actual role matched their previously stated role preference. However, pre\u00adferred-perceived role match was associated with less anxiety fol\u00adlowing the consultation. 130 In summary, patient preferences for their own communication as well as that of their clinician vary and can moderate the effectiveness of different patterns of communi\u00adcation for achieving pathways toward better outcomes. Because clinicians are not particularly good judges of patient preferences 131,132 and because patients and clinicians 55 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 56 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care often do not perceive the decision- making process in the same way (e.g., shared versus clinician con\u00adtrol), 97 clinicians should directly assess patient preferences before or early in the consultation. Early assessment will help the clinician to determine how to manage com\u00admunication over time, to either accommodate the patient's prefer\u00adences or to discuss these expecta\u00adtions explicitly in order to align clinician and patient perspectives. 3.3.2 Context as an important source of extrinsic moderators An ecological model of communi\u00adcation suggests that all communica\u00adtion, including the patient-clinician interaction, is situated; i.e., it occurs within multiple layers of conte xt. By context, we are refer\u00ad ring to aspects of the disease and the environment that can shape patient-clinician communication but that are external to the patient-clinician relationship (Table 3.4). 133 The same communication tasks, behaviors, and principles may be associated with different outcomes depending on the context in which they occur. Unfortunately, the role of context in clinical encounters has not been addressed in most research on patient-clinician com\u00admunication. Context is an impor\u00adtant component of our model of patient-centered communication in cancer care because it is a source of numerous extrinsic moderators that will influence communication processes and outcomes. Several contextual elements have the potential to influence health care, but six require further consid\u00aderation in cancer conte xts: Disease-related factors Family and social environment Cultural context Media environment Health care system Societal factors Disease-related factors The type of cancer, stage of dis\u00ad ease and phase along the cancer care continuum all influence the types of rele vant communication processes and outcomes. Some types of cancer, such as basal cell skin cancers, are little more than a nuisance, whereas others are nearly always fatal. Some cancers involve multiple treatment options, which depend on a complex inter\u00adplay of disease stage, patient char\u00adacteristics, and patient preferences. Fewer treatment options are avail\u00adable for other cancers. Long-term prognosis and uncer\u00ad tainty also dif fer among cancers. For some cancers, a lack of evi\u00addence of recurrence after two years nearly guarantees a cure; other can\u00adcers may appear to be eradicated but recur many years later. Still other cancers have strong genetic components, and family members are likely to be affected even if cure is achieved in the index patient. Thus, we cannot assume that the findings of studies of women with breast cancer can be applied to women with lung cancer or leukemia. Chapter 4 includes a detailed discussion of how the goals of communication, the rele\u00advant outcomes, and the communi\u00adcation processes that can achie ve those outcomes differ at each phase of the cancer care continuum. Family and social environment The patient's social environment\u2014 consisting of e xtended family, friends, and coworkers\u2014can both mediate and moderate the relation\u00adship between patient-clinician com\u00admunication and outcomes. Patients who have social networks that pro\u00advide disease-related information, emotional support, and/or help with household tasks and transportation to medical appointments typically report better mental health and optimism than do patients lacking such social support. 134,135 Social net\u00ad works also can either reinforce or undermine the decisions reached by a clinician and patient and thus affect adherence and health out\u00adcomes. Lack of social support in the form of family criticism is asso\u00adciated with a higher frequency of visits in primary care settings, 136 and the same may hold true for patients with cancer. When family members are present in clinical encounters, family-related factors can also moderate the relationship between communication and out\u00adcomes. 15,51 Family members can facilitate the interaction (e.g., help patients acquire and understand clinical information) or impede the interaction (e.g., interrupt the patient to interject their own agenda); in addition, an increased number of participants can compli\u00adcate the interaction. Clinicians must conceptualize can\u00ad cer care as a f amily issue regardless 56 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 57 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators of whether family members are present in the consulting room because family members are often consulted by patients before med\u00adical visits; visit hospitalized patients and discuss their care; and are the primary caregivers for patients with cancer, offering both instrumental help and emotional support. In addition, family mem\u00adbers themselves can be profoundly affected by the patient's cancer; they frequently experience close\u00adness and/or burnout from caregiv\u00ading. 137,138 Two levels of family input must be considered in improving clinical communication: how to manage office visits or hospital stays when the patient is accompa\u00adnied by family and how to seek and incorporate family members' per\u00adspectives when they are not pres\u00adent. A body of literature addresses the impact of cancer on family members, but very little of it directly pertains to the quality and style of communication. Cultural context The cultural context of cancer care is important because of the v arious ways it can affect patient and clini\u00adcian communication styles, the interpretation of messages, and subsequent outcomes. Although we have discussed some of these issues as they relate to intrinsic moderators, we consider cultural context to be a source of extrinsic moderators because cultural beliefs, values, and practices extend beyond individuals and characterize larger segments of the population. Perhaps most obvious is that clinicians and patients from different ethnic backgrounds often speak different languages and dialects, which creates signif icant barriers to effective communica\u00adtion. 139,140 Even if there are excellent interpreters or if the clinician and patient speak the same language, preferred styles of communicating may vary across different cultural groups, particularly with respect to assertiveness and expressiveness. People from collectivist cultures (e.g., Asians) often have commu\u00adnicative styles characterized by indirectness, respect for authority, and accommodation to others; 141 as a result, they may have more diffi\u00adculty than patients from Western cultures in being assertive and expressive when communicating with clinicians. 141,142 Western clini\u00ad cians may interpret this as passiv\u00adity or agreement. How messages are interpreted is shaped by culture. \"Hearing v oices\" might be considered to be a sign of insanity by Anglos but interpreted as a religious experi\u00adence by Mexican Americans. 143 In brief, culture is a complex feature of context. Cultural beliefs about the cause of an illness, personal control over health, and the best way to manage health problems mediate what clinicians and patient talk about, how they talk about these topics, how they interpret one another's communication, and the outcomes resulting from these encounters. 25,142,144 Media environment The media environment affects patient-clinician communication processes and outcomes in se veral respects. Media coverage of a health issue can influence patients' beliefs and expectations, especially when the media reaches a lar ge audience and addresses a salient issue. This affect was demonstrated dramatically in an Italian study 145 about a widespread media campaign promoting Di Bella therapy, an unproved cancer treatment, which substantially increased expectations and hope among patients with cancer. These hopes were shattered once the treatment was publicly shown to be ineffective. Pharmaceutical companies use mass media for direct-to-consumer \u00ad advertising to prompt patients to ask physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners for these products\u2014a strategy that appears to be successful. 146 Also, the media environment, and the Internet in particular, offer extensive informa\u00adtion resources for patients with can\u00adcer and their families. On the one hand, patients may benefit from this information by better understanding their conditions and treatment expectations and participating more effectively in medical interac\u00adtions. 60,87 On the other hand, much of this information may be scientifi\u00adcally suspect and patients often may be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of information available. Changes in ways of accessing infor\u00admation have had a major influence on the dynamics of patient-clinician interactions. No longer are patients only providing information about their symptoms and illness experi\u00adences, they are also engaging in a bidirectional exchange of disease-related information, often consult\u00ading the Internet prior to the initial meeting with an oncologist. 87 57 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 58 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Health care system Cancer communication also depends on physical and procedural characteristics of the health care system, which can include ambient noise, pri vacy issues, and the chal\u00ad lenge of navigating a complex health care system. Facilities offer\u00ading an effective \"team\" approach may provide care that is coordi\u00adnated and features good communi\u00adcation among multidisciplinary team members. Such facilities also may offer informational and social support resources to clinicians and patients in person, through shared electronic patient records as well as the Internet. In contrast, loosely integrated care may require that patients use medical services at multiple facilities. Even simple changes in organizational proce\u00addures, such as longer scheduled visits, can have a significant effect on patient-clinician communication to the extent they constrain or facil\u00aditate patient involvement in the decision-making process. Longer visits are characterized by greater patient participation, and patients control proportionally more of the conversational floor. 147,148 In short, health care systems should take into account the degree to which their organizational procedures affect the quality of patient-clini\u00adcian communication, especially since problematic patient-clinician communication may lead to poorer outcomes, unnecessary tests, more readmissions, and higher costs. 7 Societal factors Although the subject of little research, societal f actors, including the regulatory and legal environ\u00adment, can have a significant effect on patient-clinician communication. Societal norms and le gislation affect eligibility for health services, transportation to medical appoint\u00adments, and payment for prescription medications. Requirements for the informed consent process and dis\u00adclosure of information provide legal safeguards that are intended to pro\u00adtect patients from abusive or negli\u00adgent medical care. The requirements help ensure that clinicians are pro\u00adviding legally appropriate care and alert patients to their eligibility for services, such as hospice care. However, the volume of paperwork that must be reviewed and signed often imposes inconveniences that take up valuable time and could detract from clinician and patient goals for the encounter. In addition, a clinician's direct or indirect expe\u00adrience with malpractice claims could influence his or her conduct in the consultation and attitudes toward patients. Many physicians worry about lawsuits, which, in turn, may contribute to a general distrust of patients. 149 Some clini\u00ad cians may adopt a more cautious and guarded style of communicat\u00ading with patients because of fear of litigation, whereas others will use more patient-centered communica\u00adtion because these behaviors may lower the risk for malpractice. 150 3.4 Multilevel Modeling Given the complexities of factors affecting patient-clinician commu\u00adnication processes, the pathways though which communication achieves desired outcomes, and the moderators of these relationships, researchers should use multilevel modeling in their analytic techniques. Multile vel modeling is one approach to sorting out multiple influences on a clinical interaction and the moder\u00adating effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the relationship between communication and health outcomes. These factors will be discussed in detail in Chapter 5, but we highlight five studies here. In two studies, Street 122,123 examined the extent to which physician and patient com\u00admunication behaviors were related uniquely to their own personal char\u00adacteristics, the other's personal characteristics, and the other's com\u00admunication behaviors. By using a nested multilevel model, Street was able to discern that the physician's individual style of communicating (a predisposing influence) and the patient's communication behavior (asking questions, expressing con\u00adcerns) were stronger predictors of the degree to which physicians gave information, issued directives, engaged in partnership building, and provided positive socioemo\u00adtional responses than were patient characteristics per se (education, anxiety, and relational history with the physician). Of the patient char\u00adacteristic variables, only level of education uniquely explained varia\u00adtion in the physician's communica\u00adtion; physicians engaged in more partnership building with better educated patients. Street also found that patients did not talk differently to individual physicians per se, but patients did ask more questions and offer more opinions when physi\u00adcians used partnership-building behaviors more frequently. In addi\u00adtion, patients' communication was 58 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 59 Chapter 3: Pathways from Communication to Health Outcomes: Mediators and Moderators uniquely related, to some extent, to their personal characteristics; better educated patients asked more ques\u00adtions and offered more opinions, and worried patients expressed more concerns. A more recent study from Street and colleagues similarly in volved the use of multilevel analyses to examine variations in patient-physician communication and physicians' judgments of the patients as communicators. 151 The strongest predictors of the physi\u00adcians' use of patient-centered com\u00admunication was the physician's individual style, the degree to which the physician had a \"shar\u00ading\" (as opposed to physician-cen\u00adtered) orientation to the physician-patient relationship, 152,153 and the degree to which patients were actively involved and expressed positive affect. Patient-centered communication was not related to patient demographic characteristics. However, physi\u00adcians' judgments of patients as communicators were more positive for white patients than for black patients and for patients who expressed more positive affect. In a related study, 154 physicians appeared to give more information to white patients than to black patients. However, when communi\u00adcation variables were entered into the equation, physician informa\u00adtion-giving was no longer related to race per se but rather to the degree to which patients were active partic\u00adipants; i.e., black patients received less information because they were less actively involved in eliciting information from physicians. Another study involved the use of multile vel modeling to ascertain whether patients' ratings in terms of trust in their physician, the physician's knowledge of the patient as a person, satisfaction, the degree of the physician's patient\u00adcenteredness, and the level of the physician's supportiveness for the patient's autonomy. 155 The authors used surveys completed by 4,700 patients of 96 physicians to exam\u00adine the adjusted relationship between patients' perceptions of their physicians and reported changes in health status. Although there were significant adjusted relationships, patients who saw their physicians more favorably in terms of communication and trust had a smaller risk of decline in health status. Multilevel analysis showed significant differences in patients' perceptions of their physi\u00adcians. These differences were unre\u00adlated to reported changes in health status, however, suggesting that unmeasured communication and relationship factors\u2014not physi\u00adcians' overall communication style\u2014affected health status. 3.5 Conclusion Models of communication should be simple enough to be understand\u00adable and guide empirical research, yet complex enough to approxi\u00admate clinical reality. We have pro\u00adposed a model of mediation of communication in which the six communication functions described in Chapter 2 lead to proximal com\u00admunication outcomes, which them\u00adselves act as mediators between communication and intermediate outcomes. We described seven pathw ays through which effective communication leads to intermedi\u00adate and distal outcomes, providing improvements in the following: Patient knowledge and shared understanding Access to care Therapeutic alliances Emotional self-management Family/social support and adv ocacy Quality of medical decisions Patient agency (self-efficacy, empo werment, and enable\u00ad ment) In turn, these pathways lead to bet\u00adter adherence, health habits, and self-care. Studies of moderators of the relationship between communi\u00adcation and proximal, intermediate, and distal (health and societal) out\u00adcomes suggest that relationship f actors need to be studied in greater depth, including issues such as gender concordance, shared understanding, mutual knowledge, and involvement of family members in care. Further\u00admore, there may be underlying and modifiable communication factors that account for some of the observed demographic differences in outcomes. Little is known of the moderating effect of different com\u00admunication media (in person, tele\u00adphone, electronic, asynchronous, etc.) on the process or outcomes of communication. Changes in the health care system are underway to improve patient safety, quality of care, and communication among 59 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 60 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care health professionals. The effect of these innovations needs further examination, given the dynamic changes that are likely to continue. References (1) Kaplan SH, Greenfield S, Ware JE Jr .

The first two phases, prevention and screening, involve the entire population. The diagnosis, treat\u00adment, and survivorship phases eventually will involve all patients with a diagnosis of cancer. The end-of-life phase is relevant for patients who have cancers that cannot be cured but clearly is also relevant to individuals who die of other causes. The patient's position along the cancer care continuum is one of the most important contextual ele\u00adments that determine the nature of the concerns raised during clinical encounters, the most relevant health outcomes, and the specific pathways by which communication affects those outcomes. In Chapter 2, we described six functions of communication (Table 4.1) and, in general, the proximal outcomes associated with each function. For example, information exchange would be expected to lead to improved knowledge and shared understanding. In Chapter 3, we described pathways between com\u00admunication and intermediate out\u00adcomes such as self-efficacy and adherence, and distal outcomes such as quality of life and survival. In this chapter, we consider in greater detail how each of the six communication functions affects specific outcomes at each of the Table 4.1 Six Functions of Patient/Family-Clinician Communication in Cancer Settings Fostering healing relationships Exchanging information Responding to emotions Managing uncertainty Making decisions Enabling patient self- management six phases of the cancer care con\u00ad tinuum. At all phases, clinicians may have to assess symptoms, foster change in health beha viors, deal with uncertainty, and/or discuss plans for the future. Nonetheless, the rel\u00adative balance and importance of each communication task changes as each patient moves through the illness trajectory. Early in the con\u00adtinuum, there may be greater need to share information, but later there may be more of a need to deal with uncertainty; e.g., whether the treat\u00adment was effective. Similarly, at each phase, different outcomes also assume varying degrees of importance. For example, emo\u00adtional well-being may be para\u00admount at the time of diagnosis or recurrence, whereas physical func\u00adtioning may be a more central issue during and after treatment. Although intermediate outcomes, 4 67 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 68 Figure 4.1 The six communication functions can help to improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in each of the phases of the cancer care continuum. Outcomes HRQOL Survival Communication Functions Fostering Healing Relationships Exchanging Information Responding to Emotions Managing Uncertainty Making Decisions Enabling Patient Self-management Prevention Phases of the Cancer Continuum Screening Diagnosis Treatment Survivorship End of Life Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care such as adherence to treatment, often are necessary steps to achieve desired health outcomes at some phases, communication itself may have a more direct effect on well-being at other phases. At each phase, patients normally encounter a new set of clinicians. During the prevention and screen\u00ading phases, cancer-related commu\u00adnication usually takes place in primary care settings. At later phases, surgeons and radiologists are involved in the diagnosis of cancer, and during the treatment phase, oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, specialized nurses, and technicians are involved. Still later, patients often return to primary care settings after activ e treatment and often encounter specialists in rehabilita\u00adtion and palliati ve care. Thus, com\u00ad munication research should take into account not only what is com\u00admunicated but also with whom. We suggest a taxonomy of research agendas based on the phases along the cancer care continuum, relev ant health outcomes, and the six com\u00admunication functions (Figure 4.1). This perspecti ve is intended to guide research that progresses from generalities about what improves communication to specifics on what will improve outcomes for a particular patient at a given point on the continuum. The taxonomy indicates, for example, that it may be possible to look at unique path\u00adways and outcomes of information exchange during the treatment phase. It also can help identify gaps in the literature and pro vide a framework for design of interven\u00adtions to improve communication. The proximal, intermediate, and distal outcomes of communication were summarized in Table 3.1 (Chapter 3). The discussion that follows here (and Table 4.2) pro\u00advides a framework for identifying particularly important outcomes at each phase of the cancer care con\u00adtinuum. Only some of these out\u00adcomes have been discussed in the cancer communication literature. 68 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 69 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and

Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum In discussing each phase, we first describe desirable outcomes of communication, common commu\u00adnication tasks, and the pathways by which communication improves health. We also recognize that other potent factors, such as the patient's prognosis, influence how commu\u00adnication affects outcomes. Starting with current research on patient-cli\u00adnician communication, we provide a roadmap for future work to study relationships between communica\u00adtion and outcomes. 4.1 Prevention Phase Effective interventions for preven\u00adtion involve much more than patient-clinician interactions. Because ideally they involve the entire population, most prevention efforts take a public health approach and use mass media to disseminate information and foster behavior change. Our discussion, however, specifically focuses on how patient/family-clinician com\u00admunication can reduce cancer risk. Primary care physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners are the major sources of health information related to prevention of cancer in health care settings for all patients except for patients who have a high genetic risk for cancer. Primary care clinicians also have an important role in motivating behavior change. 4.1.1 Desirable outcomes Effective cancer prevention should ideally result in a lo wer risk of cancer, as well as a reduction in racial, ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic disparities in can\u00adcer pre vention. Intermediate out\u00ad comes along the pathway from communication at the prevention phase and a lower incidence of cancer among the general popula\u00adtion include use of immunizations to prevent cervical cancer and hep\u00adatitis B-associated liver cancer and the adoption of healthier habits, such as smoking cessation, exer\u00adcise, and sun protection. 4.1.2 Communication tasks and functions A large percentage of the popula\u00ad tion has beha vioral risks for cancer that are difficult to change and require active patient participation and motivation. The patient-clini\u00adcian relationship has an important role in fostering behavior change. Relationship building during the prevention phase should involve autonomy-supportive clinician behaviors such as active listening and encouraging patients to become involved in their own care, which will help them feel more enabled 1,2 and motivated.3, 4 Clinicians can help patients gain access to infor\u00admation about healthy behaviors and also can explore patients' health beliefs that are not concordant with known prevention strategies. 5 Patients must make decisions regarding prevention, the most important of which is whether to try to change a behavior at all. In addition, patients encounter deci\u00adsions regarding immunizations. For example, now that two human papillomavirus vaccines are avail\u00adable, many parents must confront the decision of whether to immu\u00adnize their preadolescent children and, if so, with which of the v ac\u00ad cines. Clinicians have a role in making choices explicit for patients and helping them decide to adopt healthy behaviors. Clinicians also should actively help patients adopt healthy beha viors. One method for enabling patients is the 5-A model to guide patients through a behavior change process; 6,7 the process includes the following: Asking about the behavior Advising the patient to change Assessing facilitators and bar\u00ad riers to change Assisting (actively) the patient Arranging for further interven\u00ad tions and follo w-up Factors related to the health care system are also crucial. Clinical practices that are or ganized around prevention have been associated with higher rates of recommended cancer screening. 8 Well-function\u00ad ing health care systems can pro\u00advide patients access to cancer risk reduction programs, including counseling on diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. In addition, such systems can address clini\u00adcians' lack of time and the compet\u00ading demands in primary care encounters that make it difficult to focus on all relevant health risks. It is important to note that many rec\u00adommended patient self-management strategies may be inaccessible to patients with low socioeconomic and educational levels unless clini\u00ad 71 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 72 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care cians involve social agencies to assist these patients in following through with their healthy choices. 4.2 Screening Phase 4.2.1 Desirable outcomes When cancer or precancerous con\u00ad ditions are detected at an early enough phase, the y are more likely to be curable. Early detection can also reduce morbidity and suffer\u00ading for patients who have cancers that are not curable. Thus, the most important intermediate outcome at this phase is the timely completion of recommended age-specific and gender-specific cancer screening, with appropriate follow-up for abnormal results. Communication about risks and benefits of screen\u00ading generally occurs within the pri\u00admary health care domain, whereas some screening tests and follow-up of positive screening tests often involve specialty care. 4.2.2 Communication tasks and functions In the United States, many recom\u00ad mended cancer screening proce\u00addures are performed on only a small percentage of the population. 9 Lack of information may be one reason for low screening rates, but more often fear, inconvenience, and lack of access are the reasons patients do not have screening tests. In addition, some patients have health beliefs that cause them to doubt clinical guidelines. For example, patients may believe that mammography can cause cancer or that recommendations for prostate cancer screening are promoted by special interest groups. It is impor\u00adtant for clinicians to understand their patients' health beliefs in order to address them. Some of these beliefs may have some basis in current or historical fact. Communication about screening must incorporate se veral steps. Patients must be informed about screening and its effectiveness, make a decision to schedule a pro\u00adcedure, and navigate their way through the health care system to have the procedures completed. Also, because most screening pro\u00adcedures involve some discomfort and inconvenience, clinicians need to address patients' concerns and help make it easier to have the pro\u00adcedure completed. For example, a patient who is avoiding a colonoscopy may benefit from an explicit discussion about the trade\u00adoffs: the discomforts associated with the procedure versus the pre\u00adsumed benefits. Some screening procedures, such as determination of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), are controversial, with oppo\u00adnents suggesting that the test may actually lead to worse outcomes. Discussions of risks, benefits, fears, and uncertainties involving PSA testing are necessary, although time-consuming. Some patients also fear knowing the result of a screen\u00ading test, considering ignorance bet\u00adter than bad news. Eliciting and discussing those fears can improve the chance that patients will partici\u00adpate in screening. Barriers to screening dispropor\u00ad tionately af fect disadvantaged, minority, and low-literacy popula\u00adtions, 10,11 in part because they are more likely to experience fragmen\u00adtation of care, have inadequate transportation, and be unable to take time off from work for med\u00adical visits. Racial and ethnic stereotyping and cultural differ\u00adences in language use can create further communication barriers. 12-14 Knowledge deficits, fear, uncer\u00adtainty, poor access, and poor understanding of probabilistic esti\u00admates of risks and benefits can be improved through effective com\u00admunication, which includes the following steps: Clarify the reason for screening Gain the patient's trust Offer tangible help for navi\u00adgating the health care system Provide interpreters Provide low-literacy, culturally informed educational materials Involving family members in the consultation also may be helpful in moti vating patients to follow through with screening. 4.3 Diagnosis Phase 4.3.1 Desirable outcomes Effective communication should impro ve the likelihood that carrying out diagnostic testing, informing the patient of the diagnosis, and deter\u00admining initial treatment choices will be accomplished quickly, without delays, and in an environment that supports the patient's emotional 72 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 73 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum needs. Intermediate outcomes include adequate patient under\u00adstanding and recall of disease-related information, including prognosis and treatment options. Ultimately, patients should be satis\u00adfied with their treatment choices and the process by which they reached their decisions. Improved social support, self-efficacy, and a sense of control are important inter\u00admediate outcomes as well. Patients with a greater sense of confidence may make better informed choices and may seek the support that they need. Confidence also may help patients anticipate and plan for the disruptions and discomforts of anti\u00adcancer treatments. 4.3.2 Communication tasks and functions During the diagnosis phase, clini\u00ad cians initially must accomplish the follo wing: Assess symptoms that raised suspicion of cancer Address patients' anxiety, fear, and sometimes terror at the anticipation of a cancer diag\u00adnosis, e ven before communi\u00ad cating bad news Communicate bad news clearly and compassionately Involve family members in discussions and decisions to the de gree that it will be help\u00ad ful and desired by patients Help patients recall important information Assist patients with navigating their w ay through the health care system to gain access to procedures and consultations Discuss probabilistic data in w ays that patients understand so that they can participate in discussions and decisions about treatment Assess patients' desire to par\u00ad ticipate in decisions Communicate prognosis while maintaining hope Help patients make decisions about anticancer treatments and adv ance directives Provide support to the patient, f amily, caregivers, and friends Mutual understanding and patient in volvement in the consultation are also likely to help patients tolerate and follow through with treatment. All of these tasks are complex and apply to the treatment, survivor\u00adship, and end-of-life phases as well. Because these tasks often are encountered for the first time at diagnosis, we discuss them in detail in this section. The first major communication task at the diagnosis phase is either assessing symptoms that ha ve raised the suspicion of cancer or notifying patients of results of a positive screening test. Some can\u00adcers, such as cancers of the cervix, breast, and colon are increasingly being diagnosed by routine or tar\u00adgeted screening, whereas other common cancers, such as cancers of the lung and ovary and hemato\u00adlogical malignancies, usually are diagnosed in response to patients' reporting of symptoms. The initial process of clinical evaluation in volves gathering information from the patient. In later phases, clinicians provide information, but this information often is changing rapidly and is incomplete until the full diagnostic picture is clear. The entire process of diagnosis may take a day or less, but more often, it takes place over the course of sev\u00aderal days or weeks. Furthermore, patients may need to choose which (if any) diagnostic procedures to pursue. The choice can be more difficult if the diagnostic proce\u00addures are uncomfortable. Patients experience chaos, terror, and anxi\u00adety during this phase, which, in turn, affects their ability to assimi\u00adlate information and make rational decisions. Thus, eliciting and vali\u00addating emotions may become more important and also more difficult during the advancement toward a definitive diagnosis. Patients' decisions and understand\u00ad ings are frequently influenced by information from multiple health professionals, which can some\u00adtimes be conflicting or unclear . Consider the situation of a patient with a brain lesion that appears unresectable; a neurosurgeon sug\u00adgests a brain biopsy to establish a tissue diagnosis, but the biopsy is associated with a risk of brain injury, and a radiation oncologist suggests empirical radiotherapy because, in all likelihood, that would be the treatment of choice. This case illustrates that sometimes clinicians cannot provide a defini\u00adtive diagnosis or prognosis. Although the process of establish\u00ading a diagnosis is typically a very 73 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 74 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care stressful time for patients and their families, there has been almost no research on communication during the diagnostic process. The second task at the diagnosis phase is deli vering bad news. Although almost all patients in Western industrialized countries wish to know their diagnosis, patients vary in their desire for information about treatment and prognosis at the time of the initial cancer diagnosis. Clinicians must assess how much detail patients want. Particularly important is ask\u00ading patients what role they would like their families to play: what information should be shared, with whom, and when. Ideally, patient preferences should be discussed before diagnostic testing, but in actual clinical practice, that is often not the case. Because recall of such information is typically poor, pro\u00adviding information in small chunks, repeating key points, categorizing, summarizing, and checking patient understanding are key communica\u00adtion skills. 15-19 Audio recordings of consultations20-22 and written mate\u00ad rials23 may be helpful. Managing the strong patient emo\u00adtions associated with hearing bad ne ws for the first time requires skillful clinician use of empathy. Patients' emotional well-being after a diagnosis is enhanced by adequate preparation for the news before diagnostic testing, presence of friends or family members at the consultation, discussion of the patient's feelings, and clear infor\u00admation presented in oral and writ\u00adten formats. 24,25 Patients fear that they will face these challenges alone; they need reassurance that their physicians and other health professionals will be there for them when the y need them.26 Communicating bad news is never easy and often is done poorly. However, intensive training in this area can improve physicians' abil\u00adity and willingness to share bad news in ways that optimize infor\u00admation transfer, emotional support, and the patient-clinician relation\u00adship. 27-29 Unfortunately, few physi\u00ad cians and other clinicians have participated in such training, and frequently, participants are not those whose skills are the most deficient. As discussed in Chapter 2, delivery of bad ne ws also may occur later in the cancer care continuum. The recurrence or metastasis of a tumor that had been presumed cured may be emotionally devastating to the patient, require management of information and uncertainty, and involve treatment choices about which less is known than primary treatment at the time of initial diagnosis. Complex navigation of the health care system may be nec\u00adessary to get additional expert opinions from sources outside the institution. The third major communication task during the diagnosis phase is making decisions about the initial anticancer treatment. In some cases of slo w-growing cancers, patients choose to forgo anticancer treatment entirely or opt for watch\u00adful waiting if it is possible that the risk of treatment-related complica\u00adtions will exceed the therapeutic benefit. In trying to measure what constitutes a \"good decision, \" researchers have considered whether the Decision is consistent with recommendations Patient feels informed and kno wledgeable Patient later regrets the decision Patient participated at his or her desired le vel of involvement These intermediate outcomes may contrib ute to increased motivation, self-efficacy, and a higher likeli\u00adhood that adequate treatment will be completed. 30,31 Making decisions depends on the availability of adequate, patient-friendly information. 32 Factors related to the patient, clinician, and health care system affect the type, quality, and quantity of informa\u00adtion patients can obtain about their illness and its treatment. Patients who are more active communica\u00adtors tend to get better quality infor\u00admation from their physicians. 33 In addition to obtaining information from their physicians, patients seek information from a variety of sources: other health professionals, family, friends, the media, books, and, especially, the Internet. Even though patients trust their physi\u00adcians more than information from the Internet, they tend to go online for information before their initial cancer consultation. 34 When searching the Internet, patients may be frustrated by the lack of useful information, confused by 74 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 75 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum conflicting information from reli\u00ad able sources, and/or overwhelmed by the overload of information without clear criteria to judge its quality. 35 Clinicians can help patients interpret and judge the quality of these other sources. However, even clinicians can dis\u00adagree with each other. In those sit\u00aduations, patients with strong relationships with their family physicians and other primary care professionals may rely on them for advice, or, alternatively, may seek additional opinions from special\u00adists or lay sources. Presenting probabilistic informa\u00adtion about treatment ef fectiveness and prognosis is challenging,36 as discussed in Chapter 2 (and in detail in Appendix B). Because patients and clinicians may under\u00adstand semiquantitative words, such as \"rare\" and \"mild\" differently, 36 clinicians should be explicit and use graphics and written materials as well. Patients with low literacy generally need explanations in a face-to-face setting, especially for probabilistic information, and even then may not fully understand. 10 Written, video-based, or Internet-based decision aids can help to clarify options and can affect patients' choices, sometimes para\u00addoxically decreasing willingness to follow recommended guidelines when the absolute reduction in risk is low. 37 An important area for future research is the effect of decision aids on patient-clinician communi\u00adcation; very little is currently known. 38 Information is necessary but not sufficient for decision-making; 32 patients and clinicians need to interpret information in the context of the patient' s illness and his or her values. Few clinicians in North America and other English-speak\u00ading countries follow purely pater\u00adnalistic models, in which the clinician makes decisions unilater\u00adally, or consumerist models, in which the patient is an independent agent who uses the clinician only for advice. Nearly all patients, when given the opportunity to par\u00adticipate and express their prefer\u00adences, tend to favor some degree of involvement in decision-making. Patients frequently do not want to take the responsibility for making decisions yet want to be involved and to participate in their care in meaningful ways. 39 Patients with recently diagnosed cancer may be cognitively compromised because of the terror of the initial diagno\u00adsis, fatigue and other symptoms, family pressure, and information overload. Thus, they may not par\u00adticipate at levels that they might have anticipated. 40 Although patients retrospectively may appre\u00adciate clinicians' efforts to help them participate more actively, cli\u00adnicians also must have the flexibil\u00adity to recognize when they are imposing an unwanted burden of responsibility on patients. 41 However, reviews of interventions to increase patient involvement in decision-making (summarized in Appendix E) suggest that the degree to which patients achieve their preferred role in decision-making does not always lead to increased satisfaction or a lower level of anxiety. Rather, the quality of the interaction and the relation\u00adship may be more important\u2014 whether patients feel heard and understood, whether the y have trust in the clinician, and whether they feel enabled to act on their own behalf. 42-46 4.4 Treatment Phase During the treatment phase, patients and clinicians continue discussions about planning and participating in anticancer treat\u00adments. Patients frequently experi\u00adence uncomfortable side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and pain, yet these may go unreported or unaddressed. Patients may want to discuss changing or stopping treat\u00adment depending on the initial response and side effects. 4.4.1 Desirable outcomes Effective communication can encourage patients to complete sur gical treatment and/or receive adequate doses of chemotherapy agents or radiation. Better commu\u00adnication can lead to lower levels of anxiety and depression, fewer side effects, greater social support, and success in finding meaning. 47 Completion of adequate treatment and attention to psychosocial issues are both associated with improved survival and health-related quality of life. Conversely, poor communication may be par\u00adtially responsible for the inade\u00adquate treatment more commonly seen in minority populations 48 and patients with low health literacy.10 Patient factors that influence com\u00admunication include access to care, expectations, trust, and level of activation. 75 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 76 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care 4.4.2 Communication tasks and functions Clinicians need to understand how cancer and its treatments af fect their patients in order to form stronger relationships with them. When patients have strong rela\u00adtionships with members of the treatment team, they may receive information and social support that help them tolerate transient fatigue and nausea and adjust to disfigure\u00adment and disability. Patients should feel that information was shared in ways that they could understand and recall to help them make informed decisions. Clinicians can help patients take charge of aspects of their care, gain access to needed treatments and services, and prepare for long-term care and surveillance. Addressing uncertainty and wor\u00ad ries about the future are important at this phase b ut are rarely addressed. Clinicians often do not detect patients' emotional con\u00adcerns, often leading patients to stop raising the issues. 49 The nature of worries during the treatment phase may also differ from that during other phases, and patients may be afraid even to mention concerns. Nonetheless, patients commonly ask themselves, \"Is the treatment working?\" or \"Will I experience side effects?\" Clinicians should be attentive to indirect cues, 50-52 initi\u00ad ate conversations with patients about their worries, and ask directly about patients' reasons for nonadherence or discontinuation of treatment. 53 Acknowledging patients' emotions,54 expressing empathy, giving choices to patients,55 and offering referrals for counseling are ways of responding to patient distress. Unfortunately, many patients recei ve less than optimal anticancer treatment. Clinicians may interpret patients' expressions of discomfort differently based on racial or ethnic stereotyping, misunderstandings, and prior assumptions about treatment effectiveness. 48 These interpretations may result in dose reductions that render chemother\u00adapy ineffective or in cessation of treatment. For patients, communication-related f actors that contribute to these treatment changes include the following: Lack of understanding of clini\u00adcal e vidence suggesting that the treatment is effective Lack of understanding that lo wer doses may be equivalent to no treatment at all Lack of understanding that side ef fects may be transient and reversible Distrust of the clinician, or feeling \"e xperimental\" Distrust of the evidence on which treatment decisions are based Information and recommenda\u00adtions from other sources (par\u00adticularly the Internet) Not feeling understood by the clinician 4.5 Survivorship Phase More than 10 million Americans are living with cancer, 14% of whom have cancer that was diag\u00adnosed more than 20 years earlier. Survivorship is more common with breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecological cancers than with other common cancers, such as lung, pancreas, and brain cancer, for example. Currently, 64% of adults with cancer can expect to be alive in five years. 56 Survivorship has been defined as the time from diagnosis to death 57,58 and is divided into acute, extended, and permanent phases. 59 In this section, we address the extended and permanent phases, which begin after initial treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy has been completed (usually less than one year after diagnosis). Survivors include indi\u00adviduals who have had remission after initial treatment, who will not have treatment-induced remission, and who will have relapsed disease after remission. Survivorship has an impact on family, friends, and caregivers. 60 Many of the commu\u00ad nication issues related to survivor\u00adship have been discussed in the sections on the diagnosis and treat\u00adment phases and will not be repeated here. We address issues that arise for patients at the end of life in the next section. 4.5.1 Desirable outcomes Ideally, effective communication should result in greater lik elihood of maintenance of remission, pre\u00advention and treatment of long-term 76 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 77 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum sequelae of treatment, and improvement in quality of life. Intermediate outcomes include the following: adherence to long-term treatments (e.g., tamoxifen for breast cancer), completion of rec\u00adommended surveillance testing for recurrence, and treatment decisions made in concordance with the patient's values. Because uncer\u00adtainty and anxiety are common when active treatment is com\u00adpleted, feeling supported and understood are important interme\u00addiate outcomes on the pathway between communication and emo\u00adtional well-being. 4.5.2 Communication tasks and functions The greatest gap between the bio\u00ad medical perspecti ve (cure or remis\u00ad sion) and the patient's illness experience may occur at the sur\u00advivorship phase. Although the cli\u00adnician may celebrate that the patient has had a response to treat\u00adment when the tumor appears to have diminished in size or disap\u00adpeared, the patient may be experi\u00adencing residual symptoms and other effects of the cancer and its treatment. Such symptoms as fatigue, paresthesias from neuro\u00adtoxic chemotherapy, dysphagia from chest radiation, lymphedema from axillary node dissection, and slowed thinking from brain irradia\u00adtion are rarely totally disabling, but they have an impact on quality of life and self-image. Many patients must learn to live with the results of disfiguring surgery and may need reconstructive surgery. They may experience late effects of can\u00adcer treatment, such as secondary cancers, obesity , sexual dysfunc\u00ad tion, infertility, and birth complica\u00adtions, which are more common than previously thought. 61 Other consequences of cancer are lower earning potential 62 and difficulty in obtaining health insurance. Patients and their families continue to need information during the sur\u00advi vorship phase. Patients, their families, and their work colleagues may have the misconception that all cancer is fatal; patients may interpret any new symptom as a harbinger of disease progression and may seek frequent diagnostic testing for reassurance. Clinicians and patients must decide about fre\u00adquency of follow-up, which tests to use for surveillance, and the advan\u00adtages and disadvantages of exten\u00adsively evaluating new symptoms. Further explanations of prognosis may be needed during this phase. Patients often want to know the likelihood of recurrence and, if the cancer recurs, they want to know the effectiveness of treatment. At some point, most patients fear recurrence, and man y worry about their children's and other family members' risk for the development of the same cancer. Depression is common at this phase. However, patients may be reluctant to share their feelings because they feel that they should be glad treatment was successful, and others may expect them to feel this way as well. Because patients tend not to dis\u00adclose these concerns sponta\u00adneously, clinicians need to gain patients' trust and to inquire about their concerns. Not surprisingly, a major communication task for cli\u00adnicians, patients, and their f amilies, especially during the first few years of survivorship, is dealing with the cognitive and emotional aspects of uncertainty. Achieving an appropriate balance between realism and hope is discussed in greater depth in Section 4.6. Patients who have had a good response to treatment ha ve less fre\u00ad quent contact with health profes\u00adsionals. Patients may have fewer opportunities to get information and reassurance and at the same time need to re-establish a normal life. Family members may be relieved and may be less receptive to disease-focused discussions. Yet, the patient may continue to feel wounded, afraid, and vulnerable long after the successful treatment has been completed. 59,63 Thus, the clinician's focus must be both on controlling the disease and on healing the patient. Healing begins with the willingness and ability to see the illness through the patient's eyes as well as through a clinical lens and building a network of social supports so that the patient can move ahead with his or her life. Prior patterns of responding to stress, anxiety, and social support may predict how patients face the stresses of survivorship. Currently, however, there is very little empiri\u00adcal literature that can guide clini\u00adcians to communicate more effectively with cancer survivors. 77 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 78 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care 4.6 End-of-Life Phase 4.6.1 Desirable outcomes Palliation, the reduction of suffer\u00ad ing related to physical and mental symptoms, should be part of an y cancer treatment program, regard\u00adless of curative intent. However, quality of life, rather than post\u00adponement of death, becomes more of a focus of care for most patients with treatment-resistant cancer. Clinicians should not assume that all patients value par\u00adticular aspects of quality of life equally. For some patients, the ability to go to a family event may be more important than total relief of pain, and for others the ability to eat may take on particular importance. Thus, clinicians should inquire about quality-of\u00adlife issues directly. 4.6.2 Communication tasks and functions In reviews of the communication tasks in end-of-life care, de Haes and T eunissen 64 and Tattersall et al.,47 noted that the following tasks are important: Eliciting information from patients about pain and other symptoms Providing accurate prognostic information while maintaining hope Managing strong emotions in patients and clinicians Making numerous decisions about initiation and cessation of palliati ve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and life-sus\u00ad taining treatments Deciding where the patient will li ve and who will care for him or her Dealing with patients' fears of abandonment Handling requests from the patient and f amily to use futile therapies, to set unrealistic goals, or to hasten death Information exchange can be prob\u00adlematic in both directions. P atients are frequently reluctant to report pain for a variety of reasons, often because they believe that reporting pain represents moral failure or weakness. The use of systematic questioning and quality-of-life questionnaires has helped patients to report pain and other symptoms. 65,66 Even when offered the opportunity, however, patients may not report symptoms, and caretakers may take on the role of reporting symptoms and advocat\u00ading for the patient. Patient passivity may be especially evident if the patient has cognitive decline, which is often noted with advanced cancer; in such situations, caretak\u00aders may assume the role of surro\u00adgate for the patient during encounters with clinicians. To make matters even more complex, families often do not present a uni\u00adfied view on what is best for the patient. Handling strong emotions is another important challenge in end-of-life discussions. The patient and family may express strong positive and negative feel\u00adings, which can be difficult for e ven very skilled clinicians. Furthermore, clinician and care\u00adgiver burnout may reduce clini\u00adcians' and family members' ability to respond to patients' emotions. 67-69 Managing uncertainty is one of the most difficult communication tasks during the end-of-life phase because it involves balancing two patient/family-clinician dialogues: one about prognosis and one about hope. 70,71 Communicating prognosis has three major challenges. First, prognoses apply to groups, but the illness trajectory will be unique for each individual. Second, patients and their families vary in their wish to know what will happen next. Patients who might tolerate knowing that they have cancer may not want to know that they are dying. 72 Third, patients are often discomfited by physician expres\u00adsions of uncertainty; consequently, the clinician may feel that he or she has to assume a posture of expressing more than can be known. The dialogue on hope has similar challenges. P atients generally want to know the truth. However, when asked, patients with terminal ill\u00adnesses often still express hope for a cure. 73 Physicians often collude with these wishes by exaggerating or avoiding discussion of prognosis 74,75 even when providing palliative treatments. Although cli\u00adnicians debate whether to present prognostic information directly or to engage in \"necessary collusion\" to soften the blow of a terminal diagnosis, 76,77 few data support 78 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 79 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum either method. Regardless of the communication approach tak en, however, patients have a right to be informed of a full range of treat\u00adment options. Continuing treat\u00adment with the illusion of curative intent when the patient is dying or saying that nothing can be done represent paternalism and aban\u00addonment, respectively. Although clinical guidelines for skillful com\u00admunication about these issues exist, 15,78 empirical data are lacking. A series of difficult decisions is often made during the end-of-life phase, perhaps more so than at ear\u00adlier phases of the disease\u2014and there is less e vidence to guide each decision. Treatment options, including experimental treatments, must be considered one by one. The patient may need to decide which clinical outcomes are most important; for example, longer sur\u00advival may come at the expense of more treatment-related symptoms. Clinicians should raise the issue of advance directives, as patients do not usually discuss them sponta\u00adneously. Typically, the family becomes more in volved during the end-of\u00ad life phase. Family engagement in decisions varies according to the culture and the cognitive capacity of the patient. Clinicians must be skilled at keeping the focus on the patient's wishes when communi\u00adcating with anxious family mem\u00adbers whose understanding, concerns, and values may differ from those of the patient. 79 Conflicts within the family about treatment goals, resuscitation, and hospice care are common. Navigating the health care system is challenging for patients who are weak ened by disease and cogni\u00ad tively compromised. Clinicians have an important role in advocat\u00ading for patients and enabling fami\u00adlies to engage hospice and palliative care teams and to man\u00adage home services, pain medica\u00adtions, insurance benefits, and other aspects of caretaking. Clear com\u00admunication among the team and with the patient's family is critical. 4.7 The Real World of Cancer Car e In Chapter 2, we described a gen\u00aderal six-function model of commu\u00adnication, and in Chapter 3, we discussed some of the pathways by which communication might affect health outcomes. In the first part of this chapter, we presented a model of how the six communication functions interact with the six phases of the cancer care contin\u00aduum to affect important health out\u00adcomes. In this section, the model will be applied to the specific ill\u00adness trajectories of two patients. We suggest that this approach not only will bring the model to life but also will indicate how the model itself is dynamic and adapt\u00adable to a variety of particular situa\u00adtions. A model is only as good as its heuristic v alue. General models should be simple enough to be understood but complex enough to approximate reality and should be applicable to a wide range of situa\u00adtions. All models have limitations, and we assure the reader that the framework we have presented is no e xception. Specifically, we have focused on some aspects of cancer at the expense of others. For exam\u00adple, we might have considered patient culture and ethnicity as a more central factor in our under\u00adstanding of communication and health. Both of our cases are based on real patients, and identifying details ha ve been removed (Textboxes 4.1 and 4.2). One purpose of present\u00ading these cases is to indicate that human experience, including suf\u00adfering and well-being, does not necessarily conform to the models that we create to describe it. Thus, for some patients, what seems like bad news may provide relief that finally there is an explanation for their suffering. In other situations, a single factor, such as lack of transportation, low health literacy, deafness, or cognitive dysfunction may be so powerful that most com\u00admunication efforts are directed toward overcoming that barrier. In yet other situations, being well educated can be a hindrance because the emotional capacity to deal with uncertainty does not always match the patient's intellec\u00adtual capacity to gather information. The cases presented here also highlight that families are involved in the care of each patient with cancer in a somewhat unique way and that each patient and family normally encounter multiple health professionals who also are involved in each patient's care in a somewhat unique way. Lastly, in cross-cultural situations, communi\u00adcations that otherwise seem simple 79 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 80 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Textbox 4.1 Case of Gloria Rodriguez* Patient's Cancer Experience Communication Tasks Screening phase Gloria Rodriguez is a 48-year-old Mexican American factory worker who had a follow-up mammogram one year after she had discovered a lump in the right breast. The right breast was aspirated at that time, and the findings were benign. On the follow-up mammogram, a suspicious two-centimeter lesion was found in the left breast. Exchanging information: Explaining the difference between a positive screening test and actual disease Managing uncertainty: Interpreting test results Neither she nor her primary care physician had detected the mass by palpation. Fostering healing relationships: Establishing trust, understanding clincians' limitations Ms. Rodriguez was referred to a large inner-city hospital that did not have a regional cancer center and had a lower percentage of Board-certified physicians on staff compared with other hospitals in the region. Enabling patient self-management: Eliminating disparities in access to and quality of care Diagnosis phase The radiologist made an appointment for an ultrasound the next day, but the patient did not understand why an ultrasound was necessary and why she did not have an aspiration, as she had previously. When the radiologist said \"suspicious,\" Ms. Rodriquez thought he was being evasive. She missed the ultrasound appointment because of a lack of transportation. She attempted to call the radiology department to reschedule but was unsuccessful. Making decisions: Involving patients in decision-making. Exchanging information: Improving patient knowledge about the diagnostic process Enabling patient self-management: Guiding the patient through the health care system After a two-week delay, Ms. Rodriguez had an ultrasound that suggested a solid mass, and she was referred to a surgeon for needle biopsy later that week. Although the ultrasonographer mentioned that the mass was \"solid,\" Ms. Rodriguez did not know that the term meant that the mass was more likely to be malignant, nor did she realize that it was more appropriate for the diagnostic information to be conveyed by the physician, not a technician. Ms. Rodriguez returned to her primary care physician for a routine follow-up visit, but the reports from the ultrasound were not immediately available. Seeing that Ms. Rodriguez was distraught, the physician called the radiologist to obtain the findings. Enabling patient self-management: Communicating within the health care system Coordinating involvement of multiple clinicians for the patient' s care Exchanging information: Using electronic communication technology Responding to emotions: Conveying empathy and taking action The primary care physician explained the need for biopsy and probable surgery. Exchanging information: Using lay language cont'd on p 81 80 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 81 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum Textbox 4.1 Case of Gloria Rodriguez cont'd from p 80 Ms. Rodriguez recounted the story of her mother's breast cancer several years before that was caught \"too late\"; it had already spread and she died within 3 years. Ms. Rodriguez did not ask any questions about the likelihood that her own cancer would spread, and thus, her unspoken concern was not addressed. She left the visit with the impression that the cancer would be incurable. Responding to emotions: Recognizing and responding to indirect cues of patient distress. Exchanging information, fostering healing relationships, managing uncertainty: Discussing genetic testing for the sake of family members at possible risk Fostering healing relationships, making decisions: Activating patients to ask questions and participate in decisions She had a visit with a surgeon, the same one who performed the previous needle biopsy. She had an idea of what to expect because of her prior experience. Enabling patient self-management: Promoting continuity of care She was told that the surgeon would call with the result. However, when the surgeon did call, the message was taken by her 10-year-old child, who transposed the digits in the phone number . After several tries, Ms. Rodriguez did make contact with the surgeon' s physician assistant, who informed her that the biopsy was \"positive\" and that she should plan another appointment with the surgeon and to meet with the radiation oncologist. She was not sure what \"positive\" meant but assumed it meant that the tumor was cancerous. She was very upset and confused as to what would happen next. Fostering healing relationships: Considering family and social factors in communication Exchanging information, responding to emotions: Delivering bad news clearly and sensitively Exchanging information, fostering healing relationships: Using in-person vs. telephone vs. asynchronous communication Enabling patient self-management: Coordinating involvement of multiple clinicians She met with the surgeon' s physician assistant, who explained the options: modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation therapy. She was afraid of surgery for three reasons: disfigurement, fear of spreading the cancer , and not waking up. She did not share these concerns with the physician assistant but otherwise found the meeting helpful and informative. Responding to emotions: Eliciting and addressing patient fears Making decisions: Facilitating informed decision-making She was given an informational pamphlet. It contained several words that she did not understand, but with the help of the surgeon's nurse, she was able to get the basic idea to help her decide on lumpectomy plus radiation therapy. Exchanging information: Using written and electronic media to reinforce information transfer and informed decision-making Treatment phase A week later, Ms. Rodriguez had lumpectomy. After the procedure, the surgeon explained that he \"got it all\"; the margins were clean. She experienced more pain than she was led to believe she would have. She called the surgeon, and her nurse suggested warm compresses. Two days later, the pain increased and the incision reopened, draining a copious amount of purulent material. Fostering healing relationships, exchanging information, responding to emotions: Explaining and responding to unexpected complications Her surgeon saw her later that day but of fered no explanation or apology. After a course of antibiotics, the wound healed by secondary intention but left a scar. Exchanging information: Dealing with adverse outcomes The patient was not offered reconstructive surgery, but a friend later suggested that she talk with her surgeon again about it.

Because of the size of the tumor, Ms. Rodriguez was referred to a medical oncologist to discuss chemotherapy. She was puzzled because she thought that they \"got it all.\" No one had mentioned chemotherapy previously. Fostering healing relationships: Optimizing communication among multiple clinicians and the patient Ms. Rodriguez discussed the advantages and risks of chemotherapy with the oncologist. The oncologist also discussed other alternatives such as oophorectomy and hormone therapy and mentioned that research still is being done to determine the best option. She was given an informational booklet and asked to call once she had decided on the therapeutic option and whether she wanted to proceed. The list of side effects seemed frightening, so she did not make a follow-up appointment. She was also worried by the word \"experimental\"; she thought that she would be used as a guinea pig. Also, she did not understand the statistics on ef fectiveness in preventing recurrence. Exchanging information: Offering both inform\u00ad ation and the skills to process the information Communicating with patients with low health literacy Responding to emotions Making decisions: Communicating evidence Fostering healing relationships: Establishing and maintaining trust The radiation oncologist explained the course of radiation therapy and its risks, and, after Ms. Rodriguez provided consent, a five-week course of radiation therapy was begun. She came to know and trust the radiation oncology technician, and her brief conversations with her each day provided some comfort. Fostering healing r elationships: Lowering the level of patient anxiety Survivorship phase Ms. Rodriguez completed treatment and returned to her surgeon, radiation oncologist, and primary care physician for follow-up visits several times in the first year, with no indication of recurrence. Nonetheless, having not received chemotherapy put her at a 5% to 10% higher absolute risk for recurrence. Although she is afraid of recurrence, she and her family never spoke of these fears, and she did not initiate discussions of these issues with her physicians. If the cancer were to recur, she might blame herself, however, for not deciding to receive chemotherapy. Fostering healing relationships: Coordinating communication with multiple clinicians Responding to emotions: Addressing fears of recurrence Managing uncertainty: Interpreting survival estimates Judging the degree of numerical detail that would be meaningful for the patient *Although this case is based on a real patient, details have been altered to maintain confidentiality and to avoid any potentially identifying information. can result in serious misunder\u00ad standings. In one of the cases pre\u00adsented, a physician's attempt to be honest in saying that a lesion was \"suspicious\" was interpreted as evasive rather than informative because the patient had inflated expectations of medical technol\u00adogy. To lose perspective on these individual factors risks missing important aspects of healing and suffering. These cases illustrate how during each patient's individ\u00adual trajectory, the six communica\u00adtion functions and the six phases of the cancer care continuum frame the communication challenges and outcomes relev ant to the patient, clinicians, and f amily members. 4.8 Conclusion This chapter describes some of the desired outcomes of communica\u00adtion during each phase of the can\u00adcer care continuum. At each phase, relevant outcomes are different, and the patient's and family's concerns change over time. Thus, the com\u00admunication processes that are nec\u00adessary to lead to those outcomes differ some what at each phase. Ho wever, the phases have more similarities than differences. At all phases, a strong patient-clinician relationship based on trust and respect is important so that it can, if necessary, accommodate strain at some points and greater family involvement at others. Similarly, although the nature and impact of information change during the can\u00ad 82 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 83 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum Textbox 4.2 Case of Randall Groves* Patient's Cancer Experience Communication Tasks Diagnosis phase Randall Groves is a 73-year-old semiretired, divorced professor of economics. His energy has been diminishing over several months and a sense of fullness and bloating developed in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. On the physical examination, there was tenderness in that area but no mass was palpated. The findings of fecal occult blood testing were negative, as were the results of upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Blood chemistry levels and cell counts were normal. He began to lose weight. His physician suspected cancer, which he communicated to the patient. He did not communicate that he considered pancreatic cancer most likely. Exchanging information: Deciding how to share information and clinical impressions at different points in the diagnostic process Responding to emotions, managing uncertainty: Dealing with anxiety until the diagnosis is clarified Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a large tumor involving the head of the pancreas. The radiologist suggested that it likely was inoperable. This information was communicated to the patient by the primary care physician. Mr. Groves was not surprised by the news. The patient wanted a surgical opinion. He indicated that symptom control was more important than life-extending procedures. Exchanging information, managing uncertainty: Communicating bad news Eliciting patient values and wishes The surgeon suggested that a Whipple procedure might be possible, but whether it could be done would be known only after the abdomen had been opened. He estimated that the best-case scenario represented a 20% chance of long-term survival and a 30% chance of improved quality of life. Mr. Groves was devastated and terrified. He had not realized that the prognosis was so poor. Exchanging information, making decisions: Framing choices to help patients decide among options Communicating prognosis both accurately and sensitively Responding to emotions: Managing terror Mr. Groves preferred to talk it over with his primary care physician. The patient searched the Internet and found data indicating the prognosis was worse than the surgeon suggested. The primary care physician contacted the surgeon directly , who communicated a more pessimistic picture to the physician than he had to the patient. Fostering healing relationships: Maintaining trust Exchanging information, managing uncertainty: Dealing with complex ambiguous medical information Mr. Groves and his primary care physician discussed and updated his health care proxy and living will. His primary care physician of fered to help clarify the patient's choices. Managing uncertainty: Discussing advance care planning and end-of-life issues Both Mr. Groves and his primary care physician found information about a variety of chemotherapy regimens. A further Internet search by the patient led to 15 recently published reports, each supporting dif ferent regimens of palliative chemotherapy. Mr . Groves tried to reconcile the multiple conflicting sources of information about treatment ef fectiveness and prognosis. Although he was highly educated, he could not always distinguish between terms such as \"treatment response,\" \"clinical remission,\" \"radiographic remission,\" and He felt increasingly confused and anxious; the more he searched, the less sure and more anxious he became. Exchanging information, managing uncertainty: Effectively using information that patients bring to the consultation Enabling patient self-management: Using electronic media Responding to emotions: Managing anxiety related to uncertainty and cognitive overload When Mr. Groves consulted with a local oncologist, he was of fered one of the palliative chemotherapy options; other treatments were available only through clinical trials in other cities. Mr. Groves opted not to have surgery but chose to go to a major cancer center in another city to discuss experimental options. He would stay with relatives there.

He had only mild nausea and no other side effects. Mr. Groves never spontaneously complained of pain and only described a sensation of abdominal \"fullness.\" However, when a daughter visited from out of town, she noted that he seemed uncomfortable and woke frequently at night. His primary care physician consulted the palliative care team, who made a home visit. They suggested a trial of long-acting opioid pain medication, which improved the patient' s quality of life and sense of well-being. Exchanging information: Gathering information about the patient from family members and friends Making decisions: Discussing palliation while still in the active treatment phase Forgotten by the physician, but addressed by the home care nurses and clergy, were discussions about the meaning of the illness to the patient, the process of dying, and the role of the family. Fostering healing relationships, r esponding to emotions: Introducing psychosocial dimensions into discussions End-of-life phase Mr. Groves completed three courses of chemotherapy, two weeks apart, but worsened clinically. Jaundice and ascites developed, requiring paracentesis for comfort. He postponed the fourth and final course of chemotherapy, intending to return in a couple of weeks. His appetite and energy waned. He required increasing doses of oral opioids to control his abdominal discomfort. Mr. Groves and his primary care physician discussed hospice care and suspension of further anticancer treatment. Exchanging information: Discussing treatment failure and transition to palliative care Managing uncertainty: Helping the patient articulate end-of-life wishes Previously active in making decisions regarding his care, Mr. Groves relegated these and subsequent decisions to his girlfriend, who also was his health care proxy. He moved to another city (where she lived) and received hospice care in the home. Fostering healing relationships: Accommodating patients' changing wishes for involvement in decision-making, and increased family involvement Mr. Groves died two weeks later, more rapidly than anyone expected. The day after Mr. Groves' death, the oncologist called Mr. Groves' girlfriend to tell her that he had admired how Mr. Groves coped with his illness and recognized the girlfriend's role in caring for him. Fostering healing relationships, responding to emotions: Communicating with the patient's family and friends after the patient's death *Although this case is based on a real patient, details have been altered to maintain confidentiality and to avoid any potentially identifying information. cer care continuum, information still must be delivered clearly and clinicians should check whether patients have understood. Decision-making also changes during the cancer continuum in terms of con\u00adtent, impact, and scope; but, in gen\u00aderal, patients want to be involved in some meaningful way at all times. There is tremendous variability among patients at any gi v en phase of the cancer care continuum. Thus, each clinician should attend to each individual patient's illness trajectory, needs, capabilities, and preferences. Clinical care involves one patient at a time. Importantly, from a research standpoint, each patient represents his or her unique model for understanding the particular communication behav\u00adiors that are necessary to impro v e his or her survival, functioning, and well-being. 84 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 85 Chapter 4: Key Communication Tasks and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Continuum References (1) Howie JG, Heaney DJ, Maxwell M, et al.

Thus, all other things being equal, the measure should reflect true change in the attribute being measured and not an intrin\u00adsic flaw of the measurement itself. Reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity of a particular measurement. Validity is the extent to which an instru\u00adment measures what it was intended to measure. In order to evaluate and support the construct validity of communication meas\u00adures, the specific purpose of each measure and hypothesized associa\u00adtions between it and other con\u00adstructs need to be specified. Also, because some overarching models of communication, such as the \"patient-centered\" model, are mul\u00adtif aceted constructs, each measure generally will assess some aspects better than others. Communication can be measured with use of a variety of methods, including patient report, clinician report, peer assessment, observ a\u00ad tional measures (direct observa\u00adtion, video or audio recording), medical records, diaries, and unan\u00adnounced standardized patients (SPs; actors who portray patient roles consistently and reliably and present covertly in clinical prac\u00adtices with clinicians' prior con\u00adsent). Each method has different strengths and weaknesses and can yield different results. For exam\u00adple, observational measures often do not correlate strongly with patient perceptions of the same encounter as reported in surveys. 2 However, Tisnado et al.3 found generally good agreement between medical record and patient survey data measures of process of care in a study of 1,270 patients with dia\u00adbetes, ischemic heart disease, asthma or chronic obstructive pul\u00admonary disease, or low back pain. Concordance was best for areas in which there was little ambiguity, such as medication use, and worst in situations requiring interpreta\u00adtion and judgment, such as having received \"counseling.\" Similarly, in a study of 500 adults presenting with a physical symptom, there was good agreement between clini\u00ad *The lead author of this chapter was Ron D. Hays, PhD, Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, University of California, Los Angeles. 89 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 90 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care cian and patient reports of whether a prescription w as given, a test was ordered, and a referral was made, with kappa values ranging from 0.83 to 0.91. 4 However, there was poor agreement about whether the clinician communicated a diagno\u00adsis and prognosis; clinicians reported communicating this infor\u00admation in 93% and 78% of visits, respectively, compared with patient reports of receiving this informa\u00adtion in 63% and 43% of visits. Such studies do little, however, to elucidate the reasons for the dis\u00adcrepancies. It may have been that physician use of jargon or patient cognitive impairment interfered with mutual understanding of the information exchanged. Or, patients may have understood but then forgotten. Also, interpretation of some elements of communica\u00adtion may be broad, leading to dis\u00adcrepant reporting on the same events. For example, clinicians and patients often disagree on whether \"counseling\" occurred during a particular encounter, or whether \"information about prognosis\" was provided. The most commonly used methods in communication studies to date ha ve been qualitative data from interviews and focus groups and both qualitative and quantitative data from direct observation of clinical encounters and from patient surveys. Focus groups and interviews are useful for eliciting perceptions and gaining insight into possible reasons for behavior. 5 These techniques help ensure that what is important to patients and their families is captured. Often, the techniques become the basis for the de velopment of quantitative instruments or are used to deepen the researcher's understanding of statistical findings. Observational approaches have the adv antage of providing a direct view of a sample of behavior. However, they can require direct observation and audio recording, which some clinicians find intru\u00adsive. Also, clinicians who are not confident about their communica\u00adtion skills may be less likely to participate, thus perhaps limiting the degree of observed variability in clinicians' communication behavior. Although direct observa\u00adtion studies capture the immediate experience of the visit, most can\u00adnot account for conversations in prior visits, nonverbal communica\u00adtion, and the overall experience of receiving care. For that reason, some studies in which visits are recorded on either audio or video also involve debriefing of clini\u00adcians or patients after the visit to clarify the reasons for their own actions and their perspectives on the other's communication behav\u00adiors. 6 Some coding systems have third-party coders listen to or view audio or video recordings and then place the clinician's and patient's verbal and nonverbal behavior into certain categories (e.g., providing information, expressing empathy). However, these coding systems are complex and fail to capture the salience of the acts from the partic\u00adipants' perspectives. Coders require substantial training and experience. Few such systems are based on a particular theory of communication or patient-centered care. Comparing f indings derived from different coding systems can be difficult. There are at least two reports of poor correlation among instruments that claim to measure the same communication construct of the same data set (e.g., patient-centered communication, shared decision-making). 7,8 Observed clin\u00ad ical encounters also can be ana\u00adlyzed qualitatively by applying text-based analytic methods to the actual encounter or field notes gen\u00aderated by the observer. These methods encourage new themes and observations to emerge from analysis of the data. Standardized patients (SPs) have been used to capture clinician beha vior in response to nearly identical stimuli. Using SPs can overcome some difficulties in using real patients to study clini\u00adcians' communication behavior: Clinicians' patients differ in case mix and patient demo\u00adgraphics, thus making compar\u00adisons among clinicians dif ficult. Real patients and clinicians tend to self-select and accom\u00admodate to each others' behav\u00ad iors over time. The condition in question may occur with lo w frequency, requiring multiple observa\u00adtions in order to find relevant ones for the purpose of the study. SPs often carry hidden audio recorders, which allo ws for subse\u00ad quent qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interaction. This 90 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 91 Chapter 5: Methodological Challenges in Studying Clinical Communication in Cancer Care approach has documented note\u00ad worthy differences in utilization of health services, clinician prescrib\u00ading, history taking, and communi\u00adcation with patients. 9-16 Standardized patients also can report on their own subjective experience by com\u00adpleting some of the same surveys as do patients. Because they learn some principles of communication and present the identical role to multiple clinicians, SPs become \"connoisseurs of care.\" 17 Compared with real patients, SPs tend to rate clinicians more harshly, thus avoiding very high mean scores characteristic of patient ratings (ceiling effects); and rate individ\u00adual clinicians with higher reliabil\u00adity. 17,18 In addition, there are larger standard deviations in the scores given by SPs compared with those given by real patients, thus dis\u00adcriminating among clinicians to a greater degree. However, there are some limitations of SP-based methods: training and deploying SPs can be expensive, SP visits by nature are first visits to the clini\u00adcian, 19 some physical signs cannot be accurately portrayed, and SPs normally cannot undergo invasive procedures that might occur in real clinical settings. Patient surveys allow the patient to reflect on the ef fectiveness of com\u00ad munication and the nature of the patient-clinician relationship. There are numerous scales that claim to measure different aspects of clinician communication. Although patients may be consid\u00adered the ultimate arbiters of patient-centered communication by clinicians, their survey responses are limited by recall and reporting bias. Man y measures demonstrate ceiling effects and small standard deviations. Also, patients' responses to survey items appear to reflect global impressions of the clinician and do not discriminate among different aspects of com\u00admunication; thus measurements of different constructs (e.g., trust, explanations, listening, autonomy support, clinician knowledge of the patient) share a substantial amount of common variance. 20,21 Ecological momentary assessment is a method of collecting data as quickly as possible after events take place to minimize problems with recall. 22,23 Using pen and paper, the Internet, or handheld devices, a patient can record answers to survey items or narra\u00adtive impressions. Different studies have used scheduled entries, entries triggered by specific events (such as a medical visit), or ran\u00addomly prompted entries. Advances in information technology have increased the potential use of other sources of data for diaries, such as entries into shared medical records, e-mail text, and mobile telephone communications. Much more needs to be learned about the unique value of each source of data, however. Although family members are present in a lar ge percentage of visits,24-26 their input is often not recorded or analyzed using obser\u00advation methods, and the ways in which they affect and are affected by the patient's illness often are studied only in the context of care-giving at home and burnout. In reality, however, cancer care is most often a web of communica\u00adtions: among f amily members, among various clinicians, and between the patient/family network and the network of clinicians and clinical teams caring for the patient. However, limited attention has been directed at the assessment of communication among patients, family members, and the health care delivery team. When family members are present during one or more clinical encounters, their input contributes to the evolution of the conversation. Studies of family involvement in care often extend beyond the patient's death. For example, family members tended to perceive that their loved one had a \"good death\" if they also reported that the health care team listened and were effective in explaining the decedent's condi\u00adtion. 27 Similarly, the input of multi\u00ad ple clinicians should be accounted for in some way. In reality, while dyadic communication may occur during individual encounters, nor\u00admally the patterns of communica\u00adtion over time are much more complex and include the patient, multiple family members (some of whom may also be patients), and a variety of clinicians of different professional training and special\u00adization. Research methods and design should account for the net\u00adwork of relationships of varying intensity between multiple mem\u00adbers of the family and the many clinicians comprising the health care team. Future research on communication in cancer settings must be designed 91 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 92 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care to evaluate the relative utility of combinations of different data col\u00adlection methods and sources of information. The best method of gauging communication may depend on a variety of factors, such as which communication function (e.g., fostering healing relationships, exchanging informa\u00adtion) is assessed, and what is the most appropriate source of infor\u00admation for a particular aspect of care. A combination of data from multiple sources is needed to por\u00adtray communication accurately between providers and patients. Studies involving both qualitative and quantitative analytic methods often yield more insight than stud\u00adies involving either method alone. 5.2 Mediators between Communication and Health Outcomes Communication sometimes affects health outcomes directly, but more often these effects are mediated through intermediate or proximal outcomes. Pathways between these proximal and intermediate out\u00adcomes of communication and sub\u00adsequent health outcomes are poorly understood. For example, a patient with prostate cancer may decide to stop hormone therapy after com\u00adpleting radiation therapy if he thinks that his continued need to urinate at night means the treat\u00adment is ineffective (an illness rep\u00adresentation 28,29). Nonadherence in this case is due to communication problems: the patient made a false assumption about the treatment and did not ask the clinician for clarification. Meanwhile, the clini\u00adcian did not elicit the patient's understanding of the illness and its treatment and therefore w as unable to correct the misconception. Some links between communication and health outcomes may be immediate whereas others are delayed. For example, communication interven\u00adtions that improve adherence to chemotherapy for breast cancer will increase symptoms and decrease quality of life initially 30 but increase the duration of survival. Potentially important mediators between communication and health outcomes were described in Chapter 3 and include impro ve\u00ad ments in patient knowledge, emo\u00adtional self-management, patient empowerment, therapeutic alliance, quality of medical deci\u00adsions, access to care, and social support. Mediation can occur through more than one pathway. For example, a study may involve a comparison of two potential pathways explaining the effects of communication on health out\u00adcomes: patient acceptance of treat\u00adment and patient self-efficacy. Alternatively, the association between communication and health may be mediated by reach\u00ading a high-quality decision (i.e., clinically sound and consistent with patient values), which, in turn, may be mediated by better clinician understanding of the patient's disease experience or bet\u00adter patient knowledge about the disease and treatment options. One or more mediation hypotheses can be tested using a stepwise process (Figure 5.1). The example illustrated in Figure 5.1 is a study of a patient activation intervention in which patients are coached to be more participatory in clinical set\u00adtings, by asking questions and par\u00adticipating to a greater de gree in decisions, for example. The figure suggests that an association between patient activation and pain may be mediated by patient adher\u00adence to treatment. 31 If this were true, visits characterized by good communication would result in improved pain relief only when the patient took medications as pre\u00adscribed, and no such effect would be noted if the patient did not adhere to treatment. In order to assess mediation, a series of bivari\u00adate models can be estimated to see whether patient activation is asso\u00adciated with pain (Model 1, solid line) and adherence (Model 2, dashed line) and whether adher\u00adence is associated with pain (Model 3, dotted line). A multivari\u00adate model (Model 4) that uses both adherence and patient activation to predict pain should show that the direct effect of patient activation on pain is smaller than it was in Model 1. In addition to the stepwise process, structural equation modeling can be used to e valuate mediators directly. Structural equation mod\u00adeling permits the simultaneous assessment of multiple dependent variables and both direct and indi\u00adrect effects of one variable on another. Each variable can be treated as both an independent variable and a dependent variable. This approach allows the estima\u00adtion of latent variables rather than only measured variables and 92 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 93 Chapter 5: Methodological Challenges in Studying Clinical Communication in Cancer Care Figure 5.1 One or more mediation hypotheses can be tested using a stepwise process. The question being tested here is Does greater adherence to medication mediate the effect of a patient activation intervention on lower levels of pain? In order to assess mediation, a series of bivariate models can be estimated to see whether patient activation is associated with pain (Model 1) and adherence (Model 2) and whether adherence is associated with pain (Model 3). A multivariate model (Model 4) that uses both adherence and patient activation to predict pain should show that the direct effect of patient activation on pain is smaller than it was in Model 1. Patient Activation Pain Adherence Model 1 Direct Pathway Model 4 All Pathways Model 2Mediated Pathway Model 3 Mediated Pathway thereby accounts for random error. For example, structural equation modeling was used to provide sup\u00adport for a conceptual model of health-related quality of life devel\u00adoped by Wilson and Cleary. 32 Used with analysis of data on patients after myocardial infarction struc\u00adtural equation modeling demon\u00adstrated that the severity of cardiac disease influenced health-related quality of life through two path\u00adways. The first, a direct pathway, was not mediated, whereas the sec\u00adond, an indirect pathway, was mediated by the presence of patient-reported symptoms. 33 Communication functions also can serve as mediators of health out\u00adcomes. A recent study of 272 health plans showed that the per\u00adcentage of clinical care delivered by staff and group model systems (rather than independent practice association and network models) was significantly related to higher rates of immunization and of screening for cervical and breast cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. However, the type of health care system was not related to patient reports and ratings of care. 34 Thus, although communication may have contributed to better preventive care through other pathways, com\u00admunication (measured from the patient' s perspective) did not explain the relationship between the type of system and preventive care. These findings suggest further research is needed to find changes in health care systems that may be able to enhance the provision of patient-centered communication. These changes may include receiv\u00ading care at a comprehensive cancer care center, having a health care team to facilitate access to informa\u00adtion, and having a \"medical home\" where the patient could do one-stop shopping for coordination of care. 93 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 94 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care 5.3 Moderators of the Link between Communication and Health Outcomes Possible moderators of the rela\u00ad tionships between communication and outcomes were discussed in Chapter 3 (and listed in Table 3.4). Moderators are variables that qual\u00adify associations of independent variables with a dependent vari\u00adable. A moderator is identified when there is a significant interac\u00adtion between two independent vari\u00adables in a regression model. For example, the use of health care navigators to help patients receive adequate follow-up after abnormal findings on cancer screening tests may improve health outcomes for poor patients but not for wealthy patients. Similarly, interventions to improve patient participation in clinical care may have different effects depending on the patient's level of education. Education would be a moderator of the rela\u00adtionship between patient participa\u00adtion in the consultation and subsequent satisfaction with care if patient participation had a positive effect on satisfaction for those with at least a high school degree, and patient participation had a non\u00adsignificant effect for those without a high school degree. In research on physiological mech\u00ad anisms, f actors (such as blood pressure) can often be clearly clas\u00adsified as mediators, moderators, or outcomes. In behavioral research, however, the situation is more complex. 35 Patient trust in the physician, for example, can be considered a mediator, moderator, or outcome, depending on the situ\u00adation. If trust mediates the relation\u00adship between information sharing and subsequent agreement to par\u00adticipate in psychotherap y for depression, patients presented with information about depression will choose to undergo psychotherapy only if their level of trust is suffi\u00adcient. In other circumstances, trust in the physician may be a modera\u00adtor; trust would moderate the rela\u00adtionship between recommending treatment and actually taking it, if, for example, patients with high levels of trust are more likely than patients with lower levels of trust to take medication as prescribed. Trust is also an intermediate out\u00adcome if it is on a pathway linking communication with a health out\u00adcome such as lower levels of anxi\u00adety. Decisions about whether a particular variable is a mediator or moderator may be based on theo\u00adretical reasons, such as testing a model predicting either the mediat\u00ading or moderating effects of trust, or on empirical evidence, such as trying to uncover reasons why a hypothe\u00adsized communication-outcome relationship did or did not occur. 5.4 Study Design Most research on communication in cancer settings is cross sec\u00adtional, primarily because such studies are less expensive and eas\u00adier to do than longitudinal studies. In contrast, longitudinal studies provide a stronger basis for demonstrating the development of patient-centered behaviors over time and for drawing causal infer\u00adences between communication processes and health outcomes. By virtue of their rigorous experi\u00admental design, randomized clinical trials pro vide a strong basis for causal inference about the effects of communication function on out\u00adcomes. Variables other than the randomized factor(s) that can affect the outcome are controlled by the random assignment of patients to conditions. But random\u00adized controlled trials of communi\u00adcation interventions are challenging because of the com\u00adplexity of interventions that involve patients, clinicians, and health care systems. In some situa\u00adtions, clinical trials can be imprac\u00adtical, impossible for ethical reasons, or prohibitively expensive. Most randomized clinical trials represent a distortion of clinical practice in a number of ways. They can give a false impression of the effect of treatment at a population level. Also, care provided in the context of a randomized trial is more consistent and more closely monitored than care in the commu\u00adnity. In addition, participants who have characteristics that might complicate the interpretation of intervention effects (e.g., other comorbid illnesses commonly associated with the index condi\u00adtion) are excluded. As a result, the participants in clinical trials differ substantially from patients who do not participate. 36 Hence, random\u00ad ized clinical trials can only suggest what is possible (i.e., efficacy) rather than what actually will hap\u00adpen when an intervention is imple\u00admented beyond the confines of the trial. The findings might not gener\u00adalize to care once it is implemented in other less controlled settings. 94 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 95 Chapter 5: Methodological Challenges in Studying Clinical Communication in Cancer Care Nonrandomized study designs are used when randomized clinical tri\u00adals are not possible or feasible. The intention of effectiveness research is to document variations in the real world, including factors that are not under the investigator's control (e.g., delays in care, inabil\u00adity to afford a medication), in order to provide a basis for plausible inferences about underlying mech\u00adanisms. Because of the weaker study design, making sense of associations is more difficult in nonrandomized studies. Case-mix adjustment can help by statistically equating naturally occurring groups on v ariables such as age, education, and indicators of health (e.g., comorbidity) that are measured at baseline. But case mix cannot account for some factors, such as unmeasured burden of ill\u00adness; in effect, the observed differ\u00adences are the result of an unknown combination of disease state, treat\u00adment effect, and patient and clini\u00adcian behavior. These factors make inferences about the effects of an intervention difficult. For example, in the Medical Outcomes Study, detection of depression was not significantly related to mental health outcomes. This nonsignifi\u00adcant result was due in part to the fact that sicker patients tended to receive more intensive care, which, in turn, increased recognition and treatment of other conditions such as depression. Because the Medical Outcomes Study measures of sickness failed to fully capture this factor, 37 standard analyses showed no effect. Standard analy\u00adses also can show a paradoxical relationship in which more inten\u00adsi ve and higher quality care appears to be associated with worse outcomes. 38 Sophisticated analytic methods such as instru\u00admental variable models may help account for unmeasured burden of illness. 39 Multicomponent interventions are likely to be more successful than testing of individual elements (\"molar\" approach). Although each individual element may have a small effect, interventions that focus on synergistic approaches at multiple levels of the health care system (patients, clinicians, care managers, system design) may have a cumulatively larger effect. For a variety of reasons, studies of interventions targeted to more than just the patient or the clinician are rare, as are interventions that include family members and multi\u00adple clinicians. Because patients with cancer meet with multiple health professionals, studies of patients' experiences over time require designs of clinicians nested within patients; most prior studies have designs in which patients are nested within clinicians. Also, the unit of analysis for system inter\u00adventions generally should be the health care system. 5.5 Conclusion For designing studies in cancer communication research, much can be learned from innovative approaches to measurement, con\u00adceptual models, and study design in other areas of research. The role of mediating and moderating vari\u00adables has not been explored fully. Longitudinal designs and no vel methods of data collection have been used in only a few studies. Sophisticated analytic methods, including multilevel modeling, structural equations, and instru\u00admental variable models may help sort out the complex network of factors that influences the relation\u00adship of communication behavior to subsequent health outcomes. 95 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 96 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care References (1) Epstein RM, Franks P, Fiscella K, et al.

In particular, health-related quality of life can be improved when clinicians are attentive to patients' symptoms, functioning, and well-being in the physical, emotional, and social domains 1 across the cancer care continuum. However, improvements in sur\u00advival and quality of life require effective communication among clinicians, patients, and family members in a health care system that fosters continuous healing relationships and care that is cus\u00adtomized to meet patients' needs. 2 Patient-clinician communication is especially important in cancer set\u00adtings because of the levels of stress, uncertainty, complex infor\u00admation, and life-altering medical decisions that exist in such set\u00adtings. Effective communication can ameliorate suffering directly, by enhancing the patient's emotional well-being, and indirectly, medi\u00adated by factors such as social sup\u00adport and adherence. Thus, it is important to understand how to improve communication between patients and their family members and the health care delivery team. The importance of communication as a means of achieving the best health outcomes for patients is fur\u00adther underscored by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, \"Crossing the Quality Chasm, \" which identi\u00ad fies \"patient-centeredness\" as one of six key ways to improve health care and notes that \"continuous healing relationships\" are a means for achieving that goal. 3 This monograph has focused on optimizing the communication process between the patient/family unit and the health care delivery team. Because the family is central to patient care and because patients normally are seen by clinicians of different disciplines at various phases of the illness, we have used the term patient-clinician communi\u00adcation throughout the monograph as a proxy for communication between the patient/family and the health care team. By clinicians, we refer to all professionals who provide care to patients within the cancer context. By family, we refer to people in the patient's social circle who are most relevant to the patient, regardless of whether they are biologically related. Patient-clinician communication was discussed within the context of the phases of the cancer care continuum, primarily the phases from screening to survivorship and end of life. Cancer prevention is important but is beyond the scope of this monograph. This chapter provides a brief sum\u00ad mary of the o verall monograph, a discussion of the gaps in the litera\u00ad6 99 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 100 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care ture on patient-clinician communi- cation, and an overview of the pri\u00adorities for future research. Table 6.1 Examples of Behaviors that Clinicians and Patients/Family Must Engage in for Effective Communication Clinicians Patients/Family 6.1 Summary of Chapters 1 through 5: Basic Principles, Functions, Mediators and Moderators, and Methodological Challenges Chapter 1 presents the basic prin- ciples of effective communication in cancer care. These principles are based on a philosophy of patient-centered care that embraces three core values: considering patients' needs, perspectiv es, and individual experiences; providing patients with opportunities to participate in their care; and enhancing the patient-clinician relationship. 4 Patient-centered communication is characterized by verbal and non\u00adverbal behaviors that are intended to accomplish the following: 4-6 Listen Disclose needs Avoid interruptions Share information about symptoms and concerns Organize the visit Share information about family, culture, and context Solicit patient's beliefs and preferences Discuss expectations Elicit, understand, and validate the patient's perspective (e.g., concerns, feelings, expecta- tions) Elicit and validate patient's emotions Voice concerns Provide clear and jargon-free explanations Discuss options Offer encouragement and support Ask questions Table 6.2 Examples of Important Outcomes Related to Effective Patient-Clinician Communication Outcomes Proximal Accurate transfer and understanding of information Recognition of and appropriate response to emotional distress Establishment of trust and respect Mutual and cooperative participation in the consultation Understand the patient within his or her own psychological and social context Reach a shared understanding of the patient's problem and its treatment Intermediate Adherence to clinical guidelines Patient satisfaction Patient self-efficacy Help a patient share power by offering the patient meaningful involvement in choices relat- ing to his or her health Distal (Health) Improved survival Enhanced quality of life Reduction in health disparities Improved quality of care Decreased health care costs Build strong patient-clinician relationships characterized by mutual trust, respect, and com\u00admitment 100 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 101 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions Table 6.3 Six Fundamental Functions of Patient-Clinician Communication Function Clinician' s Role Foster healing Establish mutual trust, rapport, understanding, See Appendix A relationships and commitment Patient-clinician agreement about each others' roles and expectations Exchange information Recognize patients' information needs See Appendix B Integrate clinical information with the patient's illness representations (explanatory models) 7-9 Acknowledge both the content and process of information exchange Use Internet-based resources 10 Communicate prognostic information accurately while also providing hope Overcome barriers related to low health literacy and poor understanding of statistical information Respond to patients' emotions Elicit patients' emotional distress See Appendix C Communicate an understanding of the patient's emotions to him or her Respond with legitimation, validation, empathy, and support Manage uncertainty Acknowledge uncertainty, to allow space for hope 11 Recognize that uncertainty often cannot be eliminated Help to manage uncertainty by providing information, support, and cognitive strategies Make decisions Consider the active involvement of the See Appendix D patient and family in the information-exchange and deliberation stages of the decision-making process Identify who is responsible for the final decision Enable patient self-management Advocate for the patient, including help in navigating the health care system Support patient autonomy Provide guidance to patients about finding information, developing coping skills, and taking actions to improve their health 101 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 102 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care To communicate effectively, both clinicians and patients need kno wl\u00ad edge, skills, and motivation, as well as a health care environment that facilitates communication (Table 6.1). (See Figure 1.1, page 3.) Individual communication skills alone are not suf ficient. Clinicians, patients, and families must align themselves toward common goals; adapt their communication styles to achieve mutual understanding; be willing to reconcile differences due to beliefs, language, or culture; and deliberate together over difficult decisions. Although individual behaviors have been the subject of communication research, the process of alignment rarely has been studied. Communication should be oriented toward outcomes, espe\u00adcially health outcomes, such as improved survival and meaningful enhancements of health-related quality of life (Table 6.2). Chapter 2 sets forth a frame work for research on patient-centered communication in cancer care, with a discussion of six fundamen\u00adtal functions of communication. These functions are not necessarily hierarchical; rather, they overlap and interact (Table 6.3). (See Figure 2.1, page 19.) Chapter 3 e xplores pathways by which communication can lead to improved outcomes, including mediators and moderators. (See Figures 3.1 [page 41], 3.2 and [page 53].) Two sets of pathways were discussed\u2014 those that lead directly from com\u00admunication to health outcomes, and Table 6.4 Some Moderators that Influence the Relationship between Communication and Outcomes Type of Moderator Variables Intrinsic Relatively immutable Age Sex Personality Health beliefs Potentially mutable Illness representations Knowledge Attitudes Relationships among the patient, family members and health care team Extrinsic Nature and phase of the illness Cultural factors Social support Health care system Medium of communication (e.g., electronic, face-to-face) Legal and regulatory factors those that are mediated, i.e., path\u00ad ways consisting of one or more links between a communication act and a given outcome of communi\u00adcation. Proximal outcomes form the first link and might include improvements in the following: Access to care Patient knowledge and shared understanding Therapeutic alliances (i.e., patient and clinician commit\u00adment to the relationship) Emotional self-management Family/social support and adv ocacy Quality of medical decisions (e.g., informed, clinically sound, concordant with patient v alues, and mutually endorsed) Patient agency12 (self-efficacy, empowerment, and enablement 13-15) These pathways link effective communication to intermediate outcomes such as impro ved adher\u00ad ence, health habits, and self-care. Chapter 3 also addresses moder a\u00ad tors, factors that influence the rela\u00ad tionship of communication to proximal, intermediate, and distal (health) outcomes. (See Table 3.4, page 53.) Moderators are either 102 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 103 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions intrinsic (variables intrinsic to cli\u00ad nicians, patients/f amilies, and their relationships) or extrinsic (vari\u00ad ables external to the individual qualities of clinicians, patients/families, and their rela\u00adtionship) (Table 6.4). Researchers often identify fixed moderating variables such as age and gender, but little is known about why such variables affect the relationship of communication to patient health outcomes. For example, age may moderate the relationship between Prevention Foster health behaviors and promote prevention interventions as appropriate Diagnosis Provide emotional support and information Discuss areas of uncertainty and prognosis Encourage patient participation in care Treatment Provide emotional support Provide treatment-related information Encourage patients to complete treatment regimens Enhance social support communication and health out\u00ad comes because of cognitive decline, low health literacy, lack of shared health beliefs, or limited access to the Internet. 16 Chapter 4 places each of the func\u00ad tions and pathways described in Chapters 2 and 3 in the context of each phase on the cancer care con\u00adtinuum and provides details about the communication needs; media\u00adtors, moderators; and proximal, intermediate, and distal (health) outcomes at each phase (Table 6.5). Also discussed are important fac\u00adtors that determine the content of communication at each phase. F or e xample, although the type of can\u00ad cer may shape the timing, content, and process of communication to an important degree at the diagno\u00adsis phase, it may be less crucial during the end-of-life (palliative care) phase. Chapter 5 discusses methodologi\u00ad cal challenges to studying commu\u00ad nication in cancer settings. Most descripti v e studies have been cross- sectional and have relied on survey methods. Longitudinal studies, mixed-method studies, and studies involving multiple sources of data are relatively uncommon but are needed to establish causal links between communication and out\u00adcomes. Measuring communication is challenging because of several factors: the lack of theoretically driven measures, discrepancies in findings depending on how obser\u00advational data are coded and ana\u00adlyzed, and relatively weak correlations between ratings of audio recorded encounters and patients' subsequent ratings of the same encounter. The chapter also discusses the need to develop more robust measures of proximal, inter\u00admediate, and distal (health) outcomes and of the processes accounting for the effects of moderators.

Descriptive models of patient-cen\u00ad tered communication must be de veloped more fully. Although there is general agreement about the goals and components of patient-centered communica\u00adtion, 4,6,17 defining it as a set of dis\u00ad crete behaviors is difficult because communication is always inter\u00adpreted individually within its con\u00adtext. Patient perceptions of care do not completely characterize patient-centered communication either. Their perceptions may relate more to overall impressions of their care and the clinician than to specific features of patient-cen\u00adtered communication. 4 In addition, the elements of patient-centered communication are not necessarily correlated, suggesting that patient\u00adcenteredness is a multidimensional construct. For example, a clinician expressing empathy and support is practicing a form of patient-cen\u00adtered behavior. However, this behavior may occur independently of other types of patient-centered communication, such as pro viding clear, understandable explanations and working in partnership with the patient. There is a need for a communica\u00ad tion impr ovement model that defines specific measurable ele\u00adments of communication empiri\u00adcally linked to outcomes. These elements should then guide the development of interventions. Thus, the model should be evi\u00addence-based as well as theory-driven. To that end, effective communication would be judged on the basis of its ability to achieve a particular intermediate outcome or distal (health) outcome and pro\u00advide a plausible explanation for this effect. For example, decision-making processes may be defined as patient-centered if they result in improved rapport, shared under\u00adstanding, and appropriate follow-through. Ingredients of a \"good\" decision may include patient-clini\u00adcian discussions of values, goals, clinical evidence, and illness repre\u00adsentations and risks and subse\u00adquent patient-clinician agreement that the best possible decision was reached. Theories of communication that incorpor ate and inform general theories of health behavior and health psychology 7 are needed to explain the relationship of commu\u00adnication to outcomes. Consider examples of such integration. Through their interactions with family, friends, various media, and clinicians, patients construct illness representations, 18 otherwise known as explanatory models9 or \"lay\" or \"common sense\" models of health and illness. 8,19,20 They are an attempt to develop a sensible nar\u00adrative reconstruction of the patient's life, disease, and illness experience. 18,21,22 These representa\u00ad tions are important in cancer care because they influence health deci\u00adsions (e.g., whether to seek or fol\u00adlow through on care) and coping mechanisms. Communication is linked inextricably to illness repre\u00adsentations because these lay mod\u00adels can be constructed, reinforced, or modified during patient-clini\u00adcian encounters. Moreover, dis\u00adcrepancies between clinicians' views of the patient's health and the patient's own health beliefs can contribute to poor outcomes, such as inappropriate decisions, poor adherence to treatment plans, anxi\u00adety and distress, and disparities in care. These discrepancies are more likely in cross-cultural settings, further emphasizing the need to incorporate cultural competency into general communication skills training. Communication concepts also should be inte grated with theories of self-efficacy,23 self-determina\u00ad tion,24 enablement,13-15 and agency12 to show how communication might transform patients from passive recipients to active participants in care and enable them to take a more active role in managing their own illnesses. Relationship-cen\u00adtered care is another construct that may contribute to a theory of how communication contributes to health outcomes. 25 104 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 105 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions Table 6.6 Recommendations for Populations and Settings to Be Studied Patients and families Greater attention to - Men - Racial and ethnic minorities - Low-education and low-literacy populations - Older patients - Gender concordance between clinician and patient - Family members and dif ferent family structures - Wider variety of cancers Clinicians Continue to study oncologists Greater attention to - Surgeons - Radiation oncologists - Interventional radiologists - Primary care clinicians - Nurses - Hospice workers Settings Continue to study settings of outpatient oncology of fices and clinics Greater attention to studies in - Hospitals - Hospice settings - Long-term care facilities - Patient homes 6.2.2 Populations and settings studied Patients and families Patients most commonly studied are middle-age, middle-class, white w omen, with at least a high school education. Racial, ethnic, and educational factors contribute to significant disparities in access to care, delayed diagnosis, and completion of treatment, 26-34 yet only a few studies in the literature on cancer prevention and decision-making have been designed to evaluate communication factors that may contribute to those dispar\u00adities. 35 Although studies have tended to focus on middle-age adults, older patients have differ\u00adent types of cancer and these can\u00adcers follow a different clinical course. Younger and older patients with cancer appear to have con\u00adtrasting communication styles, yet few studies compare their commu\u00adnication needs and behaviors. 16 Even fewer studies have examined why the communication styles of older patients differ from those of their younger counterparts. As pre\u00adviously noted, reasons might include educational, cognitive, atti\u00adtudinal, or disease-related factors. Gender and gender concordance have been studied in greater detail, b ut reasons why these affect com\u00ad munication and outcomes have not been studied. Families are essential sources of information, support, and caregiving for patients with cancer, yet communication between family members and clini\u00adcians has been studied inade\u00adquately. 36 Little is known about how different family structures influence communication in cancer settings. In summary , research is insufficient to guide communica\u00adtion interventions involving patients and families who are non\u00adwhite, members of ethnic minori\u00adties, older than age 70, or have lower educational levels and low health literacy. By understanding pathways that contribute to such disparities as different illness rep\u00adresentations, literacy levels, and health care system factors, inter\u00adventions can be developed to reduce or eliminate disparities in care. Cancer communication studies in clinical settings ha ve primarily focused on patients with specific types of cancer, especially breast cancer and, to a lesser extent, prostate and colorectal cancer. Fewer studies have involved patients with more lethal cancers, such as cancer of the lung, pancreas, or ovary. The type of cancer is an important element of context that likely affects patient-clinician communication and the relation\u00adships between communication and outcomes. Research should include patients with a wider variety of cancers. Clinicians The majority of cancer communi\u00ad cation studies ha ve involved med\u00ad ical oncologists. Fewer studies have included surgeons and fewer still, radiation oncologists, inter\u00adventional radiologists, primary care clinicians who care for cancer survivors, and hospice workers. A substantial body of nursing litera\u00adture on cancer communication exists, but few of the studies involve large enough samples to 105 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 106 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care link communication to outcomes, and fe w links have been made between the nursing and physician literatures. There is a clear need for research that focuses on the health care delivery team as a whole, beyond the interactions of individ\u00adual clinicians with patients and their families. Clinician stress and burnout appear to have a negative effect on the quality of care. 37-39 Healthy approaches to stress theo\u00adretically can be developed through clinician, patient, and system inter\u00adventions, 40-42 but these have not been studied in-depth. Settings Settings for communication research generally ha ve been outpatient oncology offices and clinics. However, hospitals can be even more stressful for patients and families, and research should be done with patients in that setting. Studies should also be done in other settings, including homes, hospice settings, or nursing homes to get a richer understanding of communication. 6.2.3 Descriptive research (T able 6.7) More often than not, descriptive research on cancer communication has been cross-sectional, has been conducted in outpatient settings, has in volved patients during the diagnosis and treatment phases, and has focused on a few specific communication tasks, such as the following: Patient self-assessed informa\u00adtion needs and a vailability of and preference for different information sources Patient recall of information discussed in outpatient consul\u00adtations Differences between clini\u00adcians' actual methods of deliv\u00ad ering bad news and patients' preferences for delivery of ad news Accuracy of physician state\u00ad ments about prognosis and patient preferences re garding frank disclosure of prognostic information Correlates of patient prefer\u00adences for and achie vement of preferred roles in decision-making and the effect of dif\u00adferent decision-making styles on proximal communication outcomes Clinician elicitation of and response to patient e xpressions of emotional distress Most descriptive studies of cancer communication ha ve involved patients with breast cancer, fol\u00adlowed by patients with colorectal and prostate cancer, with few stud\u00adies involving patients with forms of cancer that carry poorer prog\u00adnoses. Cross-sectional communica\u00adtion studies have involved the use of patient surveys and the analysis of audio recordings of consulta\u00adtions with utterance-based coding Table 6.7 Recommendations for Descriptive Research Characterize and study effects of continuous healing relationships Analyze patient narratives of illness experiences Understand effects of family involvement in clinical consultations in the interpretation of information, involvement in decisions, and caretaking Characterize current use of electronic media as an adjunct to or instead of face-to-face communication, including e-mail, shared medical records, and the Internet Understand how patients experience and deal with information overload and associated confusion and anxiety Understand how communication affects social support within and outside the patient-clinician relationship Explore the process of decision-making, including the limits of the concept of shared decision-making Investigate the effect of decision aids on communication Observe how health care systems currently foster or impede patient/family-clinician communication Characterize situations that require dealing with uncertainty and how clinicians and patients discuss uncertainty Explore how clinical communication affects patient agency, enablement, and self-care Understand the effects of clinician well-being, self-awareness, and burnout on communication 106 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 107 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions schemes. Some longitudinal studies have documented changes in patients' information needs and their preferred role in decision-making over time. The findings of a few studies have suggested that effec\u00adtive communication about bad news and treatment choices is associated with improved quality of life. We suggest the following topics as areas for future descripti ve research: Continuous healing relation\u00adships Communication environment Family involvement in clinical consultations Use of electronic media Information overload Social support Decision-making Health care systems Uncertainty Agency, enablement, and action Clinician well-being and b urnout Continuous healing relationships Patients focus on many aspects of their relationships with clini\u00adcians\u2014not just communication. Qualitati ve studies suggest that patients value physicians' enduring characteristics (e.g., caring, con\u00adnection, knowing the patient as a person) more than specific com\u00admunication techniques (e.g., expressing empathy, partnership building). 43-49 Collectively, and over time, however, these specific tech\u00adniques lik ely contribute to patients' perceptions of clinicians' enduring characteristics. One way in which communication builds healing rela\u00adtionships, for example, is through clinicians' understanding of the way patients make sense of their illnesses (illness representa\u00adtions). 8,9,18-20,50 When clinicians understand these illness represen\u00adtations, patients feel recognized, accompanied, cared for, and healed. 18,51 Qualitative reports can further elucidate the way patients understand their own illnesses and feel understood by their clinicians. In turn, such reports can inform future research on ways of improv\u00ading and monitoring the quality of continuous healing relationships. Although communication research primarily addresses single discrete clinical encounters, patients e xpe\u00ad rience visits with clinicians in a more \"narrative\" way. Over time, a story unfolds, with each contact framed by history, anticipation, and retrospect. By taking a histori\u00adcal and longitudinal approach, some of the paradoxes noted in communication research\u2014such as the relatively low correlations between observer-coded measures and patient self-reports of commu\u00adnication\u2014may be better under\u00adstood. The goals set out by the IOM's \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" report include continuous healing relationships characterized by trust and feeling understood. 3 Longitudinal research enables the study of these relationships as they unfold over time. Communication environment Not only do patients have visits o ver time, they also meet with vari\u00ad ous clinicians and staff at different phases of the illness. Yet, our knowledge is limited about how patients experience these different personnel and what value they place on these relationships. Studies should examine all interac\u00adtions in cancer care and, at mini\u00admum, assess patients' perceptions and evaluate how different patient-clinician relationships relate to proximal, intermediate, and distal (health) outcomes. Family involvement in clinical consultations Cancer has a major impact on fam\u00ad ily life. 36 Family members attend most cancer consultations in which diagnostic, prognostic, and treat\u00adment discussions occur 36 and typi\u00ad cally visit frequently when patients are hospitalized. Yet, only a few in-depth studies have considered the essential role of family members in remembering and interpreting information, discussing treatment options with and without the pres\u00adence of clinicians, providing social support, and providing \"terror management\" to buffer the effect of devastating news. 36,52-54 Families play a crucial role in improving clinical communication in cancer settings. Clinicians' attitudes toward family involvement generally are positive, 53 but family members can disrupt the patient clinician relationship, lengthen vis\u00adits, interject their own values, and lead clinicians to offer less emo\u00adtional support. 55 Clinicians cur\u00ad rently make poor use of family 107 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 108 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care members' potential to improve care and cancer outcomes. Electronic media Patients with cancer and their fam\u00ad ily members often consult the Internet before and between con\u00adtacts with health professionals. 10 Little is known about how this information shapes patients' illness representations, makes its way into clinical conversations, or influ\u00adences subsequent patient behavior and well-being. Another type of electronic communication, e-mail, is being used more often by clini\u00adcians and patients/families, and the impact of such communication likely will change important processes of care. Although e-mail communication can increase patient access to clinicians, it also may increase clinician workload and lead to stress and burnout. More research is needed on the ways in which electronic resources and e-mail can enhance the care of patients with cancer. Information overload Communication research generally has used an information-def icit model, which focuses on patients' expressed needs for more informa\u00adtion about an illness and its treat\u00adment, prognosis, and psychological impact. Paradoxically, a new gen\u00aderation of Internet-savvy patients and families find themselves with seemingly unlimited access to information and now need help judging its quality and relevance. Information overload can also be a source of anxiety. Often, contradic\u00adtory or ambiguous information requires clarification by clinicians. Research may suggest areas for impro vement, interventions, and the role of health care systems in providing access to relevant, understandable, high-quality information. Social support Clinicians provide social support during their interactions with patients and also f acilitate patients' access to social support. How clinical communication can result in increased social support and how social support might mediate the relationship between improved communication and improved health outcomes is poorly studied. Likely factors include neurohumoral and immunological responses to (lack of) social isolation, logistical and financial support, emotional sup\u00adport, and promotion of healthy behaviors through social norms and encouragement. A large body of literature documents the need for and influence of social support, but very few studies have specifi\u00adcally addressed the role of com\u00admunication. Decision-making Several studies on decision-making address the balance of po wer between patients and physicians in making decisions under uncertain circumstances. 56-62 (See Appendix D for a more extensive review.) However, few of these studies have addressed how decisions actually are identified and made in clinical practice. Future research should describe the process by which decisions are addressed, how patients participate in discussions, and the role of family members in the decision-making process. Determining whether a decision is \"shared\" may be comple x. Observers of the interaction may rate the level of sharing differently than the protagonists, 63 perhaps reflecting differing ability to dis\u00adtinguish acquiescence from agree\u00adment. Further exploration of the nature of clinical decisions is needed to guide future interven\u00adtions. Decision aids, written or video materials designed to enable patients to make independent choices among treatment options, present opportunities to help patients and families participate in the clinical interaction and deliber\u00adate when confronting difficult deci\u00adsions. 64 However, the role of decision aids in facilitating com\u00admunication is not well studied. Health care systems The role of health care systems in fostering communication has been e xplored minimally, although their role seems pivotal. In one way or another, health care systems control access, the flow of information, use of time, financial incentives, and the structure of health care teams, all of which have an impact on communication and quality of care. Descriptive research on clini\u00adcal communication in health care systems that have adopted struc\u00adtural changes to improve quality of care would inform future commu\u00adnication efforts. These changes might include implementing team approaches to care, self-manage\u00adment programs, Internet classes for patients, and patient access to elec\u00adtronic medical records. 108 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 109 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions Uncertainty From a theoretical and practical standpoint, management of the ine vitable uncertainties in cancer care is poorly understood.65-67 Recent neurobiological research suggests that neurohumoral responses are activated not only in response to but also in anticipation of imagined unpleasant events. 68 These responses lead people to make hasty choices to avoid the imagined pain and anxiety of pro\u00adlonged uncertainty. Further research can explore how commu\u00adnication raises awareness of, frames, reduces, and/or fosters acceptance of uncertainty across the different phases of the cancer care continuum. Agency, enablement, and action There is very little research on how patient-clinician communication is translated into patient action. Descripti ve research can elucidate how patients are motivated to self-manage aspects of the illness, acquire information, garner social support resources, and navigate the health care system with and with\u00adout help from health professionals and family members. Clinician well-being and burnout Clinician well-being has a direct impact on the quality of care patients recei ve.38,39 Caring for people with cancer is emotionally taxing, burnout is not infrequent, and personal wellness strategies seem to have a positive effect on reported quality of care for patients. 38,40,69-73 However, clini\u00ad cians' emotional needs and their feelings toward their patients are often not addressed. 74,75 Further descriptive research can explore which self-care strategies and institutional en vironments foster well-being, reduce burnout, and enable clinicians to deliver higher quality care. 6.2.4 Intervention research (T able 6.8) Intervention research in cancer communication lar gely has focused on providing information, enhanc\u00ading patient recall of information, improving the delivery of bad news, eliciting and responding to emotional needs of patients, advancing patients' information-seeking skills, and increasing patient control of the decision-making process. An overview of intervention research is provided in Appendix E. A fresh look at improving commu\u00ad nication in clinical cancer settings may be needed to meet the goals of impro ving patient survival and quality of life. As described in Section 6.3.1, the development of a communication improvement model , not just a descriptive model of communication, is needed to further intervention research. Although descriptive models are useful for research purposes, health care system planners and change agents need a model to guide interventions; this model should focus explicitly on elements that are likely to make a difference. The research framework should take into account the desirable out\u00adcomes and identify theoretical and empirical links between communi\u00adcation and desired outcomes. Planning of interventions should take into account factors related to health care systems\u2014an interv en\u00ad tion should be designed and deployed within an environment that can sustain it. Interventions should address several questions: Who should be the targets of the interv ention? What skills, attitudes, and con\u00adtent areas should be addressed? When is the intervention most lik ely to have an impact? Where should the intervention tak e place? How should the intervention be conducted? The areas for descriptive research listed in the pre vious section are also areas for potential interven\u00adtions, but they will not be dis\u00adcussed again here. Four additional considerations should guide future interventions: Combining interventions in volving health care systems, clinicians, and patients Focusing on improving patient access and agenc y, not just attitudes and knowledge Incorporating family and social systems to optimize patient care Using all possible communica\u00adtion media to foster continuous healing relationships 109 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 110 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care To whom interventions should be directed and what behaviors and skills should be targeted Communication research should test combined interv entions that include health care systems changes in addition to targeting cli\u00adnicians, patients, and ancillary per\u00adsonnel. Research should also focus on families and social systems, not just individual patients. Most cancer communication stud\u00ad ies to date ha ve focused primarily on changing clinicians' (especially physicians') communication behavior. 76-78 Fewer studies have involved patients, and studies involving health care systems are rare. To provide a rationale for combined interventions involving patients, clinicians, and the health care system, we first present a brief overview and explain the limita\u00adtions of interventions involving only clinicians, patients, or ancil\u00adlary personnel. Clinicians Interventions generally consist of seminars for clinicians that are of three hours to three days in dura\u00adtion. Areas of focus include skills for eliciting patient concerns, expressing empathy, responding to patient cues, handling psychologi\u00adcal distress, dealing with emotions, breaking bad news, helping patients manage pain, and working with patients who have limited lit\u00aderacy. The most effective training programs are long-term, involve multiple pedagogical methods, allow for rehearsal, provide timely feedback, and allow clinicians to work in groups with skilled facili\u00adtators. 76-81 These interventions result in better elicitation of and response to patients' fears and con\u00adcerns, as well as clearer delivery of information. In addition, the find\u00adings of some studies have indicated that the patients of physicians who have undergone such training con\u00adsequently felt better informed, less depressed, and more in control. 82,83 However, many of these studies are characterized by a small sample size. Use of different measures of communication and health out\u00adcomes makes comparison across studies difficult. Furthermore, without incentives to participate, only interested and motivated clini\u00adcians attend communication skills courses, leaving the majority\u2014and often those who need it the most\u2014 without training. Because experi\u00adenced clinicians have usually developed rather stable routines for interacting with patients, commu\u00adnication training interventions need to be introduced early in the med\u00adical school curriculum. Changing the behavior of practic\u00ad ing clinicians presents an impor\u00adtant challenge for tw o reasons. First, patient-centered communica\u00adtion represents not only a new set of behaviors and skills but also a fundamental difference in outlook on the patient-clinician relation\u00adship, in which the clinician's task is to explore emotional aspects of suffering, not just physical aspects, and to empower\u2014not just inform. Second, it is likely that many clini\u00adcians believe that they are \"patient centered\" because they are caring, thorough, and involved. However, a closer look at their communica\u00adtion patterns reveals otherwise. It is clear that more intensive clini\u00adcian interv entions yield more sub\u00ad stantive and long-lasting results.76,84 Technology and economy of scale may make some of these interven\u00adtions more user-friendly, accessi\u00adble, and affordable. Also, a better understanding of the fundamental skills that clinicians need will help to focus interventions on those skills and attitudes that will truly affect patient outcomes. For exam\u00adple, there is sufficient current evi\u00addence to suggest that clinician interventions should ensure that clinicians at least learn to accom\u00admodate patients who wish to par\u00adticipate in their own care. 85 However, the effectiveness of these interventions will be diminished if patients are not prepared to partici\u00adpate in their visits or if health care facilities do little to encourage or sustain these training programs. The cost of providing communica\u00adtion training to clinicians should be considered in the context of the suffering and expense incurred by poor communication and the cost of the use of unnecessary or inap\u00adpropriate cancer treatments and technologies. Patients Such interventions as in-person coaching, interacti ve computer programs, videos of role models, and question prompt sheets pro\u00advide patients with tools to learn about the disease, ask questions, and participate in decision\u00admaking. 86-88 The interventions can improve information-gathering,88 decrease anxiety, improve recall,89 and stimulate discussion.90 Decision aids are used increas\u00ad 110 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 111 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions ingly, but there have been virtually no studies on the role of the aids during clinical visits. 64 Audio recordings of clinical consultations can help improve patient recall and assimilation of information. 91-93 They also raise patient satisfac\u00adtion 94 and may increase patients' participation at later consulta\u00adtions. 95 Patient interventions para\u00ad doxically may decrease patient satisfaction and not affect clini\u00adcians' communication patterns if the clinicians are not \"in tune\" with the goals of the intervention, suggesting that combined interven\u00adtions may have positive effects on communication that clinician and patient interventions alone cannot demonstrate. Ancillary personnel Numerous interventions for depression, diabetes, asthma, and other chronic illnesses ha ve involved the use of care managers and/or navigators to educate, moti\u00advate, and activate patients to improve their own self-care and to help patients move through the health care system. While some research has examined the role of lay health educators to help patients with cancer manage pain, 96 to date, none has specifically examined how ancillary health workers affect communication between clinicians and patients with cancer. 97 Clearly, if these interventions are to have a future, their incorporation into routine clinical care is essential. It is not clear if care management interven\u00adtions will work in the long-term as stand-alone interventions in the absence of interventions at the cli\u00adnician, patient, or health care sys\u00adtem le vel. In addition to such spe\u00ad cialists, the role of volunteers, other patients, electronic informa\u00adtion systems, and members of the health care team in improving patient navigation should be explored further. Perhaps care managers and navigators may become unnecessary if appropriate changes to health care systems are made. Health care systems System-wide interventions have the potential to incorporate and b uild on interventions for clini\u00ad cians and patients by coordinating approaches, a variety of health pro\u00adfessionals and staff, and financial incentives. The chronic care model provides one way of understanding how health care systems can opti\u00admize care, including communica\u00adtion. 98,99 The model includes self-management support, decision support, clinical information sys\u00adtems, delivery system design, and community resources and policies, all of which are aligned to opti\u00admize care. Coupled with clinician and/or patient training, improved communication with patients is a likely but unproved outcome of such systems. System-wide inter\u00adventions benefit from attention to the following: Providing leadership to clarify roles and set e xpectations for good communication Setting incentives in the form of compensation, recognition, and job satisf action Involving patients in the redesign of health care systems Changing the physical envi\u00adronment, especially in inpa\u00adtient and emer gency room settings, to foster better com\u00admunication Making sure time during a clinical encounter is used to focus on substanti ve issues rather than administrative tasks Developing systems for monitoring the quality of communication Potential interventions at the prac\u00adtice le vel include the following: Restructuring appointment systems to impro ve access to health care Providing telephone informa\u00ad tion lines Implementing health informa\u00adtion systems that pro vide patients with easy access to health and disease-related information (e.g., patient-friendly websites); Implementing shared elec\u00adtronic health records Providing cultural competency training for all clinical staf f Providing interpreters Giving patients choices of physicians and health care team members Training patients to request appropriate treatment Using family meetings routinely 111 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 112 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Communication training for clini\u00ad cians and patients will continue to be essential, but some interven\u00adtions at the health care system level are likely to change face-to-face communication even without such training. For example, the use of question prompt sheets in the wait\u00ading room or health-related websites that can be accessed from patients' homes in anticipation of a clinic or hospital visit can jump-start impor\u00adtant clinical conversations. Health care systems also can supplement face-to-face communication by adopting electronic communication systems that support patient-clini\u00adcian interactions. Allowing patients to write in their personal medical charts also bolsters communication. Parallel interventions for clinicians and patients may impro ve the like\u00ad lihood that clinicians will enthusi\u00adastically support patient efforts at self-management. Interventions at the health care system level can improve communication among multiple clinicians by providing a common information system, structural features that facilitate communication, care teams, and shared medical records. These measures are not a remedy for lack of clinician and patient communi\u00adcation skills, however. Combined interventions may be synergistic and should target more than just one of the elements (clinicians, patients, or health care systems). No single element necessarily may be effective alone, just as single-agent chemotherapy often has min\u00adimal or short-lived responses. In order to design and execute communication interv entions at the health care system level, programs should in volve multiple layers of expertise on health care system administration, health economics, patient advocacy, information tech\u00adnology, and communication tech\u00adnology. Changes that are designed to improve patient-centered care also should measure the effect of these interventions on the quality and ease of communication. Families and social systems We noted in the section on descrip\u00ad ti ve research that family members are frequently present during inpa\u00adtient and outpatient consultations. How family involvement and fam\u00adily dynamics affect communication and health outcomes is not known. Intervention research can help family members assist the patient in gaining access to care, encour\u00adage healthy behaviors, and remem\u00adber important details that might be forgotten by a patient in distress. Yet, in a recent review, 36 no clinical trials to improve family-clinician communication were identified. The nature of family interventions could include the following: pro\u00adviding information to the family; using prompt sheets and coaching similar to those received by patients; conducting group visits that include patients, families, and clinicians (similar to such visits patients with diabetes); 100 and offering family members the opportunity to write in the patient's medical record (while also ensur\u00ading confidentiality). Family inter\u00adventions may be especially appropriate for patients who lack functional or cognitive capacity, patients who present language bar\u00adriers for clinicians, and patients from more f amily-centric or socio\u00ad centric cultures.101 Patients' social networks help improve communi\u00adcation, as well as lend instrumental and emotional support, and should be explored early in the illness. Interventions to improve family-clinician communication should include skills for managing family dynamics and conflict. 53 Outcomes of family interventions should also include measures of family functioning. Which communication behaviors and outcomes should be targeted Communication research in the cancer care setting should broaden the focus on se veral behaviors: Establishing continuous heal\u00ad ing relationships, not just sin\u00adgle encounters Helping patients be effective consumers of kno wledge, not just passive recipients of infor\u00admation Improving social support within and e xtrinsic to the patient-clinician relationship Managing uncertainty Process of deliberation for treatment decisions, not just who decides Partnership and agency, not just self-ef ficacy or satisfaction Fostering continuous healing r elationships We discussed the importance of narrati ve, history, and longitudinal relationships in the section on 112 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 113 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions descriptive research. Patients derive comfort and hope simply knowing that a clinician and the staff care about them and will be there when times are difficult. Intervention research to improve communication should target the strengthening of these relation\u00adships. At the health care system level, patients should have improved access and continuity. Research should study the mediat\u00ading effects of the therapeutic alliance on the relationship between communication and outcomes. Continuous healing relationships in volve more than the patient-clini\u00ad cian dyad. As noted previously, interventions should include atten\u00adtion to family members and other members of the health care team. Structuring and evaluating such complex interventions will require qualitative as well as quantitative approaches. Continuous healing relationships should in volve optimal use of all possible communication media. Very little is known, however, about how to incorporate even sim\u00adple technology, such as e-mail, seamlessly into clinical practice. As information technology contin\u00adues to change and is incorporated more often into practice settings, it becomes an opportune time for large-scale longitudinal research on the impact of information tech\u00adnology on healing relationships. Longitudinal studies of relation\u00ad ships will require inno vative data collection techniques to reduce the burden on study participants and to obtain high-quality data. In addi\u00adtion to traditional surv ey and observational methods, data collec\u00adtion can include use of e-mail, Web-based diaries and surveys, text messaging, and mobile tele\u00adphones. Follow-up intervals must account for the effects of interven\u00adtions as relationships evolve over time. Also, interventions may have to occur over time. Patients' needs, wishes, preferences, and emotions vary during the course of the can\u00adcer experience, and this could limit the effect of any single training intervention. Helping patients be effective con\u00ad sumer s of knowledge With increased access to the Internet, shared medical records, and other resources, clinicians will ha ve to help patients sort through information and put it into the con\u00adtext of their own illness. Clinicians and patients can be trained to engage in more productive sharing of information, but training would be optimized in a health care sys\u00adtem that provides access to high-quality health-related information. Improving social support within and e xtrinsic to the patient- clinician relationship Social support has powerful effects on health, yet the potential of patient-clinician communication to broaden social support has not been e xplored in-depth. The medi\u00ad ating effect of social support on the relationship between communica\u00adtion and outcomes may be best explored in intervention studies that include components that enable patients to better use their social networks and form new ones. Managing uncertainty By moving beyond a model that attempts to minimize uncertainty , interventions may be able to help patients and clinicians tolerate and work with uncertainty. These inter\u00adventions should have both affective and cognitive elements. Particularly important is the avoid\u00adance of anxiety-driven premature closure of decisions that would otherwise benefit from more dis\u00adcussion and deliberation. Realistically framing uncertainty as providing both threat and hope can lower anxiety over the long run. In contrast, reassurance often leads to a transient reduction in anxiety, followed by a quick rebound to previous or higher lev\u00adels. 102 Very few studies have been done on eliciting the patient values that would influence the outcome of decisions made under uncer\u00adtainty. Presenting clinical evidence to patients in ways that can be eas\u00adily understood and incorporated into decisions is also crucial to managing uncertainty. 103 For exam\u00ad ple, recent studies demonstrate that the use of graphical displays can enhance patient understanding and reduce reliance on anecdotal infor\u00admation during discussions of risk. 104-107 Further studies might explore how the use of graphics influences oral communication and whether electronic and paper media for displaying graphics are equally effective. Four types of uncertainty have been proposed by Saunders: 108 Interpersonal uncertainty or uncertainty in communication occurs when people do not say 113 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 114 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care what they mean or the intended message is under\u00adstood by the receiver in more than one way. Uncertainty arising from lack of kno wledge occurs when the clinician or patient is unsure, but there is an answer available that can reduce uncertainty. Uncertainty in application occurs when the a vailable sci\u00ad entific evidence is known, but there is still doubt about what to do because the populations studied differ from the patient in important ways, the find\u00adings are conflicting, or there are no data on outcomes of importance. Moral uncertainty occurs when the goal of the clinical inter\u00adv ention is unclear, such as whether the patient wants aggressive treatment with a known probability of effective\u00adness even if it might involve greater discomfort. Each of these types of uncertainty requires a dif ferent approach to communication. Improving the process of delibera\u00ad tion for tr eatment decisions As noted previously, most decision research in cancer has focused on who makes the decision, presum\u00ad ing that there is conflict between, or mutual ignorance of, patients' and clinicians' values. However, optimal decision-making is a process that achieves mutual understanding by revealing the cli\u00adnicians' and patients' respective thoughts and reconciling differ\u00adences between the two. Although there ha ve been calls to study deliberations during decision-mak\u00ading, 57 few studies have been done in cancer settings, and no interven\u00adtions have been directed at both clinicians and patients. Enhancing partnership and agency Self-management programs for patients with chronic disease focus on se veral features that may opti\u00ad mize outcomes in cancer settings. (See Tables 4.1 [page 68] and 4.2 [page 70]). Although empowered patients have a sense of self-effi\u00adcacy, they also need the means to identify problems, set goals, actively access resources, solve problems, and use physicians and a variety of other health profession\u00adals as partners in care. It remains unclear, however, which clinician communication behaviors promote self-care and self-management, and what combination of patient, clinician, and health care system interventions is necessary to trans\u00adform fundamentally clinician-directed care to partnerships. Further research should identify the phases of cancer self-manage\u00adment during which interventions are most appropriate and most likely to influence health outcomes. Which phases of the cancer care continuum should be targeted Most cancer communication stud\u00ad ies in volve patients making deci\u00ad sions about screening or patients with newly diagnosed cancer con\u00adsidering treatment choices. Additional intervention research is needed at these phases, but perhaps more important is the strikingly lo w number of studies that have explored communication issues for cancer survivors experiencing anx\u00adiety about recurrence and func\u00adtional disabilities as a result of the disease or its treatment. When patients are dealing with recur\u00adrence and treatment failure, they frequently must decide between third-line treatments with limited or unproved effectiveness and comfort care. But clinicians have very little research to guide them in presenting information and help\u00ading with these difficult decisions. In addition, few interventions address patients' needs for infor\u00admation and emotional support, decision-making, and managing uncertainty from diagnosis through survivorship. Longitudinal interventions with reinforcement and accommodation to changing clinical realities may pro vide patients and families with needed continuous healing rela\u00adtionships. Just as cancer treatment involves different modalities offered sequentially\u2014some of which are intensive and some of which take years\u2014sequential lon\u00adgitudinal communication interven\u00adtions may yield the best outcomes. How and when interventions should occur Drawing from complexity theory articulated in the IOM' s \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" report,109 the timing and context of interventions may be as important as the inter\u00adventions themselves. As mentioned previously, clinicians develop rela\u00ad 114 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 115 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions Table 6.8 Recommendations for Intervention Research Whom and what to target Develop inexpensive, user-friendly, accessible, and affordable clinician interventions Study patient interventions in a wider range of clinical settings, with use of electronic media, and in combination with clinician interventions Study the effects of care managers, navigators, and other personnel on the quality of care and patient outcomes Focus on families and social systems, not just individuals Focus on health care systems, not just clinicians, patients, care managers, and navigators Develop system-wide interventions to incorporate and build on interventions for clinicians and patients Consider self-management support, decision support, clinical information systems, delivery system design, and community resources Study combined interventions rather than single elements Which communication behaviors and outcomes to target Focus on continuous healing relationships, not just encounters Focus on helping patients be effective consumers of knowledge, not just passive recipients of information Focus on improving social support within and extrinsic to the patient-clinician relationship Focus on managing uncertainty Focus on the process of deliberation when making important treatment decisions, not just who decides Focus on partnership and agency, not just self-efficacy or satisfaction Which phases of the cancer care continuum to target Continue current research topics - Screening decisions - Treatment choices for patients with newly diagnosed cancer facing treatment choices - Palliative care decisions Future research topics - Communication during the treatment phase - Survivorship, including the experiences of cancer survivors who have recurrence - End-of-life care - Longitudinal interventions across phases tively stable communication styles during training, and it may be more difficult to change in later years. Thus, early intervention at the medical school or residency level is likely to have a greater impact on overall communication style. Patients, on the other hand, generally have little experience with physicians, and training may be more effective when they are confronting a serious illness later in life. Although this concept appears logical, communication improvement models would depend on knowing when these interventions actually have the greatest effect. 6.3 Methodological Issues in Communication Resear ch in Cancer Settings (Table 6.9) 6.3.1 Study design Most descriptive research in cancer settings is cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies illuminate the de velopment of patient-centered behaviors over time and facilitate causal inferences linking commu\u00adnication processes with patient health outcomes. Despite calls for longitudinal studies for more than 20 years, 110 these studies are rare, probably because of their expense and complexity. Randomized con\u00adtrolled trials of communication interventions are challenging because of the complexity of inter\u00adventions that involve patients, cli\u00adnicians, and health care systems. A considerable number of random\u00adized trials have proximal endpoints that measure only communication 115 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 116 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care behaviors and immediate out\u00ad comes, not intermediate or health outcomes. Because patients with cancer meet with multiple health professionals, studies of patients' experiences over time may require designs of clinicians nested within patients, the opposite of the traditional patient-nested-within-clinician design using a convenience sam\u00adple. Also, health care system inter\u00adventions ideally would use the system as the unit of analysis. Patients' experiences are, by defi\u00adnition, incompletely captured using rating scales. Hence, a qualitative component of intervention studies can provide valuable information about how the intervention is received. There exists a consider\u00adable body of knowledge involving design of mixed-method studies in primary care that can be applied to cancer settings, 111 including ran\u00ad domized controlled trials of health care system interventions. There are limitations to the use of real patients, including differences in clinician case-mix and self-selec\u00adtion of clinicians and patients. Observational studies and random\u00adized trials can be conducted with use of standardized patients to overcome some of these chal\u00adlenges, and this topic is discussed in Section 6.4.7. In some cases, randomized con\u00adtrolled trials are impossible for eth\u00adical reasons, are impractical, or are prohibiti vely expensive. In those cases, it is possible to carry out carefully designed cohort or descriptive studies using qualita\u00adtive and mixed-method methodol\u00adogy borrowed from educational program e Interventions As noted previously, multicompo\u00ad nent interv entions are more likely to be successful than a molar Table 6.9 Recommendations for Methodological Issues Study design Randomized trials Mixed qualitative-quantitative studies Longitudinal design Intermediate and distal outcomes Nesting clinicians within patients and nesting patients within clinicians Evaluation of educational programs Theoretically informed choice of pathways and intermediate and health outcomes Improved patient knowledge and shared understanding Improved access to care Improved therapeutic alliances Improved emotional self-management Stronger family/social support and advocacy Improved quality of medical decisions Improved patient agency Data sources Current - Patient surveys - Interviews - Focus groups - Observations (direct or audiotaped) of practice New methods - Patient or clinician diaries - Entries into shared medical records - E-mail text - Critical incident reports - Unannounced standardized patients approach of testing individual ele\u00ad ments. Although each individual element may have a small effect on communication and outcomes, synergistic approaches at multiple levels of the health care system may be more effective. 116 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 117 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions 6.3.3 Defining relevant pathw ays and intermediate and health outcomes There is a need to explore which intermediate outcomes best reflect (and are most sensiti ve to) changes in communication and which are most closely associated with health outcomes. These intermediate out\u00adcomes then can be used as indica\u00adtors of future changes in health outcomes or as proxies for the moment-to-moment behavior that occurs in clinical settings, which can otherwise be difficult to meas\u00adure. For example, consider the case of a man with prostate cancer who stops hormone therapy after treat\u00adment with radiation has ended because he thought his continued need to urinate frequently at night indicated that the treatment was ineffective (an illness representa\u00adtion). In this case, poor adherence, which also leads to poorer out\u00adcomes, is a result of communica\u00adtion failure because the patient is making false assumptions about the treatment. Another question to explore is whic h intermediate outcomes are most closely associated with improvements in quality of life and survival. Different intermediate outcomes may link various com\u00admunication functions with various aspects of health-related quality of life. Also, some links may be immediate and others, delayed. For example, communication interven\u00adtions that improve adherence to long-term hormone therapy for breast cancer will likely improve survival but may increase symp\u00adtoms and thus decrease quality of life in the short-term. Research should explore the fol\u00adlo wing hypothesized pathways between communication and health outcomes: Improved patient knowledge and shar ed understanding This pathway encompasses the translation of information into use\u00adful kno wledge, the effect of useful knowledge on anxiety and well\u00adbeing, and the attainment of a shared understanding when clini\u00adcian and patient understand and align illness representations. Improved access to care This pathway encompasses societal and health care system issues, na v\u00ad igational resources, and patient empowerment and enablement. Improved therapeutic alliances As stated previously, one of the functions of communication is to foster continuous healing relation\u00adships. Once formed, the therapeu\u00adtic alliance may also ha ve a mediating effect on the pathways from communication to health out\u00adcomes. Studying this pathway should incorporate mixed-method research, given the discrepancies noted between what patients report in unstructured qualitative inter\u00adviews and the content of com\u00admonly used survey instruments. (See Appendix A for a more exten\u00adsive discussion of healing relation\u00adships.) Improved emotional self-man\u00ada gement Emotions have an important effect on well-being; ho wever, only a few of the many possible mechanisms that help patients make sense of the terrifying e vents surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have been explored. Enhanced social support is one of those mechanisms. Equally important may be provision of timely infor\u00admation, a continuous relationship with a health care team, and assis\u00adtance in navigating the health care system. Also, the ability to manage uncertainty depends on and also affects the patient's emotional state. Stronger family/social support and advocacy There is a large body of literature linking social support to health. 113 However, of the four mechanisms described in Chapter 3 (and Figure 3.3), it is not clear which of these is most appropriate at each phase of the cancer care continuum or with different types of patients and settings. Social networks can improve health outcomes by set\u00adting social norms for and facilitat\u00ading healthy behaviors, offering financial assistance, providing a sense of connectedness, lowering physiological arousal, and increas\u00ading self-efficacy. However, there is a need to understand how commu\u00ad nication affects social support and which communication-related changes in social support, in turn, affect health outcomes. Improved quality of medical decisions Criteria for high-quality decisions should include e vidence that the decisions are clinically informed, concordant with the patient's val\u00adues, and mutually endorsed. 117 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 118 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Improved patient agency The links between self-efficacy, empo werment, and enablement are poorly understood. Measures of the latter two constructs have been developed only recently, yet are important in understanding how communication might lead to improved adherence, health habits, and self-care. 6.3.4 Defining and describing important moderators of the relationship betw een communication and health outcomes Space limits our ability to discuss all of the potential moderators of the relationship between communi\u00adcation and outcomes. (See Table 3.4, page 52.) However, we con\u00adsider three moderators to be partic\u00adularly important and in need of future research: social distance, health literacy, and social networks. Social distance Social distance is the discordance between clinicians and patients with re gard to interests, values, beliefs, and assumptions. This moderator may provide an expla\u00adnation for effects related to differ\u00adences in educational background, social class, race, ethnicity, and gender. The general communica\u00adtion literature suggests that patient reports of lower satisfaction with greater social distance may not be supported by direct observations of communication behavior. 114 This raises two questions: Are we look\u00ading at the right elements of com\u00admunication? Is social distance the moderator of the observed effects, or are there other factors more proximal to the communication beha viors that might be more relevant? Social distance can be seen as a combination of se veral demo\u00ad graphic characteristics that may not occur independently; that is, differ\u00adences between two ethnic groups may also include differences in skin color, language or dialect, eco\u00adnomics, and educational back\u00adground. Also, social distance is associated with other moderators that have a more direct theoretical relationship to communication, such as increased anxiety in the presence of someone who seems different, lack of a common illness representation, and misunderstand\u00adings due to different word usage. 115 Supporting that view is the obser\u00advation that disparities in communi\u00adcation related to social distance may be the result of a patient's prior impressions based on stereo\u00adtyping, which change only gradu\u00adally as he or she gets to know a clinician better. 116 As another exam\u00ad ple, although age has been associ\u00adated with a more passive decision-making style and fewer requests for information, 16 age- related differences may be far less or even disappear when highly edu\u00adcated, literate, nondepressed, cog\u00adnitively intact seniors who use the Internet are compared with similar younger counterparts. By framing the moderators as behavioral vari\u00adables, they may be perceived as amenable to change, in contrast to demographic characteristics, which are not. Thus, it is not unreasonable to propose that bias related to the initial perception of social distance can be attenuated through patient-centered communication. Greater cultural competenc y may manifest as a reduction in the moderating effect of social distance on the rela\u00adtionship between communication and outcomes. Health literacy The effectiveness of interventions to impro ve patients' communica\u00ad tion skills, agency, and self-care may be moderated by health liter\u00adacy. 117 Similarly, a balanced presen\u00ad tation of treatment options may also increase patient participation in decision-making more for liter\u00adate patients who have sufficient background knowledge to under\u00adstand the health issues involved. Social networks Social networks may moderate as well as mediate the relationship between communication and out\u00adcomes. 113 For example, the degree to which a patient follows through with a treatment plan may be mod\u00aderated by the degree of others' sup\u00adport for the plan. Although identification of moderating vari\u00adables is important, it is equally important to understand why these variables have a moderating effect. 6.3.5 Study populations Most patients enrolled in cancer communication studies represent a narro w spectrum of patients and families affected by cancer. Men and family members of patients with cancer are studied less fre\u00adquently than women. Members of linguistic, ethnic, and racial minorities, and patients with low 118 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 119 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions literacy and educational levels are under-represented in cancer com\u00admunication research; these patients typically have worse prognoses with similar illness burdens. Also, more studies are needed involving patients with cancers associated with poor prognosis. These studies should address the survivorship phase, time of relapse, process of considering experimental thera\u00adpies, and palliative care. 6.3.6 Data sources Currently, patient surveys and audio recordings of clinical consul\u00adtations constitute the majority of communication data in quantitati ve studies, and interviews, focus groups, and audio recordings or direct observations of practice dominate qualitative studies. However, the use of other sources, such as patient or clinician diaries, entries into shared medical records, e-mail text, standardized patient encounters, and critical incident reports, is now more feasi\u00adble, given advances in information technology. Diaries allow for moment-to-moment assessments of \"life as it is lived\" 118 by sampling patients' emotional states, physical symptoms, or critical experiences shortly after they happen. Longitudinal data obtained from studies involving diaries often reveal patterns not seen in retro\u00adspective reports. Unannounced standardized patients\u2014actors who present covertly in clinical prac\u00adtices with clinicians' prior con-sent\u2014have been used in health services research to document important differences in prescrib\u00ading, history-taking, and communi\u00adcation beha vior.119-125 Standardized patients offer the advantage of pre\u00adsenting clinicians with nearly iden\u00adtical patient presentations, thus eliminating variability due to case mix, patient and clinician self-selection and accommodation, and other sources of unexplained patient variance. Standardized patients can be deployed in a vari\u00adety of settings and are detected less than 15% of the time. Other data sources, such as shared medical records, are still relatively undevel\u00adoped. The utility of these different data collection methods and sources needs to be examined in future research on communication in cancer settings. 6.3.7 Measurement tools General principles Measures should be based on the\u00ad ory and theoretical relationships among communication functions, pathw ays, and outcomes. Obviously, richer qualitative description of some elements will always be necessary. Measurement of communication: dir ectly observed and patient- reported Communication measures can be general, applying to all communi\u00adcation situations in health care, or specif ic to particular contexts, such as delivery of bad news or deci\u00adsion-making. They also can be process-oriented, categorizing the type of linguistic event (e.g., ask\u00ading questions, social talk), or con\u00adtent-oriented (e.g., providing prognostic information). We have identified six key communication functions in this monograph, and psychometrically sound measures of all six functions are lacking. Oftentimes, e xisting measures use similar nomenclature to measure distinct behaviors and/or use dif\u00adferent nomenclature for similar behaviors. 4 Measures based on audio or video recorded coding schemes of the actual interaction often do not correlate strongly with measures that are based on patient perceptions of the same encounter noted in surveys. 77 In order to suc\u00ad cessfully monitor and improve the delivery and impact of communi\u00adcation in clinical practice, meas\u00adures of the key functions must capture, over time, in a reliable and valid manner, the interactions of patients and their families with multiple members of the health care delivery team. Following are some considerations dra wn from a recent set of pub\u00ad lished recommendations:4 Communication measures should be theory based and empirically v alidated. Particular attention should be focused on correlations between the specific measure and future intermediate and distal (health) outcomes. The aspects of communication being measured should be clar\u00adified; \"patient-centered com\u00admunication\" currently has so many connotations that meas\u00adures of it are likely to represent very different aspects of a mul\u00adtifaceted construct. Components of a measure should be described, and the 119 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 120 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care theoretical links between those components should be made explicit. Also, theoretical and empirically derived pathways from communication to out\u00adcomes should include a theo\u00adretically plausible link as well as measures of proposed medi\u00adators along the pathway. Communication measures should reflect what is impor\u00adtant to patients and f amilies. Researchers ha ve noted differ\u00ad ences between the way patients describe their experi\u00adence of care in qualitative studies and the findings of sur\u00adveys or observational coding of clinical encounters. Thus, there is an important role for focus groups, cognitive inter\u00adviews, and ethnography in the development of measures. Measures should account for all rele v ant participants in the interaction. When family members are present or there is more than one clinician involved in the patient's care, their contributions to the con\u00adversation should be recorded and analyzed. Also, patient's perceptions of communication should include observations of their interactions with other relevant health professionals. Surprisingly, even though fam\u00adily members are present in most interactions in which diagnosis and treatment options are discussed, their contributions rarely are acknowledged and thus, important data and interactions are missed. A balance between general and disease-specif ic or function- specif ic communication meas\u00ad ures should be sought. Communication measures should be individualized for the purpose studied. Attempts to create single measures encompassing all relevant ele\u00adments of communication have not been sufficient and have often yielded paradoxical results that cannot be explored in greater depth. However, general measures can allow for comparison across settings. A similar set of principles also applies to the measurement of outcomes, mediators, and moderators. Outcomes measures should be standardized. There are numer\u00ad ous measures of health-related quality of life, both general and disease-specific or situa\u00adtion-specific. 126-133 Different measures will likely be sensi\u00adtive to various communication interventions for different dis\u00adeases at distinct phases on the cancer care continuum. However, this creates difficul\u00adties extrapolating results from one study to another in differ\u00adent contexts. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scales offers a partial solution by providing a \"fam\u00adily\" of scales, each of which incorporates common general outcomes measures as well as disease-specific or situation-specific outcomes. 132-135 Measures of relevant media\u00adtors and moderators should be standardized. Standardized measures of social support or agenc y/enablement may allo w for comparisons across studies. Measures of the structure and functioning of health care sys\u00adtems are needed to monitor the effects of interventions at the system level. Although instru\u00adments to capture patients' sub\u00adjective experience of care are available, 136 they do not iden\u00ad tify structural elements, such as availability of multidiscipli\u00adnary teams and shared medical records. 6.4 A Timeline for Future Research A solid framework of interaction- based descriptive research and ran\u00addomized trials indicates that communication is a central feature of high-quality care for patients and families affected by cancer. The field is ripe for interventions to improve the survival and quality of life of people affected by can\u00adcer, including patients, their fami\u00adlies, and clinicians. However, several elements need to be better developed to improve the likeli\u00adhood of success of large-scale interventions and further descrip\u00adtive research. These elements include the following: Defining pathways from communi\u00ad cation to health. Research design should be informed by an under\u00adstanding of which f actors mediate and moderate the relationship of communication to subsequent health care and health outcomes. Some of these f actors could be 120 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 121 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions studied in naturalistic descriptive investigations. Others require pilot trials of interventions, particularly to study innovations such as the use of electronic communication media or rarely encountered behaviors such as use of empathy. These likely would be single-insti\u00adtution endeavors initially. Understanding these pathways will then inform what types of meas\u00adures should be developed to describe relevant communication behaviors, intermediate outcomes, and health outcomes. Creating better infrastructures for data mana gement. Longitudinal studies involve ongoing interven\u00adtions, continuous data collection, and long-term surveillance of out\u00adcomes and communication behav\u00adiors. Data from current and past communication research tends to remain where it was collected and does not include standardized measures, limiting the usefulness of the data to other researchers. In the future, data should be suffi\u00adciently standardized and easily accessible so that multiple out\u00adcomes can be studied over time. Surveillance can be applied to communication (e.g., What per\u00adcentage of patients with cancer are being told accurate prognoses? To what extent do clinicians assess patients' understanding of these estimates?) in the same way it is applied to other clinical variables. Creating research networks and consortia. Interventions at the health care system level likely will require large numbers of partici\u00adpants. Thus, consortia of clinicians, clinical practices, and health care systems will improve the chances for success. These consortia can be at two levels. First, networks of can\u00adcer clinicians, including surgeons, interventional radiologists, oncolo\u00adgists, radiation oncologists, nurses, and technicians, can facilitate clini\u00adcian and patient interventions across institutions. Because only the largest health care systems in the United States would have sufficient patients, resources, and clinicians to conduct large longitudinal trials, consortia of health care systems will be necessary to study systems interventions in most settings. Creating programs of research. Communication research should graduate from the cottage industry of indi vidual studies to linked pro\u00ad grams of research. Currently, fund\u00ading for communication research that involves studying interactions between clinicians and patients is supported by grant mechanisms, which, by nature, have a three-to\u00adfive-year horizon. Cancer, however, can be a disease that affects people for many years or decades, taking into account long-term sequelae of the disease, its treatment, and the uncertainty of a cure. Programs could be positioned to create longi\u00adtudinal data warehouses accessible to investigators nationwide and to tackle some of the difficult issues in the long-term care of patients and families affected by cancer. 6.5 Conclusion Cancer will affect 40% of individ\u00aduals in the United States at some point in their lifetime if current trends continue, and 64% of them will survive five years or more after diagnosis. Currently, 10 mil\u00adlion Americans are living with can\u00ad cer or are survivors of cancer, accounting for 3.5% of the popula\u00adtion. 137 Reducing mortality and relieving suffering associated with cancer requires effective communi\u00adcation between clinicians and their patients and family members in the context of a health care system that supports these efforts. Communi\u00adcation is ubiquitous during all phases of the cancer care contin\u00aduum, from prevention through survival and end-of-life care. Currently, patient-clinician com\u00admunication occurs most commonly in face-to-face outpatient and inpa\u00adtient settings. However, this is changing, and electronic communi\u00adcation will play a greater role in the future. When effective, com\u00admunication creates shared knowl\u00adedge and understanding, reduces clinical errors, leads to medically sound decisions concordant with patients' values, facilitates partici\u00adpation in care and follow-through, and helps patients cope and find meaning. Communication is a sine qua non of cancer care. This monograph has provided a preliminary roadmap for under\u00adstanding ho w communication can improve health and health care for all Americans facing cancer. The field of cancer communication research has provided important insights into how effective communication can meet patients' information needs, assist with decision-making, and provide emotional support. Historically, research has been hindered by several factors: 121 4156-DCC PCC Book Front to Ch6-v7.qxd 9/21/07 10:12 AM Page 122 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care Lack of coherent theoretical and conceptual frame works: we have attempted to provide the latter and have suggested the means for developing the former. Lack of common measures: we ha ve suggested principles for developing measures of com\u00admunication. Lack of agreement on relevant outcomes: we ha ve provided a framework of proximal, inter\u00admediate, and distal (health) outcomes that can guide future research, Focus on only a few patient populations, types of cancer , and phases of the cancer care continuum: we have suggested expanding research to include all types of cancer and phases of the continuum. Interventions that concentrate on either patients or clinicians and not both: we ha ve sug\u00ad gested mixed and synergistic interventions involving clini\u00adcians, patients, and families. Lack of considering factors related to health care systems that may impro ve communica\u00ad tion: we have suggested some organizing principles for involving health care systems factors in communication research. Researchers also should turn their attention to communication chal\u00adlenges f aced by minority and dis\u00ad advantaged populations, patients in the survivorship or end-of-life phase of the cancer care contin\u00aduum, and family members and friends. Communication interv en\u00ad tions should focus on creating con\u00adtinuous healing relationships, helping patients and family mem\u00adbers to be effective consumers of health-related information, improv\u00ading social support, managing uncertainty, activating patients to take a greater role in clinical con\u00adsultations and their own self-man\u00adagement, and preventing caregiver and clinician burnout. Interventions must also target or take into account health care systems factors that can support or undermine efforts to improve clinicians' and patients' communication skills.

A.1 Understanding the Patient- Clinician Relationship Most quantitative studies of com\u00admunication focus on the accom\u00adplishment of specific communica\u00adtion tasks (e.g., delivering bad news, sharing information, or mak\u00ading decisions), but qualitative stud\u00adies of patients and families dealing with cancer have tended to charac\u00adterize the ways that these behav\u00adiors occur within relationships with clinicians. Clinicians are more than sources of information and expertise; they provide emo\u00adtional support, guidance, and understanding. 1-3 The findings of several studies have suggested that patients with cancer value clini\u00adcians' enduring characteristics more than specific communication techniques. 4-6 For example, Butow et al.7 reported that the most important factors in communica\u00adtion of prognosis to patients with metastatic cancer was that the communication be within a caring, trusting, long-term relationship and that there be open and repeat\u00aded ne gotiations for patient prefer\u00ad ences. Salander and Henriksson8 found that patients reported that being \"connected to health care\" and \"acknowledged as a person\" by their clinicians' as the most important features of their care, more so than the provision of information. Patients' perceptions of their clinicians' overall interper\u00adsonal style can be quite nuanced. Some discussing transitions to palliative care. 9 These perceptions may partially account for patients' tendency to rate clinicians according to an underlying global sense of the cli\u00adnician rather than according to specific behaviors, even when those behaviors are explicitly list\u00aded as items on a survey. 10 Therapeutic relationships with cli\u00adnicians can help patients adjust better to their illnesses. 3,5,11,12 However, the mechanisms by which an enduring, strong relation\u00adship is formed and how a trusting relationship facilitates communica\u00adtion and helps patients adjust to their illnesses, is poorly under\u00adstood. Some clues to the interac\u00adtions between communication and A 131 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 132 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care relationships have been explored qualitatively. For example, com\u00admunication may lead to a patient's greater sense of \"being known\" 13 by his or her clinician. Warmth, caring, and confidence may be communicated more through non\u00adverbal channels than through ver\u00adbal ones Physicians' tone of voice may affect patients' confidence in them and has even been correlated with the likelihood that a physi\u00adcian was sued. 14 Effective commu\u00ad nication presumably is a key to strengthening relationships and providing patients with a greater sense of support. 1 Conversely, a global sense of trust, warmth, and caring also may allow for forgive\u00adness for, and repair of miscommu\u00adnications and medical errors. A.2 Patient Participation in Care Regardless of their preferred roles in making medical decisions, patients generally want to be involved in the process of care, be informed of all their treatment options, feel as if they were lis\u00adtened to, and feel as if their physi\u00adcians know them as people not simply diseases. 15-17 In order to be involved and feel understood, patients must be able to effectively and actively communicate their needs, concerns, and perspectives. From a communication perspec\u00adti ve, active patient participation may be defined as the extent to which patients produce verbal responses that have the potential to significantly influence the content and structure of the interaction, as well as the clinicians' beliefs and behaviors. 18,19 Particularly powerful linguistic behaviors include asking questions, being assertive (e.g., offering opinions, introducing top\u00adics, making requests), expressing concerns and feelings, and telling one's health story (i.e., discussing health within the context of daily living). In general, compared with less assertive (passive) patients, patients who use these behaviors more often 20-24 Have increased satisfaction with care Receive more information and support from clinicians Are more committed to treat\u00ad ment plans Have a better understanding of treatment options Experience greater improve\u00adment in health Although clinicians sometimes complain about o verly talkative and controlling patients, many cli\u00adnicians believe patients' commu\u00adnicative openness is desirable. 25 Clinicians report that active com\u00admunication reveals valuable infor\u00admation about patients' health needs and beliefs 26,27 and con\u00ad tributes to treatment recommenda\u00adtions better suited to an individual patient's life circumstances. 28 In order to be more active commu\u00adnicators, patients need to have suf\u00adficient cognitive and linguistic resources and skills, believe in the legitimacy of their participation, and interact with clinicians who support their involvement. 18 In studies that have included use of observational and self-report meas\u00adures, cancer care and cancer pre\u00adv ention settings, patients are more active participants when their cli\u00adnicians use more partnership-building and supportive talk (e.g., reassurance, encouragement). 29-32 Other communication strategies of clinicians that encourage greater patient involvement include explic\u00adit agenda-setting, active listening, checking of understanding, and nonverbal behaviors conveying empathy and warmth. 33 Even if they wish to be actively involved, patients with low health literacy may lack sufficient knowledge to adequately understand treatment information 34 and lack the linguis\u00ad tic repertoire to produce elaborat\u00aded, fluent conversational contribu\u00adtions. 35 This fact may explain why the findings of one study indicated that educated patients with breast cancer were more actively commu\u00adnicative in their cancer consulta\u00adtions than were less educated patients. 30 Patients' communicative self-efficacy is also related to their perceptions of greater participation in cancer care consultations. 29 Some patients, especially older patients 36 and patients from Mediterranean and Asian cul\u00adtures, 37 are more likely to prefer passive roles and paternalistic rela\u00adtionships with clinicians. However, there is substantial variability among members of these groups, and it is not clear how fixed their preferences actually are. The quality of the patient-clinician relationship and the de gree of patient participation in cancer con\u00adsultations are inter-related. As an 132 4156-DCC PCC Book End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 133 Appendix A: Communication and Healing Relationships in Cancer Settings example, a patient's greater trust and rapport with his or her clini\u00adcian lead to more openness and a willingness to discuss personal and sensiti ve topics.38 This assertion is supported by observations that black patients often have less trust in physicians and the health care system, which in turn, may be one reason black patients may be more cautious and less engaged in their interactions with clinicians com\u00adpared with white patients. 39 On the other hand, trust may create less of a need for information. 4 A.3 Clinician Self-Awareness and W ell-Being Communication requires for self\u00admonitoring. 40,41 Identification of patients' concerns,42 recognition of changes in clinical status, explo\u00adration of patients' emotions 43 and early recognition of errors44,45 in care all likely depend on clini\u00adcians' ability to be attentive, curi\u00adous, and perceptive. Clinicians' ability to be attentive and percepti ve is related to their own well-being. Clinicians who report burnout or job dissatisfac\u00adtion also report lower quality of clinical care and demonstrate decreased capacity for empathy. 46-55 Correspondingly, clinicians' ability to self-monitor, their availability of means to improve personal well\u00adbeing and job satisfaction, and their ability to derive greater satis\u00adfaction from the patient-clinician relationship have all been noted as possible avenues for improving the quality of care, including commu\u00adnication with patients. A 1990 sur\u00adv ey of physicians identified several means to reduce stress and improve well-being: 56 Self-awareness Sharing of feelings and responsibilities Self-care Development of a personal philosophy Balancing of work and home life However, few of these approaches ha ve been studied formally. Some studies have shown benefit of education and training in self-a wareness, communication skills, and ways to promote well-being. Multiday workshops for oncolo\u00adgists that included self-awareness sessions and communication train\u00ading had a positive impact on burnout and self-rated communica\u00adtion skills. 57,58 A descriptive study of workshops for residents sug\u00adgested that previously unrecog\u00adnized negative attitudes interfered with learning communication skills, and consciously addressing those attitudes facilitated future learning of communication skills. 59 A before-and-after study of an eight-week workshop on stress reduction through the use of medi\u00adtation techniques showed increase in the capacity for empathy in a group of nursing trainees. 52 In qualitative studies, mindfulness and self-monitoring were linked to better conflict-resolution skills 60 and more compassionate hospice care. 61 Personal wellness strategies among oncologists were associated with better job satisf action and a lower rate of burnout.47 In the only study of patients' reports of physi\u00adcians' mindful actions, a survey of 5,000 patients suggested that patient-perceived physician mind\u00adfulness is highly correlated with satisfaction, patient trust in their physicians, and physicians' respect for patients' autonomy. 62 It is clear that research in this area is quite preliminary and in need of further attention. A.4 Implications for Future Study Qualitative data have pointed the way to future quantitative and epi\u00addemiological studies of the patient-clinician relationship. Effective communication and rela\u00adtionships are generally mutually reinforcing. Nevertheless, a strong relationship does not ensure that difficult and emotionally charged issues are managed effectively. The effects of conversation on control of chronic diseases 63,64 have not been studied in cancer settings. In some cases, the per\u00adceived qualities of that relationship may be more important to out\u00adcomes than the specific communi\u00adcation techniques used. Conversely, communication may serve to strengthen the patient-clinician relationship, which, in turn, may have a direct effect on quality of life, adherence to treatment, and control of disease. These mediat\u00ading and recursive influences of patient-clinician relationships on communication warrant further study. 133 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 134 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care References (1) Rose JH.

The first part of this appendix is a review of selected recent litera\u00adture regarding the way informa\u00adtion is managed in general, cen\u00adtering on four themes: patients' information needs, patients' sources of information, informa\u00adtion exchange, and patient recall and understanding. The second part of the appendix addresses two specific areas in which there has been more intense research: communicating bad news and dis\u00ad cussing prognosis. B.1 Patients' Information Needs Patients with cancer seek infor\u00admation about the cause, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and psy\u00adchosocial aspects of their illness, but these needs vary among patients and change over time. 1,2 Although most research has focused on delivery of informa\u00adtion at or shortly after initial diag\u00adnosis, patients' information and education needs persist through\u00adout the cancer care continuum. 3 Attending to patients' information needs is important not only in conveying the facts of the illness to the patient but also in develop\u00ading a strong patient-clinician rela\u00adtionship and improving patients' psychosocial well-being and cop\u00ading abilities. 4,5 Information given to patients with cancer should be tailored to the type and stage of cancer that the y ha ve and should also consider personal character\u00adistics such as age, sex, and cultur\u00adal identification. 6 The availability of information has increased over the past decades, but many patients and family members remain dissatisfied with the infor\u00admation they are given and when they are given it. 7 Researchers have measured the information needs of patients with cancer through the use of self-report surveys, individual inter\u00adviews, and descriptive narratives in qualitative studies. Specific instruments have been developed to identify the general and diagno\u00adsis-specific information needs of patients with cancer. Some, but not all, of the instruments have been validated. The information needs of patients with breast and prostate cancer have been well described, whereas the informa\u00adtion needs of patients with head and neck, lung, colorectal, gyne\u00adcological, and testicular cancers have been less well described. In particular, the information needs of patients with breast cancer have been high. 8,9 Younger patients and those with breast, prostate, gynecological, or testicular cancer reported needing more information regarding sexu\u00adality, sexual functioning, fertility, B *This appendix was also coauthored by Taj Hadee, MD, Departmental Fellow, Instructor of Family Medicine and Instructor of Pediatrics, Departments of Family Medicine and Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. 137 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 138 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care and self-esteem than patients with primary cancers at other sites.8,10-14 Many patients report that sexuali\u00adty has not been adequately addressed 15 and cannot recall any information regarding sexuality given to them by clinicians. 16 About two-thirds of patients with prostate cancer surveyed desired more information pertaining to the effects of brachytherapy on sexual function and on treatment options for erectile dysfunction. 17 Younger patients with prostate cancer have had greater general information needs than their older counterparts. 18 In general, sexuali\u00ad ty was often addressed later in the course of the illness than patients would have preferred. During the treatment phase, patients ha ve valued detailed infor\u00ad mation about their treatment plan, potential side effects, and the potential impact of these on their quality of life. 19-22 Patients with cancer frequently arrive at the con\u00adsultation with expectations of side effects from treatment, 23,24 and such expectations actually increase the likelihood of experiencing those side effects. 24 Accurate information may help to decrease patients' negative experiences and increase their participation in consultations. 23,25 Information on pain management also is often lacking from discus\u00adsions with patients, 26,27 as is infor\u00ad mation regarding possible emo\u00adtional reactions, alternative treat\u00adments, and the long-term effects of cancer treatment. 16 Patients with cancer have used information not only to address their physical needs but to their psychological needs as well. 28 Patients have indicated that their psychosocial information needs are not always adequately addressed by clinicians; if these needs were met, patients may be better able to cope with their ill\u00adnesses. 29-33 In general, the benefits of provid\u00ading patients with information include increased satisfaction with and participation in the con\u00adsultation, decreased anxiety, and increased ability to cope. 34 Patients with cancer often use their information resources not only to understand their disease but to find hope as well. 35,36 When surveyed, more than 80% of patients with cancer said they wanted as much information as possible regarding their cancer diagnosis and treatment options. 16,37 The more information patients received, the more satis\u00adfied they were. 38,39 However, some patients with cancer avoid infor\u00admation as a coping mechanism. 40 Although information-seekers should be given larger amounts of information, doing the same may overwhelm information-avoiding patients. 41 Interestingly, the greater the information needs of patients with cancer, the more anxiety, depression, and psy\u00adchosocial concerns that they tend\u00aded to have. 42 Patients who were more dissatisfied with the infor\u00admation they received tended to have more information-avoiding behaviors. 43 Information needs change over time. 44 At the time of diagnosis, patients may want full disclosure but they may need some time to absorb the details and implica\u00adtions. During the period between diagnosis and treatment, patients often w ant more detailed informa\u00ad tion in discussions of their prog\u00adnosis, treatment options, side effects, and changes to their daily living. After patients have had treatment, the amount of informa\u00adtion they need may be less but the topics\u2014psychosocial issues, reha\u00adbilitation, recovery, and recur\u00adrence\u2014are no less important to them. Barriers to information-gathering ha ve been the source of some frus\u00ad tration for patients with cancer.45 Patients with breast cancer who experienced barriers to accessing information had decreased sense of functional, emotional, social, and family well-being. 46 Patients encountered problems if they were unable to access the information, if they had communication difficulties with their clinicians, if they experi\u00adenced information overload, if they had difficulties with information retention, or if the information they were given was inaccurate. Patients' recall of information is v ariable. Patients especially may not recall discussing psychosocial issues, sexuality, or sexual dysfunc\u00adtion. 16 Patients' ability to understand and retain information may vary depending on the format of the information and how easy it is for them to extract it. 47 Written materi\u00ad als and audio recordings of consul\u00adtations tend to improve recall and are discussed in detail later. 48-51 138 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page Appendix B: Information Exchange in Cancer Care B.2 Patients' Information Sour ces The findings of recent reviews and studies suggest that patients most often used information they received from their clinician and preferred information from this source. 52,53 Generally speaking, patients with cancer continue to believe that their physician is the most highly trusted information source, even though 48% consult\u00aded the Internet before seeing their physician. 53 Print resources are also commonly used,54 but use of this type of material has decreased since the availability of online access to health information. Although information-seeking behavior in general decreases with age, 55 most patients with cancer are particularly interested in informa\u00adtion regarding treatment and side effects. 21,56,57 Whether or not patients are satis\u00adfied with the information that has been presented to them by clini\u00adcians, they often use the Internet to confirm or expand on that infor\u00admation. 58,59 Some cancer centers have created their own educational programs to instruct patients and their family members on how to use the Internet. 60 Although there is concern about the quality of infor\u00admation found on the Internet, 61,62 there is little evidence of adverse outcomes related to inaccurate information from the Internet. Patients with cancer use the Internet not only to obtain general information on a cancer diagnosis and its treatment but to also gain access to other patients with can\u00adcer and support groups where they can share their experiences through electronic mail, blogs, and chat rooms. 63,64 Mass media have played a role in influencing infor\u00admation-gathering, patient-clinician interactions, and decision-making roles of patients. 65,66 Also, adver\u00ad tisements have increased the use of the National Cancer Institute Cancer Information Service by patients with cancer, their families, and the general public. 67,68 Until recently, print information resources have been second only to information obtained from clini\u00adcians. Although the findings of some studies suggest that print materials can have a positive effect on patient recall and satisfaction, 47 others have found that patients with cancer may be satisfied with this information source but it does not appear to have a significant impact on recall. 69 The format of information sheets may affect the usefulness of these materials for patients. 70 Literacy limits the use\u00ad fulness of written materials for large portions of the population. 71-73 Low-literacy print materials or videos help increase patients' knowledge. 74 Telephone help lines can be a use\u00adful source of information and emotional support for patients with cancer. 75,76 The National Cancer Institute Cancer Information Service (CIS) tele\u00adphone help line has provided can\u00adcer information support servic\u00ades 68,77,78 and outreach services for patients with cancer and their families. 79,80 Individuals with a recent cancer diagnosis often use the service to obtain treatment information to prepare for speak\u00ading with their clinician. 81,82 B.3 Information Exchange The goal of information exchange is for patients to understand and to be understood. Clinicians often have a flawed understanding of patients' information needs and consequently do not provide enough information or the kind of information patients find useful. 83-90 Correspondingly, patients do not always immediately disclose sub\u00adstantive information about their symptoms or concerns; clinicians play a key role in helping patients to self-disclose. 1 Clinicians do not always appreciate the complexity of concerns that patients have 91,92 and thus may not explore areas important to their patients. 93 Clinicians overestimate their own informativeness 94 as well as the level of understanding of their patients with cancer. 94,95 While imparting information, clinicians often use medical terms that patients do not understand, and they do not check patient under\u00adstanding. 96,97 Clinicians also may not be aware of their patients' information-seeking and informa\u00adtion-avoiding coping styles and thus may not tailor the manner of information delivery accordingly. The breast cancer literature, in par\u00adticular , includes descriptions of the importance of the flow of informa\u00adtion among clinicians, patients, 98-101 and patients' spouses.102 Patients have viewed sharing information as an attempt to share power and control in the interaction. 103 The 139 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 140 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care literature is sparse about informa\u00ad tion-sharing in the setting of other types of cancer . Patients with prostate cancer have appreciated obtaining as many facts as they could from their clinicians. 104 Among patients with lung cancer, many did not understand their situ\u00adation well enough to make inde\u00adpendent decisions and physicians were not aware of the information gap. 105 Not only do patients with lung cancer express greater satis\u00adfaction with physicians who are informative, they also trust these physicians more than do patients who perceive their physicians as less informative. 106 Given that patients with cancer with more concerns are also more likely to have poorer quality of life, 107,108 clinicians need to engage in behaviors that encourage patients' disclosure of these con\u00adcerns. Patient-centered communi\u00adcation is characterized by effective efforts by clinicians to elicit patients' fears and concerns 109 and encourage more active patient par\u00adticipation in the consultation. 110 Patient-centered communication has been associated with higher patient satisfaction with the clini\u00adcian, and better coping, adherence to treatment, and quality of life in populations with and without can\u00adcer. 111-113 Poor patient-clinician communication has sometimes led to patients' poor understanding of their disease and the process and intent of staging and treatment; as such, they may lose confidence in their medical care team. 114 In one study, patients and family mem\u00adbers generally preferred a patient-centered approach when presented with recordings of dif ferent con\u00ad sultation styles.115 B.4 Patient Recall and Understanding Interventions to improve communi\u00adcation are discussed in Appendix E, but mentioned here are prompt sheets, audio recorded consulta\u00adtions, and patient-held records. Prompt sheets used by patients with cancer can improve their abil\u00adity to gather information during the consultation. 116-119 When physicians addressed concerns on patients' prompt sheets, patients' anxiety decreased and their recall improved. 120 Physicians also said that they thought that prompt sheets stimulated useful discussion. 121 Audio recordings of clinical con\u00adsultations have been helpful for patients' recall and assimilation of information. 48,122,123 Such recordings also increase patient satisfaction51 and may increase their participa\u00adtion at later consultations. 124 Recordings, however, have had inconsistent effects on anxiety and psychological distress in patients. 50,125 Most of the studies on audio recordings were done with initial consultations only; the find\u00adings of some studies have suggest\u00aded that using audio recordings would be beneficial for all consult visits. 122 Physicians have become more accepting of audio recorded consults, 126,127 and although it is unclear if audio recordings can improve physician-patient relation\u00adships, 128 one study demonstrated that they led to increased patient participation in the clinical encounter .124 Giving patients access to their own medical information (in the form of patient-held records, patient information files, or log books) has helped patients and clinicians communicate more efficiently with one another. 129-131 B.5 Implications for Future Study Information needs, information resources, patient recall, and patient-clinician information exchange are all areas that require further study. The limitations of many of the studies to date have been that they have involved small sample sizes; patients with a limit\u00aded number of types of cancer; few minority, non-English speaking, and low-literacy patients; and a focus on the initial phases of the illness. The information needs of patients with forms of cancer other than breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer warrant additional explo\u00adration. Further longitudinal studies may help track patients' informa\u00adtion needs over time and patients' recall and understanding of the information provided to them. Lastly, cancer survivors will need better sources of information about rehabilitation, surveillance for recurrence, and late effects. B.6 Communicating Bad News Communicating bad news has been the subject of some of the earliest cancer communication research. Although no communica\u00ad 140 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 141 Appendix B: Information Exchange in Cancer Care tion intervention will take away the life-changing impact of a can\u00adcer diagnosis, effective delivery of bad news can result in patients who are the following: Better informed More motivated to follow through with further e valua\u00ad tion and treatment Less emotionally distressed Better able to ask questions and participate in the clinical encounter Better prepared to make treat\u00ad ment decisions Better able to navigate the health care system Clear about the level of uncer\u00ad tainty of the diagnosis However, the authors of a recent re view concluded that despite a large body of literature with seem\u00adingly sensible recommendations for delivering bad news and an increas\u00ading number of courses to train stu\u00addents and residents, the delivery of bad news continues to be stressful for clinicians and ineffective and/or traumatic for patients. 132 Clinician-related factors in communicating bad news Beginning physicians, residents, and medical students often deli ver diagnostic information without having had training or support in the task. 133,134 Most physicians were untrained in communicating bad news at the time they were first required to deliver it, and many report having felt overwhelmed and traumatized by their early e xperiences.134 Clinicians may know how they should deliver bad news but do not follow through because of their own discomfort, fear and anxiety, 135,136 and lack of forums to deal with their own feel\u00adings. Correspondingly, it is not surprising that patient reports of cold, impersonal, blunt, evasive, tactless, indirect, jargon-laden, and poorly timed delivery of news still appear in the popular press and the medical literature. Clinicians' actions may favor their needs to reduce their own anxiety and uncertainty and bring the visit to closure rather than address the needs of patients. 137 Patient-related factors in communicating bad news Communication at the bad news visit is af fected by patient-related psychological factors, cognitive functioning, and health literacy. Patients report that they felt upset or overwhelmed anticipating devas\u00adtating news or after hearing it, mak\u00ading assimilation and recall of addi\u00adtional information difficult. Patients may function at a much lower cog\u00adnitive level when they are critically ill than when they are well. 138 Low health literacy may lead to confu\u00adsion; for example, the word \"posi\u00adtive\" may connote something good to a patient unfamiliar with the reporting of test results. 72 Social, cultural, and family-related factors in communicating bad news Culture, social distance between clinician and patient, and relation\u00adships between the patient and f am\u00ad ily members play important roles in the communication of bad news and prognoses. In many Mediterranean, Latin American, black African, and Asian cultures, it is still common for clinicians to disclose cancer diagnoses to family members and not the patient. 139-142 Although younger patients increas\u00adingly say that they want informa\u00adtion, it is also common for even these patients to relinquish some control to family members. There is controversy about how to recon\u00adcile views about patient rights and autonomy as articulated in main\u00adstream Anglo-Saxon culture with the views and values of individuals from other cultures. It is often rec\u00adommended that the patient should initially be given the choice about what they wish to know; the con\u00adsequences of this approach have not been studied. The diagnosis of cancer is often delayed in racial and ethnic minorities and indi viduals of low socioeconomic status.143-149 One factor affecting this delay is a rel\u00adative lack of trust and therefore less open communication between black patients and white clini\u00adcians compared with racially con\u00adcordant pairs. 150 Further research can clarify whether providing eas\u00adily understood information in the context of a trusting relationship when cancer is first suspected 141 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 142 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care will lead to earlier completion of diagnostic testing and initiation of treatment. Health care system-related factors in communicating bad news Health care system-related barriers to timely and conf idential provi\u00ad sion of bad news include disconti\u00adnuity of care, lack of access, lack of a private space, and environ\u00admental noise. Scheduling of same-day face-to-face meetings is diffi\u00adcult within most health care sys\u00adtems. Because of this, when patients want to know test results as soon as possible, it is often nec\u00adessary for clinicians to communi\u00adcate with patients by telephone\u2014a method that both agree is subopti\u00admal. When bad news is communi\u00adcated by phone, other members of the health care team may be unaware of what has already been discussed with the patient. 151 Team- related issues have rarely been the subject of empirical studies. Effect of poor delivery of bad news on patients Poor delivery of bad news appears to ha ve important effects on patients' subsequent coping and anxiety. 132 However, it is unclear whether following recommended methods for delivering bad news affects satisfaction, knowledge, ability to make decisions, or fol\u00adlow-though with care. Further research can determine the optimal balance and degree of flexibility needed in the elicitation of patient perspectives, provision of informa\u00adtion, and reassurance that the patient is receiving the best care and emotional support. Fe w longi\u00ad tudinal studies of patient satisfac\u00adtion with the delivery of bad news have been conducted; clearly, the immediate impact of bad news and later reflection may be different. Training for clinicians The curriculum at many medical schools in the United States no w includes sessions on giving bad news. Intensive training courses of several days' length designed to help residents and clinicians improve their skills in communi\u00adcating bad news have a lasting impact on skills, 152,153 but the majority of less intensive courses have been evaluated only in terms of satisfaction of participants and intention to use the learned skills. 132 The exploration of clinicians' emo\u00adtions is a key feature of effective training courses. Future research can identify other key elements, with the hope of accomplishing training using less intensive and more cost-effective interventions. Training for patients In medical encounters not involv\u00ad ing cancer , training, guidance, or information for patients in antici\u00adpation of a clinician visit has shown promise in improving the outcomes of the consultation. 154,155 Patient interventions, including decision aids and prompt sheets, have been used to help patients decide about cancer screening. 156 However, there have been no stud\u00adies about interventions for patients undergoing diagnostic testing for cancer with the possibility of bad ne ws. In planning future research, the AIDS literature may be instructive. Guidelines for counsel\u00ading before HIV testing include suggestions for anticipating and managing anxiety, discussing how the diagnosis might affect the patient's life, legal ramifications, and social support. 157 Implications for future study of communicating bad news Although there is a substantial body of descripti ve, attitudinal, and intervention literature on the delivery of bad news, several issues remain unstudied, including the following: Long-term impact of different types of deli very Patient satisfaction with the timing and manner of commu\u00adnication Management of patients' anxiety follo wing the initial disclosure of bad news Role of family members in such discussions Means of reducing physicians' anxiety so that such discus\u00adsions can flo w more openly. Studies of delivery of news of tumor progression after remission and treatment f ailure are also needed. The impact of communi\u00adcation among clinicians caring for the same patients and health care system factors on the delivery of consistent information are poorly understood. 142 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 143 Appendix B: Information Exchange in Cancer Care B.7 Communicating Prognosis Delivery of bad news is closely linked with the discussion of prog\u00adnosis. Information on prognosis helps patients make choices among treatment options, plan their lives, and receive optimal palliative care. Communicating prognosis, thus, depends on the physician's ability to estimate the expected lifespan of patients with cancer, the patients' desire to know the prognosis, and the physician's willingness to disclose the true prognosis. Considering the goals of information exchange, clini\u00adcians discussing prognosis with patients and families must choose what to disclose, when disclosure should occur, how to disclose prognostic information, and to whom the information should be disclosed. Much of what follows here is a summary of the re view by Hagerty et al.158 of studies pub\u00ad lished before 2004, in which those authors suggested important themes in discussing prognosis with patients. Most of the studies reviewed had involved patients with early stage cancer and focused on the initial diagnosis and treatment decisions. The largest number of studies has been conducted in Australia, with the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and continental Europe also represented. Given large cultural differences among English-speaking, Mediterranean, and Asian cultures in discussing prognosis, and perhaps differences within the English-speaking world, many of these findings need further investigation to deter\u00admine their generalizability . Frequency of discussion Data on the frequency of discus\u00ad sions of prognosis is mix ed and difficult to compare across popula\u00adtions. 158 In one study, most patients with breast cancer knew their prognosis, 159 but more recent stud\u00ad ies of patients with melanoma and advanced cancer indicate other\u00adwise, 137,160,161 suggesting that uncer\u00ad tain or serious prognoses are with\u00adheld more often. There appears to be both a norm of silence 161 and a norm of vagueness162 among physi\u00ad cians, patients, and caregivers in which euphemisms and discus\u00adsions of treatment plans overshad\u00adow more frank discussions of diffi\u00adcult topics. When discussions of prognosis do occur, they are usually initiated by physicians. 163 What patients want to know In responding to surveys, patients tend to endorse w anting informa\u00ad tion about prognosis44,97,137,164-168 and value clear and straightforward presentations of data. However, in a study in the United States in which additional details about patients' preferences were sought, many patients expressed reserva\u00adtions and qualifications about uni\u00adversal disclosure of quantitative survival estimates and many pre\u00adferred qualitative rather than quan\u00adtitative estimates; 168,169 surveys of patients in Australia have shown no preference. 170 Patients' views may be ambivalent and inconsis\u00adtent. They may reinforce physician avoidance by suggesting that they w ant full information but did not want to know about a \"bad prog\u00adnosis.\" 169 Even among patients receiving palliative care only 55% of patients in the United States wished to have discussed life expectancy with their physicians, 169 and only 59% of patients in Australia wanted to know their prognosis at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. 170 Many patients preferred to be asked what information they wanted before it was disclosed and also wanted to be asked when the disclosure should take place. 170 Patients with depression appeared more interest\u00aded in knowing the most dire possi\u00adbilities, whereas patients who were not depressed were more likely to want information about the maxi\u00admal possible survival or wanted no information at all. 170 Anxious patients, however, generally avoid\u00aded discussions about prognosis and were more likely to prefer that cli\u00adnicians disclose that information to family members. 168,171 The findings of studies involving convenience samples suggest that women tend to want more information than men do, 166 but these findings were not adjusted for actual expected prog\u00adnosis. Most studies were conduct\u00aded considering preferences without necessarily considering the context and nature of the patient-clinician relationship. It may be that the nature of the communication process also influences patients' preferences and responses and should be studied in greater depth. 143 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 144 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care What physicians believe that patients should know While physicians usually provide accurate, complete information to patients about their diagnosis and treatment options, physicians still commonly ha ve difficulty provid\u00ad ing prognostic information for sev\u00aderal reasons. First, physicians' prospective estimates of prognosis are usually more favorable than indicated by the actual course of the disease. 172 Second, although the vast majority of physicians favor truth-telling, many feel uncomfort\u00adable about discussing dire prog\u00adnoses 173 and intentionally exagger\u00ad ate prognoses when communicat\u00ading with patients and families. 174 Correspondingly, patients fre\u00adquently report not knowing their prognosis 95,175 or overestimate their prognosis, even when provided accurate information. 95,105,176-182 In these studies, higher educational level, lower levels of depression, and higher patient ratings of their physician were associated with better understanding, but further research is needed to examine causal relationships among these factors. Participants in discussions of prognosis Some literature exists on family in volvement in cancer care, but lit\u00ad tle has been written explicitly about sharing of prognostic infor\u00admation. 170 Although most patients prefer to have a family member present during discussions of prog\u00adnosis, 164,171 patients do want control over the information that family members receive.169 Moreover, when caregivers have prognostic information first, they may be reluctant to share it with patients. 183 One study found that disclosure of prognosis to family members first and using euphemisms diminished a patient's hope. 35 Disparities in provision of prognostic information has been a concern. Although most studies suggest that white patients of high\u00ader socioeconomic status tend to get more information than poor black patients, one qualitative study sug\u00adgested the opposite outcome with regard to prognosis; poorer and nonwhite populations reported having more discussions of prog\u00adnosis. 184 The results of several studies sug\u00adgest that patients get information about prognosis from several members of the health care team, and that such information may be complementary or sometimes hap\u00adhazard 151 and contradictory. In one study, an organized team approach, in which the patient presumably received well-coordinated informa\u00adtion increased patients' under\u00adstanding of their illness, including prognosis. 185 Our understanding of specifically how teams can improve understanding and recall of prognostic information is limit\u00aded, however. Elements of effective discussions of prognosis Although most studies focus on the content of discussions of prog\u00adnosis, patients frequently suggest that the manner of presenting the information and the relationship with their clinicians is equally important. In qualitati ve studies, patients reported that they valued communication of information within clinical contexts in which they felt known, connected, and acknowledged. 186 Communicating clinical evidence is challenging, raising questions about framing, use of visual aids, and communication of risk. 187 Patient and clinician understanding of statistics may be limited, and misunderstandings about median or mean survival may lead to over\u00adly concrete interpretations. 97,167 Graphical displays are increasingly used to improve patient under\u00adstanding of statistical data, but the findings of at least one survey sug\u00adgested that patients preferred words to pictures. 170 In that study, however, health literacy was not assessed. Patients tended to favor framing estimates in positive terms (survival) rather than in terms of mortality. Use of a mix of positive (survival) and negative (mortality) language may enhance understand\u00ading. Other recommendations from the literature conform to principles of general patient-centered com\u00admunication skills and have few elements specific to cancer com\u00admunication or prognosis: summa\u00adrizing and checking understanding, active listening, privacy, adequate time, and honesty. 35 Increasingly, the Internet and patient advocacy organizations provide more ready access to prognostic information. Until recently, no studies have been con\u00adducted on reconciling physicians 144 4156-DCC PCC Book 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 145 Appendix B: Information Exchange in Cancer Care as a source of prognostic informa\u00ad tion with other sources. Patients, however, choose to discuss this information with their physicians on the basis of trust and need to resolve uncertainty. 188 Although most patients though that contra\u00addictory information would not undermine their trust in their physicians, a significant minority felt that it might. Those patients also tended to express that there was one correct answer to the question and reported discomfort with uncertain or contradictory primary data. Patient access to pri\u00admary data on prognosis and ways to discuss this data effectively with health professionals is an impor\u00adtant area for future research. The communication of hope is fre\u00adquently encountered in the conte xt of the discussion of prognosis.189 However, patients' experience of hope is related both to the process of communication as well as to the content of communication. Providing up-to-date information, answering questions, and offering emotional support are often seen as engendering hope, whereas a cold, impersonal clinical style appear to diminish hope. 190 This finding implies that frank and honest dis\u00adcussion of prognosis need not diminish hope if it is conducted in a patient-centered manner. In some situations, the dialogue on hope appears detrimental to the discus\u00adsion of prognosis. 191 Some patients think that the burden of maintain\u00ading the appearance of a \"fighting spirit\" limits discussions of their fears and concerns, including about prognosis and quality of life. Cultural factors As with the disclosure of bad ne ws, patients and physicians from Anglo-Saxon cultures favor disclo\u00adsure, whereas individuals in other cultures do not. 158 However, there is significant change in some areas. Family members may take a more primary role in information exchange in Mediterranean and Asian cultures compared with Anglo-Saxons. In Spain, 192 for example, over the past 10 years, there has been a radical shift from nondisclosure to disclosure. Relevant to settings in the United States, however, is recognition that several factors could contribute to patients' desires for information about prognosis, including culture of origin, health literacy, educa\u00adtional level, prior illness experi\u00adences, and degree of cultural assimilation. Generalizations can be made on population levels, but they may not apply to individual patients; clinicians must be pre\u00adpared to inquire about individual beliefs and values. We have not encountered any published work suggesting how the level of a clini\u00adcian's cultural awareness affects discussions of prognosis. Outcomes of discussions of prognosis Few outcome studies have separat\u00ad ed discussions of prognosis from discussions of bad ne ws or other aspects of cancer care. The results of studies that have been published suggest associations between recalled discussion of prognosis and increased satisfaction, as well as lower levels of depression, anxi\u00adety , and hope. Compelling qualita\u00ad tive data suggest that toxic effects of intentional deceit can lead to heightened anxiety and distrust. 193 However, there is disagreement whether collusion should be bro\u00adken down quickly 194 rather than maintaining \"necessary collusion\" temporarily 195 to soften the blow (by delaying disclosure until it can be more easily assimilated). The cross-sectional design and plausi\u00adble bidirectional causality make it difficult to draw conclusions from the current literature. Future research on the relationship between discussions of prognosis and quality of life is needed. We are aware of no interventions designed specif ically to improve the delivery of prognostic informa\u00adtion. However, inference might be drawn from intensive workshops to improve delivery of bad news, which have enhanced clinicians' communication skills for at least 12 months following the interven\u00adtion. 152,153 The most important inter\u00ad vention in the United States was a large randomized trial for patients with a prognosis of no more than six months. 196 Specially trained research nurses provided informa\u00adtion about the disease, treatment, and prognosis, convened individ\u00adual and family meetings, and dis\u00adcussed and documented patient and family preferences with the goal of improving communication about advance directives, improv\u00ading pain control, and lessening the likelihood that patients would receive unwanted intensive care. The trial yielded completely nega\u00ad 145 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 146 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care tive results for all outcome meas\u00ad ures, including communication. The lar ge body of literature that has attempted to explain and learn from this trial indicates that inter\u00adventions must focus on patient-cli\u00adnician relationships and involve repeated contact and reinforcement in order to be effective. 197 Implications for future study of communicating prognosis Physician optimism and reluctance to paint a grim picture, along with patients' highly variable desire to hear complete prognostic informa\u00adtion, create a complex set of fac\u00adtors to consider in discussions of prognosis. Communicating statisti\u00adcal information is challenging especially with patients of low health literacy and low numeracy; there is very little empirical research to draw on in determining how best to communicate clinical evidence with these patients. Research should also address cul\u00adtural values and beliefs and family issues. Patients need hope, but it is not known the degree to which skilled clinicians can provide hopeful messages without distort\u00ading prognostic information. Studies to date have addressed only parts of this complex picture, which may explain failure of even large innovative studies to improve communication about prognosis and advance care planning.

Patients expe\u00adrience and often express a variety of emotions in their interactions with clinicians, including fear, 1 humor,2,3 nervousness, worry or sadness, or fatalistic thinking.4,5 It is particularly important to understand the factors that lead to recognition of and response to patients' emotional states, given their potential effect on treatment outcomes. Depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders have a major effect on quality of life. 6-11 In addition, depression has been found to influence responses to chemotherapy, risk of death, 12 and experience of pain.13 Anxiety has been shown to be a predictor of clinical response to treatment. 12 Early recognition of depression and anxiety is crucial for reducing the risk of suicide and social isola\u00adtion and for initiating pharmaco\u00adlogical and psychological treat\u00adments that improve quality of life. Most patients with cancer who have mental disorders have adjust\u00adment disorders and not major depression or severe anxiety disor\u00adders. 9 Recognition of these disor\u00adders may lead to mobilizing social support 14 and psychotherapeutic interventions that could improve quality of life and perhaps increase the likelihood that cancer treat\u00adment would be completed. However, the diagnosis of depres\u00adsi ve and anxiety disorders is often missed in oncology practice. The findings of one large study demon\u00adstrated that emotional distress was recognized by physicians in 29% of affected patients, 15 and results of another study showed that oncolo\u00adgists correctly identified 17% of patients who were found to be anx\u00adious and 6% of those who were found to be depressed on a stan\u00addardized anxiety and depression scale. 16 Communication barriers influence the diagnosis of mental illness, 17-21 and some issues are par\u00ad ticularly salient in the cancer set\u00adting. Many common symptoms of depression are also symptoms associated with cancer or its treat\u00adment, including fatigue, lack of energy, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Thus, clinicians must rely to a greater degree on elicitation of the patient's emotional state and maintain the possibility that these physical symptoms may also signi\u00adfy underlying depression. Research to date on the role of emotion in cancer care primarily has focused on three issues: the psychological benef its of patient expression of emotion during the C 155 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 156 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care consultation, how clinicians respond to patients' emotional state, and emotional well-being as an outcome of patient-clinician communication. C.1 Benefits of Patients' Emotional Expr ession Patients who share their emotions and feelings during medical con\u00adsultations often experience thera\u00adpeutic benefits. The use of humor has been found to decrease stress, increase comfort levels, and restore immune function. 2,3 Patient narratives about their illness expe\u00adrience help to decrease emotional distress. 22 Conversely, patients who restrain the expression of their negative emotions may become more anxious, depressed, and con\u00adfused after receiving a cancer diag\u00adnosis. 23 Disclosing emotions may even contribute to improvements in physical symptoms. 24 The writ\u00ad ten disclosure of emotion can also buffer the negative effects of the inadequacy of social support. 25 Although emotional expression can have positive benefits, patients appear to vary in the kind and manner of emotions expressed. For example, humor in consultations can be either positive or negative. Patients with testicular cancer have reported that humor in the consul\u00adtation can dispel tension and make them feel \"normal,\" but, if such humor is managed poorly, it can be a source of humiliation or stigma. 26 Just as disclosing emotions may have cathartic effects, failing to disclose emotions may hurt emo\u00adtional processing. Patients may fail to disclose fears because of low social support, lo w emotional well\u00ad being, or the belief that the clini\u00adcian is not responsible for helping with emotional concerns. 11,27 Undisclosed fear can cause patients to underreport their difficulties with cancer to their clinicians. 28 In one study, the worry of appearing disrespectful to clinicians caused some patients to withhold their feelings about wanting to reconsid\u00ader decisions about treatment. 29 C.2 Clinicians' Responsiveness to Patients' Emotional States Most patients with cancer respond favorably when clinicians are receptive and interested in their emotional states and well-being. In one study of patients terminally ill with cancer, the patients perceived their clinicians more positively when they offered more emotional support. 5 In another study, oncolo\u00ad gists' affective tone and socioemo\u00adtional behaviors were associated with greater patient satisfaction. 30 Facilitating patients' emotional processing helped them to partici\u00adpate more effectively in making decisions about palliative care. 31 Because cancer also has a signifi\u00adcant emotional impact on patients' family members, clinicians may need to help families address their own emotional distress and experi\u00adences. 32 Clinicians typically are not effec\u00adtive at recognizing patients' emo\u00adtional cues or at uncovering their fears and concerns, although some clinicians may be minimally receptive to patients' emotional expressions. 1,33 Clinicians' difficulty in recognizing emotional cues may, in part, be related to Patients' ten\u00addency to articulate concerns that are informational rather than emotion\u00adal in nature 34 and to disclose physi\u00ad cal symptoms rather than psycho\u00adlogical problems. 35 Adding to the difficulty is that the patients who are the most anxious or depressed are often the least likely to disclose their emotional concerns. 35 The findings of one study found that nurses were not accurate in identi\u00adfying patients' concerns and most could not even identify the patient's three primary concerns. 36 Nurses were biased toward concerns about physical symptoms and medical treatment compared with emotion\u00adal and other psychosocial issues. The lack of communication skills, time, and a quiet pri vate environ\u00ad ment in hospital settings appear to be barriers to clinicians' validation of and responsiveness to patients' emotions. 37 With respect to skills, the findings of several studies demonstrate that educational inter\u00adventions could help clinicians become more adept at addressing the patient's emotional needs. 38,39 Clinicians can elicit the fears and concerns of patients with cancer more effectively with use of patient-centered communication tactics such as open-ended ques\u00adtions, focusing on and clarifying psychological issues, and empathic statements. 18 In contrast, disclosure is less likely when clinicians use leading questions, focus on physi\u00adcal aspects of health, and prema\u00adturely move into giving advice and reassurance. 156 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 157 Appendix C: Recognizing and Responding to Emotional Distress in Cancer Consultations It is important to recognize that the relationship between patient-clinician communication and patients' emotional states can be quite complex. The body of litera\u00adture in this area is small and most of the studies have focused on patient-clinician communication during the survivorship phase, with emphasis on the management of anxiety related to uncertainty and on the process of reassurance. Cancer survivors with disease in clinical remission are often anx\u00adious and present physical symp\u00adtoms that clinicians interpret as requests for reassurance. However, in other settings, clinicians' expression of reassurance to patients without obvious disease can sometimes heighten the patients' anxiety. 40-42 In one of the few studies of reassurance, Stark et al. 43 reported, not surprisingly, that in more than 90% of posttreat\u00adment oncology visits, clinicians attempted to provide reassurance, either spontaneously, or, more commonly, in response to patient-reported physical symptoms. These attempts at reassurance often produced initial lowering of the anxiety level followed by para\u00addoxical worsening of anxiety. Spontaneous reassurance (\"you look well\") increased anxiety in the most anxious patients before their next scheduled visit, and offering a treatment plan without explanation raised the level of anx\u00adiety in all patients within one week after the consultation, regardless of the baseline anxiety level. Moreover, providing reassurance may worsen outcomes if it appears to avoid the focus of the patient's anxiety or is offered before the patient can e xpress his or her con\u00ad cerns. The imperative to reduce anxiety may also drive diagnostic testing, some of which is not med\u00adically indicated, in an attempt to provide reassurance. If extrapola\u00adtions from studies of populations without cancer hold, 41,42,44 clini\u00ad cians' reporting of normal test results may provide only tempo\u00adrary reduction of anxiety. In con\u00adtrast, providing simple reassurance while offering clear explanations has a more neutral effect on anxi\u00adety. 43 Through effective communi\u00ad cation, clinicians can contribute at least temporarily to a transient decrease of patient anxiety, but the long-term effects of communica\u00adtion on anxiety in cancer survivors are unknown. C.3 Emotional Well-Being as an Outcome of Patient-Clinician Communication In the previous sections, we exam\u00ad ined patients' emotional expres\u00adsions and clinicians' but other ele\u00adments of patient-clinician commu\u00adnication can also influence the affective states of patients with cancer following the consultation. For example, the way clinicians manage information can have a significant effect on patient emo\u00adtions. Research has shown that less anxiety and depression were expe\u00adrienced by children with cancer in the initial stages when clinicians were open about the diagnosis and prognosis. 45 Information about diagnosis may lead to greater hope, although the time between diagnosis and disclosure may moderate that relationship. 46 These findings are consistent with those of other studies in which patients' perceptions of being told \"every\u00adthing\" led to an increase in patient satisfaction. 47 Clinicians' communication style can directly influence patients' emotional well-being. For exam\u00adple, the degree to which patients perceive their clinicians' commu\u00adnication as patient-centered and facilitative may decrease postcon\u00adsultation anxiety, although this relationship was weaker for patients with more advanced dis\u00adease. 48 Communication that can help reduce anxiety included preparing the patient for diagnosis, giving the patient clear informa\u00adtion, providing written informa\u00adtion, discussing questions and feel\u00adings, encouraging the patient to be involved in decision-making, and being reassuring. 47 Additionally, compassionate communication and empathy from clinicians also may play a role in reducing patient anx\u00adiety and emotional distress. 49,50 Other variables that may affect patients' emotions after the consul\u00adtation visit revolve around the patient's participation in decision-making. As patients participate in treatment decisions, they may feel more anxiety regarding their responsibility in the outcome of that treatment. However, if patients are more satisfied with their increased level of involvement, then increased patient participation is associated with reduced emo\u00adtional distress. 50 157 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 158 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care C.4 Implications for Future Study Eliciting, acknowledging, normal\u00ad izing, and empathizing with patients' emotional expressions have positive effects on patients' subsequent functioning and quality of life. Yet, clinicians rarely engage patients in discussions about their fears and worries. Emotional dialogue is embedded in other communication activities such as exchanging information, making decisions, and providing access to care, yet the interface of instrumental and affective commu\u00adnication is poorly understood. For example, is patient involvement in decisions facilitated by emotional dialogue and understanding, not just the provision of information and choices? Interventions to improve emotional responsiveness in clinicians have been successful in small-scale studies, but future research should identify and over\u00adcome barriers to participation in these interventions and provide means for sustaining the positive effects.

Decisions to screen for specif\u00adic cancers arise when there is a choice of screening method (such as for colorectal cancer screening) or debate about the o verall value of screening (such as with prostate cancer screening). Decisions about treatment arise when several treat\u00adment options are available and no single option is best for all patients (as often occurs with breast can\u00adcer). At the end of life, decisions involve discontinuing anticancer treatment, advance directives, treat\u00adment setting (including hospice), and assisted suicide. Decision aids are included in the discussion on interventions in Appendix E. D.1 Decision-Making in the Scr eening Phase Cancer screening programs\u2014 specifically those designed to detect breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal cancer\u2014aim to sort asymptomatic people who ha ve cancer from those who do not. Increasingly, efforts have been made to promote informed deci\u00adsion-making on the part of the health care consumer and the clini\u00adcian when discussing and evaluat\u00ading screening options. Decision-making about screening often involves complex personalized dis\u00adcussions with eligible individuals about the risks and benefits of screening procedures. Communication about Risk Screening programs and clinicians v ary in how they communicate, especially the degree to which they promote informed decision-mak\u00ading with eligible individuals. A 2002 Cochrane review addressed the effects of personalized versus general risk communication on individuals' decisions about whether to participate in health screening programs. 1 The specific goal of that review was to see whether personalized communica\u00adtion about risk for disease influ\u00adenced any of several possible out\u00adcomes. Personalized communica\u00adtion was defined as information tailored to an individual's personal history or medical conditions that affect his or her risk of cancer. Personalized risk communication varies in detail and complexity as D *This appendix was also co authored by Jennifer Carroll, MD, MPH, Research Assistant Professor, Department of Family Medicine and James P .

The outcomes were categorized into the following groups: Behavioral, such as actual receipt of a screening test or adherence to choice re garding screening Cognitive, such as knowledge of risk or accurate risk perception Affective, such as anxiety, emotional well-being, satisf ac\u00ad tion with decision made, or decisional conflict domains The review included randomized controlled trials of people who were in volved with \"real life deci\u00ad sions\" about whether to undergo screening, studies in which there was a risk communication infor\u00admation component to the interven\u00adtion, studies that addressed deci\u00adsion-making about screening pro\u00adgrams, and studies that included any of the aforementioned out\u00adcome measures. Of the 13 hetero\u00adgeneous identified studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review, 10 addressed personalized risk communication related to breast cancer screening and one each, to cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening. Only some studies incorporated patient-clinician communication; others focused on mass media and tai\u00adlored communication interven\u00adtions. In the six studies in which the intervention included a compo\u00adnent of counseling (usually a health educator or graduate stu\u00addent) , the participants' accuracy of risk perception and use of appropriate cancer screening serv\u00adices usually increased. There was no evidence that this increase in uptake of services was due to informed decision-making. An interesting finding was that if the personalized information was more detailed or numerically spe\u00adcific relative to the patient's own risk, there was less receipt of can\u00ad cer screening than when the infor\u00admation was provided in a more general way. Patient involvement and postconsultation outcomes Studies on decision-making about screening thus f ar have primarily focused on breast cancer compared with other types of cancer. The studies have tended to include only a limited number of outcomes, usually, the actual receipt of screening services. Knowledge of the processes by which communi\u00adcation and decision-making informs other screening-related outcomes remains limited, yet these other outcomes may also be responsive to change. Effect modi\u00adfiers (such as high risk status) may also contribute to decision-making regarding cancer screening and detection. Research published since 2002 has involved examina\u00adtion of aspects of communication and decision-making processes about screening for types of cancer other than breast cancer) and have also included diverse populations. More recent studies have yielded additional information about com\u00admunication and decision-making about screening for colorectal can\u00adcer . In a qualitative study of mem\u00ad bers of an African American church in rural North Carolina, 2 the quality of the communication with their physicians influenced patients' decisions to undergo col\u00adorectal cancer screening. In a larg\u00ader cross-sectional survey (397 indi\u00adviduals) following the qualitative phase of the study, participants who reported that they had good communication with their clinician were more likely to have been screened (36%) according to the recommended guidelines than were participants reporting poor com\u00admunication (17%). The strongest predictors of colorectal cancer screening or intent to complete screening among individuals with low income included higher base\u00adline risk of disease, self-efficacy, and recall of physician recommen\u00addation. 3 This finding was further explored by Manne et al.,4 who collected data from 534 siblings of individuals diagnosed with col\u00adorectal cancer and found that physician support, family support, and cancer-related distress were related to perceived benefits of screening. In another study, the desired and actual le vels of patient control over decisions regarding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening were examined. 5 Both before and after visits, patients expressed a preference for a shared approach to the actual decision. The study focused on decision-making out\u00adcomes and role preferences when encountering differing communi\u00ad 162 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 Page 163 Appendix D: Decision-Making in Cancer Care cation styles and media. The inter\u00ad vention included different scripted communication (\"discussion\") ele\u00adments. The participants wanted to share decision-making more than they had, yet the actual decision was shifted toward greater patient control. Twenty-five percent of men reported having greater deci\u00ad sional control over the PSA test than they had wanted, and 30% of men who wanted a shared approach made the decision themselves. The findings of another study 6 demon\u00ad strated that the rate of PSA screen\u00ading decreased from 98% to 50% when information was given with greater intensity and through a higher number of media (in per\u00adson, video, etc.). Correlates of patients' decision pref erences Another line of research has in volved evaluation of the role that belief systems and sociocultural characteristics play in decision-making about cancer screening. Among black women, for exam\u00adple, those who had had mammog\u00adraphy were more likely to report having had recent contact with a physician; not surprisingly, they tended to believe that screening should be done annually and that early detection improves outcomes. 7 In a study about barriers to screen\u00ading in rural Appalachia, 8 physicians identified such barriers as time constraints and conflicting guide\u00adlines. Physicians' perceptions that patients do not value prevention had a negative impact on commu\u00adnication about cancer screening. Implications for future study The focus of studies thus far has been on risk communication and role preferences for decision-mak\u00ading about cancer screening rather than the de velopment of a trusting relationship, clinician responsive\u00adness to patients' concerns, and understanding of the patients' views. Future work on decision-making in cancer screening needs to explore other outcomes, such as the cognitive and affective path\u00adways of decision-making, rather than measuring only the receipt of screening service. Also, measures or tools to assess decision-making, rather than just personalized risk communication per se, are needed. The association between more detailed information and lower uptake of screening services is a curious finding that deserves fur\u00adther study, suggesting there may be a \"dose-response\" relationship to information about personalized risk and intention or receipt of cancer screening services. Perhaps more detailed communication about the relationship between one's personal risk and population-wide benefits of cancer screening may attenuate one's sense of per\u00adsonal need to undergo screening, given the marginal personal gain. Thus, increasing the communica\u00adtion may have the paradoxical effect of lowering an individual's use of cancer screening services. Other poorly characterized factors may also be effect modifiers on decision-making about cancer screening. D.2 Decision-Making in the T reatment Phase High-stakes decisions about treat\u00adment choices that are either reversible (such as initiation of chemotherapy) or irrevocable (such as mastectomy vs. lumpectomy) dominate the cancer communica\u00adtion literature. The most difficult decisions are those that involve tradeoffs between quantity and quality of life and those that involve small but statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes. Patient preferences for in volvement in decision-making The findings of surveys of patients with cancer re garding their prefer\u00ad ences for involvement in treatment decisions suggest that patients' wishes are often difficult to predict and that they change over time. Some studies have indicated that most patients prefer an active or collaborative role, 9-13 and other studies have demonstrated that patients generally prefer the physi\u00adcian to make the final treatment decisions. 14-16 More importantly, evidence suggests that patient pref\u00aderences are affected by a number of factors. In cancer care, one of the key factors is the severity of illness. Patients who are sicker and/ or more distressed generally prefer to relinquish control of decisions to clinicians. 17,18 Patients who are older and less educated also are more likely to prefer paternalistic decision-making models, whereas younger and more educated patients desire more active and collaborative roles. 14,18-21 In one 163 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 164 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care study, women were more likely than men to prefer shared deci\u00adsion-making with the physician. 22 However, there was more hetero\u00adgeneity within groups than between them. Although a patient's health literacy has not been clearly linked to patient pref\u00aderences for involvement, it is relat\u00aded to their ability to actively par\u00adticipate in these interactions, 23,24 an issue discussed later. The wide variation in patients' preferences re garding involvement in decision-making has prompted some investigators to call for tai\u00adlored approaches to assessing patient preferences. 9,25 Support for this position is found in several studies that have indicated that a substantial number of patients with cancer do not achieve their desired level of participation in the deci\u00adsion-making process. 15,18 Butow26 found that most patients with breast cancer did not obtain their preferred level of involvement (29% and 37% were more and less involved than preferred, respec\u00adtively). Patients who had a mis\u00admatch on preferred and actual involvement expressed greater anxiety following the consultation. Physicians are not particularly good judges of patient prefer\u00adences 9,27 nor do patients and physi\u00ad cians perceive the decision-making process in the same way (e.g., shared or physician control 12). Patient involvement and postconsultation outcomes A number of studies have been conducted to e xamine the relation\u00adships between the decision-making in volvement of patients with can\u00ad cer and a variety of postconsulta\u00adtion outcomes. The authors of early studies reported that simply offering patients with breast cancer a choice for initial treatment (e.g., breast removal or breast conserva\u00adtion) was correlated with a short-term reduction in depression and anxiety following treatment. 28,29 However, in another study, the per\u00adceptions of patients with breast cancer regarding the choice of adjuvant chemotherapy were not related to subsequent quality of life. 30 The findings of another study showed that the degree to which patients with early breast cancer actively participated in their treatment consultations was related to the degree to which they assumed responsibility for the decision one year following treat\u00adment. 31 The patient's self-report of involvement in the consultation at the time of consultation also was predictive of having a choice for treatment one year later. In turn, decision responsibility and per\u00adceived choice were predictive of health-related quality of life at one year. Patient satisfaction with care and decisional re gret has been the sub\u00ad ject of considerable attention in research on communication between clinicians and patients with cancer. Some evidence has indicated that the greater the match between the preferences for involvement of patients with breast cancer and their perceived actual involvement, the less decisional regret and greater patient satisfac\u00adtion with care. 32 However, the results of one study showed that patients' perceived actual role in the consultation, and not the pre\u00adferred role, was the stronger pre\u00addictor of evaluations of care. Patients reporting a shared role with the physician were more sat\u00adisfied and evaluated their physi\u00adcians' communication more favor\u00adably than did patients reporting that their physicians exclusively made treatment decisions. 33 Decision aids can help facilitate patient-clinician communication about treatment preferences, which, in turn, contributes to greater patient satisfaction and less decisional conflict. 34,35 The relationship between patient involvement in the decision-mak\u00ading process and outcomes may in part be mediated by clinicians' efforts to encourage greater patient participation. For example, in stud\u00adies that have involved the use of observational and self-report meas\u00adures, patients with cancer were more active participants when their clinicians used partnership-build\u00ading to encourage patient involve\u00adment. 36,37 In turn, clinician support of patient participation can foster a sense of having a choice of treat\u00adment and greater satisfaction with care. 38 Correlates of patients' decision preferences The quality of patient-clinician communication can af fect patients' decisions and decision preferences, and some research has examined other factors affecting patients' 164 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 165 Appendix D: Decision-Making in Cancer Care decisions about treatment. Patient preferences for decisions may in part be influenced by their percep\u00adtion of their physicians' prefer\u00ad ences.39 Patients' decisions to forego traditional therapies for alternative and nonconventional treatments are influenced by a host of factors, such as having a close friend or relative who has died from cancer when receiving con\u00adventional treatments, beliefs, need for control, side effects of conven\u00adtional treatments, poor communi\u00adcation with physicians, and expect\u00aded benefits of treatment. 40 Media hype about remarkable cures can also predispose individuals with cancer to choose experimental and nontested treatment. 41 Regardless of the source of influence, clini\u00adcians often have little understand\u00ading of patients' reasons to forego traditional therapy and/or choose alternative approaches. There is a large body of literature on decision aids for assessing patients' decision preferences in general, and in the setting of can\u00adcer care specifically. The vast majority of studies on decision aids do not address their impact on patient-clinician communication. Research that has investigated their impact on communication will be reviewed later, in the dis\u00adcussion of patient activation inter\u00adventions. In reviews of nearly 200 decision aids pertaining to health care decisions of all types, O'Connor et al. reported that most of the aids were provided before the consultation to make decisions, included an emphasis on informa\u00adtion about treatment options and relative advantages and disadvan\u00adtages of options and were general\u00adly free of conflict of interest. 35 However, many of these aids were not fully evaluated. Decision aids generally increased knowledge about options, lowered decisional conflict, and reduced the propor\u00adtion of people remaining undecided about the treatment. Importantly, simple decision aids seemed to be more effective than complex ones with respect to knowledge gained, more realistic expectations, and greater concordance between val\u00adues and preferences. Contributions of decision aids to health out\u00adcomes and cost of implementing such interventions require further study. A follow-up to that review highlighted the fact that many of the decision aids described in the literature lack clear conceptual explanations of processes by which they are expected to achieve their goals, fail to recognize or acknowledge the values embraced by the decision aid itself, and are not thoroughly evaluated. 35,42 In cancer care, resources to sup\u00adport decision-making should take into account not only patient val\u00adues but also patient competencies; patients with cancer often want as much information as possible but can be overwhelmed with the information available and the com\u00adplexity of decisions. Continued development and evaluation of decision aids, especially ones that use interactive technology, may be resources for optimizing patient involvement in decision-making in a progressive, iterative fashion. 43 Implications for future study Collectively, the findings of the studies on decision-making indi\u00adcate that the quality of the patient-clinician interaction, and not patient in volvement in treatment decision-making per se, is the most important factor affecting cancer outcomes. For example, in a study of patients with colorectal cancer, the perception that their clinicians explained treatment options in a clear and unhurried manner was especially important to most patients, regardless of their preferences for decision-making roles. 22 This finding is very similar to that of a qualitative study44 in which women with a variety of cancers differed in their prefer\u00adences for involvement in decision-making but were similar in that most reported that judgments about whether the right decision was reached was related to a feel\u00ading of being listened to, inclusion in the decision-making process (regardless of who made the final decision), and trust in the physi\u00adcian. Specific communication strategies that may facilitate patient-clinician communication about treatment include explicit agenda setting, active listening, checking understanding, offering opportunities for involvement, endorsing participation, and using nonverbal behaviors that convey empathy and warmth. 45 It remains unclear how often the patient-clini\u00adcian conflict about the treatment and screening decisions occurs. 165 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 166 Patient-Centered D.3 Decision-Making in the End\u00ad of-Life Phase Palliation should occur at all phas\u00ad es of the cancer care continuum, but end-of-life care refers to the point at which relief of pain and other symptoms takes precedence over prolonging survival. There are no clear landmarks for the transi\u00adtion to end-of-life care, complicat\u00ading both the communication chal\u00adlenges and their study. Much of the literature on decision-making at the end of life is based on individual case reports, qualitative interviews and focus groups, attitudinal sur\u00adveys, and expert opinion rather than on observation of interactions and surveys addressing specific communication tasks. 46 Older stud\u00ad ies from the hospice literature are not easy to access with use of stan\u00addard search strategies. The studies that do exist indicate gaps in com\u00admunication that result in inade\u00adquate symptom management, lack of emotional support, excessive use of medical technology, and insuffi\u00adcient use of hospice care. 47 In general, patients, families, and clinicians consider patient involve\u00adment in decisions during the end\u00adof-life phase to be important, 48 and most patients want to participate in such decisions. 49 However, the results of studies have suggested that there is substantial variability in patients' wishes to be involved, that discussions about end-of-life issues are often inadequate, 50 and that clinicians usually underesti\u00admate patients' desires to partici\u00adpate in decisions. 9 Outcome meas\u00ad ures have been developed to deter\u00admine the quality of life for patients at the end of life. Although these measures correlate with symptom scores and f amily ratings of care after the patient's death, challenges remain in validating the measures prospectively in a variety of popu\u00adlations and settings. 51 End-of-life decision-making focus\u00ades on four areas: discontinuing anti\u00adcancer therapies, the settings for end-of-life care, advance directives, and assisted suicide. Decisions in each of these areas involve the patient as well as the family; 52-55 in fact, about half of all patients lose decision-making capacity before their deaths, so family-based deci\u00adsion-making is common. 56 Discontinuing anticancer therapies The decision to forego or cease anticancer therapies may occur at the point when gains in survi val and functioning and reduction of symptoms may be offset by a decrease in the quality of life due to the treatment itself. However, studies suggest that consideration of quality of life has had little influence on clinicians' recom\u00admendations and subsequent deci\u00adsions to continue or cease chemotherapy. 57 Clinicians who use third-line and fourth-line chemotherapy in the last months of life in the absence of clinical evidence of its effectiveness 58 tend to be less skilled in communicat\u00ading. 59 Presumably, decisions on such treatment are based on clini\u00adcians' emotions (feelings of guilt, failure, and blame) rather than open discussions about alternatives and choices. 60,61 Case reports and anecdotal evidence suggest, how\u00adever, that many patients and fami\u00adlies view the stopping of disease-directed therapy as \"giving up.\" They may confuse the failure of treatment with the failure of their clinician and prefer to continue even long-shot experimental thera\u00adpy to transitioning to a hospice approach. 62,63 Correspondingly, many patients' decisions are based on personal and spiritual belief systems, advice from others, and fear. 64 Accurate and complete information about options at the end of life are necessary for informed decision-making, but according to question\u00adnaire surveys, most patients did not fully understand their rights to withdraw treatment once initiated or their rights to aggressive symp\u00adtom management with medication doses that may unintentionally has\u00adten death. 65 Less than half of patients were presented with treat\u00adment choices and information about quality of life. 66 However, patients who reported participating in decisions about end-of-life care had higher levels of anxiety for at least two weeks following the deci\u00adsion. In one intervention to facili\u00adtate patients' participation in care and decisions, question prompt lists were well received and reduced the level of anxiety, but the impact on the process of deci\u00adsion-making was unclear. 67 Settings for end-of-life care The decision about the setting in which end-of-life care will occur 166 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 167 Appendix D: Decision-Making in Cancer Care is also important. Options for the setting include the patient' s home, with or without hospice services; a nursing home; or a dedicated hos\u00adpice unit. Despite a large body of literature about patient attitudes regarding the setting of end-of-life care, no studies have specifically addressed patient-clinician discus\u00adsions about this topic. Advance directives Discussions about advance direc\u00ad ti ves and substituted judgment about life-sustaining treatments should the patient lose the capacity to decide are contextualized by numerous sociological, psycholog\u00adical, legal, and ethical factors that are beyond the scope of this monograph. A self-determination model suggests that patients would want to use a principle of substi\u00adtuted judgment if they lose capaci\u00adty, but this application of self-determination theory is increasing\u00adly being called into question. 68 There is empirical support that some patients (especially those who are older and sicker) are more comfortable delegating such deci\u00adsions to family members and, under certain circumstances, let\u00adting surrogates override the patient's own living will, depend\u00ading on the context, recognizing that decisions are unstable over time. 69,70 However, patients and their surrogates do not always make the same decisions when presented with hypothetical sce\u00adnarios, nor are their advance care decisions completely stable over time. Yet, most patients still favor the decision-making authority of their selected surrogate, should the y lose capacity in the future.71-73 Although patients and clinicians believe that frank discussions about end-of-life choices are important and necessary, clinicians should be aware that patients' abil\u00adity to maintain a positive attitude is associated with increased sur\u00advival and quality of life 74 and that clinician recommendations can have psychological benefit for patients. 75 Thus, presenting \"just the facts\" and expecting patients to take a primary decision-making role may not always be good for the patient's health and well-being. Clinicians also have an important role in fostering positive attitudes and hope. They must often share responsibility for the decision with the patient and his or her family. One qualitative study emphasized the importance of determining whether the patient was an \"activist\" or a \"delegator\" before approaching discussions of advance directives. 76 The SUPPORT study was an important effort to promote discus\u00adsions about end-of-life issues with seriously ill patients, some of whom had cancer. 77 However, the intervention\u2014nurses informing teams about the patient's values and prognosis\u2014produced no changes in the use of advance directives, and care was no more concordant with patients' values in the intervention group than in the control group. 77 Even when discus\u00ad sions occurred, physician under\u00adstanding of patients' preferences were no better than when such dis\u00adcussions were reported not to have occurred. 78 Tulsky et al.79 and Fischer et al.80 recorded consulta\u00ad tions addressing advance directives and then surveyed both physicians and patients. The discussions included questions about prefer\u00adences and surrogate decision-mak\u00ading but rarely addressed values or uncertainty. The researchers found that most patients had misconcep\u00adtions about the process and out\u00adcomes of cardiopulmonary resusci\u00adtation. Although physicians accu\u00adrately predicted who the patient would choose as a health care proxy 89% of the time, they were unable to predict patients' prefer\u00adences in 18 of 20 scenarios involv\u00ading advance directives. 79,80 Our knowledge about the content and process of discussions about advance directives or do-not-resus\u00adcitate orders with patients with incurable cancer is limited. Furthermore, traditional models of decision-making consider only two parties\u2014the patient and the clini\u00adcian. However, families are nor\u00admally involved in end-of-life deci\u00adsions, even in Anglo-Saxon cul\u00adtures, and more so in Asian, African, Mediterranean, and native American cultures. 81,82 Models for communicating about end-of-life issues have only begun to take the family into account, 83 and family interventions have not been tested empirically. Assisted suicide Assisted suicide and euthanasia are also issues that arise during the end-of-life phase. Ev en in loca\u00ad tions where assisted death is ille\u00adgal, 12% of physicians report hav\u00ading received explicit requests for 167 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 168 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care this.84 In one study, half of oncolo\u00ad gists surveyed reported having received such requests and 13.5% complied with them. 85 Although there are several published guide\u00adlines on the use of assisted suicide, 86-88 their implementation has been studied with only qualita\u00adtive interview techniques with cli\u00adnicians 89 and patient/family units.90 Clinicians' reports suggested that their initial responses to such requests are to ask the patient to clarify his or her reasons for the request, address the physical symptoms and psychological issues underlying the request, and identify and treat depression. However, clinicians' greatest diffi\u00adculty in responding to such requests and reaching a decision was related to existential suffer\u00ading\u2014patients' loss of meaning, loss of role function, and feeling that they are burdensome to their families. Patients and their fami\u00adlies reported on clinicians' quali\u00adties necessary to facilitate these discussions, including openness to discussing assisted suicide, expert\u00adise dealing with the dying process, and maintaining a trusting rela\u00adtionship despite potential disagree\u00adments. 90 These interactions, how\u00ad ever, have not been recorded or observed directly, nor is there information about how clinical communication affects suffering and quality of life in these settings. Implications for future study Little known about the content and process of discussions between cli\u00adnicians, patients at the end of life, and their f amilies regarding treat\u00adment decisions, advance directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, hospice care, f amily involvement in deci\u00ad sion-making, and assisted dying. Study of communication in this domain must take into account, more than in other domains of cancer communication, the patient's implicit model of self-determination, desire for autonomy versus delegation to family or friends, desire for physician rec\u00adommendations and willingness to confront difficult circumstances, all of which exist with an under\u00adcurrent of prognostic uncertainty. Addressing patients' emotions and existential suffering appears to be a necessary first step in reaching decisions regarding end-of-life care. References (1) Edwards A, Unigwe S, Elwyn G, Hood K.

Such experiences are often emotion-laden, and the participants must discuss a com\u00adplex array of diagnostic and treat\u00ad ment information. As a result, many clinicians have expressed the need for communication skills training to help them, their patients, and their patients' fami\u00adlies have more positive, productive encounters. 1,2 Research to date has focused on three issues: communi\u00adcation skills training for clinicians (mostly for physicians and nurses), cultural competency training, and communication skills training for patients. Very little research has been conducted to determine how interventions focused on changing the structure of clinical practices and health care systems may affect communication and related out\u00adcomes. E.1 Communication Skills Training for Clinicians In cancer care, clinicians have a number of communication tasks that must be accomplished skill\u00adfully. According to Beckman and Frankel, 3 these include the following: Delivering bad news Helping patients make truly informed choices Effectively working with families Facilitating the transition to palliati v e care Ensuring that end-of-life care honors the patient' s requests W orking with grief Clinicians generally feel more comfortable discussing diagnosis and treatment than emotional and psychological issues. 4 Even the management of information is challenging; patients with cancer typically report that they want to know all the available information about their type of cancer and its treatment 5 yet are often over\u00ad whelmed by the sheer amount of information provided by clinicians, the mass media, and the Internet. 6 Various communication training programs for clinicians have been described and evaluated in several studies. Typically, clinicians report that they find these programs to be satisfying and meaningful and to result in more confidence in han\u00addling difficult communication issues with patients who have can\u00adcer. 7-11 For example, in one study, before beginning a communication skills training program, oncolo\u00adgists expressed difficulty with a number of communication issues, such as giving complex informa\u00adtion, obtaining informed consent, and handling cultural differences. Three months after the three-day E 173 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 174 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care course, physicians reported having greater confidence in handling these matters, a more positive atti\u00adtude toward patients' psychosocial needs, and a more patient-centered orientation. 12,13 Other studies have focused on the effectiveness of interventions to teach clinicians emotion-manage\u00adment skills, such as expressing empathy, responding to patient cues, and handling psychological distress. 14 A recent review of ran\u00ad domized controlled trials and con\u00adtrolled before and after studies designed to assess the effective\u00adness of communication skill pro\u00adgrams demonstrated that physi\u00adcians and nurses improved on several patient-centered skills, including communicating empa\u00adthy, using open-ended questions, and providing appropriate respon\u00adsiveness to patient cues. These improvements were sustained over several weeks. 15 With the proper training, improvements in communication skills can be sus\u00adtained over longer periods. In one study, 12 months following a physician intervention, there was no noticeable attrition in physi\u00adcians' improvement in the use of open-ended questions and respon\u00adsiveness to patient cues (although there was a decline in empathy). 16 The physicians also interrupted less and made more of an effort to summarize information for patients, skills that had not been observed immediately following training. In a Japanese study, oncologists' confidence in com\u00admunicating with patients increased significantly after train\u00ading, but the oncologists' emotion\u00adal e xhaustion worsened three months after the workshop.17 This study raises the possibility that although communication training may increase clinicians' skills in patient-centered communication in cancer care, it may have the unintended consequence of adding to the clinician's stress. Other interventions have specifi\u00adcally focused on the ef fects of training to uncover and discuss emotional distress in patients with cancer. In one study, nurses trained in ways to discuss and handle patients' emotions were indeed able to elicit more affective com\u00admunication from patients than were untrained nurses. 18 In another study, nurses trained to address the emotional content of medical encounters used more words relat\u00aded to emotions immediately and three months after training com\u00adpared with a control group. 19 Communication interventions for clinicians have also been linked to patients' perceptions of quality of care. Patients of trained physicians reported that they understood their disease better, 20 felt less depressed, and believed they were more in control than did patients whose physicians did not have training. 21 In the most recent study, physi\u00adcians who participated in an inten\u00adsive training program (a series of six three-hour workshops) used more open-ended questions and were more effective at eliciting and clarifying the psychological concerns of simulated patients than were physicians who partici\u00adpated in a less intensive training program. 22 Moreover, patients (but not necessarily their relatives) were more satisfied with the physi\u00adcians who received the more inten\u00adsive training. Although most studies have demonstrated impro ved communi\u00ad cation skills following training, a few have had negative findings. A training program designed to increase physicians' ability to detect patients' distress led to no significant differences between those who participated in the workshops and the control group. 23 Instead, physicians' ability to assess patients' distress was nega\u00adtively associated with patients' education level and self-reported distress both before and after the intervention. A study of nurses indicated that an intervention designed to help detect psycholog\u00adical difficulties in patients with cancer was successful in enhanc\u00ading the detection of difficulties, but few of the patients were referred to psychological services. Unfortunately, there was no fol\u00adlow-up on patient health out\u00adcomes. 24 In another study, patient satisfaction associated with a physician communication training program was attenuated because of practical problems, such as waiting too long to see the physi\u00adcian. 25 These studies point to the possibility that system and organi\u00adzational barriers can hinder the effectiveness of communication training programs. It is also worth noting that the studies re viewed here generally focused on skills training for can\u00adcer consultations in general, but 174 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 175 Appendix E: Interventions to Improve Communication between Patients with Cancer and Clinicians other programs have been devel\u00ad oped for more specific tasks and patient populations, including breaking bad news, 26-28 genetic counseling,29 management of pain,30 and communicating with patients with limited literacy.31 The most effective training pro\u00adgrams for clinicians are those that 32,33 Are carried out over a long period of time Use multiple pedagogical methods Allow for rehearsal Provide timely feedback Allow clinicians to work in groups with skilled f acilitators Moreover, because clinicians de velop routines for interacting with patients, communication training interventions should be introduced early in the medical school curriculum. Such interven\u00adtions have been successful. In one program for students in which patients with cancer were enlisted as part of an educational program, students in the intervention group valued listening, trust, and show\u00ading concern for patients to a greater degree than did students who did not participate in the pro\u00adgram. 34 Although three to five- day training courses can con\u00adtribute to behavior and attitude change in students, these work\u00adshops may not be as effective as incorporating communication skills development throughout the medical and nursing curriculum. E.2 Cultural Competency T raining for Clinicians We include cultural competence within this section on communica\u00adtion skills interventions because the construct has evolved beyond an awareness of language barriers and the ways cultures differ to the implementation of patient-centered communication (e.g., empathy and responsiveness to patients' values and preferences). 35,36 According to Paasche-Orlow,37 the essential principles of cultural competence are the following: Acknowledgment of the importance of culture in peo\u00adple' s daily lives Acceptance and respect for these dif ferences Minimization of the negative ef fects of cultural differences Clinicians and patients must adhere to these principles in order to com\u00admunicate ef fectively. Cultural com\u00ad petency is important at all points across the cancer care continu\u00adum\u2014during cancer screening, the informed consent process, deci\u00adsion-making about treatment after diagnosis, and palliative care. 38 Despite the need for programs in cultural competency, 39-41 very few of these programs have been devel\u00adoped or evaluated to date. The challenges facing cultural competence training are manifold. Most medical students are not highly culturally competent with respect to understanding health disparities, stereotyping, and cul\u00adtural dif ferences in communication styles.42 When patients and clini\u00adcians discuss cultural barriers in health care, each often has dif fer\u00ad ent conceptions of what cultural competence entails. 43 Nevertheless, a recent review of the published research on cultural competency training indicated that these pro\u00adgrams generally increase clini\u00adcians' knowledge of cultural issues and their communication skills when interacting with diverse patients and that patients report greater satisfaction with such clini\u00adcians. 44 However, there has been little indication to date that this education contributes to greater patient adherence and improved health outcomes. We suspect that, like communication skills training, the most effective cultural compe\u00adtency education will be programs that provide intensive education before, during, and after clinical training 45 and that involve multiple pedagogical methods (role-play\u00ading, feedback, simulated patients, group discussion). Moreover, hav\u00ading culturally competent clinicians is but one requirement for a cultur\u00adally responsive health care system. Patients and clinicians also must be supported with staff and practi\u00adtioners who reflect the community served, with linguistically and cul\u00adturally appropriate health educa\u00adtion materials, and with access to interpreters when needed. 46 E.3 Communication Skills T raining for Patients Patients, too, play an important role in the success of clinical encounters in cancer settings. The key premise underlying patient \"activation\" or communication 175 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 176 Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care skills interventions is to increase patient participation in the consul\u00adtation and, if they desire, to enhance their involvement in deci\u00adsion-making. The current research has shown that the most successful \"patient activation\" interventions are those that 47-49 Promote the legitimacy of the patient' s participation in care Provide information about the patient' s health condition and treatment options Provide specific communica\u00ad tion strate gies and behaviors for patients to use in their interactions with clinicians Deliver the intervention in a timely f ashion so that the patient has an opportunity to act on behavioral intentions resulting from the program Patients in gynecology clinics who were advised to write do wn specif\u00ad ic questions and take the list into the consultation reported that they had asked more of the questions they wanted to, felt more in con\u00adtrol, and were more satisfied with the information they had received. 50 With another interven\u00ad tion, patients were explicitly encouraged to be active informa\u00adtion seekers and were advised to write down specific questions and concerns before the visit with their physician. 51 Patients who received the intervention asked significantly more questions and had better recall of the information provided by physicians than did patients not receiving the intervention. It has been shown that having patients watch video recordings of role models successfully asking ques\u00adtions and introducing topics for discussion also increases patient participation. 52 It is important to note that the effectiveness of these interventions may depend in part on providing patients with specific skills and goals for the encounter. 53-55 Simply encouraging patients to be more involved may not sufficiently help them overcome barriers to participation. In addition, interven\u00adtions are more effective if the physician has a positive attitude toward patient participation. 56 There is a large body of literature on the use of decision aids to inform patients about their type of disease and help them identify their treatment preferences, 57 and several studies have involved the evaluation of decision aids designed to enhance patient com\u00admunication and participation in cancer consultations. The findings of many studies of aids to facilitate the involvement of patients with cancer in the decision-making process have demonstrated that patients receiving these interven\u00adtions had greater knowledge about the surgical treatment of breast cancer, assumed a more active role in the process, had less decisional conflict, and were more satisfied with the decision-making process. 58,59 In contrast, some stud\u00ad ies have indicated less success with interventions designed to help patients in the decision-making process. For example, Davison and Degner 60 reported that, paradoxi\u00ad cally, women with breast cancer who used computer-assisted edu\u00adcation designed to promote their involvement in decision-making actually participated less than the control group. Women in the con\u00ad trol group completed measures of decision preference before their clinic appointments, whereas women in the intervention group were encouraged to use the infor\u00admation and decision preference profiles generated by the computer program at their clinic appoint\u00adments. In general, the majority of women in both groups achieved their preferred roles in decision-making, but a higher proportion of women in the intervention group reported playing a more passive role than expected. One potentially moderating factor not examined in this study was the way in which physicians communicated with patients. In another study, women with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer 61 either received a multimedia program or an educa\u00adtional brochure; women in both groups achieved significant gains in knowledge about treatment and the two groups did not differ with respect to their rates of participa\u00adtion in decision-making. Rather, as with question prompt sheets, the degree to which patients asked questions, expressed concerns, and offered opinions was related to their age, education, and the extent to which physicians facilitated their involvement. This finding highlights the fact that the clini\u00adcian's attitudes toward patient acti\u00advation and behavior in the consul\u00adtation likely moderate the effects of patient activation interventions and that the effectiveness of such interventions, in part, depends on physician endorsement. 61,62 176 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 177 Appendix E: Interventions to Improve Communication between Patients with Cancer and Clinicians As noted by Parker et al.,62 research on patient-based commu\u00ad nication interventions show that a variety of methods (e.g., audio recordings, prompt sheets, coach\u00ading) generally work well at increasing patients' information-seeking and decision-making behavior. Yet, in cancer care, how patients manage their emotions and personal meaning of illness are also important. For example, in palliative care, patients' partici\u00adpation may be less focused on medical information and more focused on discussing their expe\u00adriences and life circumstances. 63 Even when interventions are designed to facilitate patients' information-gathering and deci\u00adsion-making behavior, patients may be more interested in sharing their experiences with others rather than learning specific com\u00admunication skills. In short, these results suggest that interventions designed to foster patient partici\u00adpation in cancer consultations should also focus on facilitating patients' emotional processing of the disease, particularly when it is incurable. In summary, the research on acti\u00ad v ation and communication skills training for patients highlights the importance of providing specific communication strategies (e.g., through role models, prompt sheets, and writing down ques\u00adtions and concerns) when inter\u00adacting with clinicians. Health information and encouragement also facilitate patient participa\u00adtion, but, to be most effective, patient activation interventions should provide resources to help patients select and enact specif ic communication tasks. Patients should be encouraged to express emotion and meaning. Providing the education immediately before the consultation is particularly effective because patients can use these communication strategies while they are salient and rele\u00advant. It is important to note that, when programs to enhance patient communication are well designed, they can be effective in a variety of media, including pamphlets or booklets, 50,55 prompt sheets,59 video recordings,52 multimedia programs,61 coaching sessions,64-66 or diaries.67 However, it is not known how long the effects of the intervention persist or how to simultaneously augment physi\u00adcian endorsement and facilitation of patients' active involvement so that patients' values and experi\u00adences are thoroughly discussed and incorporated into actual decisions. E.4 Interventions at the Team, Practice, and Health Car e Systems Levels to Improve Communication between Patients with Cancer and Clinicians There are very few studies of the effect of changes at the team, prac\u00adtice, and health care systems levels on communication between patients with cancer and clinicians. Interventions at the team level Patients normally encounter multi\u00ad ple clinicians during the cancer trajectory. Observational studies ha ve indicated that clear and respectful communication is an essential quality of well-function\u00ading teams 68,69 and that these quali\u00ad ties are not always present.70 Many researchers have called for improved communication within health care teams, 71 but there are few interventions overall and even fewer in cancer contexts. Interventions in intensive care set\u00adtings have had a positive impact on communication and leadership within health care teams, 68 howev\u00ad er, the impact on patients is unknown. Interventions to provide structured written communication between primary care physicians and oncologists 70 and between gen\u00ad eral practitioners and oncology nurses 72 appeared to facilitate information transfer, but a subse\u00adquent study showed that a similar intervention had little impact on patient health care and informa\u00adtion-seeking behavior. 73 The find\u00ad ings of one cohort study suggested that palliative care teams result in better patient insight into their ill\u00adnesses than standard care, 74 but the results of a study of a team-build\u00ading intervention indicated that interventions to improve team functioning may not be effective if there is understaffing. 75 Patient- held medical records have some promise in improving communica\u00adtion among team members and in facilitating patient understanding, 76 but effects on communication between clinicians and patients have not been reported. A shared-care intervention to promote team\u00adwork between general practitioners and oncologists appear to influ\u00ad 177 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 Page Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care ence patients' attitudes positively,77 but, as with many of the studies cited, patient-clinician communi\u00adcation was not evaluated directly. Interventions at the practice level In a series of studies, Stange and colleagues 78-82 demonstrated that use of individualized interventions at the practice level could increase rates of cancer prevention and screening. These interventions involved research personnel trained in ethnographic and survey methods who would spend from several days to several weeks observing the organization, patient flow, and teamwork in primary care practices. These personnel would then meet regularly with the entire practice to propose changes in the structure of the practices tai\u00adlored to the particular problems encountered. However, the impact of such interventions on communi\u00adcation between clinicians and patients, and the degree to which the effects of these interventions are mediated by changes in com\u00admunication, is unknown. Interventions at the health care systems lev el One randomized trial identified problems in the physical layout of a cancer outpatient clinic and de vel\u00ad oped an intervention to make changes in that layout and to edu\u00adcate staff on communication tech\u00adniques. 83 Patients in the intervention group were more likely to report higher satisfaction with communi\u00adcation, better privacy, fewer inter\u00adruptions, clearer language, suffi\u00adcient time, and greater understand\u00ading. Ho wever, it is not clear whether the change in physical lay\u00adout or the communication training was responsible for the results. Systems interventions to facilitate transfer of information between patients and physicians include care diaries in which patients and all members of the health care team could share information, 67 patient-held medical records,76 and direct access by patients to elec\u00adtronic medical records. In one study, patients expressed satisfac\u00adtion with the care diary approach, 67 but no other randomized trials have been conducted to assess the effects of these approaches on communication, quality of life, and other outcomes. These inter\u00adventions present compelling areas for future research. E.5 Implications for Future Study The evidence to date suggests that communication training interven\u00adtions are generally effective for enhancing clinicians' patient-cen\u00adtered behaviors and patients' infor\u00admation-seeking and decision-mak\u00ading skills. In cancer care settings, more attention should be directed at developing programs designed to enhance clinicians' cultural competency and to help patients discuss and manage their emotions and feelings. Despite the promis\u00ading results of these interventions, such programs have not been implemented system-wide within cancer care settings. Moreover, there is a paucity of research on how changes in the structure of teams, clinical practices, and health care institutions, as well as use of other system resources\u2014 such as Web-based resources, mul\u00ad timedia programs, and electronic medical records\u2014can be used to improve cancer care consultations. Interventions generally have not involved family members and friends, nor have the effects of the intervention on caregivers' well\u00adbeing been assessed. Interventions have very rarely combined clini\u00adcian and patient training, despite evidence that lack of physician endorsement can undermine patient interventions that are other\u00adwise successful. Very few inter\u00adventions incorporate means for reinforcing the effects of the inter\u00advention over time. These robust technologies hold much promise for improving patient-clinician communication. 84 178 4156-DCC PCC Book Appendix to End-v4.qxd 9/21/07 10:13 AM Page 179 Appendix E: Interventions to Improve Communication between Patients with Cancer and Clinicians References (1) Maguire P, Pitceathly C.
