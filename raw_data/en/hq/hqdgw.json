I am the mother of a vaccine injured child . My daughter was injured in 2 006 by the Gardasil vaccination (HPV vaccine) which came out in 2006. My daughter was one of the first inoculated for this vaccine. As time went on, many reports of injuries started coming out. This allowed me to make the connection to a mysterious sudd en autoimmune illness that came upon my daughter after her 2nd and 3rd required injections. We went to many doctors and finally went to Mayo Clinic to try and figure out why my daughter's body turned into a horrific ill body with many many life altering symptoms. - Everyone's body is made up differently and we don't know how each individual body will react. Each individual knows their bodies and their limits to chemical exposures and issues they may have from these injections, they should not be FORCED to be immunized and they need their FREEDOM of choice. ALL vaccines carry the risk of injury or death so there has to be informed consent and the right to refuse any vaccine without penalty. - There is a reason there is a National Vaccine Injury Compensati on Program that has paid out over $ 4.5 billion in damages. - Individuals need to be allowed to make their own decisions when it involves THEIR body - the only thing they truly own in this world. - If you received a vaccine - that is your choice - then if vaccines are so great - you are protected.
