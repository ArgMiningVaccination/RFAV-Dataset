EinSteinchen provides a simple example revealing how size - depending on your point of reference - is actually relative. 124666 002 E=mc \u00b2 Einstein's famous formula! EinSteinchen explains that energy can turn into mass, while mass can likewise be converted into energy. This second process, for example, constantly occurs in our sun. 124666 003 The Discovery of SlownessWhat is the 'relativity of time'? EinSteinchen shows how time changes when traveling through space. Of course, speed also plays a role. An external observer watching a clock on a spacecraft that was accelerating through space could see time 'slow down' as the ship gained speed. 124666 004 As Fast as LightEinSteinchen explains that light always moves at the same speed, and why nothing can be faster than light.124666 005Glowing Atoms - Stimulated EmissionsHow does a laser apparatus create its special, highly concentrated beam of light? EinSteinchen explains the role that 'excited' atoms play in the process. 124666 006 The Supermolecule - Bose-Einstein CondensationWhen EinSteinchen drops the temperature of molecules close to absolute zero, they change state and begin behaving like a single 'wave'. 124666 007 The Spooky Long-Distance EffectEinSteinchen takes a look at a paradox. Two particles can continue to be 'entangled' with each other even if they're far apart in space. 124666 008 Bent SpaceEinSteinchen shows how incredibly massive objects exerting enormous gravity actually bend space, and how even light follows the curve. 124666 009 Dancing ParticlesMolecules are in constant motion. Even inanimate particles can move in seemingly unpredictable ways. EinSteinchen explains how the forces that play a role in interactions between molecules can be defined by formulas. 124666 010 Electricity from LightLight can exhibit the characteristics of either a particle or an electromagnetic wave. That's why light energy can be converted into electrical energy. EinSteinchen shows us how. 124666 011 The Invisible ForceEinSteinchen reveals how the forces of gra vity exerted by stars and planets keep everything in the universe in motion. 124666 012 WormholesTheoretically, two black holes could distort space-time in the universe so extremely that they would create what's called a 'wormhole'. EinSteinchen explains how a theoretical journey through this kind of cosmic tunnel could provide shortcuts across the enormous distances of space.E=mc\u00b2 - the most famous formula in the world. Everyone knows it, but very few know what it actually means. This is true of most of Albert Einstein's revelations. You don't have to be a genius in physics to under-stand our program.

Now physicist Ferenc Krausz has broken a new barrier. He's first to produce an attosecond pulse. An attosecond is an unimaginable 0.000 000 000 000 000 001 of a second long. The technique that Krausz used is based on Einstein's prediction of stimulated emission. The great physicist's hypothesis helped lay the foundations for the development of that incredibly versatile tool - the laser. 124665 006 Juggling Ultra-Cold AtomsThough he's just 32 years old, Immanuel Bloch is already a professor of physics at the University of Mainz. He's an expert on a state of matter that was predicted by Albert Einstein - Bose-Einstein condensation. Immanuel Bloch has now taken things a step further. He has become the first to crack the Bose-Einstein condensation wave and regularly arrange several hundred of these special atoms into a glowing grid. In the future, grids like these could make up the basic elements of a new kind of supercomputer. 124665 007 Cloned Atoms Through Teleportation For the first time ever, Rainer Blatt was able to transfer the state of one atom to another. Although the process is called 'teleportation', no matter is transported from one spot to another. Instead, information leaps the gap. To achieve his goal, Blatt made use of what Albert Einstein described as the 'spooky action-at-a-distance between particles'. The discovery is a scientific sensation, even though the teleporting distances crossed up until now have only been a few hundredths of a millimeter.124665 001Nuclear Medicine: A Formula and its ResultsWhen an atom in a radioactive element decays, then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy. This is part of the proof that backs up Einstein's realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Without Einstein's discovery that is expressed in the formula E=mc\u00b2, some later medical developments would not have been possible. Artificially produced radioactive substances known as radiopharmaceuticals play a major role in modern medical diagnostics and research. 124665 002 Satellite Navigation - Einstein's Contribution to GalileoTime is relative - in the field of satellite navigation, Einstein's theory has practical applications. In space, clocks tick differently than they do on Earth. But the accuracy of satellite navigation systems is depen-dent on how precisely the atomic clocks on board can measure time. 124665 003 The Speed of Light - Part 1: Light ResearchersAt the root of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is the assumption that the speed of light never changes. Einstein said that the speed of light is a universal constant, one that always remains the same no matter where you are. Is that really the case? European researchers now want to conduct an experiment in space to find out. 124665 004 The Speed of Light - Part 2: Radar SatelliteThe speed of light also standardizes the exact length of a meter. That's important for large-scale surveys like those slated to be carried out by the radar satellite TerraSAR-X. The rader satellite will begin surveying Earth's surface with an accuracy never before seen in civilian applications. The new satellite, for example, will be able to map the ongoing urban sprawl of some of the world's largest cities. 124665 Clips, 12 x 03-05 min., 2005, SD;Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, Greek, Hindi, Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish WW, VoD, M, IFESCIENCE124665 011 The Search for a Theory of Everything For much of his life, Albert Einstein sought a formula that would describe and encompass all four funda-mental forces. He failed to find a unifying theory. The tunnel in Geneva is huge - and it runs in a circle that's 27 kilometers long. Thousands of scientists allover the world are waiting with bated breath for experiments to begin in the Large Hadron Collider. It's hoped that the gargantuan apparatus will be able to generate a kind of small scale Big Bang, lasting for just fractions of a second, that will recreate the conditions just after the birth of the universe. 124665 012 Time Travel Through Wormholes - Nothing More than a Dream? As early as 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen recognized that relativity theory did not rule out 'bridges' through space-time. Today, we call these hypothetical pathways 'wormholes'. Physicists nowadays admit that time travel through wormholes is at least theoretically possible, although journeys into the past or future have remained firmly in the realm of science fiction. 124665 008Cosmic Telescopes: Discovering Distant Galaxies According to a theory first put forward by Albert Einstein, a large body of mass curves space and the light that traverses it. Clusters of galaxies create what are known as gravitational lenses. Astrophysicist Joachim Wambsgan\u00df has spent years studying this phenomena in deep space. He searches and maps massive celestial objects such as galaxies that possess strong gravitational fields. These curve or bend the space around them, and force light from even more distant galaxies and objects into a curved rather than a straight trajec-tory. The process also 'bundles' the light, focusing and increasing its intensity. 124665 009 Racing down Einstein's Paths Molecules in gas and fluids tend to behave in unor-dered and random ways. This phenomenon, first identified by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown and therefore named Brownian Motion, was also of great interest to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published his studies on Brownian Motion. Today, his findings can help researchers solve many of the problems linked to the movement of particles. 124665 010 Organic Solar Cells What a pain: the cell phone has to be charged at the mains every few days. But in future that could be rendered obsolete by a portable charging unit in a jacket. It consists of wafer-thin organic solar cells. Like conventional silicon cells, the organic solar cells convert light energy into electrical current. The principle behind it is the photoelectric effect. Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of this phenomenon. SCIENCEHuge progress has been made in medicine over recent decades. For example, the discovery of fiber optics has made it possible to take a close look at the stomach and intestines.

They offer a refreshing take on the work of one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. \" After performing all of Schumann's symphonies you get a sense that what you learned about him at school was simply wrong. Robert Schumann's symphonic music is amazing. If you're brave enough to look beyond tradition and focus solely on the music, you'll see just how impressive it is.\" The project Schumann at Pier2 consists of two elements: a concert film and a recording of Schumann's four symphonies. T he concert film Schumann at Pier2 offers a new and unconventional encounter with Schumann's symphonic oeuvre. The film stars the US-Estonian conductor Paavo J\u00e4rvi and the German Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra Bremen. The setting is Pier2, a former shipyard in Bremen harbor. Usually a venue for rock and pop concerts, on this occasion it hosts performances of Schumann's symphonies for a young audience. T he film observes the orchestra during rehearsals and presents elaborately recorded performances. Paavo J\u00e4rvi explains key sections of the symphonies and talks about Schumann's life. Studio-takes show members of the orchestra playing selected passages from the sympho-nies and talking about what makes them so special. S chumann at Pier2 combines these various filmic elements - concerts, rehearsals and studio recordings - into an entertaining, informative and fascinating musical experience.MUSICChristmas Music Johann Sebastian Bach: Christmas Oratorio The Christmas Oratorio is probably the most popular spiritual work by Johann Sebastian Bach. The composition for choir, orchestra and vocal soloists illustrates the Biblical Christmas story and was written at a time when Bach was employed as cantor at the famous St. Thomas Church in Leipzig. It is comprised of several parts originally intended for church services on Sundays and religious holidays between Christmas and Epiphany. It was first performed in sections in the winter of 1734/35 under Bach's baton. Soon afterwards, the composer merged the six highly uniform parts to create the Christmas Oratorio. However, owing to its considerable length of around two-and-a-half hours, it was rarely performed in its entirety. D W Transtel presents Bach's Christmas Oratorio, performed by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from Amsterdam, one of the world's best orchestras, in an abridged version of 2 x 50 minutes. This version comprises four of the six parts which perfectly reflect the spirit and the mood of the oratorio. T he entire Christmas Oratorio is borne by the joy at the birth of Christ, which finds its expression in celebratory choruses and dynamic orchestral passages, interspersed with hymns and emotional arias performed by the vocal soloists. All the while, melancholic musical allusions infuse the fundamentally joyful tone of the work with the knowledge of the later death of the Savior on the Cross - all masterfully interconnected by Bach in a manner that lends his music a timeless character. 684914 Live Music, 02 x 50 min.,Only MusicMUSIC 684914 001 Christmas Oratorio, Parts I-II The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Cappella Amsterdam conducted by Jan Willem de Vriend.

On the programme: Arcangelo Corelli's \"Christmas Concerto\" played by the Baden-Baden Philharmonic, as well as traditional songs and other seasonal melodies. Concert venues include the Kurhaus Baden-Baden, castles, museums, churches and abbeys in southwestern Germany. The centrepiece is the famous \"Christmas Concerto\", a work that is easily as well known as Antonio Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons\" these days. It has an especially rich structure, with regard to movement progression, dynamics and melodic structure. A ggressive sections alternate with wistfully pastoral parts, painfully dissonant movements with calm and peaceful ones; very fast, almost hurried sections are abruptly interspersed with measured passages that almost appear to be grinding to a halt. An intense musical game of questions and answers serves to draw all these divergent, contrasting elements together, and despite the ornamentation and virtuoso coloratura passages, the exceptionally soulful dominant violin melody comes very close to part writing for the human voice. The closing 5th movement leads into the famous Pastorale: in a major key, instead of an austere minor key, and in a tranquil, restrained manner, this comforting pastoral music ambles by: in a rocking gait, with cantilenas in thirds and sixths and a pianissimo as subtle as the beat of angels' wings - as the piece draws to a close.
