The incidence of obesity in the United States has risen to an alarming level, resulting in tremendous strain on our health-care system. Chronic and comorbid medical condi- tions like diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and heart disease are all more prevalent in obese individ - uals. 1,2 Additionally, obese individuals are more likely to die from diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease.2 The most recent data that the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collected from 2007 to 2008, showed that the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 30) was 33.8% overall, 32.2% among men, and 35.5% among women. Moreover, Flegal et al estimated that the combined overall prevalence in the US population of being overweight or obese (BMI > 25) was 68.0%. 3 Given these statistics, it is not surprising that the commercial sector has developed numerous diet programs to help people with weight loss. Conventional, structured weight-loss strategies usually involve limiting total calories 4 or a major macronutrient, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates, to achieve weight-loss success. 5,6 Meal replacement programs are also effective for weight loss and compare favorably with conventional structured diets.7-9 Most recently, detoxification (detox) diets have begun to gain a great deal of attention as a novel approach to losing weight. Detox diets have gone by the name of elimination diets, rotary diversified diets, the Master Cleanse, and many other names. People use them with the expected effect of ridding the body of toxins, cleansing the colon, or improving liver detoxification. The primary outcome that individuals hope to achieve is eventually to feel better. Studies have indicated that these programs can be effective for improving symptoms. 10-12 The current research team, however, was unable to find a study on detox diets to substantiate their weight-loss claims. In this study, the primary objectives were to examine the effects of a meal replacement-enhanced, low-calorie detox diet supplying from 800 kcal to 1200 kcal per day on symptoms scores and weight loss to clarify the amount of success to be expected from these measures for individuals following this version of a detox diet.Symptom Relief and Weight Loss From Adherence to a Meal Replacement-enhanced, Low-calorie Detoxification Diet Jeffrey A. Morrison, MD, CNS; Anita L. Iannucci, PhD Context: Recently, detoxification (detox) diets have achieved notoriety in the popular press due to celebrity endorsements and marketing that suggest quick and easy weight loss. Although researchers have done studies to evaluate the weight-loss outcomes of popular diet programs such as Weight Watchers, Atkins, and others, they have performed no outcomes studies to support the weight-loss results that detox diets claim. Objective: This study intended to evaluate the changes in weight and medical-symptoms scores in participants who adhered to a 4-week, meal replacement-enhanced, low-calorie detox diet.Design: The research team performed a retrospective chart review.Setting: Office of the first author, New Y ork, New Y ork. Participants: The participants were 31 (13 M, 18 F) patients the first author saw consecutively in his private practice. Their ages ranged from 23 to 77, their preintervention weights from 134 lbs to 275 lbs, and their preintervention body mass indexes (BMIs) from 23.2 to 38.4.Intervention: The participants followed a meal replacement-enhanced, low-calorie detox diet for approximately 4 weeks.Outcome Measures: The research team examined participants' preintervention-to-postintervention (pre-to-post) changes in scores on the Detox Questionnaire, which measures medical symptoms, and its 15 scales; pre-to-post changes in weight; and pre-to-post changes in BMI.Results: On each of 15 toxicity scales (medical symptoms) from the questionnaire, the study showed a statistically significant pre-to-post decline. The overall score, containing all 71 items from the 15 scales, also showed a significant decline, from a median of 53 at preintervention to 17 at postintervention, P < .001. Additionally, the average pre-to-post weight loss equaled approximately 9 lbs, P < .001, and a significant reduction in BMI occurred, from an average of 29.2 to 27.8, P < .001. No significant relationship existed, however, between the amount of the decline in symptoms scores and the amount of weight lost. Discussion: This meal replacement-enhanced, low calorie detox diet appears to be a viable option for both weight loss and a reduction in chronic health symptoms.

To subscribe, visit imjournal.com Symptom Relief and Weight Loss From Detox DietDeSIgn AnD MeThoDS Participants and Methods For this retrospective chart review, the research team selected 31 individuals from patients that the first author saw consecu-tively in his private practice. In brief, after the participants provided a medical history and received a physical evaluation, the team allowed them to participate in the detox program as long as they were (1) over the age of 18, (2) were not pregnant or nursing, and (3) did not have any serious illness that would contraindicate participation in a meal replacement-enhanced, low-calorie, detox-diet program. While the selected participants did not suffer from any serious illnesses, they did suffer from chronic health complaints such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, flatulence and bloating, muscle and joint aches, and/or difficulty losing weight. The research team asked each participant whether he or she would like to address his or her health-care problems by following a meal replacement-enhanced detox diet for 4 weeks. Each participant expressed interest in following the program, and the team gave participants both verbal and written instructions, emphasizing the necessity of close follow-up during the program. The team provided participants with a handout that comprehen-sively listed the foods to avoid and include (Tables 1 and 2), and participants obtained the meal-replacement shakes from the first author's office. At the first visit and again after about a month, the research team examined each participant to obtain height, weight, and other physical measures. Additionally, on the first visit, each participant completed a Detox Questionnaire (Table 3) to assess his or her medical symptoms from the previous week. This ques-tionnaire was identical to the Metabolic Screening Questionnaire that Jeffrey Bland, PhD created. 10,12 Bland designed his question- naire to be a succinct form of the Cornell Medical Index, concen-trating on symptoms that might be related to toxicity. 13 The ques- tionnaire considers a score of 0 to 14 to represent low toxicity, a score between 15 and 49 moderate toxicity, and a score of >50 high toxicity. Table 4 shows the characteristics of the 31 partici-pants (13 M, 18 F) prior to treatment. Participants included in this study followed this program until their follow-up appointments, which occurred between 3 and 5 weeks after their initial visit. The research team assessed partici-pants' progress at this second appointment by recording their weights and having them complete the Detox Questionnaire again, rating their symptoms over the past week. A few of the patients remarked that they noticed an increase in their symptoms when they first started the program, but the symptoms quickly subsided within 3 to 5 days. All 31 participants successfully completed the plan. The Diet The meal replacement was a combination of 2 scoops of Daily Detox Powder, 2 tbsp of lecithin, and 1 tbsp of Daily Fiber that the participants added to 8 oz of pure water. Metagenics (San Clemente, California) manufactured the Daily Detox Powder and Daily Fiber, and Douglas Laboratories (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) manufactured the lecithin for Daily Nutritionals, Inc (New Y ork, New Y ork). Partici-pants could mix the shake by hand, mix it in a container, or blend it with ice cubes. The detox powder consisted of rice-based protein powder, and the Daily Fiber consisted of a nongluten fiber from rice bran, apple pectin, and plantain (Table 5). The research team instructed participants to have (1) a shake for breakfast, (2) an approved fruit for a snack between breakfast and lunch, (3) a shake and approved vegetables for lunch, (4) vegetables as a snack between lunch and dinner, and (5) 4 to 6 oz of acceptable protein with vegetables for dinner (Table 6). The research team did not require participants to monitor consumed calories strictly, allowing participants flexibility in making healthful choices within the guidelines of the program. The research team retrospectively determined through self-reports that participants generally consumed between 850 to 1000 kcal daily. The daily minimal amount of macronutrients consumed while adhering to the diet was 45 g to 60 g of protein, 22 g to 25 g of fat, and 60 g to 70 g of carbohydrates. ReSULTS To analyze the study's data, the research team used SPSS 17.0 Table 2.

For the Detox Question-naire, the team summed the scores for the items in each of the 15 scales to compute the scale scores and also summed the 15 scale scores to compute the total score for each participant. The indi-vidual scales had a possible range of 0 to 32 (4 times the number of items in the scale). Note that a lower number on each of these scales represents lower toxicity. Table 7 shows that the median dropped from pre-to-post for 11 scales (the other four were already 0 at preintervention) and for the overall total. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that a statistically significant pre-to-post decline occurred in the detox-symptom scale scores for all 15 scales and for the overall totals, representing a decline in toxicity as measured by medical symptoms. Furthermore, from pre-to-post, the overall total for the detox scale score declined an average of 66.3% across participants (standard devi-ation [SD] = 18.7), from a mean preintervention of 58.1 to a mean postintervention of 18.9. The median decline was 67.6%, and the range of the decline across subjects was 0% to 95.7%, again showing a large pre-to-post decline in the medical symptoms of toxicity. Participants lost an average of about 9 lbs from pre-to-post, as Table 8 shows. Twenty-nine participants lost weight and two gained over the approximately 4-week period. A paired samples t-test showed a highly significant weight loss, t (30) = 8.085, P < .001. Average BMI also declined significantly, from 29.2 at preintervention to 27.8 at postintervention (Table 8), with a paired samples t -test showing t (30) = 8.701, P < .001. Finally, the research team calculated Pearson correlations to determine whether a relationship existed between participants' amount of weight loss and the amount of decline in their overall detox score. The number of lbs lost correlated only very mini-mally with the percentage change in overall detox score (r = 0.199) and with the pre-to-post difference (obtained by subtraction) in the detox questionnaire scores (r = -0.290), and neither rela- tionship was statistically significant. The change in BMI (post minus pre) also correlated minimally with these detox outcomes, r = -0.283 and r = 0.216, respectively. Thus, while participants' scores declined significantly on toxicity as measured by all 15 detox scales and by the overall total detox scale for medical symp-toms and while participants showed a statistically significant weight loss, the research team found no relationship between the amount of weight lost and the amount of change in toxicity. The Figure is a visual representation of the relationship between weight loss and change in detox symptoms score. It shows the rela-tionship with the Pearson correlation of 0.199 discussed above. Each circle in the scatterplot represents one participant's weight loss and change in detox symptom scores. If the circles fell into a linear shape, the scatterplot would show a strong relationship between weight loss and change in toxicity symptoms. The fact that the scatterplot has very little pattern (is a \"blob\") shows that virtually no relationship exists between the amount of decline in toxicity symptoms as measured by the questionnaire and the number of pounds lost. DIScUSSIon The objective of this retrospective chart review was to clarify the amount of weight loss and symptom reduction to be expected from following a low-calorie, meal replacement-enhanced detox diet. While this diet generally provides between 800 kcal to 1200 kcal per day, with adjustments to provide more as described below, the participants in the current study consumed between 850 kcal to 1000 kcal per day. The results achieved during the 4-week period compared favorably with the weight loss and improved symptoms scores that researchers have seen with other diets. The study showed a significant amount of weight loss in partic - ipants who followed the detox diet. Participants lost an average of Table 5.

Additionally, from the initial visit to the follow-up visit 3 to 5 weeks later, all 15 symptoms had statistically significant levels of improvement, and the overall total of the detox symptoms scores declined an average of 66.3% across participants. These results compare favorably with symptoms scores in other detox studies using the same questionnaire, which showed improvement of 47% at 1 week 12 and 52% at 10 weeks.10 The research team postulates that these changes come from improvements in phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification pathways as the result of consuming nutrient-dense foods as previously suggested by Bland. 13 Another possible expla- nation for improvement is that participants eliminated inflamma-tory substances\u2014allergenic foods or toxic elements\u2014from their diets and thereby decreased systemic inflammation, allowing for more effective detoxification. This improvement in symptoms is Table 7 .

To subscribe, visit imjournal.com Symptom Relief and Weight Loss From Detox Dietimportant because numerous individuals with a constellation of seemingly unrelated symptoms could consider using a detox diet in their treatment strategies to improve symptom control. Also important to note is that no significant increase in symptoms occurred from adhering to the detox diet, so the diet appears to be safe for patients of doctors in a general medical practice. Furthermore, the study found no relationship between the amount of weight loss and the amount of change in detoxification symptom scores, which is important for participants who would like to participate in a detox diet but do not want to lose weight. One way to ensure that an individual will not lose weight on this plan is to add more starchy vegetables from Table 3 to the diet. Detoxification diets possibly work by eliminating a particular food or toxin from a person's body. Therefore, if the underlying cause of an individual's symptoms is not the food in his or her diet or a toxin but rather some other cause, weight loss will not necessarily result. For example, if the patient has an undiagnosed underactive thyroid, the medical practitioner should identify and correct the problem to ensure proper metabolic function. If the doctor can find no such underlying cause and a person's weight and symptoms return when he or she resumes the pre-detox diet routine, some food or lifestyle habit may be playing a role in the person's health. Finally, it is important to recognize possible placebo effects for the outcomes reported. Because the study is a retrospective chart review, the potential for selection bias existed. Also, the individuals who participated may have been highly motivated to achieve a successful outcome, which may not be reproducible in other prac - tice situations. Additionally, the research team followed partici-pants only for up to 5 weeks, and it is uncertain whether individuals can maintain the results over a longer duration of time. The results confirm the hypothesis that a low-calorie, meal replacement-enhanced detox diet does help individuals lose a significant amount of weight and does improve symptom scores significantly. A controlled trial with a larger number of subjects and long-term follow-up would be useful in determining any differences due to gender as well as the capacity for individuals to maintain their weight loss and to continue to improve their symptoms. To determine whether participants are able to main-tain the benefits described in this article, researchers should perform studies to clarify whether or not metabolic risk factors will improve with a meal replacement-enhanced detox diet.
