The Spiritual in us, finds the Spiritual in the Universe\" Welcome to the first episode of 2020! Today I'm interviewing the warm and wonderful Dale Brunsvold, the voice of Rudolf Steiner Audio. I've wanted to record a podcast about Rudolf Steiner for a long time. I made one years ago but I no longer think its worth being up, it was the first podcast I ever recorded. So I'm so happy to have Dale along to give an introductory (-ish, it gets pretty deep yo) picture of Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy. We start off talking about Dale and his relationship to Anthroposophy, the Christian community and how Rudolf Steiner Audio came to be. When we talk of Steiner, we discuss his childhood, his education, the cultural climate he was surrounded by, his involvement with theosophy, his stance towards communism, the three fold social order, reincarnation, how people like Goethe, Nietzsche, and the humble herb gather Felix had an influence on him, who his 'Masters' were, Goethe's Theory of colour, and so so so much more. I must apologise for the audio quality as I think my cell phone data made it sound a bit average, but I think its totally listenable and the content is so rad its worth listening too. Also around 40mins through my 3 year old can slightly be heard having a melt down :l #momlife. You can listen to SO many lectures at www.rudolfsteineraudio.com, feel free to donate to help Dale keep it running. Files on here can be streamed or downloaded. Or if you want them from Podbean: "}
