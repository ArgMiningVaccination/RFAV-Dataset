They're an ideal introduction to non-toxic living for yourself or a loved one. 1. Big Dipper Beeswax Candles Conventional candles are a mix of proprietary chemicals that release a blend of cancer-causing compounds like formaldehyde and VOCs in the air. Beeswax candles are a safe alternative and make a great house warming gift. I love Big Dipper Beeswax candles. [SHOP BIG DIPPER BEESWAX CANDLES](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Big+Dipper+Wax+Works/page/6F8B4FCC-78C8-48A3-8F3B-D46A23B4D820/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_bln&linkCode=ll2&tag=natbabmam-20&linkId=eb7ee54752bfd130977861465169d533&language=en_US) 2. Moon Valley Organic Hand Lotion Moon Valley organic lotion bar is certified organic and can easily be carried anywhere. I love that it lasts such a long time! Another great lotion is [Dr. Bronner's Organic Magic Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Arnica-Menthol-Massaging-Respiratory/dp/B01LXE0TP5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1VEX7JCM4BSXL&dchild=1&keywords=dr+bronners+magic+balm&qid=1607063209&sprefix=dr+bronners+mag,aps,363&sr=8-18&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=natbabmam-20&linkId=415ae0f7dbbc09dbd646f79a26d878d3&language=en_US).

Moon Valley Organic Chapstick What you put on your lips is likely to be ingested, so gift yourself (or a loved one) with a non-toxic chapstick for colder days or sunburned lips. I always keep a Moon Valley chapstick in my bag. It lasts for hours and doubles as a lip moisturizer.

Moon Valley Bar Soap Moon Valley Organics is one of my favorite non-toxic soap brands. The bar soap is a household essential-I even take one with me on road trips. The bar soap cleans and moisturizes your body and I find it not as drying as other non-toxic soap brands. Must-Haves Under $25 If you're new to non-toxic living, trying affordable alternatives is the best way to see how easy it is to begin. Below are the best non-toxic essentials under $25. 5. Kooshoo Organic Hair Ties Did you know most hair ties are made from plastic and shed polyester that transfers to clothes and the environment? Kooshoo biodegradable hair ties are made of organic cotton and natural rubber. The best part is they hold my hair better than any other hair tie I've used (they also last longer than other brands). They're machine washable and double as a bracelet. They are more expensive, but I find myself losing them less and having less guilt that they'll end up in a landfill.

Nourishing Meals Cookbook Nourishing Meals is my bible for vegetarian, vegan, seafood, and meat dishes. It includes over three hundred recipes and instructions and also tips on organizing your kitchen and storing food. This cookbook will become a staple for anyone that wants to cook healthy meals for the entire family. All recipes are gluten-free and so good! This cookbook seriously changed our lives.

Simple Ecology Organic Tote Bag The Simple Ecology organic shipping bag doubles as our beach bag, swim bag, and temporary diaper bag. It's washable, and it is [GOTS certified](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Ecology-Reusable-shopping-washable/dp/B00J8TR1I8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=simple+ecology+organic+shopping+bags&qid=1605252432&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=natbabmam-20&linkId=15a0675f99b57e2973293d84b41fb1e8&language=en_US).

Meliora Laundry Detergent Conventional laundry detergent is full of toxins that disrupt hormones and cause skin irritation. You may not even know that you or someone in your family is sensitive until you switch to natural alternatives. Meliora laundry powder is my favorite non-toxic clothing must-have. It's made with only three ingredients: baking soda, washing soda, and vegetable soap. You'll never switch back to toxic, smelly detergents again. [Read the full guide on non-toxic laundry detergent here ](https://naturalbabymama.com/non-toxic-laundry-detergent/) [SHOP MELIORA LAUNDRY DETERGENT](https://www.amazon.com/Meliora-Cleaning-Products-Unscented-Standard/dp/B01DC1D4JM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=SUYAKWQ4ZNIJ&dchild=1&keywords=meloria+laundry+detergent&qid=1606970352&sprefix=meloria+l,aps,543&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=natbabmam-20&linkId=49100bbd035e91a7746a34b9a6b335f7&language=en_US) 9. Toups & CO Mascara Conventional mascaras can cause itchiness, redness, and expose you to toxins. Since cosmetics aren't regulated for ingestion like food or drugs, they include toxins like formaldehyde, lead, mercury, and other heavy metals. Toups mascara is made from organic and natural ingredients. It stays on all day, and it works just as well as my old toxic, conventional mascara. I was on a hunt for years that compared to my old mascara, and I finally found it in Toups Long Lash mascara. It's my one beauty essential. 10. Poofy Organic Eyeliner Poofy Organics sells organic, natural, and non-toxic personal care products, cleaning supplies, and makeup. They are one of the few natural makeup brands that consistently test for heavy metals and share their test results. The Poofy Organic eyeliner works well and is free of toxins commonly found in conventional makeup brands. 11. Under the Nile Terry Wipes These Under the Nile Terry wipes are made of GOTS certified organic cotton. I've used these since my children were babies. First to wipe up spit, then spills, now they are our go-to for everything. We use them from everything from wiping tables and countertops to our paper towel alternatives. Over the years we have accumulated a lot of these, they wash well and have held up to a lot of use!

Fox Run baking sheet 13. Fox Run Mini Muffin Pan Must-Haves Under $50 These must-haves under $50 will become your new daily essentials. 14. Hydroflask Stainless Steel Water Bottle Hydroflask is my favorite, earth-centered company for water bottles. The stainless steel Hydroflask is lead and chemical-free, and it won't leach hormone-disrupting plastics into your water. Best of all, since it is insulated, it will keep your favorite beverage (or food) hot or cold for hours. [Find the full list of 21 non-toxic lunch essentials here ](https://naturalbabymama.com/non-toxic-lunch-box/) 15. Merkur Safety Razor Disposable razors are not only wasteful and bad for the earth but the moisturizing strip is full of toxins. Moving over to a safety razor is such an easy switch! Merkur is made in Germany. 16. Luminance Organic Skin Care Luminance skincare is an affordable, organic brand with zero toxins. Every ingredient is organic, raw, and vegan. Conventional skincare products are full of Masking Scents that cover up the smell of chemicals in products, says Kim, the Luminance founder. The [Rosewater Toner](https://luminanceskincare.com/products/wild-crafted-rosewater-toner/ref/316/), [Tamarind Seed Moisturizer](https://luminanceskincare.com/products/premium-tamarind-seed-moisturizer/), and [Delicate Facial Cleanser](https://luminanceskincare.com/products/delicate-facial-cleanser/ref/316/) are three of my favorite products.

The small rug is perfect in front of the entryway or as a play mat. My kids are in and out of the house all day and these rugs really help stop some of the dirt and debris. Plus, allergens like pollen and household dust get trapped in rugs, so I love that the Under the Nile rug is washable and folds up for easy storage. This rug is often sold-out so you just have to keep checking back to see when they get new inventory. [SHOP UNDER THE NILE ORGANIC RUG](https://underthenile.com/products/small-rug) 18. CRUNCHI SUNLIGHT Organic, non-toxic sunblock for your face that rubs in (and doesn't leave a white sheen!). 19.

Just using the Gua Sha is a great self-care gift. 20. Crunchi Makeup Clean, non-toxic beauty that tests for heavy metals and toxins. Prices vary from product to product. Must-Haves Under $100 My favorite essentials under $100 are essentials that won't break or tear after one season. You'll buy less and won't create waste when investing in high-quality items for yourself and your family. 21. Terrathreads Organic Cotton Backpack Terrathreads makes organic canvas backpacks, duffel, and gym bags. These are one of the few GOTS certified organic cotton backpacks.

We use them not only for baking dishes but storing leftovers. We also use them for cookies or any other desserts we make. It's the perfect alternative to non-stick or aluminum bakeware. 25.

Pure Effect Water Purifier Drinking clean, filter water free of toxins is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Tap water has been shown to have countless numbers of toxins. If you are drinking from plastic water bottles, they results aren't much better. By getting a water filter, you will be cutting down on landfill pollution. The Pure Effects water filter is the best for overall toxin removal and fluoride. I have personally tested this water filter multiple times. Pure Effect has options for an above counter sink filter and an under-counter sink filter, whichever fits your needs best.

Soaring Heart Organic Pillow Your bed should be one of the most non-toxic places in your home. My favorite pillow is the Soaring Heart 100% organic GOTS certified wool firm pillow. You do not want your head resting on toxins found in conventional pillows. Things like formaldehyde, pesticides, and petroleum-based products. If you don't have an [organic mattress](https://naturalbabymama.com/non-toxic-crib-mattress/) already, that should be a top priority as well! [SHOP SOARING HEART ORGANIC PILLOW](https://soaringheart.com/collections/bed-pillows/products/organic-wool-pillows-1?variant=39685275530) 31. Organic Mattress This is a big one but having your sleep environment be as non-toxic as possible is important. After all, we spend a lot of time sleeping each day. Flame retardants aren't as commonly used in conventional mattresses anymore but some companies do still use them. In addition to flame retardants, VOCs and formaldehyde are common toxins in conventional mattresses. These toxins are linked to respiratory issues, endocrine disruption, and even some are linked to cancer. Some of my favorite certified organic mattress companies are: [Soaring Heart](https://soaringheart.com/)- 5% off with code Natural Baby Mama [My Green Mattress](https://www.mygreenmattress.com/partner/Naturalbabymama/) [Naturepedic](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=RCaDTy2oBBA&offerid=510662.10000470&type=3&subid=0) I hope you found this non-toxic living must-haves round-up helpful.
