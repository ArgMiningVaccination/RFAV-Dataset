Dee Cee's Professional High-Potency Manganese Disc-Gard\u00ae+ formula nutritionally supports weakened ligaments helping to hold the intravertable discs in the correct position relieving pressure of the spinal nerves. However, the addition of a High-Potency Manganese Supplement is not a cure-all.

Alarm bells for women DCs The chiropractic industry over the next 12 months will further feel the impact of one of the COVID pandemic's silent victims \u2014 women chiropractors leaving the profession. Driven by the economic impact of COVID-19 and child care issues, the approximate 25% of U.S. chiropractors who are female that serve the roughly 57% of chiropractic patients who are female has likely already dropped, possibly significantly, according to the latest employment statistics. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of women entering the chiropractic profession was on an extended upswing, from roughly 13% in the early 1990s to 31% in 2019, according to Logan University. Many of these women chiropractors served a more holistic role for their women patients, acting as their primary caregiver, with nearly half their patients age 30-64 according to the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners. By January 2020, women had edged out men in the overall workforce, but the forced exodus from COVID-19 is shaping a very different workplace: More than 5.4 million women's jobs were eliminated from the U.S. workforce between February 2020 and January 2021; Since March 2020, at least 2.3 million women have left the U.S. workforce, compared with 1.8 million men; 67% of mothers with children under age 10 say child care is one of their top three challenges during COVID-19; Since March 2020, 28% of women with kids under age 18 at home have temporarily or permanently left the workforce to become a primary caregiver to their children, compared with 10% of men; Women of color are being hit disproportionately hard, with 9.1% of Latinas and 8.4% of Black women unemployed, a more than 50% increase compared with 5.7% of white women; More than 2 in 5 of the 12.2 million women's jobs lost between February and April 2020 have not yet returned * Statistics excerpted from Businessolver's white paper, \"Where Have All the Women Gone?\" \"It's really concerning,\" Rachel Thomas, co-founder and CEO of Leanin.org, told CNBC. \"... we see that women are taking on more work in the office around employee well-being, as well as advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which means their workloads just going up and up and up.\" Forbes magazine in covering what it terms the \"Great Resignation\" says the key in coming years will be to recruit and mentor women while at the same time providing a community for support, including mentorship, resources and meaningful advancement opportunities.

The Body Issue New Revelations in Patient Care ChiroEco.com/ magazineTWITTER DISCUSSIONSOCIALMARKETING How do you display the supplements, orthotics and other retail products you offer for sale to patients in your practice?Make sure you're using these two types of content marketing Consider implementing these strategies for marketing your practice: * Video marketing . In a \"Think with Google\" survey of 12,000 people, one-half of millennial (people born between 1981-96) and Generation Z (people born between 1997-12) respondents indicated they didn't know how they'd manage without video. This same survey found webisodes, tutorials, and short video clips were most appealing to younger viewers. With 46% watching in the hopes of learning something new, think about what you can teach that they don't already know. For example, if they have sciatica, which exercises can help? Individuals surveyed also indicated they prefer user-generated content. If a patient posted a video of themselves walking without pain for the first time in months, this is an example of user- generated content that you may want to post on your website (after obtaining permission). * Landing pages . A landing page is a web page, within your website, designed for a singular purpose. Marketing expert Neil Patel says that when he started creating individual landing pages for his search engine optimization (SEO) guides, his search traffic increased almost three times. If the purpose of your landing page is to increase leads, you might use it to offer visitors a free e-book on back pain in exchange for their name and email address. Conversely, if the purpose is to increase product sales, the page could supply information about your best-selling product (what it is, how it works, who should use it, etc.) with a \"buy now\" link at the bottom. \u2014 Christina DeBuskEach month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

Our technology can accomplish scalable weight loss with a precise combination of specic frequencies from both red and infrared laser light energy. The combination of dual coherent frequencies enables the light energy to penetrate deep into adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat) generating a signicant response in cellular functions and stimulation of the body's natural metabolism. Technology stimulates cellular respiration, lymphatic function and increases the metabolism through the synthesis of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

BUYERSBUYERS GUIDE 68 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 28, 2021 CHIROECO.COMToday's readers can get access to the entire system of proven referral generation strategies when scanning the QR code below Here's How Paul's System Works Many chiropractors know this, but few do anything about it - personal injury attorneys will (and want to) refer their Pl clients to you. But... you need to approach these attorneys in a specific way so they would be glad to keep your phone ringing with Pl patients. Paul's system reveals EXACTLY what to do to get these lawyers to send their clients to YOU rather than to your competition (you'll be surprised at the ways Paul has come up with and how effectively they work. Every. Single. Time. When you implement them properly). What would it look like if you got 4 extra Pl cases each month? What about 8? Or 20? What's the average bill for a Pl patient? $5,000? At just one more Pl case per week, you have just put $20,000 in your pocket. 100% Success Rate Yes, you read that right. This system is GUARANTEED to get more attorney-referral Pl patients, or your money back, once you implement what you discover inside. The best part is that even those who find marketing unbearable enjoy Paul's system and see results. Better Zzzzz For You Listen, here's the bottom line. When you discover Paul's referral system to get more Pl patients from Pl attorneys, you're getting peace of mind. And at a practical level, that means you get to sleep a little bit more soundly at night knowing that everything you've worked so hard for will continue growing in the morning. Risk-Free With A Moneyback Guarantee It's a fact; you might think you're getting enough patients today, but would you really like to continue chasing people to come to your practice? Wouldn't it feel great to have someone else do all the hard work for you and send you the most compliant patients so you can only focus on what you enjoy the most? You'll finally be able to have the time to spend with your friends and family and do the things you've always wanted to do -- without being tortured by the constant thought of 'How to get more patients.' If you worry about getting more patients and you're fed up of wasting money on ineffective advertising ... now your problems may be over at lastVeteran Personal Injury Attorney Reveals How Chiropractors Can Get An Endless Stream Of Personal Injury Patients ...

As a teenager Dr. Allen became an audiophile, going so far as to manufacture and sell high-end stereo equipment by the early 1980s. He later came to understand that the chiropractor's goal of balancing and creating harmony in the human body is similar to balancing a room for sound. Now that Spinal Acoustics is a reality, the company's motto is, \"Replacing the Sense of Touch with the Science of Sound.\" As a student at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in the late 1980s, Dr. Allen was tasked by the computer department to build a test rig to measure the speed of a toggle adjustment on a Compaq computer equipped with a piezoelectric load cell. He observed that other than the force, the speed or frequency of the adjustment varied the most among practitioners. Afterwards, Dr. Walter Pierce enlisted Dr. Allen to build a video X-ray computer for his Video X-Ray system in order to measure the outcomes of an adjustment using video fluoroscopy. This resulted in a teleradiology unit in 1988 that was more sophisticated than other units used at the time. At about the same time, Dr. Pierce was working on a non-computer based \"kinetic\" adjusting device with Joseph Evans, PhD. The goal was to eventually make a computerized adjusting instrument based on a load cell or a piezo electric sensor that Dr. Allen had worked with at Palmer. Dr. Allen, who had by then opened his practice in nearby Beaver County, joined the effort and brought along his ideas of frequencies as the main difference between practitioners. Dr. Allen obtained permission from Dr. Evans to modify the instrument for variable frequencies. The result was the first computer-based adjusting instrument known as the Pulstar FRAS. This device is still marketed today by Sense Technologies. By 1995 Dr. Allen again went to work, this time with Tamas Besce, a Pittsburgh engineer, to develop a PC-based adjusting device with more capabilities. That effort culminated in the creation of Sigma Instruments and the Smart Adjuster. The basis of the Smart Adjuster is its piezoelectric sensor, an ultrasonic crystal used essentially for the measurement of pressure. In the view of Dr. Allen, the piezoelectric sensor represented state-of- the-art technology for its time. However, the limitations in its ability to continuously measure human tissue, combined with the tendency of the crystal to break, left him with the need to once again move the technology forward. The result is the VSTAAR \u2014 the newest and most advanced FDA-approved adjusting instrument marketed today. Unlike any other adjusting instrument, the heart of the VSTAAR is its LVDT sensor technology. The closest proximity to human touch available, the LVDT sensor provides a continuous reading throughout the entire movement of the adjusting head, rather than a fixed snapshot at a single point in time. This distance/ time factor, combined with a known force setting, accomplishes Dr. Allen's long-held goals. The adjusting head of the VSTAAR is essentially a magnetic rail gun rather than a solenoid and spring. It strikes significantly faster than any other device while not overheating. The instrument enables the doctor to identify a patient's issues before they become problems, and validates the need for sub-symptomatic care. Along with his wife and office administrator, Michele, Dr. Allen's chiropractic practice adds new patients weekly as a result of the excellent clinical outcomes that they are able to achieve with the VSTAAR. His practice regularly receives multiple cross- discipline professional referrals. \"We continually pride ourselves in identifying whether our patients need something other than chiropractic care, or whether chiropractic care alone is going to be effective,\" says the father of his son, a successful chiropractor, and his daughter, a nurse practitioner and Afghan war vet, and his youngest son, a 3D animation and 3D computer modeling specialist. \"This is the instrument that should have been built in the first place.\" INDUSTRY INFLUENCERS \u2014 THE INTRIGUING STORY OF DR.

Spinal Acoustics is proud to announce the development of This landmark adjusting and analysis system enables clinicians to objectively locate joint dysfunction in the spinal column by measuring true compliance. The system pulses on each segment of the spine with a low energy mechanical impulse and records the impulse in real time. The results are displayed in various graphic forms as a graph of the relative compliance of the spine. Since the system does not use ionizing radiation such as x-ray or gamma radiation it is safely used on each patient on every visit. This device is 510K cleared for use by Chiropractors, PTs, MDs & DVMs. The device prototyping has been completed after 5 years. It is the only instument that has a force that is within .1% within & measures in real-time distance down to 5 one thousands of an inch. This is the only instrument using the same sensor as the highly accurate daVinci X and Xi TM Surgical Robots & totally simulates human touch.

You can't just hang up a banner to let your local community know that you exist, for instance, or put a flashing sign in your window. Even if you place these items on your website or social media pages, you're fighting against every other company on the internet. You become just one more business in a sea of businesses, reducing your ability to stand out enough to get any real attention. One strategy to consider is geotargeting marketing. Geotargeted marketing As its name suggests, geotargeting involves targeting potential patients based on geography, or where they live. This is crit - ical for businesses that offer in-person services since, while attracting attention outside of your geographical area can get you noticed in the online world, it won't necessarily bring more people into your practice. In simple terms, geotargeting is achieved by looking for IP addresses within your local community and targeting the users of these devices. Just as you used to know where someone lived based on their area code and home phone number, the IP address on a computer (and other similar electronics) provides the same type of information. It reveals the user's state, city and more. Reaching out to electronic addresses within your vicinity increases your ability to connect with the people who could benefit from your chiropractic services. You can do this with various online ad platforms, such as Google Ads or Facebook Ads. When setting up your ad, ask it to target users within your local area. Best practices for growing a social media community Once you've targeted your local community with geotargeting marketing, how do you get them to interact with you online, growing your social media following? Here are a few best practices: Make video a priority \u2014 Cisco estimates that, in 2021, 80% of all internet traffic is video \u2014 a four-fold increase over the amount of video traffic experienced in 2016. Instead of posting still images of your practice, post videos. Shoot a short clip of you talking about a new service or show your online community how to do stretches to ease their back pain, showing your personality and earning trust. Encourage sharing and tagging \u2014 Part of the value behind social media is, if handled correctly, your followers can help build your online community. An example of the latter would be to create an online post celebrating athletes in your community, then ask followers to tag the athlete in their life who they are most proud of. Offer helpful tips and advice \u2014 Give people a reason to include you in their social media news feed by regularly providing ways to advance their musculoskeletal health. Share the proper way to pick up heavy items, talk about which supplements are good for strong bones, or offer tips for relieving neck pain after a long day in front of the computer. Establish yourself as the local expert on health. Hold contests and giveaways \u2014 There's a reason millions of people flock to Las Vegas every year. It's human nature to want to \"win big\" or to get something for nothing, or next to nothing. Holding a contest or free giveaway on your social media pages satisfies this same need. Prizes might include a free adjustment or massage or product that you sell. Geotargeting marketing helps identify who to target, while implementing these other strategies can increase their desire to connect. Both can build your online community while growing your physical practice at the same time.

Your patients count on you to help them through this difficult time, as do your family and friends. If you're a business owner your employees are counting on you also. In pre-pandemic times there was less to worry about and it was easier to find mental escapes and downtime. Now we're trying to create that new normal as a society, trying to make it look as close to the old normal we can, for both doctors of chiropractic and their patients. WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER Last year we told the story of the two young chiropractors who 30 years ago attained their DC degrees, both near the top of the same graduating class and full of enthusiasm to enter chiropractic care. When they returned for their 30-year reunion, both were married with family and had stayed in touch over the years. But while one worked in a multi-doctor practice, the other had founded his own multi-location practice and as CEO was contemplating an early retirement. THE DIFFERENCE? How and why did the two DC's paths diverge? Both sought success. Both were near the top of their class in school. Both entered the field with enthusiasm. The difference-maker was the business of chiropractic - learning the economics of the industry. The eventual CEO subscribed to Chiropractic Economics and gained the knowledge to take his practice to the next level. LET OUR KNOWLEDGE BE YOUR POWER Chiropractic Economics is the only BPA Audited publication requested by over 20,000 Doctors of Chiropractic.
