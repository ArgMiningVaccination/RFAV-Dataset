An understanding of the essence of various herbal components gives the TCM practitioner a way to create a healing effect that reaches beyond the chemical [composition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition) and physical properties of the herbs. The practitioner chooses the herbal formula whose essence, or signature energy vibration, correctly stimulates or adjusts the body's own energy vibration. Chinese herbal formulas, some in use for more than 2,200 years, are composed of ingredients chosen to function in combination with each other. In Western [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine), medications are usually prescribed individually for a specific effect. In classical TCM herbal formulas, each herb has a different purpose or role to help the body achieve harmony. For a plant to have been included in the Chinese apothecary, each of its parts had to be identified for a different healing purpose. TCM also looks at the healing properties of foods in the same way. Different foods carry different energies that can go directly to specific organs to help them heal. Modern developments Various Western scientific [disciplines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disciplines) have conducted studies to learn how Chinese medicine works, but it is difficult to use a Western yardstick to measure Eastern medicine. For example, many studies on [acupuncture](https://www.britannica.com/science/acupuncture) involve research that attempts to prove that this [modality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/modality) can eliminate or reduce [pain](https://www.britannica.com/science/pain) or [alleviate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviate) certain conditions. However, this elementary approach ignores the deeper insight and experience of Chinese medicine that the [human body](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-body) has unlimited healing power and that the complementary energies of health and disease reflect the [yinyang](https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang) principle within the human body. [Genetics](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease) research and [drug](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-chemical-agent) development The yinyang principle can be applied to a [genetic disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease) such as inherited [breast cancer](https://www.britannica.com/science/breast-cancer) and its associated [genes](https://www.britannica.com/science/gene) BRCA1 and BRCA2. According to this principle of [natural law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/natural-law), if either of these genes is activated, somewhere in another part of the [genetic code](https://www.britannica.com/science/genetic-code) there also exists a gene to fix the action of the [cancer](https://www.britannica.com/science/cancer-disease) gene, because there is an opposite energy to the one that produced the disease. There must be complementary programs running\u2014one for developing the disease and one for healing it. Nearly 200 modern medicines have been developed either directly or indirectly from the 7,300 species of plants used as medicines in [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China). For example, [ephedrine](https://www.britannica.com/science/ephedrine), an [alkaloid](https://www.britannica.com/science/alkaloid) used in treating [asthma](https://www.britannica.com/science/asthma), was first isolated from the Chinese herb mahuang. Today, scientists continue to identify [compounds](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compounds) in Chinese herbal remedies that may be useful in the development of new therapeutic agents applicable in Western medicine. For example, an alkaloid called huperzine A was isolated from the [moss](https://www.britannica.com/plant/moss-plant) Huperzia serrata, which is widely used in China to make the herbal medicine qian ceng ta. Studies suggest that this agent may compare favourably with manufactured [anticholinesterase](https://www.britannica.com/science/anticholinesterase) drugs such as donepezil, which are used to treat [Alzheimer disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/Alzheimer-disease). [Meditation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/meditation-mental-exercise) [qigong](https://www.britannica.com/topic/qigong) (\"discipline of the vital breath\") are examples of other [integral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integral) features of traditional Chinese healing that have been incorporated into health and fitness programs to complement modern medicine. Tai chi is characterized by deliberately slow, continuous, circular, well-balanced, and rhythmic movements that were originally practiced as a [martial art](https://www.britannica.com/sports/martial-art). Qigong, which was known in ancient China as \"the method to repel illness and prolong life,\" contains elements of meditation, relaxation training, martial-arts techniques, and breathing exercises that are intended to [cultivate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivate) [qi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/qi-Chinese-philosophy) and transmit it to all the bodily organs. Today, many people worldwide regularly perform these exercises to promote health and may indeed derive health benefits from the exercise and relaxation. History of Chinese medicine The four major periods Between the 29th century bce and the 16th century ce Chinese medicine passed through four major periods. The first, from the 29th to 27th centuries bce, was the time of the three emperors, primarily an era of [myth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth) and [legend](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend) with only approximate dating of events. The events of the next 2,000 years are obscure, but a slow growth of medical knowledge and gradual changes in medical practice can be assumed. The second period was a mixture of legend and fact centred on the career of [Bian Qiao](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bian-Qiao) (Bian Que)\u2014about whom [anecdotal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anecdotal) material dates to the first half of the 5th century bce. The third period was that of the great practitioners, the physicians [Zhang Zhongjing](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zhang-Zhongjing) and [Wang Shuhe](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wang-Shuhe) and the surgeon [Hua Tuo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hua-Tuo), running from about ce 150 to 300. The individuals and events were real, although [legends](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legends) have grown up around them. The final 1,300 years, featuring the [compilation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compilation) of encyclopaedic works and the writing of commentaries on earlier authors, produced little that was original. In the second half of the 16th century, [tenuous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenuous) communication began with medical representatives from the West, and the character of Chinese medicine began to change. Ancient Chinese emperors and medical texts The three emperors\u2014 [Fu Xi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fu-Xi), [Shennong](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shennong), and the bagua (\"eight trigrams\"), the symbolic basis for medical, philosophical, and astrological thinking. Shennong, called the founder of Chinese medicine, was also known as the Divine Husbandman. Huangdi, the famed Yellow Emperor who ruled in the 27th century bce, was at one time believed to have written the Huangdi neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic). However, the work was actually composed much later\u2014the 3rd century bce. Despite this discrepancy, the Huangdi neijing has been [revered](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/revered) for centuries and provides "}
