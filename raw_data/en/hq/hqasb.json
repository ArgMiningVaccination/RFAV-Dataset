Both fell in love with the stimulating, soothing traditional remedies, especially when feeling overwhelmed or stressed. They kept the inhalers on their office desks, and every time they felt irritated or overwhelmed at work, they took a deep breath and calmed their minds. Mia, a longtime exponent of aromatherapy, and Jasmine, a certified clinical aromatherapist, decided to bring together traditional Thai inhalers and Western aromatherapy. The resulting range of remedies was a stimulating yet calming collection of inhalers that mother and daughter carefully designed for specific purposes. Everything is carefully handmade, and all essential oils, spices, and herbs are organic, sustainably sourced, and fair-trade. Madison + Green is proud to be a company that is owned and run by women.
