A team at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) followed hundreds of women through their pregnancy and until their children were seven years old. Doctor Jacqueline Gould from SAHMRI said participants were given either a fish oil supplement or a placebo. \"Overall we found that there's been no benefit ... so the babies in this study don't seem to have any benefit to their brain development from their mothers taking fish oil,\" she said. \"Mainly we looked at their intelligence. So at 18 months we did some assessments with them, and again when they reached four years and just now when they turned seven.\" Dr Gould said some supplement companies had targeted pregnant women in their marketing. \"Back when we first started this study some of the supplement manufacturers were specifically marketing their supplements as being beneficial for babies' brain development,\" she said. \"So it definitely was a big motivator and a big driver for pregnant women to use these supplements.\" No effect on post-natal depression rates The study also looked at whether the supplements decreased the rate of post-natal depression among almost 2,500 women. \"There was no effects there either,\" Dr Gould said. \"But we did find slightly lower rates of depression in both groups, so it almost seemed like being part of the study where we had research nurses calling the mums regularly might have even prevented depression. \"We were actually expecting fish oil to show some benefits, both to brain development and to post-natal depression as well, and we didn't find either of those.\" The study did, however, uncover an unexpected benefit. \"The length of pregnancy increased just a little bit in the fish oil group, and that actually meant there were slightly fewer babies born very pre-term,\" Dr Gould said. \"We still have to do more work to find out whether or not this is a true effect of the fish oil, but that would be quite a significant benefit if "}
