[Close](javascript:;) Abstract This book has examined the ways in which healing courses through the lives of contemporary Japanese Zen women and how ritualized activities transform emotionally intense moments\u2014charged with fear, pain, and untamed anger\u2014into healing. By analyzing ritualized activities woven into daily life, the book has illuminated the concept of domestic Zen and the healing power of resourceful and resilient women. The women's stories and experiences inform, expand, and enrich our understanding of Buddhism, Japan, women, ritual, healing, field methodology, and Zen as they reveal to us their healing practices and wisdom. Engaging in ritualized activities that embody wisdom and compassion are the keys to Zen healing. This concluding chapter describes an \"Integrated Model of Healing and Illness,\" developed by religion and medical anthropology scholar Linda Barnes, and the Way of healing paradigm based on Japanese Zen Buddhism. It also discusses the art and science of Zen healing. access](javascript:;) Personal account - Sign in with email/username & password - Get email alerts - Save searches - Purchase content - Activate purchases and trials Institutional access - [Sign in through your institution](https://oup-sp.sams-sigma.com/shib?dest=RedirectUrlPlaceholder) - [Sign in with a library card](javascript:;) [Sign in with username / password](javascript:;) [Recommend to your librarian](/pages/get-help-with-access/recommend-to-your-librarian?title=Bringing+Zen+HomeThe+Healing+Heart+of+Japanese+Women%27s+Rituals&printISBN=9780824835354&collectionsite=Hawai%27i+Scholarship+Online) Institutional account management [Sign in as administrator](javascript:) Purchase Our books are available by subscription or purchase to libraries and "}
