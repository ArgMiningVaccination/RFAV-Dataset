After all, meditation has gone from \"woo woo\" to a common spiritual practice among some of the most successful entrepreneurs. But if you are looking to take spirituality to the next level, crystals can help elevate your mindset. Like meditation, there is a science behind the energy of crystals. It's called the [Piezoelectric effect](https://www.electronicdesign.com/power/what-piezoelectric-effect). Ever wonder why watches are marketed as having quartz movement? That's because quartz helps watches keep time properly. Quartz is also used in computer and radio components. According to Courtney Abbiati, who is the cofounder of [The Urban + The Mystic](http://www.theurbanandthemystic.com/), everyone should keep crystals on their desk. She sees this as an opportunity to bring healing energy to your life. While different spaces need different things, she says, \"The one thing that remains the same, regardless of occupation, is that everyone wants their work to bring them prosperity and joy.\" Those on the fence should know that crystals can also work psychosomatically. Just having the choice to perform a crystal ritual, either through intention setting or taking a short break from work, can help boost your productivity in spades. Whether you're an entrepreneur or part of a large corporation (and trying to move your way up the ladder), here are some crystals to keep on your desk as well as the best ways to use them. Black Tourmaline If you are just starting to use crystals and you only want to keep one on your desk, black tourmaline should be it. This crystal is particularly beneficial for people who work in large office environments with lots of different energies. Do you have a coworker next to you who talks loudly on the phone all day long? Or worse, complains about you to your manager? Black tourmaline is said to protect you from that negative energy. Black tourmaline also shields against [electromagnetic radiation fields](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-129/default.html) (EMFs) that are emitted from computers, cell phones and especially Wi-Fi. These waves can trigger stress, [anxiety](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-anxiety/), and fatigue, none of which you want to particularly experience at work. Avoiding EMFs entirely is impossible, but keeping a crystal on your desk is an effortless way to reduce your exposure. Even a small tumble stone on your laptop can help. Malachite According to Abbiati, malachite helps us let go of behaviors and things that no longer serve us. It's a transformational stone that she says lets fresh ideas come to the surface. \"What better energy to have in your office than something that keeps you vibrant and moving forward?\" Green Aventurine Are you trying to get more green in your life? Whether it's a big promotion, a bonus or a signed contract that lands you more money in the bank, green aventurine can help attract it. This stone is said to put you in the mindset to receive and attract prosperity into your life. It also helps improve creativity and optimism. Pyrite Pyrite looks like a giant piece of gold and can be just as valuable. \"Another incredible stone for your office, which I often recommend people place on their desk, is pyrite,\" says Abbiati. \"If a life coach were a crystal, it would be pyrite. This warrior stone helps motivate you, strengthen your willpower and determination. It pushes out negative vibes and ushers in success and prosperity.\" Smoky Quartz Is there too much going on in your life right now? No matter what is clouding your headspace, we all know too much throws us off balance. That's when smoky quartz comes in. Stop what you're doing, take a break and give yourself a moment with this stone. Hold the crystal between your hands. Close your eyes. Think about what's really important and prioritize. Take care of that proposal for next hour and worry about next week's meeting later. Then open your eyes and reset. Smoky quartz will help to reduce anxiety, stress and anything else that hinders you from focusing on the task at hand. You can now move forward in a more grounded state. Citrine Citrine is a great crystal to integrate into your morning routine. When you arrive at your desk, hold the crystal and set intentions and goals for the day. Think about what you need to do in the long and short term. It's time to get into a manifestation mindset. Then write it all out. Do this every single day. Amazonite Is communication becoming a nightmare? Does the team you're leading just not understand what it is you need them to do? If group projects have your head in a tailspin, amazonite can be a game changer. This stone is connected to your heart and throat chakras and will re-open the lines of communication making you a more effective leader. Tiger's Eye Do you have a big presentation coming up that's making you anxious? Do you need to feel more confident in your abilities? Keeping a small tiger's eye in your pocket can give you the courage you need to succeed. Selenite Selenite is a powerful crystal with many purposes. One use is charging all of your other crystals. Buy a selenite [charging plate](https://www.amazon.com/ThrowinStones-Selenite-Charging-Plate-Authentic/dp/B07F962S4W) for your desk to keep all your other crystals on.
