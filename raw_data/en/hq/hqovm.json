Bruce Halliday gets first prize for erudition and Heather Proctor gets honorable mention for rubbing my nose in Onychophora and pointing out that I should have been able to fill in the elided 'o'. I think I'll tell my students that Dufour was probably referring to the two pairs of tenent hair-like claws in Tetranychus and that Berlese's take on Oligonychus is a bit mysterious and ask them to make their own interpretations. This is probably a good time to point out an etymological mistake that I make in 'Mites - Ecology, Evolution & Behaviour'. On page 172, I claimed that erinea get their name from their red colour. However, Carlos Flechtmann kindly (and privately) pointed out that the word refers to the Greek for wool (or perhaps a hedgehog) and refers to the tufts of hairs.

The -nychus comes from onych (Greek), translated as claw or talon. In Dufour's original description of Tetranychus, he says that the tarsi \"....termine par quatre ongles claws\". Canestrini and Fanzago altre un ciuffetto di uncini\". I translate this as \"The first pair of legs end in a straight robust spine, the others with a tufted claw\", which is self-explanatory. And I'm afraid Berlese has me stumped with Oligonychus. Bruce Halliday *********************************************************** Dr. R. B.

I was told by a friend that cyclamen mites die when plants are placed in bags for about 1.5 - 2 months. I have searched the net everywhere and cannot find anything written anywhere about this. All I find is that Cyclamen mites thrive in humidity but nowhere does it mention that they will die in saturated air. This method of bagging to kill these pests seems a little too easy and too good to be true. I am part of a large group of people who share the passion of african violets. Cyclamen mites are unfortunately part of the game and then the pesticides come in and play. Can any of you confirm if this bagging could work or not and I would love to hear your thoughts about neem oil to rid cyclamen mites. If neem oil would be applied to the plant or the soil, would the mites actually starve to death or would the go into hybernation? Thankyou all for your time, I extremely hope one of you will take the time to answer. Tina. Dear All, I am doing a PhD using a mite & collembola / moss system. I have little mite experience. I'm interested in 2 things; 1: Can anyone spare a bit of time to look at my collection of MOSS MITE MORPHOSPECIES (approx 30 morphospecies)? I'm looking for general info such as whether my morphospecies are likely to be different species or whether they are different stage of development or sex of the same species. 2: Is anyone working with MOSS MITES or has anyone worked with them in the past, who is willing to exchange emails from time to time about moss mites (e.g. on behaviour, culturing, identification, literature etc.)? (For those who are interested, I'm using the moss / mite system as a microcosm for tests of the effectiveness of wildlife corridors) Thanks for your attention, Martin Hoyle. I lost H.Hajiqanbar email to answer him for help on identification of some Oribatid from Iran... If he or anyone whoo knows it, please send it back to me again... _________________________ | EDUARDO RUIZ | | Dep.

P.O. Box 18300 Greensboro, NC 27419-8300 Use Pattern and Formulations Actigard 50WG is a water-dispersible granular formulation containing 50% active ingredient. Acibenzolar is a selective, systemic compound which induces host plant resistance. This is aunique mode of action which mimics the natural systemic activated resistance (SAR) response found in most plant species. It has no direct effect on the target pests. Actigard is applied by ground or aerial equipment at the rate of 1.0 ounce of product per acre for the control of downy mildew on leafy vegetables (including Brassica (cole) leafy vegetables, bacterial spot and bacterial speck on tomatoes, and blue mold on tobacco. Boost 500SC is a soluble concentrate formulation which will be used only on bananas for importation. Acibenzolar-S-methyl Technical is a 98.6% solid (powder) formulation and is intended for use only in the manufacturing of end-use products. Science Findings Summary Science Statement: EPA has concluded from the review of the supporting data that there are no risks of concern from the use of acibenzolar-S-methyl. There was no significant acute toxicity in a battery of acute toxicity studies and no dermal sensitivity was detected with Actigard. It was calculated that the risk due to exposure to residues in food and water or in tobacco was below the Agency's level of concern for all population subgroups, including infants and children. Risk from exposure of workers (applicators and other handlers) was also below the Agency's level of concern. There are no residential uses of Actigard either registered or pending. The Agency also concluded that the use of Actigard for the labeled uses is unlikely to represent a significant threat to non-target organisms or the environment.

In chronic and subchronic oral studies with rats, dogs, and mice, signs of mild regenerative hemolytic anemia were consistently observed at or slightly above the LOAEL. Decreases in body weight, body weight gain, and/or food consumption were also observed in these studies. In rats and mice, acibenzolar-S-methyl was negative for carcinogenicity and in a battery of mutagenicity studies, technical-grade acibenzolar-S-methyl results were negative except in an in vitro chromosome aberration study with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The results from this test, however, are considered only suggestive of a possible aneuploidy effect. Positive results in a S. typhimurium reverse gene mutation assay were observed in a study conducted with a structural isomer (CGA-362020) of acibenzolar-S-methyl. Since this isomer is found at low levels (\u00f30.1%) in some batches of technical-grade acibenzolar-S-methyl manufactured by a new \"thiazole process,\" full batteries of mutagenicity studies with CGA-362020 and with acibenzolar-S-methyl manufactured by the \"thiazole process\" are required. Of significant toxicological concern was the finding of treatment-related developmental malformations, anomalies and variations in the developmental toxicity study in rats at dose levels equal to or below the NOAEL for maternal toxicity. At the highest dose level tested in this study (400 mg/kg/day), both maternal toxicity (hemorrhagic perineal discharge) and considerable developmental toxicity (including total litter resorptions, and fetal malformations, anomalies and variations) were observed. The fetal malformations noted at this dose level included treatment-related effects on nervous system tissues (hydrocephaly, craniorachisis and anophthalmia/ microphthalmia). At the lowest dose level tested (10 mg/kg/day), treatment-related umbilical hernias (considered to be a midline closure defect, along with omphalocele and gastroschisis which were observed at higher dose levels) were also observed. Therefore, no NOAEL for developmental toxicity was observed in this study and increased susceptibility of rat fetuses (as compared to adults) was evident. Further, in additional studies in rats, it was demonstrated that as few as two doses of test material could cause hemorrhagic perineal discharge and complete litter resorptions in dams. A similar increased susceptibility of fetuses or pups (as compared to adults) was not observed in a developmental toxicity study in rabbits or in a 2-generation or 1-generation (range-finding) study in rats. Occupational and Residential Exposure and Risk Characterization. Application of acibenzolar-S-methyl may be by ground or aerial equipment and may occur up to 6 times per growing season. Short- and intermediate-term exposures may occur. Chronic exposures are not expected. Potential mixer/loader and applicator exposures were estimated and assessed for both dermal and inhalation routes. The calculated margins of exposure (MOEs) for mixer/loaders and applicators range from 42,000 to 880,000 for dermal exposure and from 72,000 to 810,000 for inhalation exposure. The post application exposure was calculated based on hand harvesting of tomatoes for an exposure period of 8 hours. The post application MOE was estimated to be 5,400 on day 0 after application. The calculated MOEs for occupational exposure do no exceed the Agency's level of concern. At present there are no registered or proposed residential uses of acibenzolar-S-methyl. Therefore, a residential risk assessment was not performed. Since the registration of acibenzolar-S-methyl includes use on tobacco, an exposure assessment of risk from tobacco use was conducted. The short-term inhalation LOAEL is 10 mg/kg/day based on an oral rat development study. The short-term MOE for exposure through the use of tobacco is greater than 500,000 and is below the Agency's level of concern. Aggregate Exposure and Risk Characterization. 1. General Considerations. Based on the toxicological data base, the HED Hazard Identification Assessment Review Committee selected endpoints for acute dietary (females 13-50 only), chronic dietary (separate reference doses for females 13-50 versus all other population subgroups), dermal, and inhalation routes of exposure. The FQPA safety factor for acibenzolar-S-methyl has been retained at 10X when assessing acute and chronic dietary exposures for the females aged 13-50 years population subgroup. When assessing chronic dietary exposure for other populations, the FQPA safety factor was reduced to 3X. The Safety Factor Committee determined that the factor is required based on the demonstrated increased susceptibility of fetuses (compared to dams) in the rat developmental study, the observed developmental malformations in rat fetuses at the lowest dose tested, and the requirement for a developmental neurotoxicity study in rats. The tolerance expression for acibenzolar-S-methyl is for residues convertible to benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid (a.k.a. CGA-210007), expressed as acibenzolar. For purposes of risk assessment, residues of the 4- and 5-hydroxy metabolites (CGA-324041 and CGA-323060) of CGA-210007 should also be considered. For this purpose, the toxicity of CGA-324041 and CGA-323060 should be considered equivalent to that of the parent compound acibenzolar. These residues occur in significant quantities in lettuce and tomato. At this time, acibenzolar-S-methyl does not have common metabolites with other agrochemicals. The residues of concern for drinking water are the same as those listed in the tolerance expression; that is, residues convertible to CGA-210007. 2. Food. An acute dietary exposure assessment (food only) was performed using the distribution of residues observed in the crop field trials and the projected percent market share for the crops involved. The analysis used the Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM) to develop exposure and risk estimates for the population subgroup females 13 - 50 years of age. The refined dietary exposure estimate for this subgroup is 0.0029 mg/kg/day. This is equivalent to 87% of the acute population-adjusted dose (aPAD). This risk estimate does not exceed the Agency's level of concern. A chronic dietary exposure assessment using residue levels at the tolerance level and 100% of crop treated was performed using DEEM coupled with the 1989-1992 CSFII. The estimated dietary (food only) risks are generally less than 10% of the chronic population-adjusted dose (cPAD). An exception to this, due to the 10X FQPA safety factor, is the female 13+ population subgroups, which have risk estimates on the order of 52% of the cPAD. Risk estimates for all population subgroups, including infants and children, are below the Agency's level of concern. 3. Water. In drinking water, the residues of concern are acibenzolar-S-methyl and its degradate CGA-210007. These residues are non-persistent to slightly persistent in the environment under aerobic aquatic conditions in and are unlikely to reach surface or ground water. In an anaerobic aquatic environment, acibenzolar-S-methyl is considered to be slightly to moderately persistent. The Tier I estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) for acibenzolar-S-methyl from the GENEEC surface water model are 640 parts per trillion (ppt) and 20 ppt for the acute (peak) and chronic (56-day) values. The acute and chronic ground water EECs are both negligible. Aggregate Risk Assessments and Risk Characterization. Since there are no requested residential use sites for acibenzolar and current OPP policy does not include tobacco use when aggregating sources of exposure, only dietary exposure (food plus drinking water) will be considered when assessing aggregate risk for the requested uses of acibenzolar. The estimated acute exposure to acibenzolar-S-methyl from food is 0.0029 mg/kg/day. This exposure estimate is rather refined, incorporating field trial distributions and projected percent market share data and reflects the 99.9th percentile of exposure for the population subgroup females 13-50 years of age (the only population subgroup of concern for acute dietary exposure). Based on the aPAD of 0.0033 mg/kg/day for this exposure scenario/population subgroup, the maximum allowable exposure to acibenzolar-S-methyl from drinking water is 0.0004 mg/kg/day (0.0033 mg/kg/day - 0.0029 mg/kg/day). Using HED default assumptions of 2 L/day adult drinking water consumption and 60 kg body weight for adult females, this results in an acute drinking water level of comparison (DWLOC) of 12 \u00e6g/L. The acute EEC from GENEEC for acibenzolar-S-methyl is 640 ppt, or 0.64 \u00e6g/L and does not include estimated concentrations of CGA-210007. This EEC is well below the acute DWLOC. The EEC is the result of a Tier-1 analysis and as such is a conservative estimate. This, coupled with the degree of difference between the acute DWLOC and the acute EEC make it extremely unlikely that actual residues of concern for acibenzolar-S-methyl (including CGA-210007) will exceed the DWLOC. The acute aggregate risk from exposure to acibenzolar-S-methyl residues is unlikely to exceed the Agency's level of concern for females 13-50 years old, the population subgroup of concern for acute exposure to acibenzolar. The Agency concludes that there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the populations of concern from acute aggregate exposure to residues of acibenzolar. The chronic, Tier 1 EEC for acibenzolar-S-methyl is 20 ppt. Although the EEC does not include estimated concentrations of CGA-210007, it is sufficient for purposes of this risk assessment. The EEC is the result of a Tier-1 analysis and as such is a conservative estimate. The modeled chronic dietary (food only) exposures are also conservative, Tier 1 estimates; thus, the resulting chronic aggregate risk estimates shown are highly conservative in nature. Even without further refinement, the chronic aggregate risks from exposure to acibenzolar-S-methyl residues do not exceed the Agency's level of concern for the general U.S. population or any population subgroup. It is concluded that there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result to adults, infants, or children from chronic aggregate exposure to residues of acibenzolar. Additional Toxicology Data Requirements: The following toxicology data needs are conditions of registration: Developmental neurotoxicity study in rats. Subchronic neurotoxicity study in rats. Mutagenicity study (Ames assay with both incorporation and pre-incubation) performed on technical-grade acibenzolar-S-methyl prepared by the new \"thiazole\" production process. Ecological Fate Characteristics: 1. Environmental Fate Summary: Acibenzolar (Actigard; degrades under environmental conditions by abiotic and biotic processes. Degradation was rapid by photolysis in water and on soil at relevant environmental photoperiods and considerably less rapid hydrolytically at relevant environmental pH's (pH 6-9). The major degradates observed were benzo[1,2,3]thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid (CGA 210007) in the hydrolysis and soil photolysis studies (up to 100 percent) with considerably lesser amounts found in the photolysis in water study (8.4 percent). The major degradate in the photolysis in water study was CO2 (>33 percent). Other degradates identified that may be of toxicological concern were CGA 323060 and 324041 (hydroxy-metabolites from the photolysis on soil study). These were found in amounts not exceeding 0.5 percent. Biotically, Acibenzolar rapidly degraded on soil (5 hours) and water (<1 day) aerobically, and was somewhat slower in water anaerobically indicating a biphasic pattern of decline (4 days followed by 95 days). The major degradate was again CGA 210007 (up to 88 percent), but in the aerobic soil study, significant degradation of CGA 210007 was observed (calculated half-life of 16.5 days). Under anaerobic conditions in water, CGA 210007 showed very little degradation by the end of the study (day 360). No other degradates that may be of toxicological concern were identified. Regarding mobility of Acibenzolar, adsorption and terrestrial field studies indicate that movement below the top 3 inches is unlikely. Although Acibenzolar would sorb to soils and sediments, degradation is the principal impediment to leaching. Additionally, Acibenzolar would not be expected to accumulate in sediments due to the rapid metabolism under aerobic conditions. The major degradate, CGA 210007, is more mobile and if it reaches depths below which aerobic metabolism is likely, may be found in groundwater due to its substantially longer half-life under anaerobic conditions. 2. Ecological Effects Summary: The acute toxicity of Acibenzolar-S-methyl, based on the maximum application rate is summarized below. Summary of Terrestrial Ecotoxicity Studies Using Acibenzolar (97.9% ai) Species Toxicity Value Toxicity Category MRID Mallard Acute oral Aquatic Ecotoxicity Studies Using Acibenzolar (98% ai) Species Toxicity Value Toxicity Category MRID Classification FRESHWATER ANIMALS Rainbow Trout LC50 = 0.88 ppm Highly toxic 44537013 Core Fish early life stage 44537019 Core NOAEC = 26 ppb LOAEC = was Bluegill LC50 = 1.6 ppm Moderately toxic 44537011 Core Water Flea LC50 = 2.9 ppm Moderately toxic 44537014 Core Life Cycle Test 44537020 Core NOAEC = 48 ppb LOAEC = 87 ppb (most sensitive weight) ESTUARINE Sheepshead Minnow LC50 = 1.7 ppm Moderately toxic 44537016 Core Eastern Oyster EC50 = 0.59 ppm Highly toxic 44537017 Core Mysid Shrimp LC50 = 0.88 ppm Highly toxic 44537018 Core AQUATIC PLANTS Algae were conducted under flow-through conditions for animal studies Novartis submitted three aquatic toxicity studies using the degradate, CGA-210007 (97% ai), which demonstrate minimal toxicity to aquatic organisms. These studies are scientifically sound, but were classified supplemental (see footnotes in Table 6 below). Summary of Aquatic Ecotoxicity Studies Using the Degradate CGA-210007 (97% Supplemental1 Water Flea Acute LC50 = 59.9 ppm Practically nontoxic 44537015 Core Green capricornutum EC50 = 80.1 ppm - 44537031 Supplemental2 1 Only seven fish were tested per group rather than the recommended 30 fish per group. 2 The study was conducted for 3 days rather than the recommended 4 or 5 days. 3 Studies were conducted under static conditions for animal studies Summary of Ecotoxicity Studies. Acibenzolar-S-methyl was found to be: a. practically non-toxic to terrestrial animals on an acute and subacute basis b. practically nontoxic to insects c. moderately to highly toxic to freshwater and estuarine aquatic animals on an acute basis with a narrow range of toxicity values (i.e., 0.6 ppm for eastern oyster to 2.9 ppm for daphnid) d. toxic to aquatic plants e. avian reproduction NOAEL of 600 ppm based on a reduction in 14-day old survivor weights and the percentage of 14-day old hatchling survivors per normal hatching, LOAEC was 1000 ppm. f. freshwater fish early life stage NOAEC of 26 ppb based on growth reduction (wet/dry weight) effects; LOAEC was 54 ppb g. freshwater invertebrate life cycle NOAEC of 48 ppb based on growth reduction (length/dry weight) effects; LOAEC was 87 ppb Environmental Risk Assessment. Based on combined environmental exposure and ecological toxicity, it is unlikely Acibenzolar will pose a risk of acute or chronic toxicity to nontarget animals.

I shoul be much obliged for sending me the e-mail directions of Dr. Hans Dautel from Freie Universitat Berlin and of Dr. Sergiey Leonovich from Institute of Zoology, Russian Academi of Sciences, Saint Petersburg. Thank you. F.Dusbabek Check the chemical label of ACTIGARD or its MSDS to find out its inhalation, dermal, ingestion toxicity. Here is the internet address: www.cdms.net. The MSDS should tell all that you need. It is interesting how it is being used to apply to mattresses to control mites, when it is a plant activator.

There is a merchandising site (find below) that presents the product. There are no explanations about the chemical aspects or mode of action, however there is a study of Dr. F de Blay from France that was published in the journal \"Allergy\" 1999;54(suppl52) (pages ??). I could not read this paper yet, but according to the abstract in the site the product could reduce the mite allergen concentration in mattressess and rugs (see the document .pdf in the site). I have tryed to contact Dr Blay, but I had no response until now. PS - I would like to thanks every information and help I have receved.

When I turned the beetle over (ventral side up), the mites seemed to engage in some sort of negative phototropism and head for the shady, dorsal side. Any idea what these are? I took a photograph with a macro lens, which I can send by e-mail (I hope). Jim Occi I@m Researcher Naomi Cuervo, I work as Vice president of the Institute on Ecology and Systematics of the Envirnmental Agency of Cuba. I have a project about feather mites very interesting because I have some new species related with this host that existed in Cuba (only one specimen in collection). These new species are also extinct because the host ( Ara tricolor) is extinct in Cuba. I@m aware that in different german museums exist 15 skins of Ara tricolor. Please, I need to know how I can applicate for to visit some of the museums in Germany that contain skins of Ara tricolor, Fam. Psittacidae, Aves. The reason of my request is that we don@t have monetary resources for the trip in order of the economical difficulties of our country-Cuba. I@ll be very grateful to here from one of my new colleagues that is willing to help in this work. Please send your response to zoologia.ies@ama.cu Many thanks in advance. Bye I can only think of Dr. Juan Morales-Malacara of UNAM. He recently worked on the ectoparasitic Mesostigmata at the Bishop Museum for 11 days. He works on the families Macronyssidae and Spinturnicidae. You can reach him by e-mail but I don't have his address accessible right at this moment. Aloha.

I found some phoretic mites (probably hypopes and adults of the same species) under the elytra of Chiron senegalensis (collected in Senegal). I would be very grateful to know which specialist could identify phoretic mites from Africa (in order to send him those specimens to identification). Thank you very much in advance for the help, Best regards, Jean-Bernard Jean-Bernard Huchet 7, rue des Cap\u00e9rans 33 000 Bordeaux FRANCE e-mail :jbhuchet@club-internet.fr http://www-museum.unl.edu/research/entomology/workers/alpha.htm Dear all, here in Brazil some mattress industries have used a acaricide product named ACTGARD or ACTIGARD. The information about it is pretty poor. Using internet search I could find that the substance associated with the product may be benzothiadiazole (FDA register number 14236, 07/06/1999) from Ronner Ltd. Apparently, this product have been used in tomatoes and other plants cultures also to 'protect' the plant from mite attact, but new studies are still necessary. Does anyone know the product ? Is it really used to kill mites or ticks ? Can it be used in mattressess ??? Is it toxic for humans ?? Thanks a lot and have a good day. Celso H Oliveira Jul 2001 19:39:06 +0800 Dear colleagues, I would be very grateful if your lab could provide me with any or all of these trainings: i) Ecological and host vector studies on acarine vectors of human infection ii) Detection, isolation and characterization of pathogens and toxins in acarine vectors iii) Use of molecular techniques for identification of pathogens iv) Development of a specific diagnostic method for a particular pathogen v) Toxicological study of isolated neurotoxins from ticks vi) Development of vaccines for protecting human against acarines Mind if U could give me the cost (+ lodging) and duration of each = training. I would like to be attached somewhere Oct/Nov/Dec. If I can't get the budget approve this year, I'll make it possible somewhere early next year. Please give suggestion/s to where I should be attached if your lab/university didn't provide any of these trainings. Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions.

A similar outage occurred the following morning and the damage was further exacerbated by a total power blackout a few hours later. The system was finally brought back on line last night. Consequently, any email sent to me during the brownout/blackout period (3 July- 9 July) is likely to have been irrevocably lost, and there is a good chance that the lost messages were not bounced back to the sender(s).
