Sands, M.D., M.S., Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai, Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and VEGA Steering Committee member.c \"These new data from the VEGA trial build upon and affirm our initial 12-week findings showing the potential clinical benefit of combining guselkumab and golimumab in treating adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\" In the VEGA study, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized (1:1:1) to receive combination therapy with monotherapy, or golimumab monotherapy.1 After endpoints were evaluated at week 12, patients in the monotherapy groups continued their initially assigned treatment, while patients randomized to the combination therapy group transitioned to guselkumab alone as a maintenance therapy.1 Patients remained blinded and received their respective therapies through the final efficacy assessment at week 38. Clinical remissiona,d was assessed based on the modified Mayo score (mMayo),b as well as the total also assessed at week 38 in an exploratory analysis.1 Safety was evaluated through week 50 (16 weeks after the final dose of study intervention at week 34).1 Patients who received combination therapy with guselkumab and golimumab followed by maintenance treatment with guselkumab achieved clinical remissiona (mMayob) at week 38 (47.9 versus 31.0 percent (22/71) and 20.8 percent (15/72) of patients who received guselkumab or golimumab alone, respectively (nominal p=<0.05).1 Rates of clinical remissiond as defined by the total Mayo scoree at week 38 were similar to those based on the mMayo,a,b with 43.7 percent (31/71) in the combination therapy followed by guselkumab group achieving this endpoint, compared to either the guselkumab or golimumab monotherapy groups, (31.0 percent [22/71] and 22.2 percent [16/72], respectively).1 Also, patients receiving combination therapy followed by guselkumab had the following outcomes at week 38:1 - Endoscopic improvementg and the composite histologic-endoscopic endpointg,i were higher in patients who received combination therapy followed by treatment with guselkumab compared to patients who received guselkumab or golimumab alone. - Endoscopic remissionh and histologic remissioni were higher in patients who received combination therapy followed by treatment with guselkumab compared to patients who received golimumab alone. Patients receiving combination therapy followed by maintenance treatment with guselkumab and patients receiving treatment only with guselkumab monotherapy achieved the same rate of symptomatic remissionf of 69 percent at week 38, which was greater than the golimumab monotherapy group of 59.7 percent.1 Rates of AEs were comparable through week 50 of the study.1 Respectively, the combination therapy followed by guselkumab, guselkumab alone, and golimumab alone groups had AE rates of 63.4, 64.8, and 76.4 percent and infection rates of 31.0, 23.9, and 31.9 percent.1 All groups had the same serious AE rates of 5.6 percent and the same serious infection rates of 2.8 percent.1 Overall, 13.1 percent of patients discontinued their treatment prior to the final dose of study intervention.1 \"The 38-week VEGA data suggest the potential that guselkumab and golimumab combination therapy has in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis for whom previous conventional treatments have inadequately managed their disease or improved their well-being,\" said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"We thank the patients who participated in the VEGA study, as their contribution helps us get closer to our goal of developing therapies that will bring meaningful improvements to patients with ulcerative colitis.\" Janssen [previously announced](https://www.janssen.com/us/sites/www_janssen_com_usa/files/us_vega_ecco_pressrelease_2.17.22_final.pdf) the 12-week data of patient outcomes from the VEGA study at the 17th Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation on February 19, 2022.2 Editor's Notes: a. Clinical remission (based on the mMayo) is defined as a stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, where the stool frequency subscore has not increased from baseline, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 with no friability present on endoscopy.1 b. Modified Mayo score consists of three of the four components of the full Mayo score: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopic score. The physician global assessment score is not included.5 c. Dr. Sands is a paid consultant for Janssen. He has not been compensated for any media work. d. Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score 2, with no individual subscore >1.1 e. The total Mayo score is the sum of four subscores - stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment, and endoscopy findings - that are scored from normal (0) to severe (3).3 f. Symptomatic remission is defined as Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, where the stool frequency subscore has not increased from baseline, and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0.1 g. Endoscopic improvement is defined as an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 with no friability present on the endoscopy.1 h. Endoscopic remission is defined as an endoscopy subscore of 0.1 i. Histologic remission is defined as absence of neutrophils from the mucosa (both lamina propria and destruction, and granulation global multicenter Phase 2a proof-of-concept study evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination induction therapy with guselkumab and golimumab, followed by a transition to guselkumab monotherapy for maintenance, in patients with moderately to severely active UC as defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12 inclusive and an endoscopy subscore of 2 or greater as determined by central read.3,4 Study participants were na\u00efve to TNF, IL-12/23, and IL-23p19 antagonists and had to be refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy (e.g. immunosuppressants and/or corticosteroids).1 Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive guselkumab monotherapy dosed at 200 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) at weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 100 mg every 8 weeks (q8w) subcutaneous (SC) (n=71); golimumab SC monotherapy dosed at at week 0 followed by 100 mg SC at weeks 2, 6, and 10 followed by 100 mg every 4 weeks SC monotherapy (n=72); or a combination of 200 mg IV guselkumab plus 200 mg SC golimumab at week 0, 100 mg SC golimumab at weeks 2, 6, and 10, and 200 mg IV guselkumab at weeks 4 and 8 (n=71) followed by 100 mg guselkumab SC q8w thereafter.1 After week 12, participants in the monotherapy groups continued their initially assigned treatment, while patients randomized to the combination group transitioned to guselkumab 100 mg SC q8w as a maintenance therapy.1 The participants received their respective therapies through week 34 with final efficacy assessments at week 38.1 The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 12, defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by 30 percent or more and 3 or more points, with either a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or more or rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. The trial's major secondary endpoint was clinical remission at week 12, defined as Mayo score less than or equal to 2, with no individual subscore more than 1. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.2,3 Other key endpoints evaluated at week 12 were clinical remission (based on components of the mMayo score), symptomatic remission, endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission, histologic-endoscopic endpoints, outcomes.1 Ulcerative Colitis Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and UC, affect as many as 1.6 million people in the United States.6 UC is a chronic disease of the large intestine, also known as the colon, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers, that produce pus and mucus.7 It is the result of the immune system's overactive response.7 Symptoms vary, but may include loose and more urgent bowel movements, persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stool, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue.8 About guselkumab Developed by Janssen, guselkumab (which is marketed under the brand name TREMFYA\u00ae) is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.9 TREMFYA is approved in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet light), and for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).9 It is also approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque PsO in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy and for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy.9 The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA\u00ae.
