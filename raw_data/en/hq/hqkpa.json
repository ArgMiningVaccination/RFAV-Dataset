The word Shatavari literally translates to \"she who has hundreds of husbands\" or \"curer of one hundred diseases\" and is widely used today as a female reproductive tonic. In Ayurveda, this plant is known as the \"Queen of herbs\", because it promotes love and devotion. Its sweet and cooling properties are used for fever, dyspepsia and gastric ulcers. A. racemosus root anti-diabetic. 2 This herb is a blessing to women at any stage of their lives. I called on her to heal my cycle and regain balance. Today, I'm sharing my herbal monograph on Shatavari. Origin: With recorded use dating back to the Rig Veda - one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language (c. 1500 -1200 BCE) and the Atharva Veda or \"Veda of Magical Formulas\"(c. 1200 BC - 1000 BCE). More specifically, its use in Ayurveda is outlined in the great texts of the Brihat Trayi: Charaka Samhita Ashtanga Sangraha (400-500 AD) as texts of the Laghu Trayi: Sharngadhara Samhita (14th c. AD). Still today, it is widely used by local people in India and Southeast Asia, however there is often little documentation of this use. In modern medical research, Shatavari has been found to be a panacea for myriad health concerns and thus several studies have been referenced. Botanical of the Liliaceae (Lily) family, this plant belongs to the genus Asparagus which has recently moved from the sub-family Asparagae in the family Liliaceae to a newly created family Asparagaceae. 3 Ecologic Status: widespread; native to tropical and subtropical India, Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Africa and Northern Australia.1 With its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus racemosus is constantly on the rise. Because of destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction, and deforestation, the plant is now considered \"endangered\" in its natural habitat.2 Plant Growth: Appreciates full sun but can grow in partial shade, a woody climber suited to its native forest habitat.4 It grows one to two metres tall and prefers to take root in gravelly, rocky soils high up in piedmont plains, at 1,300 - 1,400 m in elevation.3 The leaves are like pine needles, small and uniform and flowers are white and have small spikes.3 The roots are white, tuberous, radish-shaped, tapered at ends and found in clusters. Plant part(s) used: roots are used in herbalism but tender young sprouts can be cooked and eaten.4 The tubers are candied and eaten as a sweetmeat. The fresh juice of the root is given with honey as a demulcent. 2 Ethnobotany: It has been used for millennia as an aphrodisiac and to promote fertility in women and men. The fresh juice of the plants roots is used in several classic formulas claimed to be sexual tonics.1 Used medically by the tribal people of Purandhar in Maharashtra, India for lactation.5 Juice made from the tuberous roots is used in diarrhoea, diabetes and jaundice and juice of whole plant used in urinary disease by local people of Naogaon district, Bangladesh.7 Ayurvedic Energetics sexual debility, leukorrhea, menopause, impotence, infertility, cough, dehydration, diarrhea, inflamed of kidneys, lungs, sexual organs, and stomach. External application\u2014emollient for stiff joints and neck, and muscle spasms. Increases breast milk and semen, nurtures mucous membranes, blood cleanser, supplies female hormones, nourishes system boost\u2014good for AIDS, Epstein Barr, auto-immune disease, cancer\u2014strengthens one from and for chemotherapy.8 Dhatus: works on all tissue elements, Glycosides of quercitin, rutin and hyperoside are present in flower and fruits, Sitosterol. Trace minerals are found in roots - Zinc (53.15 mg/g), Manganese (19.98 mg/g), Copper (5.29 mg/g), Ghrta: Satavari + 10 times - milk, ghee Prepare the above together with sugar, pippali, honey and mix 3 Charaka Samhita (Ci2.3#18) Current Research Phytoestrogens Phytoestrogens are any plant compound structurally or functionally similar to ovarian and placental estrogens and their active metabolites. The majority of phytoestrogens belong to a large group of phenolic compounds known as flavonoids. Isoflavones, coumestans and prenylated phytoestrogens with the most potent estrogenic activity. Phytoestrogens affect the regulation of ovarian cycles and estrous in female mammals. They promote growth, differentiation and physiological functions of the female genital tract, pituitary, breast and several other organs and tissues in both sexes. Asparagus racemosus is well known for its phytoestrogenic properties and use as a hormone modulator demonstrated the inhibitory action of Asparagus racemosus on DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats. 7 Women undergoing menopause often experience a decline in the quality of life due to sleep deprivation, mood swings, lack of concentration, and other factors. The drug Menosan (110 mg A. racemosus extract per tablet) has been studied for the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms. In a trial, significant relief from post-menopausal symptoms such as depression (90% relief), insomnia (83.33% relief), irritability (50% relief), weight gain (50% relief), bone and joint pains (40%), sweating (37.88%) and hot flashes (37.03%) was observed after the use of Mensal. 7 Adaptogen Rasayana is a group of plant drugs which improve defense mechanisms of the body, promote physical and mental health as well as provide strength and long life. The objectives of rasayanas include vayasthapyna (slowing aging), ayukaram (enhancing life span), medhabalakaram (promoting intellect and physical strength) and rogapaharanasamartha (increasing resistance to diseases).11 These are similar to adaptogens which increase the non-specific resistance of organisms against a variety of stresses. A. racemosus is studied against the side effects induced by cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. A. racemosusreversed the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying, and also normalized cisplatin induced intestinal hypermotility.12 Anti-ulcer \"The ulcer healing ability of the drug was attributed to a direct healing effect, possibly by potentiating intrinsic protective factor as it has neither antisecretory activity nor antacid properties, by strengthening mucosal resistance, prolonging the lifespan of mucosal cells, increasing secretion and viscosity of mucous and reducing H+ ion back diffusion\". It has been found to maintain the continuity and thickness of aspirin treated gastric mucosa with a significant increase in mucosal tissue. As A. racemosusheals duodenal ulcers without inhibiting acid secretion, it may have cytoprotective action similar to that of prostaglandin. 13-15 Antioxidant, Anti-depressant Research showed that treatment with shatavari improved antioxidant defenses, increased antioxidant enzymes and reduced the damage caused by free radicals. Furthermore, shatavari improved the production of chemicals in the brain that have anti-anxiety, anti-stress and anti-depressant effect. The anti-stress properties of shatavari are due to the presence of flavonoids, polyphenols and saponins. They reduce the production of stress hormones and increase the production of hormones or chemicals that makes one feel calm and happy. Making shatavari an excellent choice for the management of mental depression and stress.16 Anti-diarrheal Research has found that shatavari can be used as an herbal remedy in the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery. It reduces the frequency of stools and gastrointestinal motility; it slows down the transit of intestinal contents. It also reduces the frequency and volume of stools. Such an effect was attributed to the presence of flavonoids which inhibit the intestinal motility. It also reduces the secretion of fluid and electrolytes in the stools, helping to slow dehydration. Thus, shatavari can be very useful in the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery.17 Immunomodulatory Research has found that shatavari root plays a vital role in stimulating immune cells. It stimulates the cells that fight infection, reducing the overall population of infection-causing cells. During infection or diseased condition, the immunity is suppressed. Shatavari roots stimulate the immune system, help the body to fight against diseases, and finally speeds up the recovery. Sapogenin, a compound present in shatavari is a potent immune-stimulator. It enhances the body's resistance during normal and immunosuppressed conditions.18 Anti-Candidal Candida yeasts normally reside in the intestinal tract, mucous membranes and on skin without causing infection; however, overgrowth of these organisms can cause symptoms to develop. Symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area of the body that is infected. Candidiasis that develops in the mouth or throat is called \"thrush\" or oropharyngeal candidiasis. Candidiasis in the vagina is commonly known as a yeast infection. In a study on the anticandidal activity of A. Racemosus, methanol extracts showed high anticandidal as well as flucanizole - a common pharmaceutical.19 Antidiabetic Asparagus racemosus roots have been shown to enhance insulin secretion in perfused pancreas and isolated islets. When administered orally together with glucose, A. racemosus extract improved glucose tolerance in normal and two types of diabetic rats. Daily administration of A. racemosus to type 2 diabetic rats decreased serum glucose, increased pancreatic insulin, plasma insulin, liver glycogen and total oxidant status. Given these findings, Asparagus racemosus may be useful as a source of antidiabetic compounds or a dietary adjunct for the management of diabetes.21 Over the milenia, Shatavari has proven to be a powerful pharmacological herb with myriad uses. The 'Queen of Herbs' has potent emotional and physical benefits for both men and women alike. Today, our bodies face more environmental and emotional stressors than ever, wreaking havoc on hormones and natural biorhythms. Shatavari's ability to bring the body back into balance makes it all the more relevant. 5 While more research is needed on phytoestrogens, Shatavari seems to be a promising, natural alternative to traditional hormone therapies. We must take care to grow and harvest Shatavari using sustainable practices so that future generations may enjoy this beautiful, rejuvenative herb. Research 1) Winston D, Maimes S.
