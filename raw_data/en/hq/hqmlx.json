The cytosolic pathogen sensor NLRP12 has emerged as a negative regulator of inflammation, but its role in HCC is unknown. Here we investigated the role of NLRP12 in HCC using mouse models of HCC induced by carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Nlrp12-/- mice were highly susceptible to DEN-induced HCC with increased inflammation, hepatocyte proliferation, and tumor burden. Consistently, Nlrp12-/- tumors showed higher expression of proto-oncogenes cJun and cMyc and downregulation of tumor suppressor p21. Interestingly, antibiotics treatment dramatically diminished tumorigenesis in Nlrp12-/- mouse livers. Signaling analyses demonstrated higher JNK activation in Nlrp12-/- HCC and cultured hepatocytes during JNK inhibition or overexpression reduced inflammatory NLRP12 negatively regulates HCC pathogenesis JNK-dependent proliferation of hepatocytes. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.001](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.001) Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common malignancy and the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide ( [Farazi and DePinho, 2006](#bib23)). Major risk factors for HCC include hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections, obesity, alcohol abuse, and drug toxicity ( [El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007](#bib21); [Farazi and DePinho, 2006](#bib23)). The common physiological process prior to HCC development is inflammation, which triggers DNA damage and mutagenesis, hepatic cell death, and compensatory proliferation ( [Maeda et al., 2005](#bib42); [Sakurai et pathways MAPK, STAT3 and AKT are hyperactivated in HCC al., 2004](#bib49); [Wang et al., 2016](#bib64)). A major class of stimuli for these pathways are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which are sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The best-characterized PRRs are toll-like receptors (TLRs) that sense a wide array of PAMPs on the cell surface or endosomal compartment ( [Akira et al., 2006](#bib1)). Because of its close anatomical connection with the intestine, the liver is constantly exposed to gut microbiota-derived PAMPs ( [Son et al., 2010](#bib61)). The translocation of microbes and their PAMPs is enhanced during chronic liver disorders ( [Campillo et al., 1999](#bib9); [Cirera et al., 1957](#bib53); [Yoneyama et al., 2002](#bib65)) and likely an important contributor of HCC development. Indeed, sensing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by liver parenchymal contributes al., 2003](#bib46); [Seki et al., 2007](#bib60)). However, the regulatory mechanisms in the gut-liver inflammatory and carcinogenic axis are poorly explored but critical to understanding and potentially treating HCC. In addition to TLRs, several cytosolic PRRs sense and respond to PAMPs or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and activate downstream cell signaling pathways. The NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of cytosolic PRRs which are associated with diverse diseases related to infections, inflammation and cancer ( [Saxena and Yeretssian, 2014](#bib57); [Zhong et al., 2013](#bib69)). The NLR family member NLRP12 has recently emerged as a critical regulator of inflammation and cancer. Previous studies showed that deficiency of NLRP12 leads to enhanced incidence and faster progression of colorectal tumorigenesis ( [Allen et regulates NF-B and in macrophages, dendritic and T cells [Lukens et [Zaki et 2011](#bib67)), and increased colorectal tumorigenesis in Nlrp12-/- mice is associated with higher activation of the NF-B and ERK signaling pathways ( [Allen et al., 2012](#bib3); [Zaki et al., 2011](#bib67)). In the liver, NLRP12 is highly expressed and dampens inflammatory responses secondary to Salmonella Typhimurium infection ( [Zaki et al., 2014](#bib68)). These observations suggest that NLRP12 may regulate inflammatory disorders of the liver such as HCC. Here, we investigated the role of NLRP12 in HCC using mouse models. The expression of NLRP12 was seen negatively correlated with human and mouse HCC. Nlrp12-/- mice developed significantly higher tumor burden in the liver following administration of mutagens. HCC susceptibility in Nlrp12-/- mice was eliminated with antibiotics treatment. Our in vivo and in vitro data demonstrated that NLRP12 suppresses PAMP-mediated proliferation and inflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes via attenuation of JNK signaling. This study underscores a novel cancer suppressive pathway in the liver involving NLRP12. Results The loss of NLRP12 is associated with increased HCC susceptibility To understand an association of NLRP12 with human HCC, we analyzed publicly available cancer genomics databases. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, about 2% of HCC patients in NLRP12 ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)). Analysis of RNA-seq the UALCAN web-portal ( [Chandrashekar et al., 2017](#bib12)) revealed that the expression of NLRP12 is significantly (p=0.0004) reduced in human HCC ( [Figure To mechanistically characterize the role of NLRP12 in HCC, we used a mouse model in which HCC was induced with the administration of a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/40396/figures#fig1s1)). DEN is a procarcinogen that induces DNA damage and cell death in the liver, leading to the development of HCC ( [Bakiri and Wagner, 2013](#bib4); [Rajewsky et al., 1966](#bib50)). 10 months post a single DEN injection into WT and Nlrp12-/- mice, we collected whole livers and measured the number and size of tumors. Consistent to reduced NLRP12 in human HCC, the expression of Nlrp12 was significantly reduced in DEN-induced HCC compared to healthy livers of WT mice ( [Figure 1C](#fig1)). As we counted the number of visible tumors, we observed significantly higher number of tumors in Nlrp12-/- mouse livers compared to that of WT mice ( [Figure 1D and E](#fig1)). Tumor sizes and tumor/body weight ratios of Nlrp12-/- mice were significantly larger compared to those of WT mice ( [Figure 1E](#fig1)). The areas of adenoma in Nlrp12-/- livers significantly larger than that of WT ( [Figure 1F and G](#fig1)). HCC is associated with liver damage leading to the elevation of serum levels of ALT and AST. As expected, ALT and AST levels were significantly higher in Nlrp12-/- mice at 10 months after DEN administration ( [Figure 1H](#fig1)). We confirmed the role of NLRP12 in HCC development in a second model involving carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) along with DEN ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/40396/figures#fig1s1)). CCl4 is a toxic chemical which causes hepatic necrosis, compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, and ultimately drives fibrosis ( [Sarma et al., 1986](#bib56)). Similar to that seen in the DEN model, DEN plus CCl4-treated Nlrp12-/- mice developed a greater tumor burden with significantly larger tumors than WT mice ( [Figure 1I and J](#fig1)). Notably, control (DEN-untreated) Nlrp12-/- mice did not develop any tumors and did not exhibit elevated ALT and AST levels ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C-E](/articles/40396/figures#fig1s1)). These results suggest that NLRP12 plays a protective role against carcinogen-induced HCC in mice. [see all](/articles/40396/figures#fig1) - Figure 1\u2014source data 1 - [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.005](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.005) Increased tumorigenesis in Nlrp12-/- mice is associated with higher inflammation Development of HCC is a multistep process involving characterize the role of NLRP12 in HCC histopathologically, we examined the H and E-stained liver sections of WT and Nlrp12-/- mice collected at 10 months after DEN injection. There were significantly higher inflammatory infiltrates, steatosis, and fibrosis in 2010](#bib47); [Sakurai et al., 2008](#bib55)). To understand the nature of inflammatory responses in the context of NLRP12-deficiency, we measured different cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators in the tumor-bearing livers from DEN or DEN plus CCl4-treated mice. Consistent with pathological features, there was significantly higher expression of IL-6, TNF, and KC in Nlrp12-/- HCC tissue were confirmed by ELISA ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E](/articles/40396/figures#fig2s1)). However, no differences were observed in the levels of T cell-dependent cytokines data 1 - [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.009](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.009) We next characterized different immune cell populations infiltrated into tumor tissues by flow cytometry. No differences were found in the number livers ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement proteins MIP2 and MCP1 in Nlrp12-/- HCC tissue resulted in increased infiltration of macrophages/Kupffer cells. These data indicate that NLRP12-deficiency promotes inflammatory responses during DEN-induced liver injury and tumorigenesis. NLRP12 regulates proliferation and cell death in the liver DEN-induced liver injury is thought to promote hepatocarcinogenesis by inducing compensatory proliferation after widespread apoptosis ( [Maeda et al., 2005](#bib42); [Sakurai et al., understand whether sensing PAMPs by NLRP12 regulates proliferative responses during HCC, we immunostained and HCC livers for Ki67. The number of Ki67-positive cells were significantly higher in livers containing HCC compared to healthy livers of either WT or Nlrp12-/- mice ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). However, ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). Higher expression real-time qPCR 3B](#fig3)). We further assessed role of NLRP12 in proliferation by BrdU incorporation assay. Similar to Ki67 staining, there was 3\u2014source data 1 - [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.013](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.013) To determine whether higher proliferation in Nlrp12-/- HCC is linked to cell death, we measured apoptosis by TUNEL assay in HCC livers collected at 10 months after DEN treatment. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in Nlrp12-/- HCC livers was significantly higher than WT, although no such difference was observed in healthy untreated WT and Nlrp12-/- mouse livers ( [Figure 3C](#fig3)). Increased cell death in Nlrp12-/- HCC by immunohistochemical detection of cleaved capsase-3; Nlrp12-/- HCC livers had a significantly higher number of caspase-3-positive cells compared to livers from DEN-treated WT mice ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). Furthermore, Western blot analysis Inflammatory cell death ( [Kamata et al., 2005](#bib35); [Sakurai et al., 2008](#bib55)). We wondered whether inflammation could promote apoptosis in Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes in a cell extrinsic fashion. Hence, we investigated the role of NLRP12 in hepatocyte cell death by culturing primary hepatocytes from WT and Nlrp12-/- mice and treating them with LPS. While unstimulated WT and Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes showed a similar level of TUNEL-positive cells, there was significantly higher apoptosis in LPS-treated Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes, suggesting that higher inflammatory responses in Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes during LPS stimulation contributed to increased cell death ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B and C](/articles/40396/figures#fig3s1)). Altogether, these data imply that NLRP12 does not directly interfere with apoptosis, but indirectly modulates hepatic cell death during DEN-induced HCC via regulation of inflammatory responses. NLRP12 dampens oncogenic signals in the liver Next, we focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of increased proliferation in Nlrp12-/- HCC. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of HCC, was significantly higher in Nlrp12-/- tumor tissue ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). We measured the expression WT and Nlrp12-/- HCC by real-time qPCR. There was increased expression of pro-proliferative and tumor promoting genes such as Ccnb1, Ccnd1, Survivin, Myc of Cdkn1a, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, was significantly reduced in Nlrp12-/- HCC ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). The protein level higher in Nlrp12-/- 4B and C](#fig4)). The expression of Cyclin d1 is regulated by several transcription factors including cMyc and cJun, which are major HCC [Schwabe et al., 2003](#bib58)). Consistently, there was higher protein level of cMyc including NF-B, ERK, JNK, p38, and STAT3 regulate the expression of proliferative genes and transcription factors involved in cancer ( [Grivennikov et al., 2010](#bib25); [He and Karin, 2011](#bib28)). To explore the pathways through which NLRP12 regulates oncogene expression, we measured the activation of NF-B, ERK, p38, JNK, and STAT3, in HCC tissues from WT and Nlrp12-/- mice by Western blotting and ELISA. While all these pathways were activated in both WT and Nlrp12-/- HCC, the JNK pathway was consistently highly activated in Nlrp12-/- tumors as compared to those of WT ( [Figure 4D-F](#fig4)). JNK plays critical roles in hepatocyte physiology by regulating cell death and proliferation, and deletion of JNK1 was shown to suppress HCC ( Thus, the JNK pathway may be involved in NLRP12-mediated regulation of oncogene expression. We hypothesized that JNK activation in Nlrp12-/- HCC occurs in parenchymal tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we isolated parenchymal cells from tumor tissue and measured the activation of JNK and other signaling pathways by Western blotting. Nlrp12-/- tumor cells exhibited significantly increased phosphorylation of JNK, while no remarkable difference in the activation of ERK, p38, NF-B pathways was observed ( [Figure 4G and H](#fig4)). Along with higher JNK activation, there was significantly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines Cxcl1 and Ccl2, and pro-proliferative molecules including of Cdkn1a ( [Figure 4I](#fig4)). These levels coincide with the expression profiles of these molecules in the liver tumors ( [Figures 2C](#fig2) and [4A](#fig4)). To examine the role of NLRP12 in the regulation of JNK in non-parenchymal cells, such as Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, in the tumor microenvironment, we isolated hepatocytes, and hepatic stellate cells of hepatocytes, Kupffer and cells 1A](/articles/40396/figures#fig4s1)). these cell types ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/40396/figures#fig4s1)). Cells were then stimulated with LPS and activation of JNK was measured by Western blotting. Interestingly, higher JNK activation was seen only in hepatocytes but not in Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells ( [Figure 4J](#fig4)). LPS stimulation of tumor hepatocytes further enhanced of inflammatory together, these findings suggest that higher activation of JNK in Nlrp12-/- HCC contributes to increased expression of cytokines and chemokines, which help recruitment of macrophages and dendritic cells in the tumor a microenvironment of chronic liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis. However, existing evidence points to the critical contribution of PAMPs derived from gut microbiota in liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis et al., 1957](#bib53); [Seki et al., 2007](#bib60)). Our data also suggest that LPS triggers inflammatory responses in tumor parenchymal cells ( [Figure 4J](#fig4); [Figure 4\u2014figure whether increased HCC susceptibility of Nlrp12-/- mice is due to the defect in the downregulation of PAMPs-mediated HCC pathogenesis, we fed Nlrp12-/- mice with the regular drinking water supplemented with a cocktail of antibiotics that eliminates commensal bacteria ( [Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004](#bib51)) and thereby reduces systemic levels of PAMPs ( [Seki et al., 2007](#bib60)). 4 weeks following antibiotics treatment, mice were treated with DEN and HCC development was monitored at 38 weeks of age ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). Depletion of microbiota was confirmed by colony forming assay and real time PCR analysis of universal bacterial 16S rRNA (data not shown). Antibiotic-treated Nlrp12-/- mice exhibited a profound reduction of tumor burden and expression of AFP after DEN-induced tumorigenesis ( [Figure 5B and C](#fig5)). The expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was also significantly reduced in livers from antibiotic-treated mice compared to untreated controls ( [Figure 5D](#fig5)). Moreover, expression Ccnb1, Survivin, and MKi67 in reduced upon antibiotics treatment ( [Figure 5E](#fig5)). These results suggest that gut-derived PAMPs, particularly HCC development which is downregulated by NLRP12. [see all](/articles/40396/figures#fig5) - Figure 5\u2014source data 1 - [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.021](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.021) LPS is the major cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria and most potent ligand for NF-B and MAPK activation. To understand whether gram-negative bacteria are abundant in Nlrp12-/- mice, we analyzed gut microbiota composition by 16S which are gram-negative and most abundant in mouse gut, are equally abundant in WT and Nlrp12-/- mice ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement also reduced levels of gram-negative phylum Proteobacteria but a higher increased TLR4 responses in Nlrp12-/- HCC may not be due to increased gram-negative bacteria in their gut. Since relative abundance of several bacterial species was different in WT and Nlrp12-/- mice ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B](/articles/40396/figures#fig5s1)), we next verified the effect of altered microbiota composition in immune responses in the liver at homeostasis. Hence, we measured the expression of inflammatory molecules, counted the number of immune cells, and analyzed the activation of signaling pathways in healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- livers. Our data show similar levels of Il6, Tnfa, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Ccl2 in mice ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C](/articles/40396/figures#fig5s1)). The of immune cells including T cells, Kupffer cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils infiltrated in the liver of healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- mice was comparable ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D](/articles/40396/figures#fig5s1)). There was also no difference in the activation of JNK, NF-B, ERK, and STAT3 in [Figure suggest that NLRP12 deficiency doesn't have immunomodulatory effect on the liver in the absence of injury or carcinogenesis. NLRP12 negatively regulates JNK signaling in hepatocytes Since JNK critical roles in 2003](#bib58)), we further investigated whether NLRP12 plays a role as an intrinsic regulator of JNK in hepatocytes. To elucidate the role of NLRP12 in hepatocyte-specific JNK activation, we cultured primary hepatocytes and [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/40396/figures#fig6s1)) and stimulated them with LPS. The activation of JNK was enhanced in Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes relative to WT; but p65, and was unchanged ( [Figure 6A](#fig6)). these molecules, indicating JNK dependency ( [Figure 6B](#fig6)). In addition to LPS, other stimuli such as peptidoglycan (PGN) and TNF, but not IL-6, induced HepG2 cells led to markedly reduced p-JNK levels and subsequent expression of phosphorylates cJun and Ronai, 2004](#bib2); [Noguchi et In agreement, the levels of cMyc and P-cJun were markedly higher in cells in Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes at basal levels and after with with WT hepatocytes ( [Figure 6E and F](#fig6)). Notably, both cMyc and P-cJun were present in the nucleus consistent with their participation in gene transcription ( [Figure 6E](#fig6)). Increased their levels ( [Figure 6\u2014figure 1D](/articles/40396/figures#fig6s1)). role of NLRP12 in regulating JNK, cMyc, and cJun was further confirmed by their rescue after the transient overexpression of NLRP12 in Nlrp12-/- NLRP12 [Figure 6H](#fig6)). the role of NLRP12 in the downregulation of JNK by knocking down NLRP12 with CRISPER/Cas9 in HepG2 cells. Suppression of NLRP12 resulted in higher of in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells ( [Figure 6\u2014figure together, these results suggest that NLRP12 suppresses the expression of inflammatory and oncogenic molecules in hepatocytes via negative regulation of JNK signaling. NLRP12 regulates hepatocyte proliferation via JNK We finally sought to investigate whether NLRP12-mediated regulation of JNK activation affects hepatocyte proliferation. To this end, we isolated and cultured primary hepatocytes from WT and Nlrp12-/- mouse livers and followed the cellular proliferation using IncuCyte live cell image analyzer. The proliferation rate of Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes was seen significantly than and B](#fig7); [Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/40396/figures#fig7s1)), and was further increased by LPS but suppressed by JNK inhibitor ( [Figure 7A and with higher proliferation, Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes with or without LPS stimulation showed markedly staining ( [Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B and we incubated WT and Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes with BrdU, which incorporates into newly synthesized DNA at S phase. BrdU-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and microscopy. There was a trend of increased BrdU-positive S phase hepatocytes in the Nlrp12-/- group compared to WT which was further increased significantly with LPS stimulation ( [Figure 7E and F](#fig7)). Similarly, Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes with LPS ( [Figure 7E and F](#fig7)). These results indicate that hepatocytes proliferation via regulation of JNK. [see all](/articles/40396/figures#fig7) - Figure 7\u2014source data 1 - [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.029](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.029) In summary, our data suggest that NLRP12 plays a central role in hepatocyte function by dampening the expression of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and oncogenes via negative regulation of the JNK pathway ( [Figure 7G](#fig7)). NLRP12 deficiency, therefore, enhances hepatocyte-specific inflammatory and proliferative responses during DEN-induced liver injury, leading to higher incidence of HCC ( [Figure 7G](#fig7)). Discussion Despite the high mortality rate, effective treatment options for HCC remain limited, emphasizing the importance of finding therapeutic measures to impede carcinogenesis. It is commonly viewed that HCC is initiated and promoted with consistent and nonspecific activation of the immune system in the liver ( [El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007](#bib21); [Farazi and DePinho, 2006](#bib23)). Gut microbiota have recently emerged as a critical pathogenic trigger for HCC ( [Dapito et al., 2012](#bib16); [Yoshimoto et al., 2013](#bib66)). TLR4-mutant mice, which lack responsiveness to LPS, are resistant to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC ( [Dapito et al., 2012](#bib16); [Seki et al., 2007](#bib60)). Although the liver is not in a direct contact with gut microbiota, microbes and their PAMPs are transported to the liver through the hepatic portal vein after crossing the gut epithelial barrier ( [Son et al., 2010](#bib61)). Cirrhosis facilitates intestinal barrier permeability and cirrhotic patients are vulnerable for bacterial infection which increases mortality ( [Campillo et al., 1999](#bib9); [Cirera et al., 1957](#bib53); [Yoneyama et al., 2002](#bib65)). However, precise mechanism of gut microbiota-mediated augmentation of HCC pathogenesis remains to be determined. Here we show that NLRP12 is a potent molecular checkpoint for gut microbiota-dependent inflammation and carcinogenesis in the liver. The pathogenesis of HCC is a complex process because of its genetic heterogeneity. Genome sequencing ( et al., 2012](#bib30); [Marquardt et al., 2015](#bib43)). Since somatic mutations in these driver oncogenes and tumor suppressors occur in the liver with the exposure of carcinogen, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress, these pathological stimuli also alter many other genes ( [Marquardt et al., 2015](#bib43)). Genome sequencing of tumors from an HBV-infected HCC identified more than 11,000 somatic substitutions ( [Totoki et al., 2011](#bib63)). Significant genetic alterations in NLRs have been identified in a genome sequence study ( [Everson et al., 2013](#bib22)). Although at low frequency, mutations in passenger genes promote tumorigenesis in multiple ways including hyperactivation of inflammatory signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, therefore, NLRP12 mutations may play a critical role in HCC pathogenesis. Increased HCC susceptibility of Nlrp12-/- mice suggests that Nlrp12 contributes to the suppression of HCC, which is also supported by human HCC genomics data showing NLRP12 mutations in 1-2% HCC. Notably, like many other cancer-related genes, amplification of NLRP12 as seen in less than 0.5% HCC cases may also contribute to HCC. It is possible that higher NLRP12 activity suppresses JNK to a level that promotes HCC. In fact, JNK and NF-B pathways play both tumor promoting and tumor suppressive roles [Das et al., 2005](#bib42); [Sakurai al., 2006](#bib54)). Growing evidence implicates the role of NLRP12 in diverse pathophysiological conditions. Variants of NLRP12 have been linked to autoinflammatory diseases, including periodic fever syndrome, atopic dermatitis, and arthritis [Borghini et al., 2008](#bib33); [J\u00e9ru et al., 2011](#bib34)). Experimental studies demonstrated that NLRP12 protects mice from colitis, colorectal tumorigenesis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 2011](#bib67)). regulation of NF-B under different pathophysiological contexts appears to be cell type-dependent. For example, NLRP12-mediated inhibition of NF-B in myeloid cells contributes to protection against intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis, in T cells it is implicated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( [Lukens et al., 2015](#bib40)), and in osteocytes it involved in osteoclast differentiation ( [Krauss et al., 2015](#bib36)). This study shows that NLRP12 is expressed in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells and suppresses HCC by preventing JNK signaling, particularly in the hepatocyte. Thus, our findings elucidate a novel function of NLRP12 in the liver and underscore its versatile physiological functions. Although we could not find a difference in the activation of NF-B and ERK between WT and Nlrp12-/- HCC, the involvement of NLRP12 in the downregulation of these pathways in myeloid and T cells during HCC and a contribution of such processes in the suppression of HCC cannot be completely excluded. It might be possible that NLRP12 suppresses NF-B and ERK in immune cells during acute but not in a chronic inflammatory environment. Thus, NLRP12-mediated downregulation of NF-B and ERK activation as well as inflammatory responses in immune cells may occur during the early phase of HCC development. The contribution of the immune cell-specific function of NLRP12 in the suppression of HCC needs to be further investigated using Nlrp12 conditional knockout mice in future studies. In this study, we show that NLRP12 attenuates HCC development though multiple mechanisms. First, NLRP12 protects the liver from injury and hepatocyte death. The liver is a unique organ with regenerative capacity. Hepatocyte death due to cytotoxic insult or inflammatory responses triggers rapid proliferation to compensate for apoptotic or necrotic hepatocyte cell death ( [Sakurai et al., 2008](#bib55)). Such a rapid cell cycle progression in an inflammatory environment results in accumulation of mutations leading to neoplastic transformation of hepatocytes. Secondly, NLRP12 downregulates hepatocyte-specific expression of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF which promote proliferation and tumor growth, and chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2, which enhance inflammatory cell infiltration and thereby augment inflammation in the tumor milieu ( [Kamata et al., 2005](#bib35); [Maeda et al., 2005](#bib42); [Sakurai et al., 2008](#bib55)). Tumor infiltrated immune cells, particularly macrophages, play critical roles in HCC induction and progression by producing many tumor-promoting factors such as iNOS, Cox2, and ROS ( al., 2013](#bib10); [Grivennikov al., 2010](#bib25)). Third, NLRP12 inhibits the expression of cJun and cMyc, which are major oncogenes seen in HCC ( [Lin et al., 2010](#bib37)). These oncogenic transcription factors regulate the expression of molecules involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression, such as Ccnb1, Ccnd1, and Cdkn1a. Consistently, we observed higher induction of Ccnb1 and Ccnd1 but reduced expression of Cdkn1a in Nlrp12-/- hepatocytes and HCC. Notably, NLRP12-mediated regulation of these processes occurs within the context of PAMP-stimulation as inhibition of gut microbiota abolishes the HCC susceptibility of Nlrp12-/- mice. Previous studies implicated the NF-B pathway in NLRP12-mediated regulation of inflammatory disorders. However, for the first time, we show that NLRP12 regulates JNK activation in hepatocytes. JNK has critical functions in liver physiology and contributes to HCC pathogenesis ( [Das et JNK is highly activated in human HCC and mouse deficient in JNK1 develop reduced tumor burden in the liver following DEN treatment ( [Hui et al., 2008](#bib31); [Sakurai et al., 2006](#bib54)). Similar to our observation that NLRP12 regulates hepatocyte death and proliferation, previous studies relate JNK1-dependent HCC pathogenesis to hepatocyte death and 2008](#bib31); [Sakurai et al., 2006](#bib54)). The mechanism of JNK-mediated regulation of cellular proliferation involves activation of c-Jun, JunD, and cMyc, depending on the cell type and ( [Alarcon-Vargas and Ronai, 2004](#bib2); [Bogoyevitch and in hepatocellular carcinogenesis is well documented ( [Eferl et al., 2003](#bib20)). In agreement, we observed that increased HCC pathogenesis in Nlrp12-/- mice is associated with increased cMyc and cJun activity. Moreover, NLRP12-deficiency links JNK activation to higher inflammatory responses during DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis. Through in vitro biochemical studies using primary hepatocytes, we clearly demonstrated that NLRP12 regulates JNK activation in the hepatocyte, particularly in the context of TLR stimulation. It is worthwhile to mention that higher JNK activation in Nlrp12-/- liver is only seen during HCC; JNK activation as well as inflammatory responses in the liver of healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- mice were comparable. It seems that tumor induction sensitizes hepatocytes to TLR ligands, leading to increased activation of JNK. It is also possible that HCC development increases intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, allowing increased translocation of gut-derived PAMPs into the liver. Higher levels of plasma endotoxin and bacterial translocation are seen in patients with liver cirrhosis ( [Campillo et al., 1999](#bib9); et al., 1991](#bib24)). Thus, NLRP12 may play a functional role in suppressing JNK activation in the hepatocyte in the context of liver injury, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. In summary, this study demonstrates that the innate pathogen sensor NLRP12 is a molecular checkpoint for HCC attenuating JNK-mediated inflammatory and proliferative responses in the hepatocytes, particularly in the context of stimulation with microbial pattern molecules. Thus, this study suggests that inducing or activating NLRP12 or its downstream signaling could be potential therapeutic options for HCC. Considering the critical role of gut microbiota and TLR pathways in inflammatory liver disorders ( [Guo and Friedman, 2010](#bib26); [Seki et al., 2007](#bib60)), future studies should investigate the role of NLRP12 in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome using appropriate animal models.

Thank you for submitting your article \"NLRP12 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulation of cJun in the hepatocyte\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Summary: NLRP12 negatively regulates HCC pathogenesis and prevents HCC by maintaining a stable immunolandscape via downregulation of JNK-dependent inflammation and proliferation of hepatocytes. Essential revisions: 1) More accurate quantitative methods are required to confirm the activation of JNK in NLRP12-inhibited HCC pathogenesis by excluding the involvement of the well-known NF-B and STAT3 pathways in this process. 2) The roles of NLRP12 in immune modulation have been ignored to some extent. The contribution of NLRP12-mediated modulation of immune response should be properly evaluated. Reviewer #1: In general the study provides a straight forward concept: Nlrp12 plays an important role in maintaining a stable immunolandscape through the regulation of JNK signaling to prevent HCC. However, the clinical patient data demonstrates that NLRP2 is more likely to be oncogenic in HCC than downregulated, in contrary to their model as there are three independent dataset that show a higher propensity for gene amplification in HCC tumors than deletions, which focus on how the KO of NLRP12 increases the tumor burden of chemically induced HCC. How do the authors reconcile that gene amplification also contributes to HCC (its potential role as oncogenic), while the main message is that the loss of NLRP2 is important for HCC (tumor suppressive)? While Figure 1B addresses that the down-regulation of NLRP12 is found in HCC, what is the likelihood of this data something that is important for HCC and not a specific event found in only in the UALCAN webportal? In addition, the tumors shown are only liver tumors, is this something specific to the liver or is are there nodules in other organs as well? Since DEN induces malignancy in other tissues as well. Is this likely to liver specific event as eluded by the author? Why would CCL4 treatment in DEN induced NLRP12 KO mice decrease the tumor size of DEN NLRP12 KO mice (Figure 1E vs. Figure 1J)? In addition, the mice seem to weigh less as well. These data indicate that CCL4, further hepatic injury, almost decreases tumor burden in DEN mice, and making them sicker. This doesn't make sense to the main paper. Have the authors looked at NLRP12 KO mice + CCL4 alone? Do these NLRP12 KO mice + CCL4 also have a higher mortality rate than NLRP12 KO mice +DEN alone? Does NLRP12 KO Mice +CCL4 also have a higher tumor burden then WT? These are more appropriate questions to ask as a secondary model. Survival is important indicator of tumor burden, does the NLRP12 KO+DEN mice get sicker and die sooner than others after the 10 months? These data would suggest that the viability of the tumor type is specific to NLRP12 KO and not the DEN itself. Reviewer #2: In the manuscript by Udden and colleagues, the authors report that NLRP12 negatively regulates HCC pathogenesis via downregulation of JNK-dependent inflammation and proliferation of hepatocytes. The role of NLRP12 as a negative regulator in multiple immune cells has been widely explored. However, the role and significance of NLRP12 in HCC pathogenesis have not been completely elucidated. The current study revealed a novel role of NLRP12 in hepatocyte during HCC pathogenesis. Moreover, the authors proposed that NLRP12-mediated JNK inhibition, but not NF-B and ERK signaling, was critical for HCC prevention. Therefore, the study is of significance and novelty in the field of both immunology and oncology. Generally, the study is well designed and presented. Most of the data are convincing and impressive. However, there are several concerns may need to be further clarified. 1) The authors proposed a novel role of NLRP12 in hepatocytes during HCC pathogenesis while they also linked the effects to intestinal microbiota. However, since the model used is the NLRP12 knockout mice, the effects of NLRP12 in HCC pathogenesis definitely involved the immune microenvironment. While the data in Figures 1-3 are convincing, the roles of NLRP12 in immune modulation have been ignored to some extent. This is a major concern. The contribution of NLRP12-mediated modulation of immune response has not been properly evaluated. Additionally, whether NLRP12 KO affected the microbiota (leading to enhanced inflammation of liver)? Hepatocyte-specific knockout model may improve the convincingness of the study. 2) In experiments regarding responsiveness of hepatocytes to PAMPs, LPS stimuli were used as standard treatment. Although I understand LPS derived from microbiota may be the major PAMPs, the other major or well-known endogenous PAMPs generated during HCC pathogenesis may also be taken into consideration. 3) In Figure 4, the authors highlighted the JNK activation in NLRP12 KO tumors and cells. However, these data cannot convincingly exclude the activation of NF-B and ERK pathway and the activation of STAT3 during HCC pathogenesis, as demonstrated in previous studies. Could the authors more quantitatively analyze the activation status of these related signaling mediators (WB is not sufficient as exclusion experiments)? [Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.] Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled carcinoma cJun N-terminal in the hepatocyte\" for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: It would be nice if the authors could provide data that NLRP12 is downregulated in hepatocytes of DEN- or DEN plus CCL4-induced HCC in mice or that NLRP12 protein level is downregulated in human HCC tissues. Please discuss the weaknesses of this study: the lack of hepatocyte-specific Nlrp12 KO models and the fact that the conclusion on the contributions of inflammatory cell populations and cytokines to HCC pathogenesis in this model would need to be supported by more data in the future. Reviewer #1: The authors investigated the role of Nlrp12 as a protective protein against carcinogen-induced HCC via animal models. The authors show that in DEN Nlrp12 KO mice had high levels of proto-oncogenes and activation of JNK signaling. Inhibition of JNK signaling reduced proliferation and hepatocyte inflammatory responses. The authors indicate in the rebuttal that the both genetic mutations and gene amplifications can occur and play contradicting roles in cancer. I agree. But the authors suggest that NRPL12 knockout enhances HCC progression. The concern here is the interpretation of what these genomic data means. A low frequency of alterations (<3%) in NRPL12 indicate that in humans, NRPL12 genomic alterations are rare and that NRPL12 has the potential to play both roles. In addition, the authors work shows that NRPL12 KO enhances HCC progression, therefore its likely not important for tumor initiation (as the NRPL12 KO alone doesn't produce much tumors). In addition, the author did not reconcile that in humans, NRPL12, with its low frequency in changes and a 1% vs. 2.5% in TCGA, but a 1% and 1% AMC, or mutated less 2% in Inserm, that NRPL12 potentially could also be oncogenic and potentially play a minimal role in HCC progression? What is the likelihood that all other gene mutations with similar alterations in human samples are also functionally important, if not more important? While I appreciate that it's not easy to do a holistic approach, this data was not well explained nor was it reconciled in the manuscript or carefully and thoughtfully rebutted. In addition, the RNASeq data (using a different data platform (UALCAN instead of cbioportal, which collects and processes TCGA differently, also is an issue as it may skew data). The authors indicate that because they used UALCAN, a platform for TCGA analysis, for RNASeq values data, the graph 1B is considered unbiased? I'm not sure what that means. This figure shows that in the TCGA data, there is a difference between tumor and non-tumor (not the same as normal livers, since TCGA patients are more likely to be HBV, HCV, NAFLD and fatty liver disease as underlying liver disease) with unequal numbers of samples. What is the likelihood of this difference being specific to this dataset (could be background noise due to the low number of non-tumor samples) as opposed to be a robust HCC specific observation? To answer this question, the authors have to check other datasets that are available to confirm that these observations are stable (not specific to this cohort, not specific to the low numbers of non-tumors). The authors did so in 1A, but did not in 1B. In response to the authors comment about DEN-induced mice not producing tumors in other organs, DEN is also widely used as a carcinogen in other animal models for other cancer types. Where are the data to demonstrate this model doesn't? I don't agree that because its well-used in the liver field, the authors shouldn't show controls. At least at the timepoint in which the authors sacrificed the mice. Reviewer #2: The authors have performed additional experiments to address my concerns, such as comparison of microbiota, ELISA confirmation of JNK activation, and clarification of inflammatory factors in HCC pathogenesis. More importantly, the authors have clearly described the limitations and provided possibilities for the current data. So generally I agree that the authors have made essential revisions for the manuscript. Considering the importance and novelty of the current study, I recommend to accept the paper for publication. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.037](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40396.037) Author response Essential revisions: 1) More accurate quantitative methods are required to confirm the activation of JNK in NLRP12-inhibited HCC pathogenesis by excluding the involvement of the well-known NF-B and STAT3 pathways in this process. To understand what signaling pathways contribute to increased HCC pathogenesis in Nlrp12-/- mice, we measured the activation status of different signaling pathways including NF-B (p65), ERK, JNK, lysates wild-type and Nlrp12-/- mice by Western blotting (Figure 4D and 4E). Our data show that all these pathways are activated in both WT and Nlrp12-/- HCC. However, the intensity of P-JNK was significantly higher in Nlrp12-/-HCC compared to that of WT (Figure 4D and 4E). We would like to clarify that we are not implying that JNK is the only pathway activated in Nlrp12-/- HCC tissues and other pathways do not contribute to HCC. While p65, ERK, p38, and STAT3 pathways are also activated, there was no statistically significant difference in their levels between WT and Nlrp12-/- tumors (Figure 4E), implicating a dominant role of P-JNK in higher HCC pathogenesis in Nlrp12-/- mice. Western blot is a gold standard method for measuring the activation of cell signaling pathways. However, as the reviewer insisted on measuring the activation of these pathways in a different quantitative approach, we used an ELISA-based method (Pathscan Inflammation Multi-Target ELISA; Cell Signaling Technology) (Figure 4F). The new data showing higher P-JNK in Nlrp12-/- HCC lysates compared to WT is consistent with our Western blot analysis. There was no significant difference in the activation of other pathways (Figure 4F). Therefore, this quantitative analysis further strengthens our observation that NLRP12 down-regulates JNK activation in the liver during HCC development. 2) The roles of NLRP12 in immune modulation have been ignored to some extent. The contribution of NLRP12-mediated modulation of immune response should be properly evaluated. To understand the role of NLRP12 in immunomodulation, we measured the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in HCC tissues by 2C, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D), and quantify different immune cell population including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and neutrophils by flow cytometry 2D and (MIP2), and Ccl2 (MCP1) are significantly highly expressed in the tumors of Nlrp12-/- mice. In addition to these, we measured several others cytokines and chemokines but no difference was observed in their levels between the groups. In the interest of space, we didn't include those non-significant data. The flow cytometric analysis of tumor infiltrated immune cells show a higher number of macrophages and dendritic cells in Nlrp12-/- tumors, while there was no major difference in T cells and neutrophils (Figure 2D and 2E). Consistently, we could not see any difference in IFN, IL-17 and IL-4 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F), suggesting that NLRP12 doesn't regulate T cell responses in HCC. Since we didn't observe any difference in T cell number or T-cell dependent cytokines between wild-type and Nlrp12-/- HCC, we didn't further investigate the role of NLRP12 in T cell responses in the liver. Instead, we focused on understanding why Nlrp12-/- HCC exhibited higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To this end, we analyzed signaling pathways and observed that Nlrp12 deficiency leads to hyper activation of JNK in the HCC. We further clarified what cell types regulate JNK activation in Nlrp12-dependent manner by isolating hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. Our data suggest that Nlrp12 regulates JNK activation in the hepatocyte but not in macrophages and stellate cells (Figure 4J). All these data led us to focus on the hepatocyte-specific function of NLRP12 which we described in Figure 6 and Figure 7. With all these data, we believe that we investigate the role of NLRP12 in immune modulation to an extent what is necessary to explain the underlying mechanism of higher HCC susceptibility in Nlrp12-/- mice. As the second reviewer stressed to further analyze the role of NLRP12 in the regulation of immune responses, we performed additional experiments and included the new data in the revised manuscript. At first, we measured the key cytokines IL-6, TNF, and KC in the lysate of WT and Nlrp12-/- tumors by ELISA. We observed that, consistent to real-time qPCR analysis, these proinflammatory cytokines were significantly highly expressed in Nlrp12-/-HCC (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E). Next, we addressed whether NLRP12 deficiency affects immune responses in the liver at homeostasis. To this end, we measured cytokines and chemokines in age and sex-matched healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- mouse livers. The expression levels of IL-6, TNF, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2 were seen and Nlrp12-/- livers (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C). We also measured the number of different immune cell population in the liver of age-matched healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- mice by flow cytometry and observed no difference in the number of macrophages, dendritic, T cells, and neutrophils between the two groups (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D). This data is supported by real-time qPCR analysis of F4/80 in the healthy liver, showing no major difference between the groups (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G). Finally, we measured the activation status of different signaling pathways in healthy livers. Interestingly, no difference in the activation of JNK, as well as other signaling pathways, was observed between healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- livers (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E). All these data suggest that Nlrp12 deficiency doesn't induce any immune dysregulation in the liver without any pathological trigger. We have discussed these observations in the last paragraph of the subsection \"NLRP12 attenuates PAMPs-mediated hepatic inflammation and oncogenesis\". In summary, our data suggest that NLRP12-mediated regulation of JNK in the hepatocyte play the key role in the suppression of HCC. Previously, we and others have shown that NLRP12 regulates inflammatory responses in myeloid and T cells in different disease contexts (Zaki et al., 2011; Lukens et al., 2015). It is possible that NLRP12 regulates different signaling pathways in cell type and tissue-specific manner. However, we do not completely exclude the involvement NLRP12-dependent regulation of myeloid and T cell-mediated immune responses in HCC pathogenesis. To further characterize NLRP12-dependent regulation of immune responses during HCC, we need to conditionally knockout NLRP12 in different immune cells. Due to resource limitation, we are not able to extend our investigation to that extent in this current study, but our future study will focus on this aspect. Reviewer #1: In general the study provides a straight forward concept: Nlrp12 plays an important role in maintaining a stable immunolandscape through the regulation of JNK signaling to prevent HCC. However, the clinical patient data demonstrates that NLRP2 is more likely to be oncogenic in HCC than downregulated, in contrary to their model as there are three independent dataset that show a higher propensity for gene amplification in HCC tumors than deletions, which focus on how the KO of NLRP12 increases the tumor burden of chemically induced HCC. How do the authors reconcile that gene amplification also contributes to HCC (its potential role as oncogenic), while the main message is that the loss of NLRP2 is important for HCC (tumor suppressive)? We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. With due respect to the reviewer comments, we disagree with the reviewer's opinion that NLRP12 is more likely to be oncogenic. The data presented in Figure 1A shows that mutation in NLRP12 is seen in 1.5-2.5% HCC, while amplification is observed in less than 1% patients. It is not uncommon that both mutation and amplification of a particular gene are associated with carcinogenesis. While loss-of-function mutations of a particular gene are commonly associated with carcinogenesis, amplification of the same gene is also linked with cancer susceptibility. Nlrp12 amplification may reduce JNK activation to a point that dysregulates normal liver physiology and promotes tumorigenesis. Indeed, inhibition of JNK1 and JNK2 in hepatocytes was seen to promote HCC burden (Das et al., 2011), while Jnk1-/- mice were protected from HCC (Hui et al., 2008). Similarly, TCGA database analyses through cBioportal show that both mutation and amplification of JNK are linked with HCC. Thus, it is not surprising that both mutations and amplifications of NLRP12 are associated with increased HCC. While Figure 1B addresses that the down-regulation of NLRP12 is found in HCC, what is the likelihood of this data something that is important for HCC and not a specific event found in only in the UALCAN webportal? UALCAN is a platform for analysis of publicly available RNAseq database of cancer. The graph presented here (Figure 1B) was based on TCGA data, which is a great resource of cancer genomics and commonly used by the research community. Therefore, the analysis shown in Figure 1B should be considered unbiased. In addition, the tumors shown are only liver tumors, is this something specific to the liver or is are there nodules in other organs as well? Since DEN induces malignancy in other tissues as well. Is this likely to liver specific event as eluded by the author? DEN-induced HCC is widely used model for HCC study. To our knowledge, the dose of DEN we used does not induce tumor in other organs. Indeed, we didn't observe any tumor development in other organs. Why would CCL4 treatment in DEN induced NLRP12 KO mice decrease the tumor size of DEN NLRP12 KO mice (Figure 1E vs. Figure 1J)? In addition, the mice seem to weigh less as well. These data indicate that CCL4, further hepatic injury, almost decreases tumor burden in DEN mice, and making them sicker. This doesn't make sense to the main paper. The differences in tumor size and mouse body between DEN plus CCl4 vs DEN alone model is due to the difference in time points when HCC was evaluated. As outlined in these two models in Figure 1C and 1H, the endpoints of the DEN model and DEN +CCl4 model were 10 and 6 months after birth respectively. No visible tumor lesion was observed in mice treated with DEN alone until 7 months post DEN administration (data not shown). Therefore, had we compared livers of DEN-treated mice at 6 months, we would not see any tumors in the earlier group while DEN+CCl4-treated mice developed an appreciable number of visible tumors. Similarly, if we would have allowed DEN+CCl4-treated mice to live until 10 months, there would have a higher number and much bigger tumors in the liver. Even some mice may not survive up to that time point due to severe HCC related complication. Therefore, the data presented here don't imply that CCl4 suppresses DEN-induced HCC, rather it accelerates HCC development. For the same reason, the reviewer might be confused with the data representing liver to body weight ratios (Figure 1E and 1J). Since DEN-treated mice were aged (10 months) compared to DEN+CCl4-treated mice (6 months), the body weight of the former group was higher. Furthermore, mice received CCl4 for 2 months starting at 2.5 months after their birth. CCl4 is a hepatotoxin which induces liver injury and affects liver function. Thus DEN+CCl4-treated mice gained body weight at a slower rate than DEN-treated mice. However, both groups of mice remained apparently healthy until the endpoint and there was no incidence of death during the experiment. Finally, we would like to mention that both of these two models are commonly used in HCC studies. The number and size of tumor lobes depend on the dose of CCl4and the duration of the experiment. Thus, although the tumor size and other morphometric features of HCC obtained from two different models are not comparable, the conclusion that Nlrp12-/- mice are more susceptible to HCC compared to WT mice is same. Have the authors looked at NLRP12 KO mice + CCl4 alone? Do these NLRP12 KO mice + CCl4 also have a higher mortality rate than NLRP12 KO mice +DEN alone? Does NLRP12 KO Mice +CCl4 also have a higher tumor burden then WT? These are more appropriate questions to ask as a secondary model. Survival is important indicator of tumor burden, does the NLRP12 KO+DEN mice get sicker and die sooner than others after the 10 months? These data would suggest that the viability of the tumor type is specific to NLRP12 KO and not the DEN itself. Thanks for asking some intriguing questions. Without DEN, CCl4 alone doesn't induce any tumor and no DEN or DEN+CCl4-injected mouse died during the experiment. The role of NLRP12 on CCl4-induced liver fibrosis is an important concern, but out of the scope of this current study. A role for NLRP12 in liver fibrosis should be investigated in depth in a separate study using appropriate animal models (we discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection \"NLRP12 regulates hepatocyte proliferation via JNK\"). We agree that it would be interesting to see whether DEN-treated Nlrp12-/-mice die faster than WT mice. However, our IACUC protocol does not permit to leave the experimental mice until they die. With the help of published literature and our own preliminary experiments, we optimized treatment doses and experimental scheme which would allow us to evaluate HCC pathogenesis without reaching to a condition when mice would become moribund. We are required by the IACUC to terminate the study before mice suffer from pain and distress. Reviewer #2: [...] 1) The authors proposed a novel role of NLRP12 in hepatocytes during HCC pathogenesis while they also linked the effects to intestinal microbiota. However, since the model used is the NLRP12 knockout mice, the effects of NLRP12 in HCC pathogenesis definitely involved the immune microenvironment. While the data in Figures 1-3 are convincing, the roles of NLRP12 in immune modulation have been ignored to some extent. This is a major concern. The contribution of NLRP12-mediated modulation of immune response has not been properly evaluated. Additionally, whether NLRP12 KO affected the microbiota (leading to enhanced inflammation of liver)? Hepatocyte-specific knockout model may improve the convincingness of the study. Please see our reply in response to editorial comment #2 regarding the concern on the role of NLRP12 in the modulation of immune response. To address the reviewer's concern regarding microbiota, we measured the microbiota composition of healthy wild-type and Nlrp12-/- mice by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed that the composition of certain bacterial species is different between WT and Nlrp12-/- mice. However, such a difference in microbiota composition didn't impact on immune homeostasis in the liver as inflammatory responses in the livers of the healthy WT and Nlrp12-/- mice are comparable (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C-E). We have discussed the new data in the last paragraph of the subsection \"NLRP12 attenuates PAMPs-mediated hepatic inflammation and oncogenesis\". 2) In experiments regarding responsiveness of hepatocytes to PAMPs, LPS stimuli were used as standard treatment. Although I understand LPS derived from microbiota may be the major PAMPs, the other major or well-known endogenous PAMPs generated during HCC pathogenesis may also be taken into consideration. We have shown that in addition to LPS, other PAMPS such as peptidoglycan (PGN) and cytokine TNFa manner (Figure6\u2014figure supplement 1B and 1C). Several molecules and danger signals produced in the tumor microenvironment may also activate JNK. However, examining the role of NLRP12 in activating JNK in response to all of these endogenous ligands and implicating those data in our current study is out of context. 3) In Figure 4, the authors highlighted the JNK activation in NLRP12 KO tumors and cells. However, these data cannot convincingly exclude the activation of NF-B and ERK pathway and the activation of STAT3 during HCC pathogenesis, as demonstrated in previous studies. Could the authors more quantitatively analyze the activation status of these related signaling mediators (WB is not sufficient as exclusion experiments)? Please see our reply to the editorial comment #1. [Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.] The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: It would be nice if the authors could provide data that NLRP12 is downregulated in hepatocytes of DEN- or DEN plus CCL4-induced HCC in mice or that NLRP12 protein level is downregulated in human HCC tissues. Please discuss the weaknesses of this study: the lack of hepatocyte-specific Nlrp12 KO models and the fact that the conclusion on the contributions of inflammatory cell populations and cytokines to HCC pathogenesis in this model would need to be supported by more data in the future. We thank the editors and reviewers to review our revised manuscript favorably. As suggested by the editors, we measured Nlrp12 expression in healthy and HCC livers and presented the data in the revised manuscript (Figure 1C). The new data show that Nlrp12 is downregulated in HCC tissue compared to healthy livers. This data supports the RNAseq data showing that the expression of NLRP12 is significantly reduced in human HCC (Figure 1B). We have discussed the weakness of this study as the reviewer and editors pointed out in the revised manuscript. Please see the fourth paragraph of the Discussion for relevant changes. Reviewer #1: [...] The authors indicate in the rebuttal that the both genetic mutations and gene amplifications can occur and play contradicting roles in cancer. I agree. But the authors suggest that NRPL12 knockout enhances HCC progression. The concern here is the interpretation of what these genomic data means. A low frequency of alterations (<3%) in NRPL12 indicate that in humans, NRPL12 genomic alterations are rare and that NRPL12 has the potential to play both roles. In addition, the authors work shows that NRPL12 KO enhances HCC progression, therefore its likely not important for tumor initiation (as the NRPL12 KO alone doesn't produce much tumors). In addition, the author did not reconcile that in humans, NRPL12, with its low frequency in changes and a 1% vs. 2.5% in TCGA, but a 1% and 1% AMC, or mutated less 2% in Inserm, that NRPL12 potentially could also be oncogenic and potentially play a minimal role in HCC progression? What is the likelihood that all other gene mutations with similar alterations in human samples are also functionally important, if not more important? While I appreciate that it's not easy to do a holistic approach, this data was not well explained nor was it reconciled in the manuscript or carefully and thoughtfully rebutted. We thank the reviewers for critically reviewing our manuscript, which helped improve our manuscript and better explain the role of NLRP12 in HCC. We agree with the reviewer that NLRP12-deficiency alone doesn't initiate HCC. During tumor promotion, NLRP12 acts as a tumor suppressor, at least in our mouse model. Therefore Nlrp12-deficient mice develop a higher number and faster progression of the tumor. We don't consider NLRP12 a potential oncogene or tumor suppressor, rather it is a regulator of signaling pathways, such as JNK, which are involved in HCC pathogenesis. Similar to NLRP12, many other innate immune molecules are involved in the regulation of HCC. Previous studies described the role of et al., 2014; Hui et al., 2008; Luedde et al., 2007; Maeda et al., 2005). None of these innate molecules are seen to be altered at a higher frequency in human HCC (please see [Author response image 1](#respfig1)), but their roles in the protection against HCC are appreciated. In fact, HCC is a genetically heterogeneous disease. While several genes such as TP53, CTCNB1, WNT, ARID1A, TERT, etc. are frequently mutated in HCC, genetic alterations in many other genes are associated with HCC and has been shown to promote the tumorigenesis process. Therefore, many genes with lower frequency mutations are considered critical regulators of HCC pathogenesis. As the reviewer may understand, comparison of NLRP12 with other related genes in HCC pathogenesis is out of scope of this study. However, we have added a discussion on this issue in light of the reviewer's comments in the revised manuscript (please see Discussion, second paragraph). We hope that with these changes and discussion in this rebuttal letter, the reviewer will find that we have adequately addressed the reviewer's concerns. In addition, the RNASeq data (using a different data platform (UALCAN instead of cbioportal, which collects and processes TCGA differently, also is an issue as it may skew data). The authors indicate that because they used UALCAN, a platform for TCGA analysis, for RNASeq values data, the graph 1B is considered unbiased? I'm not sure what that means. This figure shows that in the TCGA data, there is a difference between tumor and non-tumor (not the same as normal livers, since TCGA patients are more likely to be HBV, HCV, NAFLD and fatty liver disease as underlying liver disease) with unequal numbers of samples. What is the likelihood of this difference being specific to this dataset (could be background noise due to the low number of non-tumor samples) as opposed to be a robust HCC specific observation? To answer this question, the authors have to check other datasets that are available to confirm that these observations are stable (not specific to this cohort, not specific to the low numbers of non-tumors). The authors did so in 1A, but did not in 1B. The major focus of this study is to demonstrate a biological function of NLRP12 in inflammation and carcinogenesis in the liver using animal models of HCC. The reviewer may appreciate that we have demonstrated compelling data based on animal models and cell culture systems which support a critical role for NLRP12 in the suppression of HCC. We are very sincere about the robustness and reproducibility of our experimental data. Therefore, we performed every key experiment in multiple ways. For example, we showed the HCC phenotype in two different model - DEN and DEN plus CCl4. We measured the signaling pathways in whole liver, tumor tissues, isolated tumor cells, and primary hepatocytes. In addition, we overexpressed and knocked down NLRP12 in vitro and confirmed the function of NLRP12 in hepatocytes. Similarly, we established the role of NLRP12 in hepatocyte proliferation in multiple approaches including Ki67 staining of tumor tissue and hepatocyte culture, IncuCyte live imaging, and BrdU staining. Including mutation and expression analysis of NLRP12 in human HCC (Figure 1A and 1B) is a part of our effort to support the findings of our experimental study. However, genome sequencing and bioinformatics are not our expertise. We, therefore, relied on publicly available online platforms for genomics and transcriptomics analyses of NLRP12. We analyzed the frequency of alterations of NLRP12 in human HCC based on available datasets in cBioportal. However, cBioportal is not a suitable platform for the analysis of expression profile of a gene of interest and comparison between normal vs tumor samples. We found that UALCAN web-portal, which uses only TCGA datasets, is a helpful platform in this regard. We are sorry that we are not able to provide RNAseq data analysis from other sources as the reviewer asked; UALCAN doesn't have any resource/option to analyze other datasets. On the other hand, cBioportal doesn't provide a comparative analysis of gene expression in tumor vs non-tumor samples. However, as the editor suggested, we now provide Nlrp12 expression profile in healthy and HCC mouse livers. Our data demonstrate that Nlrp12 expression is significantly reduced in liver tumors compared to healthy livers (Figure 1C). We hope that the reviewer will find this new data is supportive of human NLRP12 expression data (Figure 1B). We understand the importance of a large scale clinical data analysis to establish the role of a gene in a particular disease. However, we believe that our study will be used as a platform for future research focusing on genomics and transcriptomics analyses of NLRP12 in HCC and other liver disorders. In response to the authors comment about DEN-induced mice not producing tumors in other organs, DEN is also widely used as a carcinogen in other animal models for other cancer types. Where are the data to demonstrate this model doesn't? I don't agree that because its well-used in the liver field, the authors shouldn't show controls. At least at the timepoint in which the authors sacrificed the mice. As we explained previously, we opted to use DEN model because it is widely used for HCC study (Bakiri and Wagner, 2013). We acknowledge that as a DNA alkylating agent, DEN may have a potential for inducing tumor in other organs. However, DEN-induced carcinogenesis is dependent on dose, time of administration, and duration of the treatment (Verna et al., 1996). For example, a low dose of DEN administration in mice at 2 weeks of age induces tumor development in the liver because liver cells are rapidly proliferating at that age allowing DNA modification. DEN-induced HCC model was developed by other researchers about 5 decades ago (Rajewsky et al., 1966) and optimized over time to make it an ideal model for studying HCC. We followed HCC studies published by eminent scientists like Dr. Michael Karin and Dr. Robert Schwabe. In their published literature, we could not find any description of tumor development in other organs during DEN-induced HCC (Dapito et al., 2012; Maeda et al., 2005; Sakurai et al., 2008; Sakurai et al., 2006). In our own study, we also didn't notice any apparent tumor development in other organs like kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. We are showing some representative images here taken during the sacrifice of DEN-treated mice (please see [Author response image 2](#respfig2)). We are not excluding the possibility of tumor metastasis in other organs at an advanced stages of HCC. However, honestly speaking, we did not focus on this aspect in this current study. To test such a possibility, we need to examine different organs histopathologically. In the future study, we will investigate whether Nlrp12-deficiency promotes tumor metastasis.

Here, we found that FOXP2 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells and prostate tumors, but its expression is absent in normal prostate epithelial cells and low in benign prostatic hyperplasia. FOXP2 is a FOX transcription factor family member and tightly associated with vocal development. To date, little is known regarding the link of FOXP2 to prostate cancer. We observed that high FOXP2 expression and frequent amplification are significantly associated with high Gleason score. Ectopic expression of FOXP2 induces malignant transformation of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1. Conversely, FOXP2 knockdown suppresses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Transgenic overexpression of FOXP2 in the mouse the FOXP2-induced oncogenic phenotype. CUT&Tag assay identified FOXP2-binding sites located in MET and its associated gene HGF. Additionally, the novel recurrent FOXP2-CPED1 fusion identified in prostate tumors results in high expression of truncated FOXP2, which exhibit a similar capacity for malignant transformation. Together, our data indicate that FOXP2 is involved in tumorigenicity of prostate. "}
