The noun is formed from the verb a- 'to know'; thus, a shaman is literally \"one who knows.\" What is Shamanism? Shamanism is an ancient spiritual practice that has been practiced for thousands of years by indigenous cultures around the world. It is a holistic approach to healing that honors the interconnectedness of all living beings, the natural world and the spirit world. At its core, shamanism is about connecting with the spirit world and using that connection to bring healing and balance to oneself and others. It is a practice that helps us to tap into our inner wisdom and the collective wisdom of the ancestors, and to access the spiritual guidance and support that is available to us. Shamans are often thought of as intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit world. The role of the shaman is not limited to just the spiritual realm, however. Many shamans also play important roles in the daily life and community of their cultures. They may act as healers, teachers, and leaders, and their practices often involve working with the collective energy of the community. Why Shamanism? Everything is energy. Another important aspect of shamanism is the use of energy work, such as reiki or acupuncture, to release stuck energy and restore balance to the body. This can be done through hands-on healing or through the use of intention and visualization. Through cleansing, clearing and rebalancing the chakaras or energy systems we are able to release stuck emotions and energy that can often lead to stress, anxiety, depression and illness. Spiritual Counseling. Many people today are drawn to shamanism as a way to heal and find greater meaning and purpose in their lives. The practices of shamanism can help individuals connect with their own inner wisdom and with the natural world, leading to a greater sense of connection and well-being. \"A Shamans duty is not to \"heal\" you, but to assist you as a hollow bone or clear channel for Spirit, God, The Creator to speak through to help you find tools inside you can use to heal yourself\".

Renda B. \"Aaron is a natural healer. I felt safe, secure and free to let go on his table. I felt clearer and brighter after the appointment. I highly recommend having a session with Aaron.\" Kyle R. \"Incredible experience and I will continue to see Aaron.\" \"My first session with Aaron was difficult to put into words. I had never expereinced energy healing before but was very excited to work with him after sitting in a Cacao Ceremony facilitated by him and his partner Lindsey. I felt a string energetic draw to Aaron and after briefly speaking with him I felt called to receive a session. He held a space where I felt safe and comfortable to compeletly let go. Trusting fully I was in great care and that I would receive exactly what spirit intended for me during our session. I felt powerful energy while on the table and a tremendous sense of clearing. I had difficulty articulating my experiences to Aaron afterwards but upon speaking with Aaron about the session from his perspective, I began to connect the dots and resonated deeply with what he shared. This was a divine experience to say the least and a powerful introduction to the realm of energy healing. I have sense been called to continue my journey through energy healing and look forward to continuing my work with Aaron. I feel he is a true and powerful conduit to spirit. I am grateful and honored to have had the blessing to sit with him. I would highly recommend his services to all that feel called.\" Lawrence G. "}
