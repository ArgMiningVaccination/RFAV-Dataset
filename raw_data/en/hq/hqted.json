Chase Middle School in Menifee operated under a \"shelter in place\" order for part of Monday morning, authorities said. The action was taken as a precaution after the discovery of \"potentially threatening statements\" on social media about 9 a.m., according to a news release by the Menifee Police Department. All students and staff remained indoors and no one was allowed to enter or leave the premises. The investigation revealed the identity of a former student believed to be responsible for the threat. It was determined that the juvenile no longer resides in Menifee. The student's current school, that city's police department, and the parents were notified. The threat was deemed not credible and the shelter in place was lifted about 11 a.m. No other details about the incident were released to the public. "}
