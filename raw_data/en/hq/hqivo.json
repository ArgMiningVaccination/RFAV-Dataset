According to this notion: (a) vertebral \"subluxations\"press on spinal nerves and interfere with the passage of energydown those nerves to various organs, causing the organs to be-come diseased, and (b) spinal manipulation (\"adjustments\") canremedy these problems. Since this \"discovery\"\u2014made by a gro-cer and \"magnetic healer\" in 1895\u2014an entire profession hasevolved, with some practitioners clinging to the original no-tion, some denouncing it, and others adopting a loosely definedmiddle ground. I consider these ideas, in all of their many forms,to be a hoax. \"Modern\" Chiropractic Chiropractic's most recent and \"authoritative\" description was formalized in 1996 by a consensus of the presidents of the 16colleges forming the Association of Chiropractic Colleges(ACC). The resultant position paper stated the following, whichI have slightly condensed: ACC Position on Chiropractic Chiropractic is a health care discipline which empha- sizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to healitself without the use of drugs or surgery. The practice of chiropractic focuses on the relation- ship between structure (primarily the spine) and func-tion (as coordinated by the nervous system) and how1 Why I Consider Chiropractic a Hoax4 Part I: Overview that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health. In addition, Doctors of Chiropractic recog-nize the value and responsibility of working in coop-eration with other health care practitioners when in thebest interest of the patient. . . . The Chiropractic Paradigm The purpose of chiropractic is to optimize health. The body's innate recuperative power is affected by and integrated through the nervous system. The practice of chiropractic includes: Establishing a diagnosis; Facilitating neurological and biomechanical integrity through appropriate chiropractic casemanagement; and P romoting health. The foundation of chiropractic includes philosophy, science, art, knowledge, and clinical experience. . . . The Subluxation Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention onthe subluxation. A subluxation is a complex of functional tural and/or pathological articular changes that compro-mise neural integrity and may influence organ systemfunction and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed, and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on thebest available rational and empirical evidence. Although the preceding statements are deliberately vague, they convey two themes that should be considered thebasis of chiropractic today: (1) vertebral \"subluxations\" influ-ence organ function and general health, and (2) managing themcan preserve and restore health. These ideas clash with the bodyof basic knowledge of health, disease, and health care that sci-entists have developed through centuries of study. Chapter 1. Why I Consider Chiropractic a Hoax 5 This chart falsely suggests that misaligned spinal bones are the cause or underlying cause of earaches, gallbladder problems, liver problems,hardening of the arteries, pneumonia, crossed eyes, and scores ofother health problems. Its listing in a recent catalog from chiropractic'sleading supply house indicates that many chiropractors still exaggeratewhat spinal manipulation can do. (The details are intentionally blurredto avoid violating the publisher's copyright.) Vertebrae Areas & Parts of Body Possible Symptoms My interest in chiropractic began during my childhood, as described in Chapter 2. During more than 40 years of6 Part I: Overview medical practice, I encountered many patients whom chiroprac- tors had mistreated for epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, cancer, andmany other conditions for which they had nothing legitimate tooffer. I eventually persuaded my state representative to intro-duce bills to the Connecticut legislature to prohibit or curtailcertain chiropractic practices, including treatment of children,but these bills did not pass. The final straw was a TV infomercial showing a chiro- practor manipulating a newborn's neck and stating, \"As the twigis bent, so grows the tree.\" This chiropractor advised mothers tohave their babies' neck \"subluxations\" adjusted immediatelyafter birth and subsequently throughout childhood in order tostay healthy. The chiropractor also advised against vaccinations.In my view, these activities amounted to a form of child abusethat should be challenged for what it is. During my investiga-tion, I visited two chiropractic colleges, interviewed severalchiropractors in depth, and sent and received correspondencefrom many more. This book, the first such work written by a medical doc- tor, exposes fairly and honestly chiropractic's failure to provethat \"adjusting\" the spine can cure disease or maintain \"wellness\"or health in any way. The effectiveness of modern medicineagainst disease is well documented in standard medical texts.In contrast, no scientific proof exists for the claims that are cen-tral to chiropractic practice.Many years ago, a 16-year-old high school student developed nausea that was accompanied by unusual abdominal pains. Hermother took her to the office of Dr. \"X,\" whom a friend hadrecommended as particularly knowledgeable about female medi-cal problems. Dr. \"X\" treated the girl with abdominal massage and vigorous spinal manipulations. The mother thought this wasstrange. She did not object, however, because she believed thatthe doctor had been so highly recommended and therefore shouldbe trustworthy. That night, the abdominal pain became so se-vere that the girl was rushed to a hospital where she was oper-ated on for a ruptured appendix. Her postoperative course tookseveral weeks, with life and death hanging in the balance. After the operation, the mother was horrified to learn that she had taken her daughter to the wrong person. The experther friend had recommended was a prominent medical doctorwith the same name as a local chiropractor. Acute appendicitis is usually easy to treat when diag- nosed early. When permitted to fester, however, the appendixcan burst and cause a severe infection (peritonitis) within theabdominal cavity. This, in turn, can lead to the development ofbands of scar tissue (adhesions) that can strangulate the intes-tines. Although the girl survived, she developed adhesions andsuffered from abdominal problems for the rest of her life. I know this case well, for the girl was my sister. Al- though I was only 10 at the time, it launched my interest inchiropractic, which has culminated in the writing of this book. 72 The Hoax in Action: Three Cases8 Part I: Overview My sister's chiropractor apparently believed that spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\") are the primary cause of illhealth and that spinal manipulations are the remedy. Thispremise\u2014still widely taught in chiropractic schools\u2014can de-lay people from getting necessary medical care. My Second Case All through my premedical education at Trinity College and medical school at Yale, nothing was ever mentioned that I canrecall about chiropractic. Perhaps something was said about thearchaic homeopathic theory that \"like cures like,\" meaning thatsubstances that can cause symptoms can cure diseases with thosesymptoms when given in tiny amounts. Christian Science mayalso have been mentioned, but most medical students consid-ered it unrealistic because it held that illness is an illusion andthat medical care should be avoided. Yes, it seemed fine to prayfor the sick\u2014and certainly we planned to hope and pray for therecovery of our sick patients\u2014but this did not involve the avoid-ance of medical care. My fellow students and I knew that more medical re- search was needed and that we were the generation to carry onthat quest for new knowledge. So it was that my second encounter with chiropractic was a shocking experience. During my internship at HartfordHospital, a man in his early 20s was brought into the emer-gency room unconscious, and I was called to examine him. Thehistory was very sparse: Friends had found him unresponsive inhis room and had him taken to the hospital by ambulance. There was no evidence of head injury and no odor of alcohol on his breath, but his breath did smell sweet. He was ina deep coma and looked emaciated. His lips and tongue wereextremely dry. His neck was flexible, which made it unlikelythat he had meningitis or was bleeding from a rupturedaneurysm within the skull. The results of the neurologic exami-nation were negative, except for the coma. Chapter 2: The Hoax in Action: Three Cases 9 Among the possible causes of coma, diabetic acidosis seemed the most likely. Drug overdose was not as common as itis today, whereas diabetic coma was more so because the typesof insulin back then were not as effective as those availabletoday. The diagnosis was quickly confirmed with blood tests that showed abnormally high levels of blood sugar and acetoneand a deranged balance of electrolytes. So we administered 100units of insulin intravenously along with a dilute salt-water so-lution to help restore his body fluid level and then planned togive more as needed based on his next blood sugar test andclinical findings. This regimen had been widely reported as ef-fective and was considered state-of-the-art treatment at that time. About half an hour after our treatment had begun, the man's distraught mother arrived and wanted to know what washappening. The conversation went something like this: \"Oh my God! What are you doing to him? My poor boy is dying. He won't answer me. What's in those bottles.He is unconscious. You know he has diabetes.\" \"We know,\" I assured her, \"and we are giving him insulin, salt, and fluids. He is very seriously ill but ismoving slightly and responding to treatment. He shouldmake it.\" \"But how much insulin are you giving him. You know his doctor reduced his insulin dosage from 90 to10 units a day. My son just hated to take his needles,and his doctor promised he would soon be able to stoptaking the insulin entirely.\" \"Well, I just gave him 100 units and planned to give him another 100 units more, depending on his next bloodsugar level in half an hour or so.\" \"My goodness, that's too much,\" she pleaded. \"His doctor was massaging his pancreas and working on hisback and had him down to 10 units.\" \"Madam, believe me, he needs the insulin,\" I ad- vised, \"and if he does not get it, he will certainly die.10 Part I: Overview Look, he is skin and bones and dry as the desert. His blood is all acid and his sugar is out of sight. If youdon't like his treatment, you can take him elsewhere bysigning him out against our advice, but I strongly feelwe can save him if you would just be patient and trustus.\" My firm reply seemed to have a calming effect, and the mother agreed to have him stay. I then asked what doctor wasmassaging his pancreas, manipulating his spine, and droppinghis insulin dosage. It was a local chiropractor. As the mother and I talked, the young man began to move about more and show signs of recovering\u2014which he fi-nally did, completely. This incident happened in 1943 and, like my sister's unlucky encounter, was a consequence of faulty chiropractictheory. You might expect that irrational treatment like massag-ing an abdominal organ for a serious disease would not occur inmodern times. Yet the next case shows that it does. The Death of Andy Warhol In February 1987, celebrity pop artist Andy Warhol died after surgical removal of his gallbladder. According to reports fromthe Associated Press and New York City's Chief Medical Ex-aminer Dr. Elliot Gross, he died of a cardiac arrhythmia, as statedon the death certificate. Warhol's medical and autopsy recordswere private and available only to members of the deceased'sfamily and could not be obtained for this book. However, thereport Dr. Gross released to the press stated: Regarding Andy Warhol, Case #M87-1718. The investigation into the death of Andy Warhol, who died at the New York Hospital on February 22,1987, has been concluded. Mr. Warhol had been admit-ted to the hospital for surgery on February 20, to Chapter 2: The Hoax in Action: Three Cases 11 remove an inflamed gallbladder due to a stone blocking the duct leading from the gallbladder. The investigation included the autopsy, toxicologi- cal tests, a review of medical records and personal andtelephone interviews with 30 individuals. One subpoenahad to be issued. The cause of death is a cardiac arrhythmia of unde- termined origin following surgical removal of the gall-bladder and repair of an abdominal incisional herniaunder general anesthesia. In the absence of significantanatomical or toxicological findings, the cause of deathis, therefore, a disturbance of the heart rhythm. The findings of the autopsy on February 23rd and subsequent microscopic examination of tissues disclosedchanges reflecting recent abdominal surgery. The op-erative site was intact and there was no internalhemorrhage. There was mild atherosclerosis of the coronary ar- teries. The lumens of the coronary artery displayed noocclusion, significant narrowing or thrombosis. Therewas no anatomic evidence of other types of heart disease. There was no pulmonary embolus. There were also no changes indicative of an allergic reaction. Toxicologic tests on autopsy specimens detected prescribed drugs in concentrations consistent with theiradministration during and subsequent to surgery. Ourmicroscopic examination of the gallbladder specimenindicated acute inflammation and longstanding chronicdisease associated with gallstones. Our investigation alsoindicates that physical manipulation may have contrib- uted to the onset of Mr. Warhol's immediate pre-hospi-tal illness [1]. On March 1, 1987, the Associated Press reported on the case with the headline, \"Warhol Complained of Pain after Visitto Chiropractor.\" The report stated:12 Part I: Overview Pop artist Andy Warhol complained of sharp pain after a chiropractor massaged his ailing gallbladder and testslater showed his condition had worsened and requiredprompt surgery, his doctors say. Warhol died of a heart attack that occurred on the day after his operation. His problem grew from routineto acute surprisingly quickly, the doctor told the Asso-ciated Press. The doctor did not directly link the chiro-practic treatment to the death of the 58-year-old Warhol,who emerged from surgery in stable condition but diedthe next morning, but he sharply criticized the massage. \"I am deeply concerned about it,\" said Dr. Denton Cox, who was Warhol's physician for 27 years. \"It isinappropriate in the extreme for a nonprofessional to doit, and a professional person would not have done it.\" Dr. Karen Burke, Warhol's dermatologist and a friend, said Warhol described the massage to her as a\"mashing\" of his gallbladder. The chiropractor, LindaLi, declined comment on the matter when reached bytelephone at her office. After learning the purpose ofthe call, she said, \"I think I'll conclude the conversationat this time\" and hung up. Louis Sportelli, a chiropractor and a board member of the American Chiropractic Association, rejected anyconnection of the treatment to Warhol's worsened con-dition. He said organ massage is too gentle to have suchan effect, but he also said that the practice is not widelyaccepted in the chiropractic community. \"To relate the chiropractic manipulation or massage of that gallbladder to the ultimate consequence of whathappened is ridiculous,\" Sportelli said Saturday. He saidthat linking the massage to Warhol's death was \"stretch-ing to place blame where none exits,\" and suggested itcould \"stem from prejudice by medical doctors againstchiropractors.\" [2] Chapter 2: The Hoax in Action: Three Cases 13 Sportelli's response\u2014blaming criticim of chiropractic on medical bias\u2014is one of the typical ways chiropractors de-fend themselves. Yet mashing a diseased gallbladder is a ridicu-lous thing to do. The gallbladder, when diseased or filled withstones, can become swollen. In this state, it may be felt by thehand and be accessible to massage. However, massage is dan-gerous because it can cause or increase inflammation, whichcan lead to rupture. No competent medical doctor would do sucha thing. Sportelli did not say why the chiropractor massaged Warhol's gallbladder or whether she also manipulated his spine. Why didn't the press ask him to explain exactly what chiro-practors can do for gallbladder disease and provide evidencethat would justify any such claim? Death caused by senseless treatment can result in crimi- nal prosecution, but such cases are rare. The most famous oneoccurred about 40 years ago when a chiropractor was convictedof second-degree murder after he persuaded the parents of an 8-year-old girl with cancer to permit him to treat her with vita-mins and spinal manipulation instead of standard medical treat-ment [3]. But Andy Warhol's chiropractor was not prosecuted. During the 1970s, Palmer Collegepublished about 50 pamphletspromoting chiropractic forappendicitis, diabetes,gallbladder disease, andmany other healthproblems. Although thesepamphlets are no longer sold,other publishers still sell manypamphlets that proclaim that\"subluxations\" can cause ill healththroughout the body and that spinal\"adjustments\" can fix them.14 Part I: Overview On August 1, 1987, The New York Times reported that no crimi- nal charge would be brought because the exact relationship be-tween the chiropractor's treatment and the cause of death couldnot be determined [4]. Why Danger Persists These three cases illustrate how chiropractic's failure to limit its scope can have extremely serious consequences. The per-centage of chiropractors who would attempt to treat appendici-tis, diabetic acidosis, an inflamed gallbladder, and other condi-tions requiring urgent medical care is unknown. The percentageis probably not high and is certainly lower than it was decadesago. However, widespread beliefs that spinal \"adjustments\" mayhelp problems throughout the body still encourage chiroprac-tors to use it inappropriately. References 1.

The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) nds it remarkable that the chiropractic profession has existed for a century without having made a single notable contribution to the world's body of knowledge in the health sciences. The reason for this failure can be found in its origins and in the continued presence of antiscience attitudes. This includes the elds of the care and prevention of back pain and the value of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), the areas in which chiropractic has dominated the health care services marketplace. Recent pronouncements on the value of manipula - tive therapy for back pain have involved medical research, not work done by doctors of chiropractic (DCs). DC publicists have been quick to grab the credit for these ndings for marketing purposes, but deserve little credit. Some research projects are now under way, but chiropractic still does not play a signicant role in researching the causes and treatment of the human ail - ments from which it derives most of its income. In the Beginning . . . Chiros (hand) + practos (practice) literally means \"done by hand.\" Chiropractic was invented in 1895 by Daniel D. Palmer, a layperson in Davenport, Iowa [1]. Because he sold goldsh commercially, Palmer is referred to by some historians as a \"sh monger.\" It is more interesting to know that he practiced magnetic healing beginning in the mid-1880s in Burlington, Iowa. Palmer 153 NCAHF Fact Sheet on Chiropractic (2004)16 Part I: Overview searched for the single cause of all disease. The standard story about chiropractic's \"discovery\" is that Palmer believed he had found the single cause of disease when he \"cured\" the deafness of janitor Harvey Lillard by manipulating his spine. (Palmer may have learned spinal manipulation from Andrew Still's os - teopathic school in Kirksville, Missouri). Lillard is said to have lost his hearing while working in a cramped, stooped position during which he felt something snap in his back. Palmer's version of this event has always been disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard Simons. She says that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's ofce and, Palmer, who had been read - ing, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said \"the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen.\" [2] Chiropractic's true origin appears to have been of a more mystical nature than the Lillard tale denotes. Palmer was an active spiritualist and apparently believed that the idea of \"replacing displaced vertebrae for the relief of human ills\" came in a spiritualist s\u00e9ance through communication with the spirit of Dr. Jim Atkinson, a physician who had died 50 years earlier in Davenport [3]. As a young man, Palmer regularly walked the six or seven miles to the estate of his spiritualist mentor, William Drury [4]. It was one of Drury's followers who told him of her vision of a door with a sign on it reading \"Dr. Palmer.\" She said that he one day would lecture in a large hall telling an audience about a new \"revolutionary\" method of healing the sick [5]. Predisposed to magnetic healing by his belief in spiritualism, Palmer was drawn to the practice by seeing the nancial success of illiterate \"Dr.\" Paul Caster of Ottumwa. Palmer's grandson described his technique: Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 17 He would develop a sense of being positive within his own body; sickness being negative. He would draw his hands over the area of the pain and with a sweep - ing motion stand aside, shaking his hands and ngers vigorously, taking away the pain as if it were drops of water [6]. Palmer began speculating that the flow of animal mag - netism may become blocked by obstructions along the spine [7]. Palmer taught that chiropractic was \"an educational, scientic, religious system\" that \"associates its practice, belief and knowl - edge with that of religion\" and \"imparts instruction relating both to this world and the world to come.\" \"Chiropractic,\" Palmer stated, \"sheds enlightenment upon physical life and spiritual existence, the latter being only a continuation of the former.\" [8] Individual chiropractors sometimes deny that they believe in Palmer's biotheological \"Innate Intelligence,\" but when pressed as to their basis for practice, they must face the physiological facts described in a scientic brief on chiropractic: If there is partial blockage of impulses in a nerve bre . . . the impulse is transmitted more slowly in a zone of partial blockage, and resumes all its characteristics as soon as it reaches normal tissue. Thus, it is impossible for a partial blockage of nerve impulses in a particular zone to affect the flow, since the impulses would resume their normal flow [9]. Unsupported by science, chiropractors must either fall back on Palmer's pantheistic views or admit that the \"sublux - ation\" theory is erroneous. Without this theory, chiropractors are reduced to spinal manipulators whose primary treatment modal - ity is shared by osteopaths, physiatrists, sports trainers, physical therapists, and others. Without subluxation theory, chiropractic's claim that it is a unique and comprehensive \"alternative\" to standard medicine is lost. D.D. Palmer had only modest success in promoting chiropractic. It was his son, B.J. Palmer, an eccen - tric promoter and Iowa radio industry pioneer, who developed chiropractic into a successful business enterprise.18 Part I: Overview Vitalistic Theory According to fundamentalist chiropractic theory, spinal \"sub - luxations\" mechanically interfere with nerve flow (the \"Innate Life Force\"), weakening organs served by the nerves and making them more susceptible to disease. Thus: \"Subluxations\" are the primary \"cause\" of disease, and restoration of nerve flow is essential to healing. The \"Innate\" is said to represent 'Universal Intelligence' (God); the function of 'Innate Intelligence' (Soul, Spirit or Spark of Life) within each, which D.D. Palmer considered a minute segment of 'Universal.' The fundamental causes of interference to the planned expression of that Innate Intelligence are Mental, Chemical and/or Mechanical Stresses that create the structural distortions that interfere with nerve supply [10]. Appeal Chiropractic combines metaphysical and mechanistic explana - tions of health and disease in a simplistic fashion. DCs have re - peatedly outperformed other providers in assessments of patient satisfaction [11-13]. DCs mostly treat back pain and are more sympathetic and supportive of patients' complaints. To DCs, back problems are signicant to overall health, whereas physicians consider such problems minor and self-limiting. Census The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) estimates that there are between 55,000 and 70,000 chiropractors in the United States [14]. Dynamic Chiropractic , a newspaper sent to every chiropractor it can locate, circulates to about 66,000 chiroprac - tors in the United States, including about 11,000 in California [15]\u2014the most in any state. Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 19 Legal Status All 50 states and the District of Columbia attempt to regulate chiropractic via licensure. DCs are also licensed in several other countries. One of the most difcult aspects of regulating chiropractors is the ambiguity of their legally dened scope of practice. Most health care providers are limited to some precisely delineated structure or function of the body. For instance, den - tists are limited to treating the oral cavity, podiatrists are limited to treating the feet, and optometrists are limited to correcting vision problems. Chiropractors are limited to analyzing and manipulating the back, but this is no limit at all if you accept the chiropractic paradigm, which holds that nerve \"energy\" is a metaphysical entity that travels from out of the cosmos, into the mind, down through the spine, and into every organ of the body and that chiropractors can detect interferences with that cosmic energy flow and restore full power through manipulation or other methods. Chiropractors allege that virtually all health problems may be affected by their \"adjustments.\" They also assert that they can treat any condition that may benet from improving the flow of an alleged cosmic energy that emanates either from the throne of God or the nucleus of the Big Bang\u2014depending on one's fundamental beliefs. Limiting the scope of practice of ideological, nonmedical providers is the key to a great deal of consumer protection, but the practical problems of doing so can be confusing [16]. Factionalism To understand the confused world of chiropractic, one must dif - ferentiate between chiropractic theory (aka, \"philosophy\") and chiropractic practitioner factions. Chiropractic is a conglomera - tion of factions in conflict. Most obvious is the dichotomy of \"straights\" versus \"mixers,\" who are represented by two separate national organizations, the International Chiropractors Associa - tion and the ACA, respectively. At least a dozen different notions 20 Part I: Overview about how the spine should be corrected divide DCs. A govern - ment report has described the chaos within chiropractic: Heated controversy regarding chiropractic theory and practice continues to exist. On-site and telephone discus - sions with chiropractors and their schools and associa - tions, coupled with a review of background materials . . . result in a picture of a profession in transition and con - taining a number of contradictions. There continues to be some disagreement with the profession regarding which conditions are appropriate for chiropractic care and re - garding appropriate parameters for treatment [17]. Scientic Status Chiropractic theory has failed tests of both validity and reliabil - ity. The \"subluxation,\" which is the foundation of its theory, has never been demonstrated to exist. Moreover, anatomist Edmund Crelin, PhD, twisted cadaver spines and found that nerves were not impinged as chiropractors postulate [18]. The ACA is equivocal on the idea of the existence and importance of spinal misalignments [19]. DCs have repeatedly failed eld tests of reliability. Chiropractic public relations have exaggerated the signicance of a British study that compared the satisfaction of patients with low back pain (screened for contraindications to manipulation) who received private practice DC care with others who were treated by physiotherapists in the government's Royal Hospital Service [13]. Chiropractors often misrepresent a review of mani-pulative therapy by the Rand Corporation [20,21] as proof of chiropractic's value. They generally do not reveal that: The Rand study was not conducted because of some new indication of the apparent scientic merit of manipulative therapy, but because the chiropractic profession paid to have the study done. Four of the nine evaluators of the studies were chiropractors who were favorably biased toward manipulation. Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 21 Only four of the 22 controlled trials they evaluated involved chiropractic care. The others involved safer techniques used by physical therapists, DOs, etc. The Rand panel concluded that \"the efcacy of spinal ma - nipulation is neither proven nor disproven at this time.\" A 1993 report by a Canadian economist, Pran Manga, who is a satised chiropractic patient, declared that chiropractic was safer, more effective, and more cost-effective than medical management of low back pain [22], but these conclusions were refuted by Rand's Dr. Paul Shekelle who noted that Manga had looked at \"the exact same studies as the rest of us, and no one else has been able to come to those conclusions.\" [23] The Manga report was also severely criticized by Dr. Hamilton Hall, director of the Canadian Back Institute [24]. The Rand Corporation also reviewed the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine, employ - ing the same technique it had used to evaluate SMT for back pain. Only 11.1% of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriate by a panel of nine judges (four DCs, four MDs, and one MD-DC). The most important nding was the paucity of evidence for the benet of these procedures [25]. The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. (For details on workers compensation and other studies involving chiropractic treatment of back pain, see the NCAHF consumer information statement on chiropractic back care.) In 2003, the Annals of Internal Medicine published a meta-analysis by Dr. Shekelle and three other experts who evaluated the results of 39 randomized controlled trials that had involved manipulative treatment for back pain. The report concluded: Spinal manipulative therapy is probably more effective than a placebo but its effectiveness compared with other advocated therapies is substantially less than previous reviews and meta-analyses have suggested. . . . We found no evidence that spinal manipulative therapy is superior to . . . analgesics, exercises, physical therapy, 22 Part I: Overview and back schools. Neither did we nd that these therapies are superior to spinal manipulative therapy. Therefore, we conclude that spinal manipulative therapy is one of several options of only modest effectiveness for patients with low back pain [26]. Antitrust Legal Victory DCs won a highly publicized antitrust lawsuit in 1987. Chiro - practic public relations messages have largely misrepresented its signicance. The facts of the case help put it in proper perspec - tive. From 1966 to 1980, the American Medical Association's (AMA) code of ethics prohibited its members from collaborating with DCs. The change in 1980 apparently resulted from legal advice and not because the AMA felt that DCs had become ac - ceptable. In 1976, several DCs led an antitrust lawsuit (Wilk v AMA, et al) charging restraint of trade under the Sherman Anti - trust Act, a law designed to ensure marketplace competition. The AMA was acquitted in 1981, but the case was over - turned on appeal. In the new trial, the plaintiffs asked only for an injunction to prohibit the AMA from ever again imposing an ethical restriction on its members to refer patients to DCs. The Sherman Act was meant to apply business, not to scientic af - fairs. An important legal question involved whether the AMA's ethical prohibition had been exempt from the Sherman Act. The AMA argued that the scientic aspects of patient care had been their reason for prohibiting members from collaboration. In 1987, Judge Susan Getzendanner decided that the AMA's concerns had been justied and were the dominating factor in its behavior (rather than economics). Nevertheless, she found the AMA guilty because it had failed to prove that its ethical boycott was reasonable and the least restrictive of competition. Once the ethical boycott was determined to have been illegal, chiropractic propagandists labeled it a \"conspiracy\" and proclaimed that the AMA was found guilty of conspiring to elimi - nate chiropractic. Their message implies that the \"conspiracy\" Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 23 was secret and medically unjustied and that the court's nding proved that chiropractic is a valid health care system. None of these is true. Judge Getzendanner stated that her ruling had no bearing on the validity of chiropractic and that the ethical boycott was done openly. It must be noted that MDs are not required to refer patients to DCs and that referring physicians assume some risk for harm that comes to patients at the hands of practitioners to whom they were referred, particularly if there was reason to fear that the practitioner uses unscientic practices. Since some DCs reject cultism and pseudoscience, DCs must be evaluated on an individual (See also: \"Statement from AMA's General Counsel.\" JAMA 259:83, 1988) Major Risks Forceful neck manipulations can cause stroke and paralysis. A survey by the Stanford (University) Stroke Center found that within a 2-year period, 56 strokes had occurred among patients within 24 hours after receiving neck manipulation by a DC. One patient died, and 86% were left with permanent impairment. Most cases involved intervertebral artery damage. The age range of patients affected was 21 to 60 years, with most occurring in young individuals [27]. The Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons advised doctors to warn patients about the risks of neck manipulation after it was found that six cases of brain- stem injury resulting in permanent paralysis had occurred within the province in the previous 3 years. Manitoba has a population of about 1 million, and since not all go to DCs, such an incidence of injury greatly exceeds the estimated 1-in-10 million risk associated with such procedures [28]. A bibliography of 166 documented and 17 anecdotal reports of vertebrobasilar injury after SMT was published in 1996 [29]. Full-spine x-ray exposure of the type used by many DCs may cause cancer. Dosimetric calculations used to test the theory that full-spine x-rays help detect bony neoplasms, both a 24 Part I: Overview contraindication to manipulation of the spine and an early detec - tion of cancer, led to the conclusion that a full-spine x-ray of a 25-year-old male is twice as likely to cause the patient's death from cancer than it is to detect a bony tumor [30]. A ve-view lumbosacral series of x-rays exposes the gonads to 3,000 times more radiation than front-to-back and lateral chest x-rays. The National Academy of Sciences Research Council estimates that spinal radiography causes an estimated 100 to 200 deaths per year from various cancers [31]. Indirect harm attributable to chiropractors includes im - proper treatment as a result of failure to diagnose a condition [32,33] and the practice of many chiropractors to discourage parents from immunizing their children based on chiropractic philosophy [34-36]. In 1994, the chiefs of the departments of pediatrics and pediatric hospitals in Canada issued the following statement: We wish to express our great concern over unscientic claims being made by Canadian chiropractors regarding the proper care of infants and children. These claims come from ofcial statements from both the Canadian and Ontario Chiropractic Associations. Chiropractic treatment for such conditions as ear infections, infantile colic, newborn jaundice, spinal scoliosis and tonsillitis, amongst others, are being recommended in at least one major textbook being used at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto. We call upon the gov - ernments of Ontario and Quebec, which have the only two chiropractic schools in Canada, to evaluate the courses being taught and the claims being made by the graduates of these schools regarding the treatment of infants and children. Contrary to the information being provided to parents and to the general public: 1. Chiropractic spinal manipulation is NOT required as a preventive therapy to maintain a child's health. 2. Chiropractic spinal manipulation is NOT an alter - native for pediatric immunization. Books sold at the Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 25 Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto are anti-immunization in nature. 3. Chiropractic does NOT alter the course of, nor does it prevent in any way, childhood illness such as ear infec - tions, asthma attacks, bed-wetting, or infantile colic. 4. Chiropractic use of x-rays of infants and children to diagnose so called vertebral subluxations is unscientic and of no value whatsoever. These x-rays can contribute, without any benet to the child, to the future risk in the child of cancers and genetic damage. Parents should never allow their children's spines to be x-rayed by a chiropractor. 5. There is no scientic evidence whatsoever that the so-called chiropractic spinal adjustment results in any correction to a child's spine. These adjustments are inef - fective and useless. 6. School boards should not authorize, and parents should not allow their children to attend, elementary school screening programs organized by chiropractors to detect scoliosis or any other postural deformities in children. Postural deformities of children such as scoliosis, kyphosis, or unequal leg lengths are not ef - fectively treated by manipulation. In the great majority of instances, what a chiropractor may diagnose as sco - liosis in a child is in fact a minor variation in a perfectly normal spine. 7. Parents should regard with extreme skepticism claims made by some other parents that their infants or chil - dren have been cured by chiropractic adjustments for such conditions as infant colic, recurrent ear infections, learning disorders, asthma, chronic abdominal cramps, or bed-wetting. However well meaning, such personal testimony is unreliable and is not a substitute for scien - tic fact.26 Part I: Overview Parents should read the June 1994 issue of Consumer Reports magazine in which the clear recommendation is made not to allow any chiropractor to solicit children for chiropractic treatment. 8. We understand the concern of parents in regard to ear infections that they may feel their child has taken many antibiotics or may require a surgical procedure. These concerns should not lead the parents to believe that chiropractic adjustments, which have the emotional appeal of being medication free or \"natural\" are an alternative to what may very well be in the best overall interests of the child. 9. We welcome the scientic guidelines of the Ortho - practic Manipulation Society International, under which manual therapy can be given in a responsible manner to adults who may require such care. We welcome warnings made in these guidelines about the unscientic use of x-rays and unscientic claims about treating pediatric conditions. We would encourage parents to seek their own personal care from their physical therapists, phy - sicians, and chiropractors who adhere to the scientic guidelines of the Orthopractic Manipulation Society International. 10. The musculo-skeletal problems of infants and chil - dren can be managed in a safe, scientic, and responsible manner by the family physician, the orthopedic special - ist, the physical therapist, and with medical consulta - tion, those chiropractors who adhere to the orthopractic guidelines. 11. We believe it to be irresponsible, and a total waste of our limited nancial resources for the governments of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia to be providing millions of dollars of public funds for chiropractors to treat infants and children. This Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 27 public scal support gives parents the false impression that society endorses the treatments. We call upon these governments to immediately suspend all chiropractic payments in the pediatric age group, i.e., up to 18 years [37]. Chiropractic Treatment of Childrens' Asthma. After a 3-week baseline evaluation, 91 children who had continuing symptoms of asthma despite usual medical therapy were randomly assigned to receive either active or simulated chiropractic manipulation (tantamount to placebo treatment) for 4 months. None had previously received chiropractic care. Each subject was treated by 1 of 11 participating DCs selected by parents according to location. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the peak expiratory flow that was measured in the morning before the use of a bronchodilator at 2 and 4 months. Except for the treating DC and one investigator (who was not involved in assessing outcomes), all participants remained fully blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the study. The researchers found no signicant differences in improvements between the two groups [38]. Chiropractic Reformers In 1987, chiropractors who reject the metaphysical biotheology and antimedical attitudes of chiropractic but see value in ma - nipulative therapy for limited conditions organized the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) [39]. NACM practitioners focus on the conservative treatment of musculo - skeletal conditions. Manual therapy is their main treatment, but the use of drugs such as pain relievers and muscle relaxants is considered desirable if they are legally available. NACM's open rejection of the subluxation theory and chiropractic philosophy and its acceptance of the scientic method set it apart from other factions within the chiropractic guild. This also has made it the target of scorn by chiropractic's true believers.28 Part I: Overview In 1994, NACM announced that it was giving up its struggle to reform mainstream chiropractic and was joining with an international group of manipulative therapists called orthopractors. NACM would become a U.S. chapter of the Orthopractic Manipulation Society (OMS) [23,40]. Orthoprac - tic therapy involves restoring a greater range of motion to the joints of the body through gentle and gradual mobilization or more forceful manipulation. Among other things, orthopractors (a) provide patient education that is aimed at reducing pain and disability and having the patients become independent of care; (b) specically reject the chiropractic subluxation theory; (c) do not use x-rays in diagnosis; (d) reject the use of manipulation to treat postural deformities in children (e.g., kyphosis, scoliosis, unequal leg lengths) or a variety of children's ailments (e.g., colic, eczema, learning disorders, infections, asthma, and more); (e) reject spinal manipulations for general health care; (f) sup - port immunization; (g) reject the use of testimonials to promote their services; (h) reject homeopathy; and (i) advise against sales promotions by chiropractors such as family plans, lifelong spinal adjustments, free x-ray examinations, and elementary school screening programs for scoliosis [41]. In addition to organizing like-minded practitioners, establishing a new profession requires the passage of new prac - tices acts by state legislatures, the development of education and training programs, and the marketing of the profession in a competitive setting. Political resistance to reform by traditional DCs and organized chiropractic is strong. The idea of an ortho - practic profession was such a serious threat to chiropractic in the United States that state licensing boards threatened to discipline chiropractors who identify themselves as ortho-practors. The organizational effort was squelched because orthopractors lacked the resources to simultaneously organize a new profession and defend against aggressive legal actions in state after state. Despite its inability to establish an evidence-based guild of manipulative therapy practitioners in the United States, orthopractic made its mark by describing what a legitimate profession would look like. Chapter 3: NCAHF Fact Sheet 29 The Future of Chiropractic At least 70% of adults will experience low back pain (LBP) at some time in their lives. Back symptoms usually begin in the third or fourth decade of life, peak on incidence in the 40s and early 50s, and decline rapidly thereafter. There has been no sex differences in incidence noted. Although acute LBP is a self-limiting illness, it can persist for a considerable time [42]. The main advantage of SMT is that it can provide more rapid relief in about one third of patients. There is more information on the value of manipulation by non-DCs than there is for DCs. However, NCAHF believes that our society has sufcient need for preventing (through ergonomics) and treating back pain (by manipulative therapy and medication) to sustain limited-scope health care providers under the entitlement of \"chiropractors.\" This will require greater attention to scientic research on the ap - propriate applications of SMT, expanding chiropractic training to include pharmacology, and rewriting state chiropractic practice acts to limit their scope of practice. Western States Chiropractic College (Portland, Oregon) is working in this direction and has changed the name of its diploma to \"Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine.\" Sectarian DCs are objecting vociferously to this advancement toward science. Precisely what will become of chiropractic in the future is uncertain. NCAHF believes that as some factions become more scientic, antiscientic chiropractic groups will continue to exist within chiropractic until it becomes economically impossible for them to survive. Consumer Beware B.J. Palmer considered chiropractic to be a business, not a profes - sion. He advised DCs to advertise and to sell their patients on the philosophy of chiropractic. Chiropractic education is proprietary (i.e., a business of its own). Unlike physicians, DCs do not go into residency programs after graduation. They are dumped on the marketplace to survive by whatever means necessary. Having 30 Part I: Overview been taught to be entrepreneurs, many sell whatever they can to make money. DCs regularly invade elds of health care in which they have no real skill (e.g., dietetics, physical therapy, sports medicine, pediatrics, and even veterinary medicine). Despite the obvious conflict of interest involved, many DCs sell dietary supplements, homeopathic remedies, herbal remedies, and other items directly to their patients. DCs take formal courses in prac - tice-building that teach methods of deception. Consumers are often no match for the schemes and scams DCs invent. References 1. Beck BL.

Mencken Debunks Chiropractic At Your Own Risk: The Case against Chiropractic The Views of Consumer Reports Smart Money Hits a Raw Nerve The Lemmon/Matthau TakeoffHenry Louis Mencken (1880-1956) was a controversial Ameri- can journalist, essayist, and literary critic. During the 1920s, hebecame famous for his vitriolic attacks on what he consideredto be the hypocrisy, stupidity, and bigotry of much of Americanlife. His critics considered him highly skilled at satire but intol-erant and often crude. The following essay was published in theBaltimore Evening Sun in December 1924. Although the medi- cal knowledge of his day was still quite primitive, Menckenknew enough to realize that chiropractic theory was a hoax. Amore modern version of chiropractic ridicule is described inChapter 8. Chiropractic This preposterous quackery is now all the rage in the back reaches of the Republic and even begins to con-quer the less civilized of the big cities. As the old-timefamily doctor dies out in the country towns, with notrained successor willing to take over his dismal busi-ness, he is followed by some hearty blacksmith or ice-wagon driver, turned into a chiropractor in six months,often by correspondence. In Los Angeles the damned, there are more chiro- practors than actual physicians and they are far moregenerally esteemed. Proceeding from the AmbassadorHotel to the heart of the town, along Wilshire Boule-vard, one passes scores of their gaudy signs; there areeven many chiropractic \"hospitals.\" The morons who 354 H.L. Mencken Dubunks Chiropractic (1924)36 Part II: What Others Have Said pour in from the prairies and deserts, most of them ail- ing, patronize these \"hospitals\" copiously, and give tothe chiropractic pathology the same high respect thatthey accord to the theology of Aimee McPherson andthe art of Cecil De Mille. That pathology is groundedupon the doctrine that all human ills are caused by thepressure of misplaced vertebrae upon the nerves whichcome out of the spinal cord\u2014in other words, that everydisease is the result of a pinch. This plainly enough isbuncombe. The chiropractic therapeutics rest upon thedoctrine that the way to get rid of such pinches is toclimb upon a table and submit to an heroic pummelingby a retired piano mover. This, obviously, is buncombedoubly damned. Both doctrines were launched upon the world by an old quack named Andrew T. Still, the father of osteopa-thy. For years his followers merchanted them, and madea lot of money at the trade. But as they grew opulent,they grew ambitious, i.e., they began to study anatomyand physiology. The result was a gradual abandonmentof Papa Still's ideas. The high-toned osteopathy of to-day is a sort of eclectic. He tries anything that promisesto work, from tonsillectomy to the vibrations of the lateDr. Abrams. With four years' training behind him, heprobably knows more anatomy than the average gradu-ate of the John Hopkins Medical School or, at all event,more osteology. Thus enlightened, he seldom has muchto say about pinched nerves in the back. But as he aban-doned the Still revelation, it was seized by the chiro-practors, led by another quack, one Palmer. This Palmergrabbed the pinched nerve nonsense and began teach-ing it to ambitious farmhands and out-at-elbow Baptistpreachers in a few easy lessons. Today the backwoodsswarm with chiropractors and in most states, they havebeen able to exert enough pressure upon the rural politi-cians to get themselves licensed. Any lout with stronghands and arms is perfectly equipped to become a chi- Chapter 4: H.L. Mencken Debunks Chiropractic 37 ropractor. No education beyond the elements is neces- sary. The whole art and mystery may be imparted in afew months, and the graduate is then free to practiceupon God's images. The takings are often high, and sothe profession has attracted thousands of recruits\u2014re-tired baseball players, plumbers, truck drivers, long-shoremen, bogus dentists, dubious preachers, villageschool superintendents. Now and then a quack doctorof some other school\u2014say homeopathy\u2014plunges intoit. Hundreds of promising students come from the intel-lectual ranks of hospital orderlies. In certain states, efforts have been made, sometimes by the medical fraternity, to make the practice of chiro-practic unlawful. I am glad to be able to report that prac-tically all of them have failed. Why should it be prohib-ited? I believe that every free-born man has a clear right,when he is ill, to seek any sort of treatment that he yearnsfor. If his mental processes are of such a character thatthe theory of chiropractic seems plausible to him, thenhe should be permitted to try chiropractic. And if it begranted that he has a right to do so, then it follows clearlythat any stevedore privy to the technique of chiroprac-tic has a right to treat him. To preach any contrary doc-trine is to advocate despotism and slavery. The argu-ments for such despotism are all full of holes and espe-cially those that come from medical men who have beenbitten by the public hygiene madness, i.e. by the messi-anic delusion. Such fanatics infest every health depart-ment in the land. They assume glibly that the whole aimof civilization is to cut down the death rate and to attainthat end they are willing to make a sacrifice of every-thing else imaginable including their own sense of hu-mor. There is, as a matter of fact, not the slightest rea-son to believe that cutting down the death rate in itselfis of much benefit to the human race. A people with anannual rate of 40 a thousand might still produce manyHuxleys and Darwins, and one with a rate of but 8 or 938 Part II: What Others Have Said might produce nothing but Coolidges and Billy Sun- days. The former probability, in truth, is greater thanthe latter, for a low rate does not necessarily mean thatmore superior individuals are surviving; it may meanonly that more of the inferior are surviving, and that thenext generation will be burdened by their get. Such quackeries as Christian Science, osteopathy and chiropractic work against the false humanitarian-ism of the hygienists and to excellent effect. They suckin the botched and help them on to bliss eternal. Whenthese botched fall into the hands of competent medicalmen, they are very likely to be patched up and turnedloose upon the world, to beget their kind. But massagedalong the backbone to cure their lues, they quickly passinto the last stages, and so their pathogenic heritage per-ishes with them. What is too often forgotten is that na-ture obviously intends the botched to die, and that ev-ery interference with that benign process is full ofdangers. Moreover, it is like birth control, profoundlyimmoral. The chiropractors are innocent in both depart-ments. That their labors tend to propagate epidemics andso menace the lives of all of this, as is alleged by theirmedical opponents\u2014this I doubt. The fact is that mostinfectious diseases of any seriousness throw out suchalarming symptoms and so quickly that no sane chiro-practor is likely to monkey with them. Seeing his pa-tient break out in pustules or choking or falling into astupor, he takes to the woods at once and leaves the busi-ness to the nearest medical men. His trade is mainlywith ambulant patients; they must come to his studiofor treatment. Most of them have lingering diseases; theytour all the neighborhood doctors before they reach him.His treatment, being essentially nonsensical, is in ac-cord with the divine plan. It is seldom, perhaps, that heactually kills a patient, but at all events he keeps many aworthy soul from getting well. Chapter 4: H.L. Mencken Debunks Chiropractic 39 Thus the multiplication of chiropractors in the Re- public gives me a great deal of pleasure. It is agreeableto see so many morons getting slaughtered, and it isequally agreeable to see so many other morons gettingrich. The art and mystery of scientific medicine, for adecade or more past, has been closed to all save the sonsof wealthy men. It takes a small fortune to go through aclass A medical college and by the time the graduate isable to make a living for himself, he is entering uponmiddle age, and is commonly so disillusioned that he isunfit for practice. Worse, his fees for looking at tonguesand feeling pulses tend to be cruelly high. His prede-cessors charged 50 cents and threw in the pills; his owncharges approach those of divorce lawyers, consultingengineers, and the higher hetaerrae. Even general practice, in our great Babylons, has become a sort of specialty, with corresponding emolu-ments. But the chiropractor, having no such investmentin his training, can afford to work for more humanewages, and so he is getting more and more of the trade.Six weeks after he leaves his job at the filling station orabandons the steering wheel of his motor truck, he knowsall the anatomy and physiology that he will ever learnin this world. Six weeks more and he is adept at all thehalf-Nelsons and left hooks that constitute the essenceof chiropractic therapy. Soon afterward, having takenpostgraduate courses in advertising, salesmanship andmental mastery, he is ready for the practice. A sufficiencyof patients, it appears, is always ready too. I hear nocomplaint from chiropractors of bad business. New onesare being turned out at a dizzy rate, but they all seem tofind the pickings easy. Some time ago I heard of a chi-ropractor who, having once been a cornet player, hadabandoned chiropractic in despair and gone back to cor-net playing. But investigation showed that he was re-ally not a chiropractor at all but an osteopath. The40 Part II: What Others Have Said osteopaths, I am sure, are finding this new competition serious and unpleasant. As I have said, it was theirHippocrates, the late Dr. Still, who invented all thethrusts, lunges, yanks, hooks and bounces that the lowlychiropractors now employ with such vast effect, and foryears the osteopath had a monopoly of them. But whenthey began to go scientific and ambitious, their courseof training was lengthened until it took all sorts of tricksand dodges, borrowed from the regular doctors, or res-urrection men, including the plucking of tonsils, ad-enoids and appendices, the use of the stomach-pumpand even some of the legerdemain of psychiatry. Theynow harry their students furiously and turn them outready for anything from growing hair on a bald head tofrying a patient with x-rays. All this new striving, ofcourse, quickly brought its inevitable penalties. The os-teopath graduate, having sweated so long, was no longerwilling to take a case of sarcoma for two dollars and inconsequence he lost patients. Worse, very few aspirantscould make the grade. The essence of osteopathy itselfcould be grasped by any lively farmhand or night watch-man in a few weeks, but the borrowed magic baffledhim. Confronted by the phenomenon of gastrulation, orby the curious behavior of heart muscle, or by any ofthe curious theories of immunity, he commonly tookrefuge, like his brother of the orthodox faculty, in a gulpof laboratory alcohol, or fled the premises altogether.Thus he was lost to osteopathic science and the chiro-practors took him in; nay, they welcomed him. He wastheir meat. Borrowing that primitive part of osteopathythat was comprehensible to the meanest understanding,they threw the rest overboard at the same time denounc-ing it as a sorcery invented by the Medical Trust. Thusthey gathered in the garage mechanics, ash-men and de-cayed welterweights, and the land began to fill with theirgraduates. Now there is a chiropractor at every cross- Chapter 4: H.L. Mencken Debunks Chiropractic 41 roads, and in such sinks of imbecility as Los Angeles, they are as thick as bootleggers. I repeat that it eases and soothes me to see them so prosperous, for they counteract the evil work of the so-called science of public hygiene, which now seeks tomake morons immortal. If a man, being ill of a pus ap-pendix, resorts to a shaved and fumigated longshore-man to have it disposed of and submits willingly to atreatment involving balancing him on McBurney's spotand playing on his vertebrae as on a concertina, then Iam willing, for one, to believe that he is badly wantedin Heaven. And if that same man, having achieved law-fully a lovely babe, hires a blacksmith to cure its diph-theria by pulling its neck, then I do not resist the divinewill that there shall be one less radio fan in 1967. Insuch matters, I am convinced the laws of nature are farbetter guides than the fiats and machinations of the medi-cal busybodies who now try to run us. If the latter gentle-men had their way, death, save at the hands of hang-men, Prohibition agents and other legalized assassins,would be abolished altogether, and so that present dif-ferential in favor of the enlightened would disappear. Ican't convince myself that would be of any good to theworld. On the contrary, it seems to me that the currentcoddling of the half-witted should be stopped before itgoes too far\u2014if, indeed, it has not gone too far already.To that end, nothing operates more cheaply and effec- tively than the prosperity of quacks. Every time a bottleof cancer specific goes through the mails, Homoamericanus is improved to that extent. And every time achiropractor spits on his hands and proceeds to treat agastric ulcer by stretching the backbone, the same highend is achieved. But chiropractic, of course, is not perfect. It has su- perb potentialities, but only too often they are not con-verted into concrete cadavers. The hygienists rescue42 Part II: What Others Have Said many of its foreordained customers, and, turning them over to agents of the Medical Trust, maintained at thepublic expense, get them cured. Moreover, chiropracticitself is not certainly fat: even an Iowan with diabetesmay survive its embraces. Yet worse, I have a suspicionthat it sometimes actually cures. For all I know (or anyorthodox pathologist seems to know), it may be true that certain malaises are caused by the pressure of vagromvertebrae upon the spinal nerves. And it may be true that a hearty ex-boilermaker, by a vigorous yanking andkneading, may be able to relieve that pressure. What isneeded is a scientific inquiry into the matter, under rigidtest conditions, by a committee of men learned in thearchitecture and plumbing of the body, and of a highand incorruptible sagacity. Let a thousand patients beselected, let a gang of selected chiropractors examinetheir backbones and determine what is the matter withthem, and then let these diagnoses be checked up by theexact methods of scientific medicine. Then let the samechiropractors essay to cure the patients whose maladieshave been determined. My guess is that the chiroprac-tors' errors in diagnosis will run at least 95% and thattheir failures in treatment will push 99%. But I am will-ing to be convinced. Where is such a committee to be found? I undertake to nominate it at ten minutes' notice. The land swarmswith men competent in anatomy and pathology, and yetnot engaged as doctors. There are hundreds of roomyand well-heated hospitals, with endless clinical mate-rial. I offer to supply the committee with cigars andmusic during the test. I offer, further, to supply both thecommittee and the chiropractors with sound pre-war wetgoods. I offer, finally, to give a bawdy banquet to thewhole Medical Trust, at the conclusion of theproceedings. \u2014H.L. Mencken In 1969, Ralph Lee Smith's book At Your Own Risk: The Case Against Chiropracti c [1] provided a detailed look at chiro- practic's shortcomings. The book's cover carried a bold state-ment by then-Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, Dr.Milton Helpern: \"The teachers, research workers and practitio-ners of medicine reject the so-called principle on which chiro-practic is based and correctly and bluntly label it a fraud and ahoax on the human race.\" Despite this scorching indictment\u2014and the underlying facts on which it was based\u2014the number of licensed chiroprac-tors in the United States has risen from about 23,000 at thattime to between 55,000 and 70,000 in 2001, according to theAmerican Chiropractic Association (ACA) Web site, and some4,000 students graduate from chiropractic colleges each year.Furthermore, chiropractors are licensed in all 50 states, whereasin 1969 Louisiana and Mississippi still refused to grant themlicenses. Lousiana's refusal had been upheld by the U.S Supreme Court, which ruled that states could deny such license if theydesired and had the right to insist on uniform, specificeducational standards for entrance into the healing arts. Duringthe trial, there was disagreement about whether chiropractorsshould engage in diagnosis. There was evidence that thechiropractic theory of subluxation was unscientific and that manychiropractors engaged in unscientific practices. The court didnot address whether chiropractic theory was, in fact, scientific,but only that the chiropractic theory of a single cause andtreatment of disease was wrong [2]. 435 At Your Own Risk: The Case against Chiropractic (1969)44 Part II: What Others Have Said Smith described the Supreme Court's decision this way: The state has a right to insist on uniform educational and scientific standards for entering the healing arts. Thistest, which is an elementary one, is nevertheless onethat chiropractic cannot meet because its beliefs andpractices are scientifically false [1]. Louisiana's legislature and public health officials had stubbornly and steadfastly pointed out that \"the emperor had noclothes.\" The only proper course that other states should havetaken was to follow Louisiana's precept that health care lawsshould accord with science. This would have meant the end ofthe Iowa grocer's dream. Unfortunately, that did not happen.With persistent lobbying, licensing laws were enacted in Mis- sissippi in 1973 and Louisiana in 1974 [3]. Chiropractic has indeed made many political gains in the past 30 years, as have many other \"alternative\" health carepractices. One of the major gains was Congress's inclusion ofchiropractic in the Medicare system despite a negative reportby then-Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, andWelfare (HEW) Wilbur J. Cohen. The 1968 HEW report concluded: 1. There is a body of basic scientific knowledge re- lated to health, disease and health care. Chiropracticpractitioners ignore or take exception to much of thisknowledge despite the fact that they have not under-taken adequate scientific research. 2. There is no valid evidence that subluxation, if it exists, is a significant factor in disease processes. There-fore, the broad application to health care of a diagnosticprocedure such as spinal analysis and a treatment analy-sis such as spinal adjustment is not justified. 3. The inadequacies of chiropractic education, coupled with the theory that de-emphasizes provencausative factors in disease processes, proven methodsof treatment and differential diagnosis, make it unlikely Chapter 5: At Your Own Risk 45 that a chiropractor can make an adequate diagnosis and know the appropriate treatment, and subsequently pro-vide the indicated treatment or refer the patient. Lack ofthese capabilities in independent practitioners is unde-sirable because appropriate treatment could be delayedor prevented entirely; appropriate treatment might beinterrupted or stopped completely; the treatment offeredcould be contraindicated; all treatments have some riskinvolved with their administration and inappropriatetreatment exposes the patient to this risk unnecessarily. 4. Manipulation (including chiropractic manipula- tion) may be a valuable technique for relief of pain dueto loss of mobility of joints. Research in this area is in-adequate; therefore, it is suggested that research basedupon a scientific method be undertaken with respect tomanipulation [4]. The HEW report recommended: Chiropractic theory and practice are not based upon the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease andhealth care which has been widely accepted by the sci-entific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory,the scope and quality of chiropractic education do notprepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosisand provide appropriate treatment. Therefore, it is rec-ommended that chiropractic service not be covered inthe Medicare program [4]. Despite these conclusions, which basically hold true today, Congress amended the Medicare law to include limitedchiropractic coverage, as follows: A chiropractor who is licensed as such by the state (or in a state which does not license chiropractors as such,is legally authorized to perform the services of a chiro-practor in the jurisdiction in which he performs suchservices) and who meets uniform, minimum standards46 Part II: What Others Have Said promulgated by the secretary . . . with respect to treat- ment by means of manual manipulation of the spine (tocorrect a subluxation demonstrated by x-ray to exist),which he is legally authorized to perform by the state orjurisdiction by which such treatment is provided. The key provision of this enactment were the words to \"correct a subluxation demonstrated by x-ray to exist .\" The \"subluxations\" postulated by chiropractic theory have never beendemonstrated by x-ray or by any other imaging technique,including the newest computed tomography scans and magneticresonance imaging studies\u2014or for that matter, by any othermeans such as surgery or autopsy. Many chiropractors nowdescribe subluxations as dynamic or functional spinal lesionsrather than entities visible by x-ray [5]. The x-ray provision should have eliminated chiroprac- tors from receiving Medicare payments, but since no one chal-lenged it, Congress itself inadvertently became part of the chi-ropractic hoax. In 1997, Congress eliminated the x-ray require-ment as of January 1, 2000. Chiropractic's Alleged Scope The HEW report noted that chiropractors claimed to treat nearly every type of illness [4]. The Textbook of Office Procedures and Practice Building for the Chiropractic Profession listed 92 illnesses that chiropractors treated and the average number ofadjustments needed for each one. As Figure 1 notes, the aver-age number of recommended adjustments ranged from 22.3 forappendicitis to 84.1 for jaundice. Ralph Lee Smith quipped thatdeafness then required 33.2 adjustments to cure, whereas it onlytook D.D. Palmer one, in his original chiropractic case. In addition, in a survey reported in 1963 by the ACA [4], 7% of chiropractors said they treated cancer. (I recall a caseof a spinal bone cancer I discovered in a patient being treatedby a chiropractor. When I called the chiropractor to inform him Chapter 5: At Your Own Risk 47 Average Number Condition of Fever 52.2Ulcers 46.2 Figure 1. Average number of chiropractic adjustments reported for 25 of the \"most frequent 100 conditions\" seen in about 250,000patients who received more than 10 million adjustments. Source:Parker JW. Textbook of Office Procedures and Practice Building for the Chiropractic Profession , Editions 1-4. Fort Worth, TX: Parker Chiropractic Research Foundation, 1964-1975. NOTE: The book does not indicate how the diagnoses were made or how the data were obtained.48 Part II: What Others Have Said of the diagnosis and asked why he was manipulating the af- fected bones, he replied, \"So what, you can't do anything aboutcancer either.\") State licensing laws do little to restrict the scope of chiropractic practice because they do not infringe on thechiropractic philosophy or approach to health and disease. Ifchiropractors limited themselves to treating conditions that trulyhave a spinal cause, they would treat none of the conditionslisted in Figure 1. It is hard to imagine how chiropractors whopersuade patients to rely on spinal manipulation for appendicitis,rheumatic fever, diabetes, heart disease, or any other seriousmedically treatable disease could avoid being sued into oblivion.Fortunately, the percentage of chiropractors willing to do suchtreatment is much lower today than it was in the 1960s. Revealing Personal Experiences To prepare for the writing of At Your Own Risk , Smith decided to visit chiropractic clinics as a patient. First, he had a thoroughcardiac and spinal evaluation at a major medical center, wherehis physical condition was judged to be normal. Then he visitedthe Palmer College of Chiropractic Clinic where he reportedhaving the typical symptoms of sciatic pain due to a ruptureddisk. Palmer College was nationally recognized at that time as a\"straight\" school, meaning that its students were taught to prac-tice strictly according to the Palmer belief in \"subluxations\"and \"adjustments,\" whereas the \"mixers\" included modalitiessuch as vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional methods. At Palmer, Smith promptly underwent a \"full spine x- ray, front and side,\" which confirmed the chiropractor's \"physi-cal findings of three \"subluxations,\" one in the fifth lumbar,two in the ninth thoracic vertebra and three in the odontoid pro-cess in the neck.\" The perfunctory treatment consisted of a se-ries of sudden thrusts and twists of his back, which caused himsoreness for about 2 weeks. This was followed by manipulationof his neck by rolling his head and twisting his neck repeatedly Chapter 5: At Your Own Risk 49 until a snap was heard and the \"adjustment\" was pronounced as successful. When Smith asked what disease he was suffering,he was told that (a) chiropractors do not diagnose or identifyillness, (b) they simply remove the cause in the spine, and (c) heshould continue to be adjusted by his local chiropractor to pre-vent recurrence. Then Smith visited the clinic at the National College of Chiropractic, where he presented himself with the typical symp-toms of coronary artery disease of a year's duration. After de-scribing his symptoms of chest pain, which his cardiologist hadtold him were classic, he was seen by the assistant director ofthe hospital, who did not question him about his symptoms butproceeded to examine his neck and back. This chiropractor thenannounced that he had found \"subluxations\" at the fifth tho-racic vertebra and proceeded to make the \"adjustments.\" Whena \"pop\" was heard, he manipulated Smith's neck and \"jerked itto the left and to the right getting a good sharp pop each time.\"This college was noted for training \"mixers,\" yet Smith receivedonly the standard manipulative treatment for what should havebeen diagnosed as a heart condition. Although what Smith reported sounds ludicrous as well as unscientific, most chiropractic licensing laws are so looselyworded and/or enforced that chiropractors can pretend that nearlyall health problems are within their scope and that they evenprovide \"complete health care.\" That chiropractors are still prac-ticing this incredible hoax was exposed in a \"20/20\" ABC tele-vision program, by Consumer Reports, and by various adver- tisements discussed elsewhere in this book. Smith's experience reminds me of the story of a man in his 40s, who would have been my father-in-law. Suffering frompain in his chest, left arm, and shoulder, he visited a chiroprac-tor who gave him a \"good working over,\" which the man saidleft him very tired. That night\u2014as my wife has told me\u2014thepain became worse and he died of a massive heart attack, leav-ing his wife and three young children to fend for themselves. Such a failure to make a proper medical diagnosis of coronary artery disease and begin proper treatment was50 Part II: What Others Have Said inexcusable then but would be even more so today because much more can now be done for heart attacks. We have balloonangioplasty, bypass surgery, and clot busters to dissolve the clotsthat cause the attacks, as well as preventive measures of properlifestyle, exercise, low-fat diets, treatments for high blood pres-sure, and medications for high cholesterol. Clearly the clinicaldiagnosis of these conditions requires scientific medical knowl-edge and experience that is not available at chiropractic clinics.Heart attacks and their treatment certainly have nothing what-soever to do with the spinal column or manipulative treatmentof anything. Smith described chiropractic marketing techniques taught 30 years ago, some of which are still in use today. Onetechnique was to frighten people away from scientific treatmentby alleging that its methods are deadly but chiropractic is a safe,natural treatment that does not use dangerous drugs or surgery.Smith also noted how chiropractors had the audacity to warnthat scientific medicine dealt only with the \"symptoms ofdisease\" while chiropractors attack and eliminate the \"truecause.\" [1] Exactly the opposite is true. This can be verified byexamining any medical textbook in which the causes of diseaseare defined in scientific terms along with the symptoms, physicalfindings, laboratory and other tests, and detailed treatment.Spinal manipulation is intended to relieve pain, which is asymptom. One chiropractor called me after reading several of my articles in my medical column on chiropractic to complain thatI was bashing only chiropractors and not medical doctors andthen asked why. I frankly answered that I thought chiropracticwas the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American public.I then asked him\u2014considering chiropractic objections to theuse of antibiotics\u2014whether he would use penicillin if he devel-oped pneumonia. He replied that he would only use it if he were\"sick enough.\" I then asked whether he realized that if the toxinproduced by the bacterial infection had overwhelmed his system,penicillin would no longer be effective and he might die. Thisended the conversation. Chapter 5: At Your Own Risk 51 After visiting chiropractic clinics, Smith decided to at- tend a course in practice-building. Posing as a chiropractor, hewas amazed at the blatant manner in which chiropractors builttheir practice. One lecture advised chiropractors to \"dig for chro-nicity\" by asking questions suggesting that the patient's symp-toms represent a flareup of a chronic condition. Then the pa-tient could be persuaded that the condition calls for a series oftreatments and that cure might take a long time. Attendees were also advised to push x-rays but not to use the word x-ray because this might frighten people. Instead,they were advised to say, \"Let's take a few pictures.\" Medicalscience has discovered that excess x-ray exposure can causeharmful effects, including cancers, and that full-spine films arecertainly not necessary and lack the detail required for accuratex-ray diagnosis. Medical science sees no need for full-lengthspinal x-rays, which can also influence the reproductive organsand result in birth defects. Nevertheless, the members of thewell-attended conference were told that \"x-rays should be givento most patients that come into the office and they should be thebig 14 x 36 photos, if for no other reason than psychological.\" The sum and substance of this experience left the im- pression with Smith that chiropractors were being taught to besmooth con artists, educated in the art of luring unsuspectingpatients into a lifetime of chiropractic care. From the advertise-ments that I have seen as a columnist, little has changed duringthe past 30 years. Shortly after the Hartford Courant (of Connecticut) ran a story on my legislative attempts to ban the use of chiropracticon children and cervical spine manipulation on anybody, I re-ceived a phone call from a medical secretary who was afraid togive her name but said she just had to tell me about herexperience. She stated that in response to an advertisement for employment, she sought a position in the office of a localchiropractor. She noted that the office appeared neat, wellequipped with an x-ray machine and treatment table, and quiteprofessional overall. She was hired and was quite satisfied with52 Part II: What Others Have Said her work until she realized that the chiropractor recommended that all patients undergo the same x-ray examination and spinalmanipulations regardless of their complaints and diagnosis.Furthermore, the chiropractor began to insist that she and herco-worker undergo neck \"adjustments\" so that they would staystrong and healthy and that they also bring family members infor similar treatments. Her co-worker, fearful for her job, complied by submit- ting to neck \"adjustments\" and brought in other members of herfamily, but this secretary refused. One day, while she was sit-ting at her desk working, the chiropractor suddenly came upfrom behind, seized her by the neck and began twisting it. Shestruggled free and fled the office, never to return. She felt thatshe had to tell me this so that I would continue working forpassage of my bill. Anecdotes like this illustrate the tendency of \"sub- luxation\"-based chiropractors to urge virtually everyone theyencounter to use their services. Whether this behavior is basedon misguided belief, greed, or both makes little difference. Thereis no scientific evidence or plausible reason to believe thatperiodic \"adjustments\" make people healthier. Smith concluded that licensing laws provide chiroprac- tors with undeserved credibility: The public cannot be blamed for not realizing that chi- ropractic has no scientific foundation. This is thelegislature's fault. People should be able to assume, andobviously do assume, that a state licensed \"doctor\" ispracticing a valid, healing art [1]. Smith states that the public incorrectly assumes that the standards for measures taken by agencies such as the Food andDrug Administration, which oversees substantial provisions forthe safety and effectiveness of drugs and medical technologies,are equally applied to chiropractic. He quotes Dr. Ralph E.Snyder, then-president and dean of New York Medical College,who said: Chapter 5: At Your Own Risk 53 It is an incredible anachronism that in an age when this nation leads the world in many areas of scientific en-deavor, New York State should be asked to place its sealof approval on a group of persons claiming to bepractitioners who are largely ignorant of the acceptedand proven science of health and disease [1]. Smith's book ends by discussing the idea that chiroprac- tic colleges could be converted into medical schools. Smith didnot believe this would be possible. Instead, he suggested threeprinciples for seeking a political solution to the chiropracticproblem: 1. Health-related laws that pay no attention to sci- ence show a deep failure on the part of legislators tofulfill their responsibility to their constituents and shouldbe abolished. 2. Anyone claiming to have a valid treatment for human illness should be required to show his validitybefore the Bar of Science before receiving a state li-cense to use it on the sick. 3. The correct way to deal with treatment methods that cannot or will not submit to the judgment of scien-tific research is not to limit and oversee them but to pro-hibit them. By abandoning all these precepts in the faceof political pressures created by chiropractors, state leg-islators have created a state-supported medical super-stition. The practice of chiropractic should therefore beprohibited and its personnel should be retrained to enterother professions [1]. If nothing else, Smith's revealing work provides proof for the French expression \" plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose ,\" which means the more things change, the more they remain the same\u2014or even worse in 2001.

Bothpoint out the political gains made by chiropractic but deplorethe lack of scientific evidence to back up many of its claims. The 1975 report, titled \"Chiropractors: Healers or Quacks,\" had two parts, titled, \"The 80 Year War with Science\"and \"Can They Help? Do They Harm?\" Part I explained in de-tail why chiropractic theory was wrong, laid bare the shortcom-ings of chiropractic education, and blasted the unethical prac-tice-building strategies that were rampant at that time. Part IIacknowledged that spinal manipulation might relieve back paincaused by restricted spinal joint mobility, but it warned that chi-ropractors falsely claimed to do much more, tended to take toomany x-ray films, and sometimes injured patients with manipu-lations. The bottom-line advice was: \"If you were planning tosee a chiropractor, we think you would be safer to reconsider.\" The 1994 report noted that \"in recent years, several aca- demic chiropractors have tried to correct such abuses and bringtheir profession into the scientific mainstream. . . . But in manycases, the problems we identified two decades ago still exist.\"The report charitably noted that D.D. Palmer's subluxationtheory\u2014when proposed in 1895\u2014might have been a \"reason-able stab at understanding the mysteries of health and disease\"but should have been abandoned by now. The centerpiece of the report was a survey sent to 456 chiropractors chosen randomly from an American Chiropractic 556 The Views of Consumer Reports (1975, 1994)56 Part II: What Others Have Said Association (ACA) membership directory. To carry out this survey, CR's reporter posed as a prospective patient moving to the chiropractor's area with a husband, three young children,and a mother-in-law. About 60% of the chiropractors responded,many of them with printed literature and/or other information.The majority said that they focused on family health care. Nearlyhalf the replies specifically mentioned that chiropractic canbenefit children or included booklets with that implication. Onechiropractor wrote, \"Children are an essential part of my healthoutlook as they are (hopefully) the healthy adults of tomorrow.\"Another told how his 3-year-old son enjoys getting regular\"adjustments.\" Another sent a long list of conditions \"regularlytreated\" in his office, including allergies, depression,hypoglycemia, and prostate problems. It was clear from thisthat chiropractors, whether or not specifically allowed to by theirlicenses, claim that their scope is very broad. If chiropractors would limit themselves to treating back pain and other musculoskeletal problems, they might win abroader measure of acceptance from medical doctors. However,many chiropractors want to do more. Louis Sportelli, DC, aformer ACA board chairman, told CR that most people go to chiropractors initially for back and neck problems. Once theyare in the office, he added, \"practitioners educate them aboutthe other conditions they can treat such as irritable bowel syn-drome, dysfunctional gallbladder, functional forms of asthmaand angina.\" Some of the other key points in CR's article, interspersed with my own comments, are described in the following. The Well-Adjusted Child The executive director of the Montreal Children's Hospital has appealed to pediatric hospitals throughout Canada to denouncechiropractic treatment of minors, which he considers \"akin tochild abuse.\" Yet chiropractors such as Jennifer and Palmer Peetclaim in their textbook, Chiropractic Pediatrics and Prenatal Chapter 6: The Views of Consumer Reports 57 Reference Manual , \"Thousands of infants and children die every week because they never receive chiropractic care.\" Ac-cording to the Peets, infants should be checked for spinal mis-alignment and \"subluxation\" within hours of birth because thebirth process can cause damage to the spine that may result incolic, impaired immunity, and even sudden infant deathsyndrome. This ludicrous claim is alive and well today, as de-scribed in Chapter 12 in this book, which discusses the treat-ment of headaches. Dr. Jeffrey Young, an osteopathic physician who is board-certified in pediatrics, states flatly that these chiropracticclaims have \"absolutely no medical data to support them\" or tojustify chiropractic for epilepsy, asthma, bed-wetting, or learn-ing disabilities, which are some of the many pediatric problemschiropractors claim they can treat. Another troubling aspect of chiropractic that CR em- phasizes is its traditional opposition to childhood immuniza-tions. It was only in 1993 that the ACA officially abandoned itsopposition. The New York Chiropractic College, however, hasconducted seminars around the country questioning the valueof immunizations, and 60% of chiropractors in their randomsampling agreed with, or were ambivalent about, the college'sstatement, \"There is no scientific proof that immunization pre-vents infectious disease.\" On the other hand, CR points out, chiropractic has failed to produce scientific evidence that it canprevent or cure any childhood disease. Lifetime Patients CR cites the continual \"hard sell\" efforts of chiropractic to es- tablish lifetime patients, as Smith described in his book At Your Own Risk in 1969. CR mentions promoters like Alan Bernstein, president of the \"Practice Builder,\" and David Singer, aClearwater, Florida, chiropractor who sells an audiotape setcalled \"How to Create Lifetime Patients.\" Promoting lifetimepatients or maintenance care is a favorite strategy of practice-58 Part II: What Others Have Said management firms. CR found some 50 such companies offering courses and literature to chiropractors on how to buildtheir practices. Some of the catch phrases recommended by these pro- motion consultants are \"maintenance care\"; \"ensuring spinalhealth\"; and for anyone questioning the need for lifetime care,\"It is a choice you, yourself, must make, depending on howimportant your health is.\" The Peter Pan Potential, a California-based marketing company, advises, \"Go to the children.\" An-other suggestion is for chiropractors to get patients to sign upfriends' children for free examinations. However, Scott Haldeman, MD, DC, in his Practice and Principles of Chiropractic textbook, does admit, \"There are no long term outcome trials on the value of preventive chiropracticcare\" to justify such maintenance care promotion. Nutrition and Applied Kinesiology Although nutrition has nothing to do with traditional chiroprac- tic, the \"mixers\" use this as a means of broadening their activi-ties. Since they are uneducated in the use of medicines and arenot licensed to prescribe them, they resort to vitamins, miner-als, and food to treat or prevent disease. The classic example ofthis was demonstrated on the \"20/20\" ABC television expos\u00e9 inwhich a chiropractor advised a mother to have her child stopdrinking milk to clear his ear infection and suggested that al-lergy to milk might be the cause of the infection. (It is difficultto see why this nonsensical chiropractic advice is not subject tolawsuits even if it is judged standard chiropractic care.) In a 1991 survey, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) found that 84% of responding chiroprac-tors had used nutritional counseling therapy or supplementa-tion within the previous 2 years and that 30% had used homeo-pathic remedies. (Homeopathic remedies are minute doses ofvarious materials claimed to produce the same symptoms inhealthy persons as the disease itself. Their theoretical basis isnonsensical, and they have no scentifically proven value.) Chapter 6: The Views of Consumer Reports 59 \"Applied kinesiology,\" used by 37% of respondents to the NBCE survey, is based on the notion that every organ dys-function is accompanied by special muscle weakness and thatdisease can be diagnosed by testing muscles after placing foodor nutrient substances under the tongue. Even more bizarre, I saw a 1-hour television program in which a Connecticut chiropractor demonstrated a diagnosticmethod called contact reflex analysis (CRA), which he describedas an extension of applied kinesiology and acupuncture. Heclaimed that muscle-testing related to \"reflex points\" could beused to diagnose problems throughout the body. To demonstrate, he asked the television hostess to extend one arm to the side while he touched the supposed \"reflex points\"and pushed down on her arm. He touched between her eyes to\"test\" the pituitary gland, on her neck for the thyroid, at herumbilicus for intestinal disease, and her chest for heart disease.When he tested her lower abdomen, her arm went down, whichhe attributed to \"low salt\" in the body. CRA is about as senselessas anything can be, but the chiropractor stated he has been usingit with great success in his practice for 20 years. Safety Chiropractors say their methods are safer than surgery and drugs that have dangerous and toxic side effects. There is some truthin this because medical doctors often treat critically ill patientswith drugs, all of which may have side effects. But therisk/benefit ratio is in favor of medical doctors. For example, aserious reaction to penicillin may happen once in 1 million uses,yet many lives are saved with the 999,999 other penicillininjections. The companies that insure chiropractors for malprac- tice won't reveal how many claims they have received or paidout for patients who have suffered a stroke or paralysis afterhaving their neck manipulated. The number is not large com-pared with the number of necks that have been manipulated.But whatever it is, it may only represent the tip of the iceberg60 Part II: What Others Have Said because only a small fraction of injured patients file a lawsuit. Back manipulation can also produce serious injury. And whenmanipulation is done without good reason\u2014as it often is\u2014nocomplication is excusable. In terms of safety, most people who consult chiroprac- tors are x-rayed, which poses a danger of x-ray radiation, espe-cially from the full-spinal type used to locate nonexistent \"sub-luxations.\" These full-length x-rays do not provide sharp im-ages, and the x-ray dosage required to produce them can in-crease the likelihood of birth defects in a patient's offspring. Recommendations The 1994 CR article states that \"if you are thinking about going to a chiropractor for back pain, proceed with caution\" and fol-low these guidelines: See your doctor first for the correct diagnosis of your problem. Remember that manipulation of the neck may be risky, especially if you take oral contraceptives or anticoagu-lant drugs, or if you have high blood pressure or otherrisk factors for stroke. Get a referral from a reliable source, such as the Na- tional Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM)in the United States or the Orthopractic ManipulationSociety in Canada, or consider getting a referral to aphysical therapist. Inquire by telephone about the nature of the chiro- practor's approach. CR recommended NACM and the Orthopractic Society because their members have abandoned the subluxation theory;do not try to treat children, infections, or other diseases; andlimit their practice to the treatment of musculoskeletal prob-lems (mostly back pain). Another way to locate clear-thinkingchiropractors is the referral directory on the Chirobase.org Website, which was not available when CR published its article.The January 1997 issue of Smart Money , the Wall Street Journal 's magazine of personal finance and related matters, included aninsightful article titled \"Ten Things Your Chiropractor Won'tTell You.\" [1] The article was written by John Protos, who called me several times for information. This chapter lists the 10 pointswith additional comments from me. 1. \"I've got more nutty theories than Oliver Stone.\" While acknowledging that chiropractic techniques can be ef-fective, Protos points out\u2014in so many words\u2014that chiroprac-tic theory is still a hoax. He also notes that \"some chiropractorsbelieve that by manipulating ('adjusting') someone's back, theycan treat almost any malady from arthritis and allergies to kid-ney failure and . . . hearing loss\" and that \"even those who don'texplicitly claim that chiropractic is a cure-all often contend thattheir training enables them to diagnose every kind of ailment.\"(Oliver Stone directed the fictional movie JFK about the \"con- spiracy\" to murder President John F. Kennedy.) 2. \"My bill will be the real back-breaker.\" Although people go to a chiropractor because they think chiro-practors are cheaper, Smart Money notes that a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995 found that seeing a chiropractor for acute low back pain cost an average of$611 in rural areas and $783 in urban areas, whereas the aver-age cost of seeing a primary-care medical doctor was $474 inrural areas and $508 in urban areas. These differences occurred 617 Smart Money Hits a Raw Nerve (1997)62 Part II: What Others Have Said because the medical treatment typically involved two visits, but the rural chiropractors saw patients nine times and the urbanones saw them for 13 visits [2]. 3. \"Go elsewhere to be on the safe side.\" Your chiropractor won't tell you to go elsewhere\u2014to an osteo- path or physiatrist (medical doctor who specializes in physicalmedicine) if you want manipulation alone or with other treat-ment. Medical and osteopathic physicians are better trained thanchiropractors and offer a much wider range of treatments. Inaddition to (or instead of) manipulation, they can prescribemedications and physical therapy. They (or their surgical col-leagues) can also cure some cases of ruptured disk, spinal tu-mor, or other causes of back pain. 4. \"I could make things worse.\" Smart Money describes the case of Tamara Joerns, a 27-year- old mother of three children in California who was paralyzedfrom the neck down from a stroke caused by a neck manipula-tion. Joerns sued the chiropractor, but the judge ruled that thechiropractor's manipulation did not amount to substandard care.In Chapter 6, I describe how a Connecticut woman won a $10million malpractice award after a similar experience. The fre-quency of these cases is unknown, largely because chiropracticmalpractice insurance companies keep their data secret. But theyoccur often enough to know that neck manipulation carries somedegree of hazard. 5. \"Your health insurer thinks I'm a slouch.\" Although many chiropractors advertise that they \"accept mosthealth insurance plans,\" anyone contemplating treatment shouldcheck their coverage carefully. Insurance companies are notparticularly fond of chiropractors. Although \"insurance equal-ity laws\" in most states force companies to pay for certain chi-ropractic services, the coverage may be skimpy (e.g., partialpayment and a limited number of visits), and about half of em-ployers who self-insure don't include chiropractic coverage. Chapter 7: Smart Money Hits a Raw Nerve 63 6. \"We'll be seeing a lot of each other.\" Smart Money asks, \"How long should a sequence of visits to your chiropractor last?\" The article cites chiropractic sourceswhose answers seem to be, \"Forever.\" A pamphlet from the Gar-den State Chiropractic Society states, \"It doesn't make sense towait until a crisis occurs and do something about your health.By having your spine checked regularly\u2014regardless of how youfeel\u2014you have taken a sensible step towards health mainte-nance.\" A prominent chiropractic practice-building firm hasmarketed audiotapes called \"How to Create Lifetime Patients\"and a videotape series called \"How to Educate Patients for Life.\"These materials teach how to persuade patients to come regu-larly for check-ups and spinal \"adjustments\" that allegedly \"workto remove the cause of problems before symptoms arise\" andhelp people \"feel better, increase endurance and reduce the riskof health problems.\" [3] 7. \"We like 'em young.\" Many chiropractors will start treatment on newborns, as docu-mented in a television show I saw in which the chiropractormanipulated a newborn while saying, \"As the twig is bent, sogoes the tree.\" Not all chiropractors, however, agree that theirtreatment is suitable for children. Smart Money quotes Ron Slaughter, DC, of the National Association for ChiropracticMedicine, who says that (a) no child under 12 should ever betaken to a chiropractor unless recommended by a pediatrician;(b) chiropractic manipulations could interfere with a child's bonestructure; and (3) the use of chiropractic manipulation for chronicear infection, bed-wetting, and asthma is \"bunk.\" 8. \"The vitamins I'm prescribing will rejuvenate my wallet.\" Many chiropractors who disparage the use of drugs eagerly sellvitamins and other dietary supplements to their patients, usu-ally for at least twice their wholesale cost. Most of what theyrecommend has not been proven useful. Smart Money points out that patients who chose to take vitamins might probablyfind a retail or mail-order store that will charge less for it.64 Part II: What Others Have Said 9. \"X-rays are our best friend.\" Some chiropractors run their x-rays like a profit center, passingthe cost on to patients and insurance companies. One chiropractorinterviewed for the article quipped, \"They will x-ray people untilthey glow in the dark.\" Another stated, \"Only 1 in 500 back x-rays will show something that was not expected.\" Smart Money mentions one insurance company that was suing a chiropracticgroup for fraudulently taking 700 x-rays on only 13 patients.Since the association between x-rays and cancer has been widelypublicized, it amazes me that a patient would submit to morethan 50 unnecessary spinal x-ray examinations. 10. \"You probably will get better on your own.\" Citing several reliable sources, Smart Money points out that two thirds of all patients with acute back pain will be pain-free after6 weeks, with or without treatment, and that 90% of cases re-solve on their own within 12 weeks. When Jerome McAndrews, DC, an American Chiroprac- tic Association spokesman, was asked why so many visits tothe chiropractor were needed, he replied that the problem wasreally that of medical doctors because they treat only the symp-toms of back pain\u2014often with painkillers\u2014whereas chiroprac-tic techniques are more ambitious. \"We go further in the analy-sis to address the causal problem,\" McAndrews claimed. \"Thatusually requires more visits.\" This is a major theme of chiropractic, that medical doc- tors only treat the symptoms, whereas they treat the cause ofdiseases. This claim is a pure and simple figment of chiroprac-tic imagination. In fact, it is backwards. If anything, chiroprac-tors only treat the symptoms of pain, whereas medical doctorsoften can treat the cause. This difference\u2014based on medicine'sscientific approach\u2014has resulted in incredible advances in medi-cal care throughout the world. The March 1997 issue of Smart Money carried several letters to the editor that illustrate the typical chiropractic responseto criticism: Chapter 7: Smart Money Hits a Raw Nerve 65 Jeffrey Wilder, DC, president of the Wisconsin Chiro- practic Association, complained that the National Associationfor Chiropractic Medicine, quoted as critical of some chiropracticpractices, particularly on children, is a radical splinter groupwith only a handful of members. He also cited the Agency ofHealth Care Policy and Research findings, analyzed in this bookin Chapter 18, regarding the favorable report on spinal manipu-lation for low back pain. Another chiropractor cited the care of a patient who had multiple back injuries, which he claimed chiropractic treat-ment could have prevented. Charles A. Paine, DC, of Bridgewaters, New York, said that, \"Quoting medical doctors on a story about chiroprac-tic is like having inmates do a story about the police.\" David Pignatello, DC, of Seminole, Florida, said that an \"eleventh thing a chiropractic won't tell you. . . . Subscribeto Smart Money magazine.\" My letter, the only one from the scientific community, said: While many people feel they benefit from chiropractic treatment, there is no scientific proof that they are actu-ally helped. The evidence is basically junk science basedon anecdotal outcomes, for the most part. The theoreti-cal chiropractic lesion, \"the subluxation,\" pressing on anerve, causing some disease, has never been demon-strated by operation, autopsy, x-ray, or any other means.In other words, chiropractic as defined does not exist.

Clearwater, FL: Expand Chiropractic Products, 1993.The comedy team of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau did a hilarious takeoff on chiropractic in their 1997 movie Out to Sea . Matthau played the part of a ne'er-do-well gambler and conman whose sister married Lemmon's character. The sister, whomLemmon's character loved dearly, died, but he and Matthau'scharacter remained close friends. Lemmon played the part of a very ordinary fellow who had spent most of his life as a salesman employed at Gimbel'sDepartment Store. He continued to carry a torch for his departedwife and could not show interest in other women. Matthau'scharacter, a playboy bachelor, felt this was wrong and inveigledLemmon's character to go on a cruise with him with arrange-ments he had conned from a friend. As part of the deal, unbe-known to Lemmon's character, he and Lemmon's character weresupposed to act as dance hosts and entertain the ladies. Matthau'scharacter, who knew nothing about dancing, feigned an injuryto his leg and back, complaining to the ship's recreation man-ager that he had slipped on the wet dance floor. Lemmon's character, recognizing the ruse and to get even with Matthau's character, proceeded to manhandle himwith various twisting, leg thrusts, and manipulations. Theacrobatics were obvious and drew more laughter than at anyother point in the entire comedy, which had many funnymoments. As is the case with many comedies, a serious point was made. Comedy, whether intended it or not, is often the highestform of debunking a serious subject. Lemmon and Matthaudepicted chiropractic as a joke. Here was a man feigning an 678 The Lemmon/Matthau Takeoff68 Part II: What Others Have Said injured leg and back, and the treatment he received made absolutely no sense. The audience recognized the situation as ahoax and enjoyed the scene immensely. The two actors did not receive an Oscar for this performance, but they surely deserve accolades from thescientific medical community. Whether unwittingly or intended,their scene might make people think about the silliness of someof the things that chiropractors do.Part III My Own Investigations The Crippling of Linda Solsbury Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges Visit with an Alaskan Chiropractor A Chiropractic Lecture on Headache Additional Opinions about ChiropracticReactions to the First Edition of This BookMore Dialogue and Debate on the InternetLinda Solsbury is a former pediatric nurse and part-time ballet dancer whose encounter with chiropractic left her a completelyhelpless invalid [1]. She had sought chiropractic care to increase her dancing movements and agility but became quadriplegicfrom vertebral artery injury that occurred during neck manipu-lation by a chiropractor. The vertebral arteries, one on each side,thread through holes in the six upper vertebrae of the neck. Sud-den neck rotation, particularly with the neck extended, can in-jure these arteries and interrupt the flow of blood to the base ofthe brain. Vertebrobasilar strokes are rare and differ from the com- mon type caused by blockage of a carotid artery, which affectsonly half of the body. In Solsbury's case, both arms and legs areparalyzed and she is unable to speak or swallow, yet she re-mains mentally clear. She can express her thoughts only by typ-ing on a computer with one finger that still functions. Here isher story, as typed on her computer: To try and explain the impact\u2014on every area of my life\u2014is too overwhelming to even think about it. It'slike setting up a giant set of dominoes and saying \"let'er rip.\" For the rest of my life\u2014confined to a wheel-chair\u2014electric at that, to have any mobility\u2014havingonly regained minimal use of my right hand. I have afeeding tube in my stomach, an indwelling catheter inmy bladder (causing frequent infections requiring anti-biotic therapy\u2014often only\u2014painful\u2014intramuscularinjections 1 x shift x 10 days is the only medication that 719 The Crippling of Linda Solsbury72 Part III: My Own Investigations works\u2014and when the bacteria build up my resistance to that ....???) using a portable computer to communi-cate\u2014tedious is an understatement\u2014time consuming\u2014some can't see it, some are unable to read well\u2014if atall\u2014always aware of an undercurrent of impatience, thephysical and occupational therapy. Needing completecare in bathing, dressing\u2014needing to be mechanicallytransferred by a lift and sling\u2014bed to chair and visaversa. Relying on someone to do everything for me\u2014from watering my plants to making an envelope, tocombing my hair. The indignity of no privacy with per-sonal hygiene, i.e.\u2014having someone else changing atampon to being given enemas every other day to evacu-ate my bowels\u2014and again\u2014relying on another\u2014who-ever is assigned ... whether you like them or not ...whether they are good or marginal workers ... you getwho you get. I will never again know the luxury of anuninterrupted night's sleep. I have 12 midnight tube feed-ing, 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 6:30 a.m. turns....because I needsomeone to change my position in bed. I have itches(endlessly) that are out of my reach. I like nights themost because sleep provides some escape. Eveningscome in second best. I can occupy my mind more anddays are my least favorite\u2014because I am forced to dealmore with the full impact of my limitations. The listgoes on and on.....that doesn't begin to touch the emo-tional impact. That is\u2014so far\u2014beyond measurement. People commonly believe a crisis tightens family bounds. In the short term, that may be true; in the longterm, all too often, the reverse is true. My daughter can-not deal with this situation. She lives with her fatherand stepmother when not away at college. He makes itacceptable for her to feel justified in not coming. I rarelysee her. It was tremendously painful to play the majorrole in her life to suddenly be on the outskirts of every-thing that happened. To \"hear\" about her prom, to \"hear\" Chapter 9: The Crippling of Linda Solsbury 73 about her graduation, to hear about her first love in vague comments\u2014long after the fact, to not even hear aboutgetting college acceptance letters. I would keep expect-ing her to \"come to terms with things\"\u2014only to realizethat this is the way it is going to be\u2014\"I have to come toterms with things.\" The man I was involved with took aposition out of state. My closest friend moved out ofstate. My mother and I had such a fragile relationship tobegin with\u2014now it is almost nonexistent. My youngerbrother was the only family that visited on a regularbasis; he died three years ago in the spring. My life istotally devoid of any type of affection. I spend everyholiday alone. I always feel like a burden. I never feelattractive. I spend most of my time alone. I'm basicallyan introvert (sic) prior to my stroke\u2014now I feel it's aforced isolation; like a monk in a monastery who tookvows of silence and solitude. I try to imagine ... what could be worse .. ? Well, I suppose I could be like this and live in a third worldcountry .... that would be worse. I don't feel particularlysorry to hear if someone has a terminal illness. Theyhave a way out. This is like a life sentence. No one canimagine what it is like to live this way ... they can try ...but there are too many facets, one outside\u2014could nevereven consider. I hear how \"lucky\" I am to have my cog-nition. However wonderful of \"others\" to project theiropinions (sic) ... when they can only have a very \"onedimensional\" view. I think \"..you fools, ... you can'tknow .... it makes it harder.\" I see human nature from avista few do. For the most part, we are not so noble as we like to think. My life is \"imposed\" on me in a physical sense and in an emotional sense\u2014by some \"challenging\" my\"will\" to live (a sunset, a flower, a snowfall, touching,huh?..moxie (sic).. ??)\u2014but the \"will\" to live\u2014if you74 Part III: My Own Investigations can really live\u2014is this really living? It's existing ... I can tell you that. Am I supposed to \"derive\" somethingof worth from this? Is that a task I just haven't masteredyet? My life is today\u2014and I imagine will always be\u2014like walking a tightrope\u2014everyday and seen as \"de-ranged\" or at the very least \"maladapted\" for speaking\"my\" truth? It's like the proverb: tell the truth and run.My way of seeing my life is wrong?? By others whodon't awaken to this ... everyday. It is like I had a bomb dropped in the middle of my life. That does not begin to touch on how dehumanizing living in an institution is. Apart from the physical handi-caps; it is like a mental bludgeoning to beat the psycheinto a \"herd mentality\" until one's sense of self starts tofragment and shrivel. As a nurse I could see family struggle to cope with tragedy; as much as I empathized, I still felt exempt. Ino longer feel exempt. The Chiropractor Responds The six-person jury found Waterford, Connecticut, chiropractor Thomas P. Goulding's treatment to be the direct cause of thestroke. Despite this, and despite overwhelming evidence thatsuch treatment has caused strokes in many other cases, Gouldingdenied all this in the following letter to the editor of the Day, a newspaper in New London, Connecticut, where the trial washeld: The Day has, in recent weeks, published reports con- cerning my trial. I would like to set the record straightas your paper has only revealed the plaintiff's arguments. First, and most important, the chiropractic treatment did not cause Ms. Solsbury's stroke. The procedure de-scribed by the plaintiff's experts was never done in my Chapter 9: The Crippling of Linda Solsbury 75 office in her several years of chiropractic care! Second, in response to Ms. Solsbury's column, I will remain inbusiness and plan to remain serving the natural healthcare needs of our community for many years. This was a tragic occurrence with a devastating re- sidual to Ms. Solsbury, but the cause was not my treat-ment. This patient had numerous neurological com-plaints and symptoms from the early 1970s. At the timeof this incident, she was post surgical and was self-medi-cating with prescription drugs when she had a stroke.One drug causes extreme vasospasm. She had a historyof vascular disease. People wonder why it took so long to get to trial. The major delay was the plaintiff's attorneys trying toobtain experts to say what they wanted and blame mytreatment. They had to look far and wide, from Wash-ington state to North Carolina to find their hired guns.One doctor had no college degree and had never seenthe patient or read her medical records\u2014but felt I wasto blame. The other experts were very well credentialedand very well spoken professors and again blamed thechiropractic treatment. They had never been to a chiro-practor; they had never seen a chiropractic adjustmentperformed; but they blamed the chiropractic treatmentanyway. You look long and hard enough, you can find some- one to say whatever you want. In defending the case,we relied on the treating doctors' testimony. They agreedwith me that the cause of this incident could not be de-termined. Originally, I was sued for two million fiveyears ago. Over a year ago the plaintiff's attorney wouldhave settled for $350,000, and they wanted my father'swidow to kick in $100,000! All these figures were wellbeyond my reach. The plaintiff's attorney stated morethan once his desire to \"ruin my practice\" and my wife'sas well.76 Part III: My Own Investigations Mr. Swain (Solsbury's lawyer) had been very avail- able to the press stating his altruism in not accepting afee\u2014there was no fee for him to accept; he will, though,have his expenses paid and the rest will go to the state.My expenses, however, ran well over $60,000! So over$100,000 was spent so that his client could get $500. Isthis ethical? Mr. Swain also met with the sworn juryimmediately after the verdict, which I have since learnedis unacceptable in many courts. The end product is that I must go bankrupt. I have no more resources to appeal this case. I do feel that Iwould win on an appeal, now knowing the tactics usedagainst me. This has been a tremendous hardship on myfamily. It has been most difficult to be libeled in thepress while deeply involved in this trial and at the sametime have Mr. Swain making himself so available todescribe his legal heroics on the plaintiff's behalf. Allhe has to show is $500 for his client. His expenses paid,a dramatic commercial for his law firm, and bankruptcyfor me. Does this sound like justice? The ultimate insult is that when a juror came for- ward and spoke to the judge about prejudice on the juryduring deliberations, nothing was done. This has been amost terrible tragedy and my heart and prayers go outto Ms. Solsbury, and I can understand her wanting toblame someone. Attorneys, however, I cannot under-stand. Chiropractic has been helping to treat patientswithout drugs and without surgery for over 100 years.Chiropractic treatment does not cause strokes. I would like to thank all the patients who have ex- pressed their concerns and support. I have always treatedmy patients with kindness, concern and gentle treatment.I have had great respect for our legal process, but I amnow much more sensitive to those wrongly accused. Thomas P. Goulding, DC, Waterford Chapter 9: The Crippling of Linda Solsbury 77 Other Views Attorney Peter J. Bartinik, a member of the Board of Governors of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers' Association, sent the follow-ing letter to the editor of the Day: A jury had determined that Ms. Solsbury's injuries and horrendous disabilities were caused by the negligenceof Thomas Goulding. What is appalling is that Dr.Goulding is unable to meet his professional responsi-bility because he failed to maintain what is commonlyreferred to as a professional liability insurance policy.What is appalling is that Ms. Solsbury will go uncom-pensated because Dr. Goulding had decided by not main-taining a professional insurance policy that the risk ofhis carelessness and negligence should be borne by hispatients and not himself. Solsbury, although hopelessly paralyzed, was able to sal- vage a bit of satisfaction by having an insurance bill passed thatmandates malpractice insurance coverage for all Connecticutchiropractors and even appeared herself in dramatic testimonybefore the state legislature. She received national recognitionfor her work on the \"Evening News with Connie Chung.\" As for the proof that chiropractic neck manipulation has caused similar strokes, this was well documented during thetrial by reports from the Mayo Clinic and from J. DonaldEastman, MD, of the Southern Illinois Medical School, whoreferred to 25 cases. A report by neurosurgeon Thomas Mehalic,MD, called chiropractic a \"cultist mechanotherapy.\" Solsbury herself described her stroke to me. Her first symptoms occurred during manipulation of her neck to improveher dancing. She became faint and sweaty, and that afternoonher speech became slurred and she experienced weakness inher legs. She was hospitalized at Lawrence and Memorial Hos-pital in intensive care. Here she had a convulsion and lapsedinto coma from her stroke. She required a tracheostomy and78 Part III: My Own Investigations respiratory resuscitation to save her life. I reported this incident in an article to our local New Britain Herald newspaper. A local chiropractor, Edward F. Hartney, a frequent ad- vertiser in the Herald , objected to what I said. In a letter to the editor, he stated: Publishing Dr. Chotkowski's response to the Herald ar- ticle on the state's malpractice insurance laws was irre-sponsible on the Herald 's behalf. In fact, Chotkowski did not respond to the subject matter discussed and usedthe Herald to express one of his personal opinions. This patient's plight is horrible and I feel heartsick for herand her family. When and if a doctor is truly negligent,he or she must be held accountable. No concerned healthcare provider would treat a patient unless that personwas protected in every way. Although the jury found onher behalf, I find it difficult to believe that a vertebralartery could experience a dissecting tear in a healthyyoung person. A chiropractic manipulative procedure isa gentle act based on the scientific principles of anatomy,physiology and the latest research in biomechanics. Chiropractic care is safe, efficient and cost effec- tive. Over 10 million Americans visit doctors of chiro-practic each year. Chiropractic care will prevail and become part of the new health plan because of public demand. After reading this letter, Solsbury wrote the following letter directly to Hartney: My purpose in writing is to dissuade the opinions you stated in your Letter to the Editor of the New Britain Herald , September 24, 1993. With all due respect, I find your letter more in keeping with irresponsible use ofthe newspaper media. I hope the enclosed informationcauses you to reconsider your position. \"Young and healthy\" had nothing whatsoever to do with my injury. Improperly executed manipulation did. Chapter 9: The Crippling of Linda Solsbury 79 Young and healthy was the reason I did not succumb; rather, was gravely ill, on life support and in ICU forseveral weeks. I doubt that I was any different from a patient you might see in your practice. Five years of chiropractictreatment at various intervals, very attuned to the body,very open to alternative health care as a means to insuregood health, avoid medications\u2014risk free ... I thought... Those are two key words, Dr. Hartney. Chiropractic care is no more risk-free than conventional medicine.To imply that it is, in 1993, is very reckless. You are clearly not informed on what has been increasingly inmedical and chiropractic literature for well over a de-cade. By lack of acknowledging this, you are denyingyour patients informed consent. It would be wise, if youexpect to maintain patient confidence, to rethink yourposition on this matter. Public awareness of this dangeris increasing. The results will be your clients going tochiropractors who will caution honestly. In reference to chiropractic strokes, Solsbury included with the letter to Hartney a list of reports by experts such as Dr.Singer, chief of pediatric neurology at Cambridge Hospital, ateaching hospital for Harvard Medical School; Dr. Simon, headof neurosurgery at University of Connecticut Medical Center, ateaching hospital; and Dr. White, neuroradiologist, also at Uni-versity of Connecticut Medical Center. These doctors were ableto use angiography to demonstrate blood clots in torn vertebraland basilar arteries in patients who had suffered a stroke fol-lowing chiropractic neck manipulation. Further ObservationsWhat can we conclude from this case, based on obvious facts? The following conclusions seem fair, based on the facts.80 Part III: My Own Investigations Chiropractors either are ignorant of the hazards of neck manipulation or refuse to admit to the dangers and in-sist on continuing this practice. The risk/benefit of chiropractic neck manipulation makes this form of treatment prohibitive. Cervical spi-nal manipulation is a sometimes-lethal procedure forwhich there is no scientifically proven purpose. It is clear that patients are not being appropriately in- formed of the dangers of neck twisting. The exact inci-dence of similar strokes is unknown but appears to beconsiderable. This practice should be banned by licensure. (Through my representative, a bill was introduced to the Connecti-cut legislature, but this was trashed without a hearingby the Public Health Committee, whose chairman, Sena-tor George Guenther, is a naturopath who believes thata chiropractor cured his polio when he was younger.Banning the procedure will not be easy.) The journal Stroke has published additional evidence of the relationship between chiropractic care and the incidence ofvertebrovascular accidents (VBAs) in nonelderly adults. Usinghospital and insurance records, Canadian researchers comparedVBA patients with similar patients who had been hospitalizedfor other problems. The data showed that VBA patients youngerthan 45 years were five times more likely than the others tohave visited a chiropractor within a week of the VBA and tohave had three or more visits with neck manipulations [2]. Anaccompanying editorial states that data correspond to an inci-dence of 1.3 cases of vertebral artery dissection or blockage per100,000 individuals receiving chiropractic neck manipulation. Cases like that of Linda Solsbury will continue to occur until the chiropractic neck-twisting practice that caused her trag-edy is abolished, either by an act of the legislature, by prohibi-tive malpractice lawsuits, or by a voluntary chiropractic real-ization and resignation to scientific fact. Chapter 9: The Crippling of Linda Solsbury 81 It is incredible that some chiropractors refuse to admit neck manipulation can cause strokes and death by injuring thevertebrobasilar artery system that supplies blood to the brain.

I find these rela-tive numbers alarming. To learn more about chiropractic education, I decided to visit a chiropractic college. I first called the American Chiro-practic Association for information about such a visitation. Isaid that I was a medical journalist writing a weekly medicalcolumn and book in my retirement. They were most coopera-tive and arranged for a guided tour and an interview with thedean of New York Chiropractic College in Seneca, New York. The tour guide was a young lady who was well versed in chiropractic philosophy, which she explained to a group ofabout 10 visitors, most of whom appeared to be prospectivestudents. I asked several questions that the guide had some dif-ficulty in answering. She referred me to the dean, whom I laterinterviewed. New York Chiropractic College is located in the former Eisenhower College. The buildings are impressive, glitzy, ala-baster structures surrounded by finely manicured, expansivelawns that would put to shame the medical school campuses ofYale (my alma mater) or Harvard. At the time of my visit (1997), the school had some 900 students and graduated about 300 chi-ropractors each year. Tuition was $4,170 each trimester, of whichthere were 10, for a total of $41,700 for 4 years. However, it ispossible to complete chiropractic school in 3 years. 8310 Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges84 Part III: My Own Investigations I saw 15 classrooms and laboratories, an ample number of x-ray film viewing boxes, and some strange looking examin-ing tables designed for spinal manipulations and \"adjustments.\"I noticed five medical doctors' names on the faculty but saw noevidence of any research department or activity to which theguide referred. The library contained a number of standard medi-cal texts in addition to chiropractic publications. The president of the college gave me a large package of information about chiropractic and a book entitled Principles and Practice of Chiropractic , edited by Dr. Scott Haldeman, a third-generation chiropractor who acquired a medical degreeand now practices neurology. Some chiropractors appear to re-gard this book as their \"chiropractic bible.\" It was to me a 600-page failed effort to explain exactly what chiropractic is sup-posed to be. An insert classified chiropractic as one of 45 major\"alternative healthcare methodalities.\" During my meeting with the dean, I said: \"I am a medi- cal columnist and admit to a scientific bias. I believe that chiro-practic is the biggest medical hoax ever perpetrated on theAmerican public. Please give me any evidence to the contrary.For starters, of the 14,000 or so diseases afflicting mankind,name one which chiropractic has proved scientifically to ben-efit or cure.\" \"Oh,\" the dean replied, \"we do not treat disease. We treat wellness. We keep people healthy with periodic spinal ad-justments.\" \"But,\" I pursued, \"chiropractic in over 100 years has failed to demonstrate what is supposedly being adjusted. De-spite surgery, autopsy, and sophisticated imagery, no spinal ver-tebral subluxation has ever been seen or shown to press on anerve, interfering with the passage of energy down that nerve,causing disease, as chiropractic claims.\" \"That is because a vertebral subluxation is tomical lesion. It is a 'dynamic lesion.' We call it a DSL or FSL,a dynamic or functional spinal lesion. (These definitions werecorroborated in Haldeman's textbook.) Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 85 At this point, after a series of similar questions and an- swers, I suggested to the dean that there was clearly no satisfac-tory evidence of such an entity as chiropractic as defined andthat they should convert their college into a medical school andabandon this phony chiropractic theory. It is not difficult to see how young people can easily be seduced into this field by becoming a \"doctor\" in a few shorterand less expensive years. The college aura; the academic-appearing catalog; and the neat, shiny, scientific-lookingclassrooms certainly must be enticing. My Report Draws Comments I shared the details of this visit with my medical colleagues in a letter to the editor of Connecticut Medicine in the June 1997 issue, to which several of my colleagues responded. The chiefof pediatrics of a well-known Connecticut hospital wrote: I was impressed by your efforts at learning more about chiropractic education as described in the June issue ofConnecticut Medicine . I echo your concerns about the lack of any scientific evidence demonstrating the effec-tiveness of chiropractic. As a pediatrician, I am, ofcourse, most concerned about the attempts made to in-fluence parents and care givers as to the need for peri-odic \"adjustments\" on children. These have been ad-vertised as being useful in the prevention and treatmentof such diverse entities as asthma, enuresis, learningdisabilities, and ear infections (to name a few)! Following the appearance of several \"glitzy\" ads by local chiropractors claiming positive results in these ar-eas, I wrote and contacted our state's Office of Healthand Consumer Affairs. This was felt by me to be a clearexample of false advertising and the individuals whowere responsible for these ads have stopped (tempo-rarily?) publishing them. However, no further investi-86 Part III: My Own Investigations gation or attempts on limiting these practices were pursued. I would be most interested to see if your efforts have reaped any benefits. I agree that the cost of such un-proven treatments are astronomical and that the medi-cal profession is bearing an undue burden by havingmost of these treatments and manipulations coveredthrough various health insurance plans. This is an issuethat should not be left unexamined. Another medical colleague, just as serious, but in a dif- ferent vein sent me an essay written by the late H.L. Mencken,which is reprinted in Chapter 4. The president of New York Chiropractic College, Ken- neth W. Padgett, DC, responded: Concerning the legitimacy of chiropractic, I believe it is important to call your readers' attention to the factthat there have been internationally recognized studiesregarding the efficacy of chiropractic care. The first wasan in-depth study conducted in the early 1990s by theRand Corporation. This study revealed that spinal ma-nipulation is of benefit to patients with acute low backpain. It is interesting to note that this study was con-ducted by a team of medical doctors as well as doctorsof chiropractic. The second study, concluded in 1994,was a publication of patient guidelines by the U.S. De-partment of Health and Human Services Agency forHealth Care Policy Research (AHCPR). This documentrecommended manipulation as the preferred therapy forlow back pain in adults. At New York Chiropractic College, we provide our students a quality education. This is readily evidencedby the fact that the college holds an Absolute Charterfrom the New York State Board of Regents and is ac-credited by the Commission on Accreditation of theCouncil on Chiropractic Education to award the Doctor Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 87 of Chiropractic degree. New York Chiropractic College is also regionally accredited by the Commission onHigher Education, Middle States Association of Col-leges and Schools. We are proud of the high level of achievement our graduates attain as health care providers. Our studentsare well-trained in diagnosis and, as practitioners, knowwhat to treat within their scope of practice and knowwhen to refer to other health care professionals. Therenewed health of literally tens of thousands of satis-fied patients provides living testimony to the effective-ness of chiropractic care. In closing, I would like to affirm the college's com- mitment to seeking the best health care possible for thosepersons we are committed to serve. We believe it is im-perative for all health care providers to work together,and we would welcome visits to our campus from thosewho are interested in joining this vital undertaking. I was given the courtesy of replying to this letter, as is a common practice of medical journals. Among other things, Ipointed out that President Padgett could not answer the basicquestions that I posed in my visit to the college. Namely, justwhat is chiropractic supposed to be, and just what is the chiro-practic theory? He did not, nor did anyone at the college, giveany proof for the existence of a \"subluxation\" of a spinal verte-bra pressing on a nerve, interfering with the passage of energydown that nerve and causing disease to organs supplied by thatnerve. To this basic question, I replied, the evidence is that chi-ropractic does not, by such definition, exist. I also commented on the AHCPR findings so proudly touted by chiropractic and President Padgett and pointed outthat, first of all, the study did not even mention the word chiro-practic but simply spoke of spinal manipulation, which osteo-paths, physiotherapists, as well as chiropractors practice. Ipointed out that the whole findings were based primarily on ameta-analysis done by Dr. Paul Schekelle of California, who88 Part III: My Own Investigations had been engaged by the Rand Corporation, which was paid $1 million by the California Chiropractic Association to study thisproblem. The study did show a small percentage of decrease in the recovery time in those whose spines were manipulated forlow back pain, but this only applied to manipulations betweenthe second and fourth weeks of acute low back pain and wasineffective before 2 weeks and ineffective after 4 weeks. I alsoshould have pointed out that the guidelines show that manipu-lation is probably harmful when sciatica is caused by a rupturedintervertebral disk. In such cases, manipulation can cause caudaequina syndrome, a condition in which damage to the nervesnear the lower end of the spine causes weakness of the legs andloss of bladder and bowel control. I further pointed out that a more recent study by a Finn- ish group suggested that having patients twist their spines later-ally to each side and backwards and forwards 10 times eachevery hour throughout the day until their back recovered maderecovery longer than for those who simply walked about anddid nothing beyond tolerance, which tends to negate the AHCPRfindings. Finally, I reminded the readers that most back painsrecover spontaneously at the end of 4 weeks regardless of treat-ment and that some 80% of ruptured disks did so also withoutsurgery. The Rand report and AHCPR guidelines are discussedin more detail in Chapter 18. Although the precise cause and the best treatment for low back pain are unclear, one dictum that seems to be gainingcredence is \"leave the back alone and it will get better on itsown\"\u2014in most cases. If this is true, then chiropractic now hasno claims for valid scientific evidence for treating anything.Certainly it does not take 5 or 6 years of some sort of collegeeducation to manipulate the spine, for which individual chiro-practors apparently develop their own techniques. There is nospecific knowledge of exactly what is being manipulated, whatit is supposed to do, and specific guidelines as to how to do it,based on science. Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 89 Chiropractor Padgett wrote in his letter to the editor, \"Our students are well trained in diagnosis.\" It is incomprehen-sible how he could make such a claim when chiropractic stu-dents experience no training inside a hospital where sick peopleare diagnosed and treated for a wide variety of specific diseases.Medical students, on the other hand, spend 2 or more years ofhospital clinical ward work diagnosing and dealing with the sick,whereas most chiropractic students concentrate on learning howto diagnose and treat \"subluxations.\" Furthermore, most medi-cal school graduates complete at least 3 more years of hospital-based postgraduate training\u2014followed by a lifetime of continu-ing medical education. Also, many chiropractors who claim all or most disease is caused by spinal misalignments feel little need to search for aspecific diagnosis. Their primary or exclusive treatment is achiropractic \"adjustment\" of the spine. Based on this claim that they are diagnosticians, chiro- practors have lobbied to be considered primary care physiciansunder managed care programs. They claim to be able to diag-nose and treat some diseases and to refer the others to medicaldoctors. Based on the limited training experience in chiroprac-tic college, it would appear that they are qualified to do neither. If President Padgett wishes to achieve the goal stated in his letter to the editor that he \"would like to confirm the college'scommitment to seeking the best health care possible for thosepersons we are committed to serve,\" he would be well advisedto consider the conversion of New York Chiropractic Collegeinto an accredited medical school as I suggested to the deanwhen I visited his college. The following is my letter to the editor in response to Dr. Padgett: The letter by chiropractor Kenneth W. Padgett, presi- dent of New York Chiropractic College, fails to addressthe very basic questions posed during my visit to thecollege, namely, where is the evidence for the chiro-practic theory that there is a \"subluxation\" of a spine90 Part III: My Own Investigations vertebra which presses on a nerve, interfering with the passage of energy down that nerve to an organ and caus-ing disease of that organ, and further, where is the evi-dence that chiropractic \"adjustments\" can benefit or curethese diseases? In scientific terms, what are the namesof the diseases; exactly what is an \"adjustment\" ma-nipulation and its function? This is the challenge to chi-ropractic. As for the RAND report and the controversial Agency for the Health Care Policy and Research guide-line report, they were both based primarily on the meta-analysis of Paul G. Shekelle et al, funded by the Cali-fornia Chiropractic Foundation. The AHCPR panel con-sisting of two osteopaths, two chiropractors, 11 medi-cal doctors, and eight others, found that spinal manipu-lation was not helpful in the first two weeks of acutelow-back pain, or after four weeks for chronic pain.There was a statistical increase in the rate of recoveryassociated with manipulation only in the two-week win-dow period between the second and fourth week, at theend of which time back pain disappeared in most casesregardless of the treatment given. Neither does the Padgett letter mention the RAND finding that, \"serious complications of lumbar manipu-lation, including paraplegia and death, have beenreported.\" Manipulations were performed by osteopaths, medi- cal doctors, and chiropractors, but nowhere in the wholeAHCPR report does the word chiropractic appear. A subsequent report which tends to negate these find- ings, which president Padgett failed to address, is theHelsinki report of 9 February 1995 appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine . A group of low-back pa- tients were instructed to twist their backs from one sideto the other and backwards, 10 times each, every hourto their limit of pain tolerance. The group subjected to Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 91 these spine-stretching exercises took longer to recover than a control group who had nothing done to their backsand simply went about their usual activities of daily liv-ing to tolerance. More importantly and to the point, the theory of chiropractic and its claims to be a legitimate method ofproviding a variety of health care far exceeds the bound-aries of controversial spinal manipulation limited to thethird or fourth week of low-back pain. For example,chiropractic claims to be able to effectively treat ear in-fections with cervical manipulative adjustments, and thatevery newborn must have prompt and periodic spinaladjustments. This must be challenged as wishful think-ing or pure quackery. And so, my impression of a visitto a chiropractic college remains the same. Clearly, thereis no evidence for such an entity as chiropractic as de-fined, and their colleges should abandon the outmodedtheory and be converted into scientific medical schools. Another letter to the editor came from Timothy C. Merrick, Board of Directors, Connecticut Chiropractic Council: I read with a mixture of mirth and sadness the letter by Mr. Chotkowski in the June issue of Connecticut Medi- cine regarding his review of Chiropractic in general and New York Chiropractic College specifically. My mirthwas elicited by Mr. Chotkowski's unbridled bias against,and appalling ignorance of, the science, art and philoso-phy of chiropractic. While it is not uncommon to wit-ness this kind of hard-line, dogmatic attitude \u2014 regard-less of the reams of research published in the last 20years \u2014 there are few who will unabashedly parade theirprejudice like Mr. Chotkowski. My sadness came from the fact that Connecticut Medicine \u2014an otherwise worthy publication\u2014would print a letter like his. Mr. Chotkowski's glaring lack ofobjectivity flies in the face of responsible journalism.92 Part III: My Own Investigations For instance: Mr. Chotkowski suggests that New York Chiropractic College had no research department. Obviously, he did not care to ask. He also did not careto find out that indeed the library was well equippedwith scientific journals. He suggests that the chiroprac-tic curriculum is a three year program when it is a tensemester program with over 4900 credit hours of didac-tic and practical education \u2014 on par with medical col-lege programs. While he took the time to go to the col-lege, he did not apparently take the time to learn any-thing. I believe his modus operandi was, \"don't con- fuse me with the truth.\" The biggest problem that Mr. Chotkowski seemed to have was understanding that chiropractic works froma different paradigm than medicine. To compare chiro-practic with medicine is like apples and oranges. He wasright, we do not \"diagnose and treat specific diseases.\"That is the practice of medicine. Is his world so smallthat nothing can exist outside of this realm? Chiropractic focuses on the connection between structure and function. Specifically between the spineand the function of the nervous system. The aim of chi-ropractic is not to treat disease but to detect and correctvertebral subluxation; to remove that which interfereswith the innate healing capacity of the human body. Asit happens, numerous studies show the beneficial effectsof this type of care on people who suffer from manydifferent disease conditions. Suggesting that there is noevidence to support the \"theory\" of chiropractic leadsone to believe that it is Mr. Chotkowski's library that isdevoid of scientific journals. Mr. Chotkowski would like to see the elimination of the chiropractic profession. Need we remind him ofthe United States Supreme Court ruling against theAmerican Medical Association for trying to do just that? Since that landmark decision to uphold a lower court's guilty verdict against the AMA, there has been Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 93 an ever-increasing, constructive dialogue between medi- cal doctors and chiropractors. I personally work withseveral physicians who refer patients to this office forchiropractic care. Patients who suffer from conditionsranging from low back pain to otitis media. They referbecause they have found that their patients benefit fromthe referral. This bridge between our professions only serves to help our patients. Mr. Chotkowski's false andinflammatory letter\u2014and your printing of it\u2014is dam-aging to this bridge and does not serve any productivepurpose. I hope to see more constructive and objective ar- ticles in future issues. Respectfully,Dr. Timothy C. Merrick, DC I responded: Dear Editor: Chiropractor Timothy Merrick's letter apparently ex-presses the view of the Connecticut Chiropractic Coun-cil, and again reveals the true nature of the chiropracticdilemma. The letter states that chiropractic admittedly\"cannot diagnose and treat specific disease,\" and thatthe \"aim is not to treat disease but to detect and correctvertebral subluxations.\" The problem with that aim isthat the existence of a subluxation has never been dem-onstrated and all scientific evidence of its existence isto the contrary. In fact, the recent attempt of the 16 col-lege presidents even to define a subluxation falls shortof any clear description of it, as follows: \"Subluxation is a complex of functional and/or struc- tural and/or pathological changes that compromise neu-ral integrity and may influence organ system's functionand health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed andmanaged through use of chiropractic procedures basedon the best available rational empirical evidence\"\u2014terms that have been described as \"chiroprattle.\"94 Part III: My Own Investigations As for Wilk vs. AMA [the Supreme Court case to which Merrick had referred], Federal Judge SusanGetzendanner did not find chiropractic to be a validhealth care system but only that it was illegal for theAMA to engage in an antitrust boycott of a licensedpractice. Regarding the creation of a constructive dialogue and bridging the gap between unscientific chiropracticand scientific medicine, the quickest way this can beaccomplished is for chiropractic to abandon its ludicroustheory and convert its colleges into accredited medicalschools\u2014as osteopaths have done. A third letter was received from chiropractor Luigi DiRubba as follows: I found it outrageous that you chose to print the letter from L.A. Chotkowski, M.D. in your June 1997 (Letterto the Editor) column. By saying he was already convinced that chiroprac- tic was a \"medical hoax,\" he admitted that he was visit-ing New York Chiropractic College with a completelyclosed mind and intentional antagonism. What purpose does it serve to air the \"opinions\" of a man who not only is closed minded, but seems to revelin his intolerance? Wouldn't your readers and your pro-fession be better served by exposure to opinions fromthose within your ranks who approach the topic of non-medical health care from an unbiased opinion and pos-sible self interest? There are thousands of medical doctors around the country and the world who are opening their minds tothe countless possibilities offered by nonmedical ap-proaches to \"health care\", including nutrition, acupunc-ture and yes, Chiropractic. These are true health professionals who are not driven by fear or hatred; but who have recognized the Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 95 limits of their own understanding and want to learn as well as promote and teach. They are overcoming de-cades of AMA initiated antichiropractic propaganda andare now working very closely with chiropractors to pro-vide a full range of health care services to their patients. They are also coming to understand\u2014as Dr. Chotkowski apparently does not \u2014 that chiropractic isnot a \"medical hoax\" or even a \"medical\" treatment. Infact, it does not offer treatments, symptom relief, orcures. Its sole purpose is the totally nonmedical one ofcorrecting vertebral subluxations (yes, Doc, there is sucha thing\u2014just review the scientific literature within thepast 20 years) to allow the human body to function bet-ter. It has been called the most conservative and, there-fore, the safest of all health care approaches. Why does Dr. Chotkowski\u2014or any medical doctor feel threatenedby this? What does he or she have to lose, other thanpatients who leave his/her office with nothing more thana prescription? Chiropractic has not grown to become the second largest health-care field in the world based on a giant\"HOAX.\" It has grown and will continue to grow, be-cause patients want one alternative to the often frustrat-ing failure of \"medical treatments\" to safely and effec-tively help them achieve health and wellness. If Dr. Chotkowski resents or fears its growth, then he should look at the weaknesses inherent in his ownprofession rather than trying to discredit or destroy the\"competition.\" Dr. Chotkowski also says he introduced a bill which would have banned the use of chiropractic on childrenand any manipulation of the neck, presumably becausein his opinion (that has no factual basis) these practicespose some sort of \"danger\" to the public. Might I sug-gest that he research the literature on this issue and alsoread the medical literature on iatrogenic diseases and96 Part III: My Own Investigations deaths which claim the health and lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year. What law will he intro-duce to put a stop to the tragedy? Your publication has a responsibility to its readers and to the public they serve. Do not relinquish that re-sponsibility by printing hate-mongering diatribes whichclearly do not adhere to even the lowest standards ofprofessional objectivity or journalistic ethics. Luigi DiRubba, D.C. (Chiropractor) My response: Chiropractor Luigi DiRubba's letter reveals the dilemma in which chiropractic finds itself today, namely there isno scientific evidence for the chiropractic theory of\"subluxation\" of a spinal vertebra pressing on a nervethat can be adjusted to treat or prevent disease. In what appears to be an admission of this, the letter states, \"In fact, it (chiropractic) does not offer treatments,symptom relief, or cures.\" What apparently remains ofchiropractic then is the claim that a theoretical adjust-ment of a vertebra can \"achieve wellness.\" If this is nota \"giant hoax,\" then at least it is a giant medical oxymo-ron. As for DiRubba's claim that chiropractic manipula- tion of the cervical spine is without danger, the 1994Consumer Reports states that a prominent malpractice insurance company paid some 140 claims for chiroprac-tic-induced strokes in one year. This alone should callfor legislative consideration of a bill to ban licensure atleast for cervical manipulation of adults, and a bill willbe introduced again this year. One issue avoided in his letter is the cost of chiro- practic care. Based on 70,000 chiropractors in the U.S.today, the cost of chiropractors' and chiropractic assis-tants' incomes, office, radiology, and laboratory ex-penses of some 200 to 300 thousand dollars each, thetotal cost is about 14 to 21 billion dollars a year\u2014a Chapter 10: Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges 97 massive health-care cost for a scientifically unproven entity. The chairman of the Connecticut Sports Medicine Com- mittee wrote in a very supportive letter, \"I compliment you onexposing yourself to the bombastics of the chiropractic com-munity. You are right. There is a massive health care cost for anunproven entity but certainly a widely publicized entity.\" Heexpressed concern that insurance companies were paying forreferrals to the neurological chiropractor, the sports medicinechiropractor, and the exercise physiologist chiropractor. He ex-pressed concern in the following statement: \"I am not sure wherethis will ever end up but again I compliment you on your efforts.\" The Clinic at Bridgeport To gain broader knowledge about what is being taught in chiro- practic colleges, I visited the University of Bridgeport Collegeof Chiropractic in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The college is 10years old and has about 250 students. The admission require-ments are 3 years of prechiropractic preparation. The total tu-ition and expense cost is about $13,000 per year for 4 years. Itis the only university-affiliated chiropractic college in the UnitedStates. A student guide was assigned to me for a tour of the buildings, which appeared adequate. I particularly wished tovisit the college's clinic and view firsthand the performance ofa spinal \"adjustment\" of a \"vertebral subluxation.\" No patientwas available, so the clinic director approved of my guide vol-unteering as a patient. My guide then lay face-down on a low table with his face cradled in a hole in one end to allow breathing. The studentadjuster then felt each side of the patient's neck and reportedfinding a cervical \"subluxation\" under his fingers. He then ex-amined the thoracic and lumber spines in the same manner, find-ing a \"subluxation\" in each.98 Part III: My Own Investigations Grasping the patient's head with both hands, he hyper- extended his head, twisted it to one side, and suddenly gave aseries of jerks. He then repeated the twists and jerks on the otherside, completing the cervical \"adjustment.\" The procedure struckme as a form of hanging without a rope or gallows. I could onlywonder what damage such twisting might be doing to the ca-rotid and vertebral arteries serving the brain, as well as damageto the intervetebral disks. The adjuster then turned the patient on his side, flexed the higher leg, clasped the leg and the thorax region, and gave aseries of vigorous thrusts. The patient was then turned over andthe thrusts repeated. When the \"adjustments\" were completed, the adjuster asked whether I had heard the cracks and assured me that theywere only the sound of gas escaping from the joints. Following this shocking demonstration of a chiroprac- tic \"adjustment,\" I visited the dean and asked him to name theexact diseases that students were taught this procedure couldeffectively treat. His answer was similar to the \"wellness\" an-swer given by the dean of New York Chiropractic College. Stu-dents were being taught to how treat the \"patient.\" When I challenged this \"patient\" concept, he suggested that I read the writings of Anthony Rosner, PhD, a spokesmanfor chiropractic. I responded that if he would turn on the com-puter on his desk, he could find on Rosner's Web site my scien-tific medical reply to Rosner's essay on the treatment of otitismedia. He then brought out a book written by Walter I. Wardwell for me to read. I responded that Wardwell, a professor of sociol-ogy at the University of Connecticut, had just written his lastpiece of advice to the chiropractic community, recommendingthat they get their act together and that different factions andbeliefs unite into a single definition and practice of chiropractic. The dean quietly put the book aside and handed me a copy of the latest chiropractic paradigm described in Chapter 1of this book. After a few cordial exchanges, the visit ended.In August 1997, I went on a fly-fishing trip in Alaskan bush country with my son and two grandsons. Our base connectionto civilization was Dillingham, Alaska, a center for the salmonfishing industry in Bristol Bay. Right in the middle of this small, quiet, rustic fishing village was a sign declaring the Chiropractic Family HealthCenter. Following a wonderful trip of catching loads of giantrainbows, dolly varden, king, silver, and sockeye salmon\u2014allrelease fishing\u2014we returned to Dillingham before flying home.I noticed the chiropractic center was open and decided to visit. The chiropractor was busy with a patient as I sat in the small waiting room. I noted chiropractic pamphlets in the officeand the standard chiropractic spinal chart depicting vertebraeand spinal nerves going to various organs. When the chiroprac-tor finally appeared, I stated that I was here from Connecticuton a fishing trip, was writing a book about chiropractic, andwas interested in what he was doing way up in Alaskan bushcountry. I also mentioned the proposed name of the book, citingits provocative title. The chiropractor was an affable, friendly man in his early 30s by appearance and quite willing to be interviewed for mybook. He said that the major problems in his area, populatedlargely by native Alaskans, were alcoholism and boredom. I wasunable to get a clear picture of exactly what health problems hewas treating, but he did say there was a small hospital in thearea where he referred patients from time to time if he felt theywere too sick for him to manage. There was also a free immuni-zation clinic for children in the town. I asked about his position 9911 Visit with an Alaskan Chiropractor100 Part III: My Own Investigations on immunization. He said he did not advise patients against immunization, but he, himself, was opposed and did not immu-nize his own children\u2014a position midway in the chiropracticspectrum of attitudes toward immunization. I questioned why he had chosen chiropractic over a medical career. He replied that his college grades had not beengood enough to get into medical school and that his applica-tions to dental schools had been rejected. After pointing out that, in my view, chiropractic could not treat any disease, I asked whether he would not feel bettergiving scientific medical care to his patients instead of chiro-practic. He replied that he was happy keeping them healthy with\"adjustments.\" I then asked whether he would consider returning to medical school if his college and other chiropractic collegeswould convert to such medical schools. He replied that medicalschool of 2 years and especially 2 more years of internship wouldbe too long. He was quite interested in this concept, however,and mentioned that Western States Chiropractic College, in Port-land, Oregon, was considering such a change. We debated the issue of unscientific chiropractic, and he pointed out a pamphlet about the Agency for Health CarePolicy and Research (AHCPR) report, prominently displayedin his waiting room. I replied that the report was an outcomemeta-analysis (these are subject to error) and that the guidelinesmentioned only manipulation and stretching back structures butdid not validate chiropractic subluxation theory. I also mentionedthe recent Finnish randomized outcome study that largely ne-gated the Shekelle meta-analysis on which the AHCPR guide-lines were largely based. He had the last word in this debate, assuring me that he was happy with his work among the Alaskan bush country peopleand was providing them with good chiropractic care. Following the visit, I had time to review the various pamphlets I obtained in his office. Of particular interest werethose issued by the Parker Chiropractic Research Foundation Chapter 11: Visit with an Alaskan Chiropractor 101 (PCRF) on kidney trouble, liver trouble, subluxation, headache, ulcers, whiplash, high blood pressure, and childhood ear infec-tions. These appear to be the same type of pamphlets issuedsome 30 years ago by the same organization mentioned in RalphSmith's book on chiropractic. To a medical-science oriented person like myself, these pamphlets all seem to be masterpieces of obfuscation. For ex-ample, the pamphlet entitled \"Kidney Trouble\" does not use\"diseases\" because it does not dicuss any specific kidney dis-ease, such as glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, oreven kidney stones. Rather, the pamphlet states: The body has two kidneys. They lie at the lower border of the rib cage, on each side of the spinal column. Thewaste material from the kidney is drained into a centrallocation\u2014the bladder\u2014to be eliminated. All very true, so far. However, the section on \"Symptoms of Kidney Trouble\" states incorrectly that the most commonlyrecognized symptom is an aching sensation in the small of theback. Most kidney disease is either painless or, in the case ofobstruction or stones, causes pain in either costovertebral angleor the abdomen. Now comes the chiropractic pitch in thepamphlet, which is, in my view, quite false: \"The most commoncause of kidney trouble is inadequate function due to impropernerve supply.\" The truth is that kidney function is controlled byhormonal mechanisms, and an adequate blood supply and hasnothing to do with its nerve supply. Kidneys can functionperfectly well with no nerve supply at all\u2014as demonstrated bytransplanted kidneys, which are separated from their nervesupply when removed from the donor's body. The obfuscation continues with the claim that the ner- vous system is a master system of the body and controls thefunction of other systems, including elimination. The pamphletthen describes the brain and spinal cord and claims that mis-aligned vertebrae interfere with normal function of the nervoussystem and \"can thereby stress the immune system, putting the102 Part III: My Own Investigations body in a weakened state that can set the stage for all kinds of malfunction\u2014kidney trouble included.\" These are all chiroprac-tic assumptions and unproven claims in the view of medicalscience. The next section of the \"Kidney Trouble\" pamphlet,titled \"Treatment,\" states: The standard medical approach to kidney problems var- ies depending upon the severity of the condition. In mildto moderate cases, diuretic drugs, antibiotics and othermedication are usually prescribed to increase functionand combat infection. If the condition fails to improveor worsens, various other procedures are used, includ-ing mechanical dialysis. Finally, if the problem stilldoesn't improve or worsens, surgery is often resorted toincluding a kidney transplant. Chiropractic is neither a kidney therapy nor a treat- ment for kidney trouble, yet patients with kidney prob-lems are turning to their neighborhood chiropractors inrecord numbers and chiropractors have a high level ofpatient satisfaction. The final two paragraphs, which appear almost verba- tim in just about all the pamphlets, read as follows: Chiropractors are health care professionals highly trained to analyze the spinal column for vertebral subluxationsthat cause nerve irritation\u2014the most common underly-ing cause of kidney trouble. Today the vertebral sub-luxation has reached epidemic proportions. This condi-tion is called a \"silent killer\" because at the same time itis weakening the body and paving the way for diseases,people may be entirely unaware they have a problem. If vertebral subluxations are found, the chiroprac- tor uses special techniques (without drugs or surgery)to correct the subluxation and relieve the nerve irrita-tion. This is called a chiropractic adjustment. The pur-pose of the chiropractic spinal adjustment is to remove Chapter 11: Visit with an Alaskan Chiropractor 103 nerve irritation, thus permitting the body to restore it- self to a greater level of energy and health. The \"Liver Trouble\" pamphlet and other pamphlets are written in the same manner, some truth mixed with unproventheory and unproven statements, all suggesting that chiroprac-tors can prevent or treat diseases of organs while correctly de-nying, at the same time, that chiropractic can treat any specificorgan disease. It would seem that one reason such pamphletsmust be carefully written so as not to be false advertising is thedanger of using the mail to defraud, and chiropractic must staywithin the boundaries of its unproven theory. The claim in that patients are satisfied with chiropractic treatment\u2014whatever that is\u2014is correct to a degree, althoughthere are many who are dissatisfied. Frankly, it is difficult tounderstand why anyone would want to be treated with spinalmanipulation for a serious disease. The Dillingham chiropractor was very interested in my book and wanted to know whether he would be in it. He seemedpleased that I said yes and appeared to feel that he had handledthe problem of chiropractic adroitly. Perhaps to have the lastword and ensure that his viewpoint was registered, he wrote thefollowing letter a few weeks later addressed to me as L.A.Chotkowski, RD (real doctor): Dear Sir: Thank you for reaffirming my belief in the chiropracticsubluxation. Having jerks like you re-ignites my dutyto let people know that allopathic medicine is run bythe pharmaceutical giants. You guys treat symptoms, notthe cause of disease. Maybe you should go back to chi-ropractic college and learn a thing or two. Sincerely. It seems that chiropractic theory and philosophy are alive and well ingrained throughout the nation, including Alaskan bushcountry.On a rainy summer evening, I and a medical colleague attended a public lecture given at a West Hartford, Connecticut, libraryby a local chiropractor on the subject of headaches. We signedin and joined some 12 enthusiastic attendees, most of whomprofessed, by a show of hands when asked by the lecturer, tohave suffered a headache at some time or other. I also raised myhand on this issue. The lecture, I soon discerned, was based on the prac- tice-building strategies mentioned in previous chapters of thisbook. The speaker, in a very congenial and pleasant manner, began by explaining how we all have headaches periodically.He then proceeded to describe the types of headache in a fairlyaccurate manner, covering the subject as found in any medicaltextbook and based on scientific knowledge. However, he alsobrought out the typical chiropractic spinal column model, dis-played in many chiropractic offices and advertisements, andproceeded to point out the area where \"subluxations\" were press-ing on nerves, causing symptoms of headache. He then described how spinal \"adjustments\" relieved these symptoms. In doing so, he criticized the medical professionfor only \"treating symptoms\" with Advil, Tylenol, or pressure on the nervoussystem, \"treat the cause.\" It is like prescribing an antacid forindigestion, he explained, which treats the symptoms, whereasspinal \"adjustments\" get at the cause. He did not explain exactlyhow this was accomplished physiologically, except to say that 10512 A Chiropractic Lecture on Headache106 Part III: My Own Investigations the nervous system in the spine controlled all body functions and that his manipulations were a natural way of treating thedisease. He showed a series of anatomical drawings of the spine, projected on a screen, to explain the chiropractic theory thatpinching of spinal nerves produced headaches. Then\u2014out ofthe blue\u2014he showed a diagram of a child passing through thebirth canal, which he described as \"very tight,\" and said thattwisting and pulling of the child's neck during delivery pro-duced cervical \"subluxations.\" These had to be adjusted, hewarned, or else the child might suffer sudden infant death syn-drome. He also claimed that the child would need treatmentsimmediately and all throughout life to stay healthy. Nobody inthe audience took exception to these imaginative statements. The chiropractor then produced a \"Chiropractic Re- search Chart\" (see page 107) from among several pieces of chi-ropractic literature in a packet given to each participant . A simi- lar chart from the Parker Chiropractic Research Foundation wasmentioned in At Your Own Risk in 1969. Such charts are interesting because they suggest that chiropractic treatment can help people with an enormous rangeof symptoms and conditions. These charts do not state when orhow the figures were compiled, how the diagnoses were made,what treatment was given, how many patients were allegedlystudied, or how the patient evaluations were obtained. Many ofthe categories are not specific conditions but are symptoms orgroups of conditions. Some of the figures are preposterous. Ifspinal adjustments could cure or substantially improve 81.9%of patients with kidney disease, 80.5% of patients with liverdisorders, or 80.9% of those with gallbladder disease, they wouldbe making headlines everywhere\u2014and perhaps Andy Warholwould still be alive today. No medical journal would publishsuch an undocumented and irresponsible report, but nobody inthe audience appeared to find anything wrong with it. Following his formal presentation, the chiropractor held what he termed a \"workshop,\" in which the audience partici-pated. He asked everyone to stand; raise their arms; inhale Chapter 12: A Chiropractic Lecture on Headache 107 CHIROPRACTIC RESEARCH CHART These statistics represent the results obtained under chiropractic care for a large variety of chronic conditions. The vast majority of these cases had also beenpreviously diagnosed and treated by practitioners other than Doctors of Chiropractic. Accepted* Well Continued for or Much Slightly to Condition Treatment Improved Improved Same Worsen Allergies 92.3% 87.2% 10.3% of chiropractic do not accept all cases but help nearly all they accept.108 Part III: My Own Investigations deeply; close their eyes; exhale and relax; and then turn their head this way, then that way, forward, and backward. Then heasked, \"Now don't you all feel better,\" to which everyone butmy colleague and I responded, \"Yes.\" I gathered that the purpose of this exercise was to sub- tly suggest that neck manipulation was safe and beneficial. Thenthe chiropractor had the group act alternately as doctor and pa-tient by massaging and gently tilting each other's heads to breakdown any barriers of fear and to further promote the chiroprac-tic concept. When the audience participation was over, he offered a free consultation and examination to \"anyone signing up to-night but not thereafter.\" He then opened the meeting to ques-tions and answers. After one person asked a question and thereappeared to be no more, I asked whether he had actually everseen a subluxation. He seemed taken aback by this question butclaimed that the wonderful results of chiropractic proved thatsubluxations existed. \"But,\" I persisted, \"have you ever seen one by autopsy, surgery, x-ray, CT scan or other imaging technique?\" \"By x-ray,\" was his answer.\"But x-rays don't show subluxations or nerves. Even Scott Haldeman calls it a functional spinal lesion, not an ana-tomical one, in his book.\" The audience became a bit restless at this point and be- gan to speak up in his defense, voicing objections to my ques-tioning and saying that chiropractic helped them. I persisted withone more question, \"You said much about the dangers of medi-cine and surgery, but what about the dangers of chiropracticneck manipulation? Do you inform your patients that neck ad-justments can cause strokes and even be fatal?\" \"It doesn't happen,\" he replied.\"Well,\" I said, \"you must certainly have heard about chiropractor Thomas Goulding of Waterford, who was judgedresponsible for causing the stroke of Linda Solsbury, who nowlies completely paralyzed in a hospital here in New Britain. Chapter 12: A Chiropractic Lecture on Headache 109 Goulding was successfully sued for $10 million.\" At this point, the audience protested further and the meeting ended. Two audience members came up to me later, and one said, \"I've been going to a chiropractor for neck adjustmentsfor 20 years and nothing has ever happened to me.\" \"What's your problem?\" I asked.\"I was injured and had a ruptured disk in my neck.\"\"How come you still have the problem after 20 years of chiropractic and didn't have an operation that could have curedyour disk overnight?\" I asked. \"I'm afraid of surgery,\" he replied.The other member asked whether I was a doctor and said, \"I have headaches every month and have been going tomy regular doctor and still have them, and I would like a cure.\" I hesitated to get involved in this manner, but I was cu- rious about her story and why she had come to the lecture. \"Do they come with your periods?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she said, and went on to describe the classical symptoms of migraine. \"Well,\" I said, \"there are a number of medications your doctor may have tried like diuretics for premenstrual tensionsyndrome and fluid retention, Inderal, as Imitrex.\" \"Oh yes,\" she said, \"he prescribed Imitrex but if I don't take it right away, it doesn't work. I still suffer sometimes everymonth and I would like a cure.\" In leaving the meeting, I said to the chiropractor who was attending the refreshments, \"Nothing personal, you under-stand, just wanted to ask a few questions.\" I left with my medical colleague, who had informed me of the meeting. He commented, as we were walking out, \"Thesepeople all seem as though they are hypnotized. Once they areprogrammed to believe something, no amount of reasoning orfact can dissuade them or convince them otherwise.\" So true, I agreed, and so ended the lesson.While preparing the first edition of this book, I sent the follow- ing letter to a leading chiropractic organization and several well-known experts. Dear Member of the Scientific Community, I am writing a book titled Chiropractic, the Greatest Hoax of the Century? , which concludes that, \"there is no such entity as the chiropractic theory of subluxationof a spinal vertebra, pressing on a nerve, causing dis-ease of various organs supplied by that nerve, and thatconcludes that chiropractic adjustments of such theo-retical subluxations cannot alleviate disease or main-tain health.\" I am seeking opinions from various promi-nent authorities and organizations in the scientific fieldthat would support this view, and would appreciate anopinion from you. The first response came from Anthony L. Rosner, PhD, (biochemistry), director of research for the Foundation for Chi-ropractic Education and Research, a group that funds chiropracticstudies but also issues a considerable amount of propaganda: Dear Dr. Chotkowski: I am in receipt of your letter of August 26th seeking anopinion in support of your view that chiropractic maybe the greatest hoax of the century. As the Director ofResearch for a foundation with over a 50-year historyfor supporting peer-reviewed research pertaining to chi-ropractic, I find your viewpoint disappointing in its 11113 Additional Opinions about Chiropractic112 Part III: My Own Investigations failure to grasp not only several goals and accomplish- ments of chiropractic research, but also how medical procedures are often practiced without scientific docu-mentation. I can appreciate your impatience with attempts to define the term \"subluxation\"; indeed, there are vary-ing opinions both within and outside the chiropracticcommunity as to precisely what the term denotes. Foryour reference, I have enclosed a copy of a recent mono-graph that I have devoted to just that subject \u2014 and youwill note that there has been a gradual evolution of asuitable definition of the term with only a recent con-sensus within the chiropractic community, and numer-ous research efforts have established with varying de-grees of success our working concepts of the term. Foryou to condemn the term outright, however, seems asfutile and ill-advised as if you were to condemn quan-tum mechanics simply because it attempts to advanceour understanding of matter by describing its wavelikeproperties in addition to its more commonly acceptedparticulate nature. Your describing chiropractic as a hoax flies in the face of leading government reports from both the UnitedStates [1] and Great Britain [2], which unequivocallystate that chiropractic is one of the leading alternatives in the management of back pain and that these conclu- sions are based upon the fact that the evidence for theeffectiveness of chiropractic is among the strongest ofany of the health professions reviewed. This recogni-tion could not have been possible under the terms ofyour current assessment of chiropractic. First, one must be aware that only 15% of medical procedures have been documented in any way in thepeer-reviewed scientific literature [3], only 1% of whichhas been deemed to be methodologically sound [4].Coronary bypass surgery, glaucoma surgery, and manyprocedures in orthopedic surgery were initiated withChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 113 virtually no literature to support them; you would do well to recall that mainstream medicine, held before us as the gold standard, has occasionally endorsed suchill-advised and short-lived therapies as the use of leechesor laughing gas. Finally, physicians need to be aware that a consid- erable body of empirical evidence in support of the chi-ropractic management of such varied conditions as exist in the peer-reviewed literature. Fifteento twenty years ago, one could say that relatively littlerefereed literature existed in support of the chiropracticmanagement of back pain. With the passage of time andconsiderable research, we now know that the medicalcommunity, with your unfortunate exception, is begin-ning to recognize chiropractic management of back painas a strongly substantiated health care intervention forthe treatment of back pain. Spinal manipulative therapy has been widely re- garded as safe and effective for a growing number ofconditions in addition to low back pain. Unfortunately,history has shown us that chiropractic has been viru-lently attacked without basis by many circles in ortho-dox medicine and the title of your book does give youaway as one of the most vociferous exponents of thatsentiment that I have ever seen. I hope that you will beable to consider this information that I have sent youbefore embarking upon what I believe is an ill-informedand ultimately self-defeating undertaking. References 1.

Rosner, PhD Rosner's letter and enclosed monograph (see excerpts in the following text) display the typical chiropractic dilemma.Chiropractic is unable to clearly define or demonstrate the ex-istence of its \"subluxations\" or show that its \"adjustments\" caneffectively treat any disease. It therefore must resort to attackson those engaged in its exposure. For example, in the mono-graph, The Role of the Subluxation in Chiropractic , the most recent attempt to define \"subluxation\" is as follows: The term subluxation used by chiropractors to describe altered joint motion, misalignment of articular surfacesChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 115 and related physiological changes significantly predates the grosser visually cued radiographic subluxation, yetgreater than one hundred terms have been proposed toreplace the chiropractic subluxation. Changing the a spinal \"boo boo,\" an adjustment seeking le-sion, or saying that bad things happen to the spine. Subluxation has meant an element of misalignment, altered motion, and dysfunction to chiropractors for morethan a century. The recent definition of subluxationdeveloped through consensus of the 16 chiropracticcollege presidents under the auspices of the Associationof Chiropractic Colleges in July of 1996 provides arational and unifying definition for use by thechiropractic profession: Subluxation is a complex of functional and/or struc- tural and/or pathologic changes that compromiseneural integrity and may influence organ systemfunction and general health. A subluxation is evalu-ated, diagnosed and managed through the use ofchiropractic procedures based on the best availablerational and empirical evidence. It is in this spirit of rationality and unity that I commend this monograph and the use of the term subluxation toboth chiropractors and non chiropractors alike. The monograph Rosner sent me contains contributions from a number of chiropractic college officials offering researchstudies designed to clarify the meaning of a \"subluxation,\" butnowhere in the text was there a demonstration that it, in fact,exists. Rosner's letter lists as his No. 1 reference Stanley Bigos, MD, who chaired the Agency for Health Care Policy andResearh (AHCPR) team that developed the guidelines for116 Part III: My Own Investigations treating acute low back pain. Curiously, the second response to my inquiry came from Dr. Bigos: I received your note of August 26, 1997. I am not to- tally sure what your note meant exactly, so I will pro-vide you with the recommendations that I have. First ofall, as you mentioned, there was no word of chiroprac-tic or the theory of chiropracsy in the AHCPR Guide-lines. But due to the fact that there were two articles,one by McDonald and one by Nortin Hadler, that madeour evidence tables to show the efficacy above and be-yond placebo, it is imperative that we consider manipu-lation a means of symptom control. As you might know, symptom control is but one part of care as the real treatment for activity intolerance isconditioning. Speaking strictly for the lumbar spine andnot the cervical spine, we had to conclude that lumbarmanipulation was safe when there was no significantneurological abnormalities and we had to consider thefact that nobody gets gastrointestinal bleeds from ma-nipulation compared to some of the problems we runinto with our nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. At no point were we able to provide any distinc- tions related to subluxations causing disease or manipu-lation correcting a problem. What we could say is thatthere are a couple of points on a 10-point visual analogscale changed above and beyond placebo with manipu-lation and that the effect lasted for a few hours. Aboutthe same as much less expensive medication methods. Hope this is helpful.Sincerely,Stanley J. Bigos, MDProfessor of Orthopedics and Environmental HealthUniversity of Washington School of MedicineChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 117 I interpret Dr. Bigos's reply to mean that the AHCPR panel found no evidence of a \"chiropractic subluxation causingdisease or manipulation correcting a problem.\" The text of theguidelines did not even mention chiropractic. The panel evi-dently considered seriously two studies showing that spinalmanipulation gave \"a couple of points\" of relief of symptomson a scale of 10 but no cure of the condition. These two studies showed that the effect of spinal ma- nipulation lasted only for about \"a few hours\" and was aboutthe same as inexpensive over-the-counter pain relievers. So, for all the chiropractic hoopla about curing the cause of disease, as far as back pain was concerned, two outcome analy-ses were finally found that showed that spinal manipulation wasno better than a couple of aspirins or Tylenol\u2014and a great dealmore expensive, as Dr. Bigos has noted. The panel's report was published before a Finnish re- port that basically negated its findings. The Finnish report, asdescribed in Chapter 18 of this book, concluded that doing noth-ing for acute low back pain was superior to intensive muscle-stretching manipulative procedures. Dr. Bigos's letter also points out that neck manipulation (which can be risky) was not part of their investigation and alsothat manipulation was safe only if there were no significant \"neu-rological abnormalities.\" This, as the guidelines stated, includessciatica due to a ruptured intervertebral disk; patients with thiscondition should not undergo manipulation. Ironically, chiro-practic claims to be able to adjust vertebrae that supposedly presson nerves, but when confronted with real, demonstrable pres-sure of a disk on a nerve, causing sciatica, spinal manipulationis both ineffective and unsafe, according to the guidelines. A third response came from Brian G. Smith, MD, staff orthopedic surgeon for a well-known Connecticut children'scenter: Thank you for your recent correspondence and phone calls regarding your continued efforts in bringing118 Part III: My Own Investigations public awareness to the nature of chiropractic care. Your recent letter to Connecticut Medicin e was very infor- mative and revealing. In my practice, I still continue tosee things that are a nuisance in caring for our patients.Please find enclosed copies of reports on two sisters whorecently saw a chiropractic person. I found it quite in-teresting that \"Mary Doe\" entered the office with nocomplaints to accompany her sister but was found tohave a \"negative alteration in neuromusculature and bio-mechanical integrity\" of her spine and pelvis and thenwas recommended to have complete radiographs of herspine as well as 3-times-a-week treatment for a periodof four weeks. This, again, for a child who was appar-ently well and simply walked into the office with hersister. Especially, as his own note mentions, when shehad no complaints. . . . The following is the chiropractic report on this pa- tient that we are calling \"Mary Doe.\" PATIENT REPORT FOR SELECTED PATIENTS SUBJECTIVE: Mary Doe entered the office with no complaints. OBJECTIVE:ROM: Cervical flexion is hypermobile at 60 degrees, extension is normal at 45 degrees, right lateral flexionis normal at 45 degrees, left lateral flexion is decreasedto 30 degrees, right rotation is normal at 80 degrees,left rotation is decreased to 60 degrees. Thoracolum-bar flexion is normal at 90 degrees, extension is nor-mal at 35 degrees, right lateral flexion is hypermobileat 40 degrees, left lateral flexion is decreased at 30degrees, right rotation is normal at 30 degrees, leftrotation is normal at 30 degrees. ORTHO:NEURO:Chapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 119 SOFT TISSUE: There is a negative alteration of the neuromusculature and biomechanical integrity in thecervical, thoracic and lumbosacral spine and pelvis. ASSESSMENT: Mary is expected to be progressing satisfactorily. PLAN: The patient will get A-P and lateral full spine radiographs. The patient will receive adjustment ofosseous disarticulations, myofascial release and thera-peutic hose exercises. The patient will be seen threetimes weekly to as needed and evaluated in four weeks. I also received a copy of a letter that a chiropractor had sent to the editor of a publication called Unique Opportunities . A medical doctor sent it to me to illustrate how chiropractorsoverpromote themselves. Chiropractic not \"alternative\" Through my father, who is an MD, I was given the March/April 1997 edition of your magazine. I read withgreat interest the article \"Coming of Age\" concerningalternative therapies entering the mainstream. What Ifound missing in this otherwise well written and bal-anced piece of reporting concerning \"alternative\" medi-cine, is that unlike acupuncture, meditation, homeopa-thy, herbology, naturopathy, etc., which are types oftherapies or \"wellness\" philosophies, chiropractic medi-cine is a 102-year-old licensed profession. None of theother types of alternative medicine covered in Ms.Feldman's article are academic disciplines or profes-sions. The chiropractic profession, like medicine, osteopa- thy, dentistry, and podiatry, has professionally accred-ited undergraduate adenopathy graduate programs, withmulti-disciplinary faculties, research facilities, and largephysical campuses. Chiropractic is a graduate health careprofession requiring previous undergraduate studies in120 Part III: My Own Investigations the humanities and sciences before a student matricu- lates in the doctoral program. Chiropractic is based on scientific principles of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics of the humanbody, consistent with allopathic medicine's views ofhealth as \"the disease.\" Ms. Feldman's definition of alternative health: \"fo- cus on optimizing health by strengthening and tuninginto the body's own healing abilities\" in part definesmodern chiropractic care. However, modern chiroprac-tic practice encompasses mainstream health care with aholistic approach. I find the inclusion of chiropractic with other forms of \"alternative medicine\" in your article positions it inthe category of marginally scientific or unscientifictherapies, which are not professions.... Chiropractic embraces scientifically based practice methodology, with a decidedly \"hands-on\" approachcomplemented by state-of-the-art diagnostic and test-ing procedures. Chiropractic stands by itself as a pro-fession, but stresses a holistic approach, which may ex-plain why Ms. Feldman and the physicians she show-cases consider my profession \"alternative medicine.\" The chiropractic profession is far more than simply an alternative type of medicine, but rather a mature pro-fession. It is satisfying that many medical schools, thegovernment, and academic institutions are taking anaggressive approach to studying \"alternative medicine.\"However, I believe chiropractic should be investigatedas a profession equal to medicine or dentistry, that hassomething to contribute to the body of scientificknowledge.\" Stephen Barrett, MD, who has investigated chiroprac- tic thoroughly and is editor of this book, has spoken severaltimes with the letter's author and believes that he is medicallyChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 121 oriented and practices in a scientific manner. However, the majority of chiropractors do not; the letter's portrayal ofchiropractic's status should be regarded as wishful thinking. I also heard from William Mahan, head of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. While not commenting onthe validity of chiropractic itself, he noted that chiropractors, asothers, can be found guilty of fraud in the real sense. (Chapter20 provides an example.) Paul H. Dworkin, MD, editor of the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics , also wrote to me: Thank you for requesting my views on the success of chiropractic treatment for children with developmentaland behavioral problems. . . . We frequently receivemanuscripts on a variety of nonstandard therapies forchildren experiencing developmental and behavioraldisorders. Based upon my knowledge of the literature, Iam aware of no studies which objectively and scientifi-cally document the value of chiropractic therapy in ad-dressing developmental or behavioral problems. Myopinion, based upon my knowledge of the literature, isthat any claims of benefit for such therapy among chil-dren with developmental and behavioral problems areunwarranted and not based on scientific evidence. Once again, thank you for soliciting my opinion. Sincerely yours,Paul H. Dworkin, MD Another letter came from C. Everett Koop, MD, former U.S. Surgeon General, who was kind enough to send his opin-ions on chiropractic: You've taken on a difficult task. Although many people might agree with your general endeavor and the title ofyour book (Chiropractic, the Greatest Hoax of the Cen-tury?), the time for that is probably past. The reason Isay this is that now one finds orthodox allopathic122 Part III: My Own Investigations physicians using chiropractors in their practices \u2014 not to do what chiropractors claim to do, but as an adjunctto physiotherapy and treatment of low back pain. I remember the professor of anatomy at Cornell tak- ing a fresh spine out of the cadaver and trying tosubluxate anything \u2014 of course, he couldn't. I wish you well, however you decide to go, but I know it's an uphill fight. Sincerely yours,C. Everett Koop, MD Another opinion came from Paul Shekelle, MD, PhD, who headed the famous Rand study on which the AHCPR guide-lines were largely based. He was helpful in sending me a pack-age of his studies and the following letter from Rand, where heis employed: Thank you for your interest in our work. I am enclosing the reprints you requested plus other related materials. RAND's work on spinal manipulation has been funded by two private foundations associated with chi-ropractors and by the Agency for Health Care Policyand Research, a branch of the United States PublicHealth Service. The optimum management for low back pain con- tinues to be a question for ongoing research. Some ob-servational studies, such as the Carey Study, in the New England Journal of Medicine to which you refer, show no difference among groups. Some experimental stud-ies show a benefit from manipulation, others do not.The net weight of the evidence for acute low back paincontinues to be positive in favor of manipulation. Sincerely,Paul Shekelle, MD, PhD Shekelle's candid statement adds to the evidence that the AHCPR study was not an endorsement of chiropractic. Inreviewing the complex statistical analysis on which the RandChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 123 meta-analysis was based, I find no mention of \"adjustments\" of vertebral \"subluxation\" or spinal misalignments, only spinal ma-nipulation. Moreover, the cited research did not include attemptsto find the cause of low back pain or just what spinal manipula-tions were supposed to accomplish. Dr. Shekelle is certainlycorrect in saying the optimum management of low back paincontinues to be a question of ongoing research. Another interesting letter came from Ira C. Magaziner, who was chief advisor to Hilary Clinton in her ill-fated healthcare reform proposal and President Clinton's senior advisor forpolicy development. I had met Magaziner at a town hall meet-ing in Manchester, Connecticut, arranged by CongresswomanBarbara Kennelley. I impressed upon him my concerns aboutthe inroads being made by unscientific \"alternative\" health care,including chiropractic. Describing how these reminded me ofthe snake oil medicine men of the 1800s, I also stated that re-form was long overdue. In response, he sent the following letter. Thank you for sharing your thoughts about health care reform. You expressed concern about chiropractic careunder the President's Health Care Reform Proposal. Thisis an issue the Administration considered carefully whileformulating the proposal. The President's proposal provides coverage for a comprehensive benefit package, including services ofhealth professionals. The proposal defines health pro-fessional services to include those services which arelawfully provided by a physician, or those services thatcould be performed by a physician and that are providedby another person who is legally authorized to providethose services in the state. The proposal does not specifyparticular items or services within these broad catego-ries, nor does it identify specific providers of services.Improved competition among health plans may createnew incentives for effective use of a range of providers,including chiropractors. Plans will be free to use anymix of providers to meet the needs of their enrollees.124 Part III: My Own Investigations This nation now has a historic opportunity to change our health care system to make it work for all of us. Ihope you will work with the President to make healthsecurity a reality for all Americans. Regards,Ira C. Magaziner Magaziner took the politically \"safe\" ground that where anyone is licensed to provide any kind of health care, the presi-dent would support it. I believe that the proliferation of worth-less, unscientific, unproven health care provides no health se-curity and would waste much-needed health care dollars. Fix-ing this problem, I related to him, would be real health carereform. Arnold S. Relman, MD, editor-in-chief emeritus of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine , gave this opinion: I have not been following chiropractic \"research\" for several years, but I am not aware of any studies pub-lished in the medical literature that relate to the \"sub-luxation\" theory upon which chiropractors base theirtherapy. There have been one or two studies, which Iassume you are aware, that compare the symptomaticrelief of nonspecific low back pain by chiropractictherapy with that produced by conventional conserva-tive medical management. These studies have shownthat chiropractic manipulation produces at least as muchsymptomatic relief as conventional medical treatment.Aside from this work, I know no other credible clinicalstudy of chiropractic treatment that has been publishedin the peer reviewed medical literature. However, I mustrepeat the caveat that I really haven't followed the fieldclosely and may, therefore, have missed some signifi-cant literature. Sincerely yours,Arnold S. Relman, MDChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 125 In a 1979 editorial, Dr. Relman had challenged chiro- practors to prove scientifically the existence of vertebral \"sub-luxations\" or abandon the chiropractic theory. No such studiesexist. Mention was previously made of the opinions of chiro- practor Louis Sportelli of Palmerton, Pennsylvania, a spokes-man for chiropractic and former board chairman of the Ameri-can Chiropractic Association (ACA), who, after my visit to NewYork Chiropractic College, had sent me a detailed three-page letter along with a package of chiropractic literature that includedDr. Scott Haldeman's textbook. Sportelli's letter, typical ofpresent-day chiropractic strategy, criticized medical care andpraised chiropractic. He stated: The underlying fact which is about to emerge from all of the outcomes research is simply this \u2014 most medicalhealth care decisions are arbitrary and harmful to pa-tients. This is the sad state of medical care in this coun-try today. . . . Only about 1% of the articles in medicaljournals are scientifically sound. The book Chiropractic: The Victim' s Perspective quotes Sportelli as saying, \"We're the only profession that can do some-thing in a patient to insure wellness before they get sick. I getadjusted every week, and I have for the past 35 years of mylife.\" This book was written by the late George Magner, with aforward by William G. Jarvis, PhD, president of the NationalCouncil Against Health Fraud. Magner characterized sublux-ation theory and its trappings as \"a delusional system\u2014a set ofbeliefs held despite abundant evidence that contradicts them\"and observed that \"as things stand now, chiropractic is clingingfor dear life to its cultist and pseudoscientific roots while insist-ing that it has risen above them.\" These statements are com-mendable and in keeping with my own conclusions. Finally, I sent a questionnaire to all American and Ca- nadian medical school deans and more editors of scientific jour-nals asking whether, in their opinion, the chiropractic theory126 Part III: My Own Investigations was \"true\" or \"false.\" Of the 27 deans who replied, all said that it was false. Dr. George M. Lundberg, then-editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , agreed that the theory was \"false.\" He also remarked that the term \"neural integrity\" usedby the chiropractic deans was unclear and that the phrase \"mayinfluence organ system function\" was meaningless. He summa-rized his opinion with the statement, \"No scientific basis forthis theory as a cause of organ system health or disease.\" Dr. Jerold T. Lucy, editor of Pediatrics , replied less dip- lomatically, \"It's garbage!\" Dr. James Dolin, editor of the Archives of Medicine , and Dr. J. Claude Bennett, editor of The Journal of Medicine , both replied, \"false.\" I received the following letter from Dr. William Harlan, then-acting director of the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine: Your letter to Donna Shalala, Secretary of the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services, was forwarded tothe National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Centerfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)for response. . . over-due . . for your administration to assess again chiro-practic,\" is one that is timely. The NIH recently established the NCCAM to con- duct evaluations of chiropractic and alternative thera-pies. As stated succinctly by Dr Harold Varmus, theDirector of NIH, in his speech at the Stamford Univer-sity Medical School Graduation ceremony, \"There aremethods that work and methods that don't. Or methodsthat have been tested and those that have not.\" It is theultimate goal of NIH and NCCAM to develop and fundresearch that will clearly, unambiguously, and definitelyshow which therapies commonly referred to as \"Alter-native\" are effective and safe. Chiropractic medicine isincluded in the group of alternative treatments currentlyChapter 13: Additional Opinions about Chiropractic 127 being investigated. NIH and NCCAM will disseminate the results of this research when they are available. Thank you for your comments on chiropractic, and we agree that further evaluation is needed. The bottom line, supported by most of the responses described in this chapter, is that chiropractic's \"subluxationtheory\" is a hoax.Following publication of this book's first edition, there were several revealing reviews and reactions. Major reviews weremade by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and theConnecticut Chiropractic Association (CCA), and one appearedin Connecticut Medicine , the journal of the Connecticut State Medical Society. My basic response to the ACA review is the same as stated in Chapter 10 (Visits to Two Chiropractic Colleges). Thereis no scientific evidence for the chiropractic theory that (a) ver-tebral \"subluxations\" press on nerves, interfering with passageof energy to various organs, and thereby causing disease, and(b) spinal \"adjustments\" of those mythical entities can prevent,effectively treat, or cure any disease. Here is the ACA review,with my responses interspersed: While the American Chiropractic Association respects open dialogue on the subject of chiropractic care, weview Chiropractic: The Greatest Hoax of the Century? as a biased, misinformed treatment of one of the mostpopular and effective forms of health care availabletoday. My response: Chiropractic has been misinforming the public for more than 100 years and is challenged by my book to provethe validity of its claims. Popular trends do not validate a prac-tice. Popular smoking, overeating, and illicit drug use do notmake them healthy practices. 12914 Reactions to the First Edition of This Book130 Part III: My Own Investigations Chiropractic care is validated by a number of research studies. The 1994 US Agency for Health Care Policyand Research [AHCPR] panel concluded that spinal ma-nipulation is a recommended form of initial treatmentfor low back pain in adults. The prestigious Rand Cor-poration also determined that spinal manipulation is anappropriate treatment for acute low back pain, and re-ported from its analysis that 94 percent of all manipula-tions are performed by doctors of chiropractic. My response: The book's last chapter contained an editorial by Dr. Paul Shekelle, chief investigator for the Rand report, statingthat, \"It is currently inappropriate to consider chiropractic as abroad based alternative to traditional care.\" In a letter to me, hestated, \"The optimum management for low back pain continuesto be a question for ongoing research.\" Also, the letter from Dr.Stanley Bigos, chairman of the AHCPR panel, places theAHCPR guidelines in perspective. There is no mention of chi-ropractic, \"subluxations,\" or \"adjustments\" in the entire report. Chiropractic is one of the safest forms of health care available today. According to another study by the RandCorporation, a serious adverse reaction from cervicalmanipulation\u2014or manipulation of the neck\u2014occurs onein a million manipulations. The same Rand study showedthat, on extremely rare occasions that when an adversereaction does occur, it is the result of improperly trainedphysical therapists or other health care providers, notchiropractors performing this procedure. My response: There are no clear figures as to just how many strokes and how much damage to the vertebral arteries occurevery year from cervical manipulations, but there are probablyat least 100 strokes a year. Since there are few sensible indica-tions for neck manipulations for any condition in the first place,any catastrophic tragedy from such manipulation is unconscio-nable. What damage this may be doing to newborn children,allegedly to prevent SID syndrome, is unknown. My report onChapter 14: Reactions to the First Edition of This Book 131 Linda Solsbury (Chapter 9 in this edition of my book) describes how she was paralyzed by chiropractic neck manipulation andsubsequently received a $10 million malpractice jury award. In contrast, a study published in the April 15, 1998, is- sue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found that more than 2 million Americans become seri-ously ill every year from reactions to correctly prescribeddrugs and 106,000 die from these side effects. My response: These figures have been challenged. It is admit- ted that many drugs such as those used for AIDS and cancertreatment do have a high risk/benefit ratio. The side effects arewell described and not hidden. The real harm of chiropractic isin inadequate diagnosis and in completely ineffective treatmentfor any disease, since the chiropractic belief is that the cause ofall disease is the theoretical nonexistent vertebral \"subluxation,\"and the primary treatment is spinal \"adjustment.\" Dr. Chotkowski's mission to defeat chiropractic is not embraced by the medical community. In fact, the Sept.2, 1998 issue of the JAMA reports that a number of U.S. medical schools are offering courses teaching studentsto work with patients who need or want to be treated byalternative health care providers such as doctors of chi-ropractic. In addition, the November 11 issue of JAMA reports that 4 out of 10 Americans used at least one formof alternative care in 1997, with 90 percent receivingchiropractic care.\" My response: Twenty-seven medical deans surveyed agreed with me that the chiropractic theory and practice based on it is false.I feel that, as a person dedicated to the scientific method of treat-ing health conditions of life and death, I have a moral, profes-sional obligation to inform the public of the total truth aboutchiropractic care. My book lays down the challenge to chiro-practic to prove their claims with scientific evidence, which theyhave yet been unable to do in more than 100 years.132 Part III: My Own Investigations Finally, more than 20 million Americans seek chiroprac- tic care each year and, according to a Gallup survey, 90percent of them say their care was effective. We feelthese patients would agree that Dr. Chotkowski's attackis unfounded and that the book does a grave disserviceto a community of people making informed health caredecisions based on research and successful outcomes. My response: The claim, if true, that more than 20 million Ameri- cans seek out this false method of health care only compoundsthe enormity of the hoax. My book is not an \"attack\" againstchiropractic. It is an expos\u00e9 of a gigantic hoax. The hoax thesisis well documented and supported with scientific evidence andby opinions of members of the scientific community. Thus, thebook is hopefully a service to humanity. Connecticut Medicine offered this review. The overwhelming theme, (of the book) is that . . . the burden of scientific proof of effectiveness of chiroprac-tic treatment has been thrust upon chiropractic for thepast century. This chiropractic has failed to do as chiro-practic itself admits. The book, like chiropractic itself, relies on newspa- per articles, author research (3 decades of primary care),and anecdotes to weave a story of concern. With thenumber of licensed chiropractors growing to 69,000 in1997, the author defines the problem, reduces the is-sues and clearly pronounces a solution. He insists thatchiropractic schools, as osteopathic schools before them,\"Convert their colleges into standard medical schools.\" With persistence to detail, he reviews the eight-mem- ber panel's recommendation to then-Secretary of H.E.W.Wilbur Cohen in the early 1970s, noting that although chiropractic was accepted into Medicare provider sta-tus, the panel judged negatively because:Chapter 14: Reactions to the First Edition of This Book 133 a. Chiropractic knowledge is not consistent with ad- equate scientific research. b. Subluxation is not a significant factor in the disease process; spinal analysis and the adjustments are thusnot fruitful. c. Manipulation must be studied through suitable sci- entific research. d. Inadequacies of chiropractic education and the de- emphasis of proven causative factors and disease pro-cesses make it unlikely that an adequate diagnosis ortreatment plan is possible. There is a short visit to New York Chiropractic Col- lege and a review of the Principles and Practices of Chiropractic , the book known as the \"Bible.\" The author addresses the issues of risk management and concludes with the ominous note that, \"the chiro-practic profession has existed for a century without hav-ing made a single contribution to the world's knowl-edge in the health sciences.\" However, an addendumdoes note that a Canadian chiropractic college studiedasthma and spinal manipulation, and no benefit wasfound. The second study from Seattle and Edmontonalso concluded that chiropractic manipulation for lowback pain was only marginally better than the minimalintervention of a simple education booklet.\" I believe that Dr. Chotkowski has successfully ap- proached and defined the chiropractic arena medically,legally, congressionally, and personally. A contrary review came from CCA president Brian Baker, DC: On behalf of the Connecticut Chiropractic Association I would like to respond to the book review of L.A.Chotkowski's self-published book, Chiropractic: The Greatest Hoax of the Century? , that was published in your November issue.134 Part III: My Own Investigations That your reviewer, C. Robert Biondino, gave this book a favorable review is baffling. Chotkowski's com-ments and sweeping condemnation of chiropractic arebased on nothing but (as Biondino acknowledges)\"newspaper articles, author research (three decades ofprimary practice), and anecdotes.\" Hardly sound, evi-denced based, science and research. The fact is Chotkowski has publicly made it his life's work to vilify chiropractic. That his book was self -pub-lished through New England Novelty Books aloneshould cast some light on his \"objectivity.\" What yourreviewer failed to do was disclose this bias and criti-cally evaluate Chotkowski's statements. Unfortunately Dr. Chotkowski steadfastly refuses to acknowledge published research favorable toward chi-ropractic. Two recent examples of research analysis arethe Agency for Health Care Policy research review ofstudies and support of spinal manipulation for low backpain, and the Ontario Ministry of Health's publishedreport reviewing Chiropractic research and literaturewith a final recommendation for increased utilizationof chiropractic in their health-care service. The chiropractic profession has taken its re- sponsibility continually to produce research andevidence seriously. It has only been recently that barriershave been overcome and increased governmentalfunding been provided. What is truly remarkable is the volume of research that the profession produced before having access to na-tional and governmental funding sources like NIH.Chotkowski and your reviewer appear oblivious to thisinformation. Chotkowski's opinion that \"The chiropractic profession has existed for a century without having madea single notable contribution to the world's body ofknowledge in the health sciences\" is as absurd as itsounds. When your reviewer writes \"Chotkowski hasChapter 14: Reactions to the First Edition of This Book 135 successfully approached and defined the chiropractic arena medically, legally, congressionally, and person-ally,\" he should have added that Chotkowski failed todo so credibly. The Connecticut Chiropractic Associationmakes efforts to reach out to the medical community toshare information on chiropractic procedure andpractice. When CSMS gives this type of book a forumand implied credibility, many of us ask: \"Why bother?\" My response to Baker was succinct and to the point as reported in Connecticut Medicine , as follows: Chiropractor Brian Baker, president of the Connecticut Chiropractic Association, writing in its behalf, in hisresponse to a review of my book by Dr. C. RobertBiondino, has erroneously stated that the book Chiro- practic: The Greatest Hoax of the Century? did not ac- knowledge the research findings on acute low back painby the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.The book contains an entire chapter devoted to thatsubject. In addition, the book goes one step further in con- taining personal communications from the chairman ofthat AHCPR panel Dr. Stanley Bigos, Professor of Or-thopedics and Environmental Health, University ofWashington Medical School, and a second letter from Dr. Paul Shekelle, chief investigator for the chiroprac-tic-funded Rand Corp. study on which the AHCPR find-ings were primarily based. Furthermore, the book reports the most recent find- ings that chiropractic spinal adjustments are of littlevalue in the treatment of low back pain. The basic thrust of the book remains unchallenged by chiropractor Baker. Despite the passage of over ahundred years, chiropractic has failed to prove its theoryof \"vertebral subluxations\" pressing on nerves causingdisease, or that spinal \"adjustments\" are effective treat-ment for any disease.136 Part III: My Own Investigations Chiropractor Baker has attempted to obfuscate the is- sue by accusing the author of the book of \"bias and lackof objectivity.\" The fact is that 27 medical college deanswho responded to my survey, unanimously agreed withme that the theory and practice of chiropractic was false.Scientific medical authorities like Dr. C. Everett Koop,former U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. George Lundberg,then-editor of the Journal of the AMA , Dr. Paul Dworkin, editor of the journal Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics , Dr. Arnold Relman, editor emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine , and a host of others, whose personal letters support my findings, are all inthe book. Finally, chiropractor Baker has failed in his review to indicate just what contribution chiropractic has madeto scientific health care over the past century. In essencehe has failed to negate the book's conclusion that chiro-practic has made none, and that the theory and practiceof chiropractic is a false hoax as documented. Louis Sportelli, DC, a major spokesman for chiroprac- tic, who claims his regular spinal \"adjustments\" have maintainedhis health for years, offered some additional choice remarks: I have read your book and find you to be beyond bias. You and your ilk are so out of touch with reality that you cannot realize the world has passed you by. Youassume that chiropractic is engaged in unscientific medi-cine and yet you remain silent as the epidemic of medi-cal errors runs rampant. You will see that the notion thatmedicine is scientific is becoming more ludicrous eachday. Look to your own \"glass house.\" My response: Medical \"bias\" and \"errors\" are two major de- fense themes frequently used by chiropractic, and Sportelli usesthem quite enthusiastically. It is medieval chiropractic that hasbeen passed by with modern medicine.Chapter 14: Reactions to the First Edition of This Book 137 More than 50 brief reviews of the book were posted to the Amazon and Barnes & Noble Web sites. Many of these re-vealed chiropractic's frustration over the book's challenge. Mostwere written by chiropractors or their true-believer patients. Hereare some excerpts: * * * The book makes a solid point that the basic theory ofchiropractic is utter nonsense. Despite a hundred yearsof existence, chiropractic has not demonstrated theexistence of the \"subluxation\" much less that it causesdisease (or \"dis-ease\") or that chiropractic methods canidentify such lesions and correct them. * * * Don't even bother to read this book. I purchased it be-fore going to a chiropractor and was scared stiff. * * * \"Scientific\" medicine is the third leading cause of deathin the US. Enough said. * * * More than identifying it as a hoax, a solution is offered!!. . . This philosophy is about as unproven as alien visitors. * * * Chiropractors usually are far superior to MD's!!! Thisbook is a farce and is representative of the closed-mindedness of too many MDs. * * * Excellent book. Public needs to be aware that chiroprac-tic is voodoo medicine. * * * A chiropractor saved me from back surgery. My daugh- ter had asthma for the first 11 years of her life. After acourse of chiropractic care, her symptoms went away.138 Part III: My Own Investigations * * * Anecdotal accounts do not determine what is true. * * * A beautiful art, falsely attacked again. Tears built up in my eyes. * * * Man who is on thin ice should jump. After reading thisbook I had to laugh. * * * Books like this show how ignorant the medical profes-sion is about chiropractic. * * * Sickening. The AMA propaganda against chiropractorsis alive and well. I feel inspired to write a book abouthow modern medicine is the most destructive force inour society and itself may be the most colossal hoax ofall time. * * * On the positive side, one reader stated, \"Dr. Chot- kowski's attempt should be applauded in light of the ever-grow-ing and unfortunate power of chiropractors.\" Another quipped,\"The emperor has no clothes (or subluxation).\" And anothersaid, \"Everyone should read this book before considering chi-ropractic treatment.\" The word \"cult\" has been criticized when applied to chiropractic, yet the language of my critics indicates levels ofbelief and devotion typical of cult members.Hoping to become better acquainted with the feelings of the chiropractic community on the \"philosophy\" of chiropractic, Iengaged in a dialogue-debate with chiropractors on various Websites on the Internet. * * * One of the first responses came gratuitously from DynamicChiropractic Online. Titled \"The War's Over, But MD Contin-ues the Fight,\" it stated: On March 10, 1974 on the island of Lubang in a remote part of the Philippine archipelago, Second LieutenantHiroo Oneda of the Japanese Imperial Army was or-dered to surrender by his commanding officer, MajorTaniguchi, after 30 years. Reminiscent of poor Hiro, although less dramatic, is L.A.Chotkowski, MD, who on August 26, 1997 sentthis memo to the \"scientific community.\" [As noted inChapter 13 of this book, the memo asked for opinionsabout the chiropractic theory of subluxations and ad-justments.] The responses to Dr. Chotkowski's appealcriticizing chiropractic were predictable. Had Dr. Chotkowski seriously considered Dr. David Eisenberg's most recent study of \"alternative medicine\"use in the U.S., he would have discovered that the num-ber of visits to \"alternative care providers\" in 1997 wasnearly double the number of visits to all \"primary carephysicians.\" Perhaps someone can get through to Dr.Chotkowski. The war is over. 13915 More Dialogue and Debate on the Internet140 Part III: My Own Investigations I responded: The war may be over but the question raised in my book remains unresolved for over a hundred years. The ques-tion not addressed by Dynamic is whether there is suchan entity as a vertebral subluxation causing disease? Fur-thermore, clear evidence is lacking anywhere that chi-ropractic can prevent, effectively treat, or cure any singledisease. It is clear from this exchange that chiropractic fears confrontation and expos\u00e9 and would like very much tobe accepted by the scientific community. As for the finding in the Eisenberg study that large numbers of people seek \"unscientific alternative care,\"this only corroborates the enormity of the chiropractichoax in my view. * * * Anthony Rosner, PhD, executive director of the Federation forChiropractic Education and Research, reviewed my book on hisorganization's Web site. His criticisms were referenced with along list of reports supposedly validating his views. However,nothing that he said refuted the book's basic thesis that sublux-ation theory is false. * * * Nearly every day for about about 5 months, on a chiropracticforum called Hot Topics, there were messages between chiro-practors and myself and between chiropractors and themselves,in perhaps one of the most remarkable medical doctor-chiropractic dialogues ever. I was originally welcomed, but af-ter I posed a list of embarrassing, challenging questions, thehost decided to limit participation to chiropractors only. Some of the most interesting posts came from chiro- practic students who questioned the validity of their theory andpractice and asked whether they were being misled into believ-ing they were prepared to deal with disease like \"real\" doctors.One former student reported:Chapter 15: More Dialogue and Debate on the Internet 141 Dr Chot. [my email name], I commend you for taking a stand on chiropractic! I started Chiro school not knowing what to expect. A couple of weeks into school I was recruited by a stu-dent to enter my college's student clinic. I was subjectedto full body X-rays when I wasn't experiencing anysymptoms. I was then given a sales pitch the intern hadmemorized that chiropractic could help my back \"prob-lem.\" My intern then treated me for a whole trimester. Irepeatedly told him I had absolutely no pain, yet he stilladjusted me anyway. He told me that he's recruited afew patients, but if he gets desperate, he'll recruit hissister and her husband. What did I learn in Chiro college? I learned that a vast majority of smart people can be easily duped bysuch a scam. I only wasted one trimester of my life andmoney there. I am currently applying to Med. school. Iwould rather take my chances of not getting into medi-cal school than to stay in a profession that is a lie. Posted by Future MD * * * The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) submitted a mes-sage on chiropractic education to this Hot Topics forum, whichstated, in part: Doctors of chiropractic (DCs), who are licensed to prac- tice in all 50 states and in many nations around the world,undergo rigorous education in the healing sciences, simi-lar to that of medical physicians. In some areas such asanatomy, physiology, rehabilitation, nutrition and pub-lic health, they receive more intensive education thantheir MD counterparts. However, several students posted messages stating that much of their time was spent listening to indoctrinating lectureson the \"philosophy\" of chiropractic. After 2 years or so of basicscience courses, most student time is spent in manipulating142 Part III: My Own Investigations spines in DC offices or clinics. At no time is there any exposure or training in a hospital diagnosing and treating medically illpeople, as medical doctors typically do for at least 6 years. Chi-ropractic students are required to perform a minimum numberof \"adjustments\" before graduation and often must resort to re-cruiting anyone for that purpose. The lack of adequate clinical exposure was ack- nowledged by a chiropractor who stated, \"Our schools do notpromote problem-based clinical exposure to real people withreal problems. Our clinical experience is all about numbers, notlearning.\" * * * In order to determine the attitude of practicing chiro- practors about the issue of \"subluxations,\" I posed the follow-ing challenging questions. \"What exactly is a subluxation, anddo you believe it exists?\" One of the first chiropractors to re-spond stated: \"Let's define subluxation. Choose a model components. Whether it be the five-component model (i.e.spinokinesiology, neuropathology, etc.) or the newer modelthree-phase (dysautonomia), just pick a model.\" A second defi-nition came from the ACA: By definition, subluxation is a slight dislocation or bio- mechanical malfunctioning of the vertebrae. Chiroprac-tors often refer to the misalignment of the vertebrae assubluxation. Doctors are trained to restore misalignedvertebrae to their proper position in the spinal cordthrough a procedure called \"spinal adjustment\" or\"manipulation.\" From a disbelieving chiropractor: \"Dr Chotkowski is right. I'll have plenty of referrals while you 'SUBLUXATIONREMOVERS' are out their brainwashing the public.\" Another chiropractor: \"Ah, the dreaded subluxation, the silent killer that we chiropractic missionaries are all on a worldwide quest to eliminate. Our philosophy regarding Subluxationsis seriously outdated and in many ways, ridiculous.\"Chapter 15: More Dialogue and Debate on the Internet 143 Still another: \"But as long as we pray to our Innate as god, this medical nazi will have plenty of fuel to keep his firegoing.\" From someone calling himself a critical thinker: \"You expect anyone on this board to answer a direct, unambigousquestion regarding the central tenet of chiropractic\u2014\u2014our veryreason for being? Don't hold your breath.\" From a chiropractor named \"Spinedoc\": \"Sorry fellow chiropractors, but it's time to hang up the chiropractic dogma ofsubluxation. We should not define our scope of practice as ma-nipulation, rather we should define our scope as managers ofsomatic dysfunction.\" And from an evidently very frustrated chiropractor: \"I have noticed several messages with the heading 'Chot for brains.'I know this is implying shit for brains and I think we shouldstop because we are giving shit a bad name.\" Objecting to this language, another chiropractor stated: I have read all the posts in this interesting debate brought about by Dr. Chot and am appalled by the conduct ofsome of the chiropractors. Yet I have not read oneunseemingly attack from him. Indeed throughout thisonslaught he has maintained his dignity and profession-alism by responding with class, substance, and not be-ing hijacked with emotion. He has presented a strong argument and is obviously very intelligent and well learned in medicine and sci-ence. Can you imagine Dr Chot being referenced in fu-ture texts on philosophy and history as the 'reconstruc-tor' of chiropractic. * * * There is no question that much dissension exists among chiropractors about \"subluxations.\" However, these mythicalentities are not likely to be abandoned\u2014for without them, chi-ropractic would lose its claim to being a \"separate and distinctprofession.\" On the related subject of \"adjustments,\" a Dr. P.pretty well summarized the dilemma. He posted:144 Part III: My Own Investigations What is an adjustment? I feel that delegates from the ACA and ICA and chiropractic college presidents shouldmeet once every year to evaluate new techniques. I haveseen weird techniques done by chiropractors. We needa strong leadership that can stand up and proclaim whatchiropractic is and what it is not. Physical therapists willone day be able to manipulate in all 50 states * * * The healthfraud discusslist, another forum in which I participate, held a similar debate about chiropractic. After muchdiscussion, I proposed a series of 10 satirical commandmentsfor chiropractic behavior. Thou shalt convince all patients to believe. Thou shalt praise all you do as natural, beneficial, and compassionate. Thou shalt condemn all medical science does as unnatu- ral, harmful, and selfish. Thou shalt accuse the pharmaceutical establishment of a scurrilous vendetta. Thou shalt declare all medical drugs as poisonous and to be avoided at all costs. Thou shalt sell supplementary vitamins, herbs, and min- erals as nutritional cure-alls. Thou shalt indoctrinate a and of immu- nization in children. Thou shalt accuse doctors of being lackeys of the AMA in a giant conspiracy against you, for their own self-ish economic greed. Thou shalt promote x-rays of the spine to demonstrate subluxations anywhere you desire them to be. Thou shalt brainwash all patients into believing your adjustments are vital to their health\u2014from the cradleto the grave. An acerbic reply came from an angry chiropractor: \"Thou art an asshole.\"Chapter 15: More Dialogue and Debate on the Internet 145 My not-so-nice reply: \"Any intelligent response chal- lenging the commandments is awaited, but it will surely be afreezing day in hell before that happens.\" * * * When the issue of chiropractic pediatrics was raised, I stated that treating a child with spinal manipulations for acuteasthma, ear infections, etc., was tantamount to child abuse. A study of the pediatric practice of 150 chiropractors in the Boston area was posted in this debate. The report had ap-peared in the Archives of Pediatrics , an American Medical As- sociation publication. The results were as follows: Respondents had an average 122 patient visits weekly, of which 13 (11%) were children and adolescents. Av-erage visit fees were $82 initial and $38 follow-up, and49% were covered by insurance. Seventy percent of therespondents recommended herbs and dietary supple-ments. For pediatric care, 30% reported recommendingchildhood immunizations. Presented with a hypotheti-cal 2 week old neonate with fever, 17% would treat thepatient themselves rather than immediately refer thepatient to a doctor of medicine or emergency facility. The report concluded that \"children and adolescents constitute a substantial number of patients in chiropractics. Anestimated 420,000 pediatric visits were made in the BostonMetropolitan area in 1998, costing approximately $14 million.Pediatric chiropractic care is often inconsistent with recom-mended guidelines. National studies are needed to assess safety,efficacy, and cost of chiropractic care for children.\" The journal's editor, Catherine D. DeAngelis, MD, com- mented that, \"When I contemplate a chiropractor treating a 2week-old neonate with fever, I get a gigantic backache.\" * * * The last contribution to this dialogue came fittingly from Walter I. Wardwell, PhD, professor emeritus of sociology,146 Part III: My Own Investigations University of Connecticut, and a leading chiropractic historian and proponent. In the \"DC Archives\" section of the chiroprac-tic Web site called Chiroweb, he commented on the lack of unityin chiropractic beliefs and practices: In this my final publication, I take the opportunity to strongly recommend to the chiropractic profession inAmerica that it do what has been proposed over most ofits history by many others, including most of the lead-ers of the profession. The disparate segments of the pro-fession should give up their minor differences and mergeinto one strong national association. Wake up and seethe light. Unite and begin to reap the benefits. * * * I have tried to choose significant excerpts from the hun- dreds of opinions about chiropractic posted to Internet newsgroups and Web sites. Most are direct quotations, but since theyare necessarily excerpts, their complete impact is sometimesdiminished. However, they clearly reflect the fact that chiro-practors cannot agree among themselves about the nature orsignificance of \"subluxations.\" Chiropractors also differ about their scope and treatment methods. Some limit their practice to manipulation of musclesand joints only for musculoskeletal conditions, whereas otherspurport to treat a wide variety of problems. Some stick withmanipulation and/or physical therapy techniques, whereas oth-ers dabble in dubious dietary supplements, homeopathy,herbology, acupuncture, and/or whatever else strikes their fancyor lines their pocketbooks. Overall, this dialogue-debate presented no plausible evi- dence that the chiropractic notions of \"subluxations\" and \"ad-justments\" and their associated practices are other than a hoax.Part IV Additional Perspectives Why People Go to Chiropractors The Chiropractic Antitrust SuitThe AHCPR GuidelineSome Notes on a Leading Chiropractic Textbook Complaints against Chiropractors Recent Studies on Tension Headaches, Low Back Pain, Asthma, and Colic Final CommentsDuring my medical practice, there was ample opportunity to observe why people visit chiropractors. One reason is the in-ability of standard medical care to cure or relieve all diseases.Many years ago, before polio was wiped out with medicalscience's vaccine, it was one of the major diseases that chiro-practors claimed to cure. They have also claimed to be able totreat multiple sclerosis. This is an ideal disease for making quackclaims because its natural course usually includes remissionsand exacerbations and any improvement could be attributed tospinal manipulation or whatever else a chiropractor wanted todo. The Spears Clinic, a now-defunct chiropractic hospital, usedto send me solicitations picturing how multiple sclerosis pa-tients entered the clinic in a wheelchair and walked out withgreat smiles. Another source of dissatisfaction with medical care is that it often requires taking medications that have adverse ef-fects. Those for high blood pressure, for example, can causeimpotence and interfere dramatically with patients' lifestyles.Even aspirin, perhaps the most commonly used drug of all, canhave undesirable side effects. It is not surprising that the prom-ise of drugless treatment is so appealing\u2014but potentially tragicin the long run. Many patients go to chiropractors because they fear sur- gery, particularly brain and heart surgery for which the fatalityrates are relatively high. Patients with a potentially fatal diseaselike cancer may seek an \"alternative\" to avoid the discomfort ofradiation or chemotherapy. Twisting the spine to allegedly 14916 Why People Go to Chiropractors150 Part IV: Additional Perspectives enhance the immune system might be a \"straw\" that a desper- ately ill patient may \"grasp.\" Another reason for resorting to chiropractic is a failure to understand the difference between scientific medicine andunscientific chiropractic. Although chiropractors have failed todemonstrate their alleged \"subluxations,\" many of them useweasel-worded descriptions to make themselves morebelievable. Chiropractors cleverly play the \"bash-the-American Medical Association and bash-the-doctor game\" by claimingthat doctors who criticize them are merely afraid of competi-tion. The federal judge who ruled in the chiropractic antitrustsuit against the AMA concluded that the AMA had attacked chi-ropractic in an attempt to protect the public and not for eco-nomic reasons (see Chapter 17). Yet economic ploys have cred-ibility to many people who distrust doctors or medical science. Despite the enormous amount of scientific progress in health matters, many people still have little knowledge of healthand disease and are unable to judge between proven factualhealth knowledge and phony claims. Many books promote allsorts of ludicrous claims made for various types of \"alterna-tive\" health care. There are books on miracle diets and miraclecures for just about every health problem known to medical sci-ence. People seeking help for a serious disease are often misledby false claims and promises. How else could the parents of achild with a neck tumor expos\u00e9d on the ABC-TV's \"20/20\" pro-gram feel that a chiropractor could cure the tumor by twistingthe child's neck? Even though this resulted in the child's pa-ralysis, the family returned for further neck manipulation. Highly Questionable Salesmanship Subluxation-based chiropractic is basically a belief system with \"principles\" that cannot be demonstrated by scientific means.Once a belief is implanted into the human mind, there is noneed for reason or proof. Chapter 16: Why People Go to Chiropractors 151 Many chiropractors sell themselves through newspaper advertisements, television infomercials, and lectures. For years,the AMA and the medical profession believed it was unethicalto advertise and that a doctor's reputation and professional skillsrather than advertising hype should be what counts. Now, itseems that everyone in the health care field advertises\u2014insur-ance companies, medical doctors, hospitals, health spas,naturopaths, chiropractors, and anyone related to health care.But chiropractors probably promote themselves more elaboratelythan any of the others. Chiropractic promises health care \"the natural way\" with \"adjustments\" and manipulations, without mentioning the harm-ful effects of these procedures. Just what this word \"natural\" issupposed to mean is not clear, particularly as related to chiro-practic. \"Natural\" is a buzzword, presumably for harmless, pris-tine, unpolluted, nonsynthetic health. This, by definition, pre-sumably excludes the use of medicines or surgery which, ac-cording to chiropractic, are dangerous. This type of advertisingcan discourage patients from seeking the benefits of modernmedicine. Some advertisements include nutrition and what are called diagnostic services. How a chiropractor can claim abilityto diagnose disease without any experience with or exposure todiseases in a general hospital goes unanswered. Medical doc-tors, by contrast, after intensive study of hundreds of diseasesfor 4 years, generally spend several more years of specialty train-ing in which they deal with patients, mainly at hospitals. Many chiropractors still claim to treat the \"cause\" of disease and criticize the medical profession for \"only treatingsymptoms.\" The exact opposite is actually the case. Chiroprac-tors basically treat pain, whatever the cause. The idea that \"sub-luxations\" cause disease has been debunked by medical science,as discussed in this book and elsewhere. While twisting backsand necks for more than 100 years, chiropractors have contrib-uted nothing to medical science.152 Part IV: Additional Perspectives For years, chiropractors have emphasized practice-build- ing. In the book At Your Own Risk, the author, Ralph Lee Smith, describes how the Parker School of Professional Services \"seemsto be nothing less than turning the entire chiropractic profes-sion into an army of smooth-talking, wheeling and dealing su-persalesmen, engaged in a gigantic con artist game.\" Smith at-tended one of its seminars posing as a chiropractor and joining200 others. He reported how chiropractors were taught how to(a) frighten patients away from medical doctors; (b) give freeconsultations; (c) concentrate on the spine as the cause of apatient's problems; (d) lather the patients with love; (e) empha-size their condition as chronic and requiring long-term care;and (f) build fear that the patient's condition could be serious,but that natural chiropractic can work wonders. Smith summedup the seminar's teaching's this way: Throughout the procedure the chiropractor tries to wean the patient away from established medical treatment\u2014permanently, if possible. \"A true chiropractic patient,\"says the Textbook , \"is one whose convictions with re- gard to health have been diverted from the muddy roadof medicine to the superhighway of chiropractic by aseries of correlated mental concepts, positively im-planted in proper order.\" Part of the fear strategy is to emphasize dangers of drug side effects and surgery as opposed to \"natural healing\" mea-sures supposedly provided by adjustments. Of course, somepeople go to chiropractors because they \"just don't like doctors.\" Chiropractors are licensed. The public tends to regard licensing as evidence of legitimacy, but chiropractic licensingwas accomplished by persistent lobbying rather than by proofof validity. Medicines must pass strict Food and Drug Adminis-tration standards for safety and effectiveness before approval.On the other hand, chiropractic licensure was based on politicalrather than scientific activity. Chiropractors advertise that their services are covered by insurance companies and Medicare. Many states require Chapter 16: Why People Go to Chiropractors 153 insurance companies to carry some form of chiropractic cover- age. The 1972 Medicare law authorized payment only in casesin which a \"subluxation\" was supposedly demonstrated by x-ray. Since chiropractic \"subluxations\" are not actually visibleon x-ray films, this should have prevented Medicare paymentsto chiropractors. However, this requirement was not strictly en-forced and was abolished on January 1, 2000, after it becameapparent that it was senseless. Some chiropractors make claims through patient testi- monials. I have seen long lines of patients testifying at legisla-tive hearings in Connecticut about the alleged benefits they havereceived from chiropractic \"adjustments.\" Although this typeof evidence is very effective when used politically, it is not sci-entific proof. Chiropractic has relied on this type of evidence,either anecdotal or in outcome studies, rather than on any basicscientific research into the nature of \"subluxations\" and \"ad-justments.\" Chiropractic advertises that it \"helps children develop into healthy adults.\" Parents are being advised to consider achiropractor even before the child is born. A chiropractic publi-cation called Spinal Column contains a full-page spread titled \"Chiropractic Care: A Total Wellness Plan for the Whole Fam-ily,\" which states: One of the first subluxations experienced is during the birth process. As the child grows and becomes moreactive, he can experience spinal misalignments fromnormal play activities and falls. It is important to haveyour child's spine checked on a regular basis. This willhelp insure proper development and the best possiblehealth. In contrast, Ronald Slaughter, DC, president of the Na- tional Association for Chiropractic Medicine, warns that no childyounger than 12 years should ever be taken to a chiropractorunless recommended by a pediatrician because children's bonestructures are still developing and manipulation can causedamage.154 Part IV: Additional Perspectives Here in Connecticut, a television infomercial showed a chiropractor manipulating the back of a newborn and stating,\"As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.\" Parker ProfessionalProducts, one of the largest practice-building suppliers, sells aposter with the same message, as shown below. A chiropractor from California who characterizes him- self as a \"holistic chiropractor\" has written a book called A Ten Minute Cure for the Common Cold , which is packaged with an instructional video and sells for $59.95. An ad for the book callshis method a new-age scientific breakthrough based on 10 yearsof research into \"nature's secrets.\" According to the ad, the se-cret for curing the common cold is mechanical finger pressureor light-thrust stimulation of the \"bladder meridian energy point\"that parallels the spinal column. Poster from a recent Parker Professional Products catalog. Chapter 16: Why People Go to Chiropractors 155 Such quasi-scientific terms might fool a medically ig- norant public, but the claims should be regarded as flat-outquackery. No cure for the common cold is known to science.Some studies have found some benefit from an antiviral agentsprayed into the nose for certain cold viruses, and a few drugshave been found partially effective in treating influenza, an-other viral disease. The chiropractic profession has contributednothing to the scientific management of respiratory infections. Some chiropractic practice-builders advocate suggest- ing to patients that they are better but need lifetime periodicadjustments of their spine to maintain their health. Many pa-tients can be persuaded to return for visits to chiropractors weekafter week because people who feel better tend to believe what-ever explanation they receive from the person who treats them. Chiropractors would like you to believe that what Smith described in his book is outdated and that very few chiroprac-tors engage in the type of \"brainwashing\" he described. TheParker Seminars\u2014which are still going strong and typically drawlarge audiences\u2014provide detailed instructions for persuadingpatients to tell others to try chiropractic care for virtually everyhealth problem they have. Parker Professional Products, whichhas been supplying chiropractors since 1951, offers a plethoraof practice-building that \"helps parents and the inadequacies ofantibiotic therapy\"] \"Ear Infections\" [flier to enable parents result in lowered resistance\"] \"Pregnancy\" [flier about \"the importance of chiroprac- tic care throughout pregnancy, and for the newborn\"] \"Subluxations Are Often Present in Pain, Sickness, Death.

Each year, therehas been a chiropractic exhibit. At this year's exhibit, fairgoerswaited in long lines to be tested with a Spinal Analysis Machine(S.A.M.), the twin-scale device pictured on page 157. The per-son to be tested stands with one foot on the platform of eachscale. In most cases, the person's weight is unequally distrib-uted so that one platform is higher than the other and the bodytilts in the other direction. The chiropractor then indicates thatone shoulder is higher than the other and levels the shouldersaccording to parallel lines on the device. This causes the spineto curve, and a red \"X\" is diagrammed at the midcurve, suppos-edly indicating the location of a \"vertebral subluxation\" thatpresses on a nerve and can cause various health problems. The chiropractor's booth included posters about \"pinched nerves\" and \"chiropractic health maintenance.\" An-other poster asked whether the patient suffered from asthma,depression, poor circulation, shortness of breath, ear infections,growing pains, low immunity, \"children's disorders,\" or about20 other problems and suggested that chiropractic could helpthem all. Chapter 16: Why People Go to Chiropractors 157 The exhibit also displayed literature claiming, \"Chiropractic care provides better communication with nervesystems to every cell, tissue,and organ in the body\" andthat chiropractic provides\"better sleep, clearer think-ing, a healthier people.\" Onebrochure described how agroup of chiropractors set upadjusting tables on the side-walks of New York City tooffer spinal adjustments torescue workers on the dayafter the World Trade Centertragedy. Another brochureoffered a \"no-charge specialoffer visit, do-nation to the Center.\" The visit,said to have normal valueof $225, aconsultation neurologic, examinations; if needed; a doctor'sreport of findings. S.A.M.'s manufacturer claims that 85% of people have \"apparent differences\" in leg length and suggests that use of theS.A.M. device can attract 20 to 40 new patients per week. Themore likely explanation is that such \"differences\" are caused byslight variations of hip position or of normal spinal muscle ten-sion. It is safe to assume that most of the people who are exam-ined with the device are told they need further evaluation andthat the \"special-offer first visit\" ends with a recommendationfor months or even years of \"treatment.\" All in all, the boothstruck me as the modern equivalent of the 19th century snake-oil salesman. Spinal Analysis Machine at chiropractic exhibit.158 Part IV: Additional Perspectives Limits are Needed Most people who consult chiropractors do so for low back pain. The fact that chiropractic thrusts produce \"popping\" soundsduring spinal manipulation may impress patients that somethinghighly therapeutic is taking place. Chiropractors have furtheredtheir stature and patient confidence by having acquired the nameof \"doctor\" and \"physician,\" an accepted professional badge ofintegrity and trust. Although appropriate spinal manipulationmay relieve symptoms in some cases, you should know thatmost cases of back pain resolve within a few weeks or monthswithout treatment. You should also know that a substantial per-centage of chiropractors will attempt to persuade everyone whoconsults them to return for periodic check-ups and \"adjustments\"throughout life. Yet no study has ever demonstrated that so-called\"preventative maintenance\" has any value for people who haveno symptoms. In recent years, with the rise of managed care, insur- ance companies are increasingly demanding that coverage berestricted to methods that have been proven cost-effective. Ifmanaged care companies require medical approval before chi-ropractic services are covered, chiropractic utilization will de-crease sharply. Organized chiropractic has responded to this byinsisting that chiropractors are qualified to practice indepen-dently and that they should be considered primary care provid-ers. Many chiropractors state that they refer cases to medicaldoctors when needed and that they have sufficient diagnostictraining to do so. However, because most common health prob-lems lie outside of their scientifically supportable scope, seeingsuch patients would add unnecessary expense and delay appro-priate care, even if proper referral takes place. So far, at least, it seems that the chiropractic desire to be considered \"primary care providers\" has met with little success,but they are still generally permitted to see patients without medi-cal referral.In 1976, Chester A. Wilk, DC, and several other chiropractors began a series of lawsuits against the American Medical Asso-ciation (AMA), other professional organizations, and severalindividual critics, charging that they had conspired to destroychiropractic and to illegally deprive chiropractors of access tolaboratory, x-ray, and hospital facilities. Most of the defendantgroups agreed in out-of-court settlements that their physicianmembers were free to decide for themselves how to deal withchiropractors. The main case against the AMA was first heard by a jury that decided in favor of the AMA, which, during the 1960s,had labeled chiropractic a \"unscientific cult.\" A retrial, how-ever, was allowed after an appeals court ruled that the originaljudge had improperly instructed the jury. A second trial washeld before U.S. District Judge Susan Getzendanner. In 1987,Judge Getzendanner concluded that the AMA had engaged inan illegal boycott, and she issued an injunction forbidding cer-tain things the organization had done. The judge's decision wasappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear thecase and let it stand. Many chiropractors trumpet the judge's ruling as an en- dorsement of what they do. However, it was not. The case wasdecided on narrow legal grounds (restraint of trade) and wasnot an evaluation of chiropractic methods. In fact, the full textof the judge's decision noted that during the 1960s, \"there was alot of material available to the AMA Committee on Quackerythat supported its belief that all chiropractic was unscientificand deleterious.\" The judge also noted that chiropractors still 15917 The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit160 Part IV: Additional Perspectives took too many x-rays. She concluded that the dominant reason for the AMA's antichiropractic campaign was the belief thatchiropractic was not in the best interest of patients. But she ruledthat this did not justify attempting to contain and eliminate anentire licensed profession without first demonstrating that a less-restrictive campaign could not succeed in protecting the public. To provide further information, here are two documents pertaining to this case. The first is the full text of the judge'spermanent injunction order. (I have italicized sentences I be-lieve are especially important.) The second is a brief commenton the case from the head of the AMA's law department. Text of court order in Wilk v. AMA In the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division Chester A. Wilk, et al., plaintiffs, v. American Medical Association, et al., defendants Permanent injunction order against AMASusan Getzendanner, District Judge The court conducted a lengthy trial of this case in May and June of 1987 and on August 27, 1987, issued a 101page opinion finding that the American Medical Asso-ciation (AMA) and its members participated in a con-spiracy against chiropractors in violation of the nation'santitrust laws. Thereafter, an opinion dated September25, 1987, was substituted for the August 27, 1987, opin-ion. The question now before the court is the form ofinjunctive relief that the court will order. As part of the injunctive relief to be ordered by the court against the AMA, the AMA shall be required tosend a copy of this Permanent Injunction Order to eachof its current members. The members of the AMA arebound by the terms of the Permanent Injunction Orderif they act in concert with the AMA to violate the termsof the order. Accordingly, it is important that the AMAmembers understand the order and the reasons why theorder has been entered. Chapter 17: The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit 161 The AMA's boycott and conspiracy In the early 1960s, the AMA decided to contain and eliminate chiropractic as a profession. In 1963 theAMA's Committee on Quackery was formed. The com-mittee worked aggressively \u2014 both overtly and covertly\u2014 to eliminate chiropractic. One of the principal meansused by the AMA to achieve its goal was to make itunethical for medical physicians to professionally asso-ciate with chiropractors. Under Principle 3 of the AMA'sPrinciples of Medical Ethics, it was unethical for a phy-sician to associate with an \"unscientific practitioner,\"and in 1966, the AMA's House of Delegates passed aresolution calling chiropractic an unscientific cult. Tocomplete the circle, in 1967 the AMA's Judicial Coun-cil issued an opinion under Principle 3 holding that itwas unethical for a physician to associate profession-ally with chiropractors. The AMA's purpose was to prevent medical physi- cians from referring patients to chiropractors and ac-cepting referrals of patients from chiropractors, to pre-vent chiropractors from obtaining access to hospital di-agnostic services and membership on hospital medicalstaffs, to prevent medical physicians from teaching atchiropractic colleges or engaging in any joint research,and to prevent any cooperation between the two groupsin the delivery of health care services. The AMA believed that the boycott worked\u2014that chiropractic would have achieved greater gains in theabsence of the boycott. Since no medical physicianwould want to be considered unethical by his peers, thesuccess of the boycott is not surprising. However, chi-ropractic achieved licensing in all 50 states during theexistence of the Committee on Quackery. The Committee on Quackery was disbanded in 1975 and some of the committee's activities became publiclyknown. Several lawsuits were filed by or on behalf ofchiropractors and this case was filed in 1976.162 Part IV: Additional Perspectives Change in AMA position on chiropractic In 1977, the AMA began to change its position on chi- ropractic. The AMA's Judicial Council adopted newopinions under which medical physicians could referpatients to chiropractors, but there was still the provisothat the medical physician should be confident that theservices to be provided on referral would be performedin accordance with accepted scientific standards. In1979, the AMA's House of Delegates adopted ReportUU which said that not everything that a chiropractormay do is without therapeutic value, but it stopped shortof saying that such things were based on scientific stan-dards. It was not until 1980 that the AMA revised itsPrinciples of Medical Ethics to eliminate Principle 3.Until Principle 3 was formally eliminated, there was con-siderable ambiguity about the AMA's position. The eth-ics code adopted in 1980 provided that a medical physi-cian \"shall be free to choose whom to serve, with whomto associate, and the environment in which to providemedical services.\" The AMA settled three chiropractic lawsuits by stipulating and agreeing that under the current opinionsof the Judicial Council a physician may, without fear ofdiscipline or sanction by the AMA, refer a patient to aduly licensed chiropractor when he believes that refer-ral may benefit the patient. The AMA confirmed that aphysician may also choose to accept or to decline pa-tients sent to him by a duly licensed chiropractor. Fi-nally, the AMA confirmed that a physician may teach ata chiropractic college or seminar. These settlements wereentered into in 1978, 1980, and 1986. The AMA's present position on chiropractic, as stated to the court, is that it is ethical for a medicalphysician to professionally associate with chiropractorsprovided the physician believes that such association isin the best interests of his patient. This position has not Chapter 17: The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit 163 previously been communicated by the AMA to its members. Antitrust laws Under the Sherman Act, every combination or con- spiracy in restraint of trade is illegal. The court has heldthat the conduct of the AMA and its members consti-tuted a conspiracy in restraint of trade based on the fol-lowing facts: the purpose of the boycott was to elimi-nate chiropractic; chiropractors are in competition withsome medical physicians; the boycott had substantialanti-competitive effects; there were no pro-competitiveeffects of the boycott; and the plaintiffs were injured asa result of the conduct. These facts add up to a violationof the Sherman Act. In this case, however, the court allowed the defen- dants the opportunity to establish a \"patient care defense\"which has the following elements: (1) that they genu-inely entertained a concern for what they perceive asscientific method in the care of each person with whomthey have entered into a doctor-patient relationship; (2)that this concern is objectively reasonable; (3) that thisconcern has been the dominant motivating factor in thedefendants' promulgation of Principle 3 and in the con-duct intended to implement it; and (4) that this concernfor scientific method in patient care could not have beenadequately satisfied in a manner less restrictive of com-petition. The court concluded that the AMA had a genuine concern for scientific methods in patient care, and thatthis concern was the dominant factor motivating theAMA's conduct. However, the AMA failed to establishthat throughout the entire period of the boycott, from1966 to 1980, this concern was objectively reasonable.The court reached that conclusion on the basis of exten-sive testimony from both witnesses for the plaintiffs and164 Part IV: Additional Perspectives the AMA that some forms of chiropractic treatment are effective and the fact that the AMA recognized that chi-ropractic began to change in the early 1970s. Since theboycott was not formally over until Principle 3 waseliminated in 1980, the court found that the AMA wasunable to establish that during the entire period of theconspiracy its position was objectively reasonable. Fi-nally, the court ruled that the AMA's concern for scien-tific method in patient care could have been adequatelysatisfied in a manner less restrictive of competition andthat a nationwide conspiracy to eliminate a licensed pro- fession was not justified by the concern for scientificmethod. On the basis of these findings, the court con-cluded that the AMA had failed to establish the patientcare defense. None of the court' s findings constituted a judicial endorsement of chiropractic. All of the parties to thecase, including the plaintiffs and the AMA, agreed thatchiropractic treatment of diseases such as diabetes, highblood pressure, cancer, heart disease and infectious dis-ease is not proper, and that the historic theory of chiro-practic, that there is a single cause and cure of disease,was wrong. There was disagreement between the par- ties as to whether chiropractors should engage in diag-nosis. There was evidence that the chiropractic theory of subluxations was unscientific, and evidence that somechiropractors engaged in unscientific practices. The court did not reach the question of whether chiropractictheory was in fact scientific. However, the evidence inthe case was that some forms of chiropractic manipula-tion of the spine and joints was therapeutic. AMA wit-nesses, including the present Chairman of the Board ofTrustees of the AMA, testified that some forms of treat- ment by chiropractors, including manipulation, can betherapeutic in the treatment of conditions such as backpain syndrome. Chapter 17: The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit 165 Need for injunctive relief Although the conspiracy ended in 1980, there are lin- gering effects of the illegal boycott and conspiracy whichrequire an injunction. Some medical physicians' indi-vidual decisions on whether or not to professionally as-sociate with a chiropractor are still affected by the boy-cott. The injury to chiropractors' reputations which re-sulted from the boycott has not been repaired. Chiro-practors suffer current economic injury as a result ofthe boycott. The AMA has never affirmatively acknowl-edged that there are and should be no collective impedi-ments to professional association and cooperation be-tween chiropractors and medical physicians, except asprovided by law. Instead, the AMA has consistently ar-gued that its conduct has not violated the antitrust laws. Most importantly, the court believes that it is im- portant that the AMA members be made aware of thepresent AMA position that it is ethical for a medicalphysician to be professionally associated with a chiro-practor if the physician believes it is in the best interestof his patient, so that the lingering effects of the illegalgroup boycott against chiropractors finally can be dis-sipated. Under the law, every medical physician, institution, and hospital has the right to make an individual deci-sion as to whether or not that physician, institution, orhospital shall associate professionally with chiroprac-tors. Individual choice by a medical physician volun-tarily to associate professionally with chiropractorsshould be governed only by restrictions under state law,if any, and by the individual medical physician's per-sonal judgment as to what is in the best interest of apatient or patients. Professional association includesreferrals, consultations, group practice in partnerships,Health Maintenance Organizations, Preferred Provider166 Part IV: Additional Perspectives Organizations, and other alternative health care deliv- ery systems; the provision of treatment privileges anddiagnostic services (including radiological and otherlaboratory facilities) in or through hospital facilities;association and cooperation in education programs forstudents in chiropractic colleges; and cooperation in re-search, health care seminars, and continuing educationprograms. An injunction is necessary to assure that the AMA does not interfere with the right of a physician, hospitalor other institution to make an individual decision onthe question of professional association. Form of injunction 1. The AMA, its officers, agents and employees, and all persons who act in active concert with any of themand who receive actual notice of this order are herebypermanently enjoined from restricting, regulating or im-peding, or aiding and abetting others from restriction,regulating or impeding, the freedom of any AMA mem-ber or any institution or hospital to make an individualdecision as to whether or not that AMA member, insti-tution, or hospital shall professionally associate with chi-ropractors, chiropractic students, or chiropractic insti-tutions. 2. The Permanent Injunction does not and shall not be construed to restrict or otherwise interfere with theAMA' s right to take positions on any issue, includingchiropractic, and to express or publicize those positions,either alone or in conjunction with others. Nor does this Permanent Injunction restrict or otherwise interfere withthe AMA's right to petition or testify before any publicbody on any legislative or regulatory measure or to joinor cooperate with any other entity in so petitioning ortestifying. The AMA's membership in a recognized ac- Chapter 17: The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit 167 crediting association or society shall not constitute a violation of this Permanent Injunction. 3. The AMA is directed to send a copy of this order to each AMA member and employee, first class mail,postage prepaid, within thirty days of the entry of thisorder. In the alternative, the AMA shall provide the Clerkof the Court with mailing labels so that the court maysend this order to AMA members and employees. 4. The AMA shall cause the publication of this or- der in JAMA and the indexing of the order under \"Chi- ropractic\" so that persons desiring to find the order inthe future will be able to do so. 5. The AMA shall prepare a statement of the AMA's present position on chiropractic for inclusion in the cur-rent reports and opinions of the Judicial Council withan appropriate heading that refers to professional asso-ciation between medical physicians and chiropractors,and indexed in the same manner that other reports andopinions are indexed. The court imposes no restrictionson the AMA's statement but only requires that it be con-sistent with the AMA's statement of its present positionto the court. 6. The AMA shall file a report with the court evidencing compliance with this order on or beforeJanuary 10, 1988. It is so ordered. Susan GetzendannerUnited States District JudgeSeptember 27, 1987 The AMA complied by publishing the judge's decision accompanied by the following statement by the AMA generalcounsel: In the Wilk case, several chiropractors alleged that the AMA's former ethical guidelines violated the fed-168 Part IV: Additional Perspectives eral antitrust laws. The AMA defended the case on the ground that our positions on chiropractic were based ona genuine concern for patients\u2014not on a desire for eco-nomic gain. District Judge Susan Getzendanner agreed.She found that the AMA had a genuine concern for sci-entific methods in patient care and that this concern wasthe dominant factor in motivating the AMA's conduct.Judge Getzendanner also found that the AMA's ethicalguidelines have complied with the antitrust laws since1980. Nevertheless, she concluded that an injunction wasproper because old AMA statements on chiropracticmight continue to have \"lingering effects\" injurious tochiropractors. Accordingly, she required the AMA topublish the order reproduced below. The Court of Ap-peals affirmed her decision. The AMA's current position on chiropractic is clear. Paragraph 3.08 of the Current Opinions of the Councilon Ethical and Judicial Affairs states that, \"It is ethicalfor a physician to associate professionally with chiro-practors provided that the physician believes that suchassociation is in the best interests of his or her patient.\"In other words, each physician is free to make an indi-vidual decision whether and under what conditions tomake or accept referrals, to teach in chiropractic schools,or otherwise to associate with chiropractors. By the same token, neither professional ethics, the law, nor the court's injunction requires any physician to associate with or make referrals to chiropractors. Indeed,Judge Getzendanner declined, in her words, \"to force amarriage\" between medicine and chiropractic. More-over, she refused to order changes in the JointCommission's standards concerning the governance ofhospital medical staffs. She concluded that \"patient carein acute care hospitals ought to be under the control offully licensed physicians rather than limited licensedpractitioners.\" Finally, nothing in the court's injunction restrains the AMA or any state or local medical society Chapter 17: The Chiropractic Antitrust Suit 169 from speaking out on any health care practice or issue, including chiropractic. As noted above, this publication of the court's 1987 order ends the Wilk litigation. The AMA is pleased that this litigation has finally been concluded. Although chiropractors hailed the antitrust suit verdict as an endorsement of chiropractic, it was not. The judge's ver-dict merely banned medical organizations from ordering theirmembers not to professionally associate with chiropractors. (In-dividual doctors could still decide for themselves whether suchassociation would serve the interests of their patients.) On the other hand, the court made some rather damag- ing findings regarding chiropractic in the statement that \"all ofthe parties to the case . . . agreed that chiropractic treatment ofdiseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, heart dis-ease and infectious disease is not proper, and that the historictheory of chiropractic, that there is a single cause and cure of adisease is wrong.\" The report mentioned, as noted previously,\"there was evidence that the chiropractic theory of subluxationwas unscientific, and evidence that some chiropractors engagein unscientific practices.\" Further, Judge Getzendanner con-cluded that \"patient care in acute care hospitals ought to be un-der the care of fully licensed physicians rather than limited li-censed practitioners.\" Finally, the court concluded that the AMAhad a genuine concern for scientific methods in patient care andthat this concern was a dominant factor motivating the AMA'sconduct. In this regard, the AMA or any state or local medicalsociety was free to speak out on any health care practice or issue,including chiropractic. It is unfortunate that the Wilk v. AMA decision was based only on antitrust considerations. It would have been much moremeaningful if the deciding factor had been whether the AMAhad been correct in labeling subluxation-based chiropractic asan unscientific cult.In December 1994, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Re- search (AHCPR), an agency of the U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services, issued a booklet of guidelines for detect-ing and managing various types of acute low back pain in peopleage 18 and older [1]. The panel defined back problems as \"ac-tivity intolerance due to back-related symptoms\" and acute as\"limitations of less than three months duration.\" The recom-mended guidelines were based mostly on a review of the scien-tific literature. The 23-member expert panel included 11 medical doc- tors, two chiropractors (including Scott Haldeman, DC, MD,PhD), two osteopathic physicians, a psychologist, a nurse, aphysical therapist, a minister, and others. The guidelines focused on how to help patients improve their activity tolerance when impaired by uncomplicated backpain or back-related leg pain (sciatica). By uncomplicated con-dition, the panel meant that there was no serious underlyingproblem, such as a spinal tumor, infection, fracture, or indica-tion that a nerve was in danger of being crushed by nearby struc-tures. The panel concluded: Once the clinician has ruled out red flags and nonspinal pathology, the symptoms can be categorized as eithersciatica or nonspecific back pain. In the absence of redflags, neither routine nor special testing is required inthe first month of symptoms for either category. Mostof these patients will recover spontaneously from theirlimitation of activities within one month. 17118 The AHCPR Guideline172 Part IV: Additional Perspectives The treatments that were analyzed included bed rest, various painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents(NSAIDS), heat, cold, exercise, lifts, corsets, diathermy, belts, trac-tion, steroidal facet injections, acupuncture, and spinal manipu-lation. Page iii of the panel's 172-page report summarized itsfindings: Findings and recommendations on the assessment and treatment of adults with acute low back pain problems\u2014 activity limitations due to symptoms in the low backand/or back-related leg symptoms of less than 3 months'duration \u2014 are presented in this clinical practice guide-line. The following are the principal conclusions of thisguideline: The initial assessment of patients with acute low back problems focuses on the detection of \"red flags\" (indi-cators of potentially serious spinal pathology or othernonspinal pathology). In the absence of red flags, imaging studies and further testing of patients are not usually helpful during the first4 weeks of low back symptoms. Relief of discomfort can be accomplished most safely with nonprescription medication and/or spinal manipu-lation. While some activity modification may be necessary during the acute phase, bed rest for more than 4 days isnot helpful and may further debilitate the patient. Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started in the first 2 weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation;exercises to condition trunk muscles are commonly de-layed at least 2 weeks. Patients recovering from acute low back problems are encouraged to return to work or their normal daily ac-tivities as soon as possible. If low back symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated. Chapter 18: The AHCPR Guideline 173 Patients with sciatica may recover more slowly, but fur- ther evaluation can also be safely delayed. Within the first 3 months of low back symptoms, only patients with evidence of serious spinal pathology orsevere, debilitating symptoms of sciatica, and physi-ologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise cor-roborated on imaging studies can be expected to benefitfrom surgery. With or without surgery, 80 percent of patients with sci- atica recover eventually. Nonphysical factors (such as psychological or socioeco- nomic problems) may be addressed in the context ofdiscussing reasonable expectations for recovery. The major interest to chiropractors was the statement about spinal manipulation, which they hailed as an endorsementof chiropractic. However, it was not. It merely supports the useof manipulation in carefully selected patients. Only a few of theresearch studies on which its conclusions were based involvedmanipulation by chiropractors; most were done by medical doc-tors and physical therapists whose practices are not identical tothose of chiropractors. The word chiropractic does not even ap-pear in the body of the report. Moreover, Dr. Stephen Barrett,who is the leading medical authority on the chiropractic mar-ketplace, has noted that the research studies do not reflect whatoften happens in practice outside of research settings: Most chiropractors manipulate the vast majority of pa- tients who walk through their door, some use techniquesthat have not been studied scientifically, and many urgeall of their patients to undergo monthly or even weekly\"preventive maintenance\" visits throughout their life.In addition, many chiropractors emphasize a techniquethat is more vigorous (and therefore less safe) than thecontrolled manipulation used by other practitioners [2]. The panel's evaluation of the effectiveness of manipu- lation was based primarily on a meta-analysis that was174 Part IV: Additional Perspectives summarized in the October 1992 issue of the Annals of Inter- nal Medicine [3]. This study, conducted by the Rand Corpora- tion, was funded by a $1 million grant from the California Chi-ropractic Foundation. Some 112 articles were reviewed by theagency. Only 13 were found acceptable; among them, 9 werereported by Paul Shekelle, MD, who headed the project. Thetwo studies that he believed were most significant found,strangely, that spinal manipulation was effective only betweenthe 14th and 28th days from the onset of pain. The explanationfor this finding raises serious questions and casts doubt on thestatistical validity of the studies. A subsequent study conducted in Helsinki, Finland, and reported in the New England Journal of Medicine [4] casts doubt on the value of stretching the back structures during this heal-ing period. The Helsinki report subjected patients with low backpain to a program of bending to either side, and backwards andforwards to tolerance of pain, 10 times every hour during theday and then comparing the recovery times with those of a con-trol group encouraged to go about their usual activities of dailyliving to tolerance. The patients who engaged in back stretch-ing and twisting took longer to recover than the controls did,which suggests that undue back motion, including spinal ma-nipulation, can delay recovery. From these additional studies,the best treatment for ordinary acute low back pain can be sum-marized as, \"Leave the back alone and in 4 weeks it will behealed. If healing does not occur, search for other trouble\u2014ared flag like a ruptured disk or spinal tumor.\" References 1. Bigos S and others.

New England Journal of Medicine 332:351-355, 1995.Following my visit to New York Chiropractic College, Louis Sportelli, DC, a leading spokesperson for his profession, sentme literature and the second edition of Principles and Practice of Chiropractic, which is considered one of chiropractic's most comprehensive and authoritative textbooks. Published in 1992by Appleton & Lange, the book was edited by Scott Haldeman,DC, MD, PhD, a third-generation chiropractor who is associateclinical professor of neurology at the University of California-Irvine and also an adjunct professor at Los Angeles Chiroprac-tic College. The book has four sections: \"History, Philosophy and Sociology of Chiropractic,\" Analysis and Diagnostic Methods,\" and\"Chiropractic Care.\" The section on history, philosophy, and sociology of chiropractic constitutes about 10% of the book's pages and 20%of its chapters. Noting that it is unusual for a professional text-book to devote so much space to such topics, Haldeman addsthat \"these topics are likely to remain an intricate part of everychiropractic student's education.\" The section traces chiro-practic's origin to the case of Harvey Lillard, a supposedly deafjanitor who on September 8, 1895, was allegedly cured of hisdeafness when Daniel David Palmer, an Iowa grocer-turned-magnetic-healer, administered the first chiropractic thrust onLillard's back and became the \"Father of Chiropractic.\" Thebook relates the trials and tribulations of chiropractors and theirtheory, including Palmer's jailing for 15 days for practicing medi-cine without a license. After describing key developments up to 17519 Some Notes on a Leading Chiropractic Textbook176 Part IV: Additional Perspectives the time the book was published, one chapter author (a former chiropractic college president) concludes: \"The extent to whichchiropractic has been, or is, a cult would be an interesting re-search topic.\" The second section addresses the basis of chiropractic itself in a potpourri of correctly described anatomical featuresof the spine, but without demonstrating a rational model of sub-luxation theory. It describes the effects of nerve compressionbut does not specify what compresses the nerve or how thiscould be related to disease. No description of an anatomical\"subluxation\" amenable to manipulation occurs in the entirebook. Yet a chapter is written on how spinal lesions could theo-retically affect visceral organs by \"smooth visceral reflex\" andhow these diseased organs can be relieved by manipulations.The chapter also mentions experiments in which beta-endor-phins, the body's own opiate-like hormones, increase after ma-nipulation. Even if this is true, endorphins should then also beincreased from manipulation of a foot or any part of the body.At most, endorphins may temporarily relieve pain. Like mor-phine, they heal nothing. The third section describes spinal analysis and diagnos- tic methods. A few pages cover history-taking and physical ex-amination as done by medical doctors. However, since mostchiropractors know little about disease, how to recognize it, andhow to treat it, these diagnostic procedures would seem to havelittle or no practical purpose. Many pages are devoted to meth-ods of physical examination and instrument-testing that are nottaught in medical schools. One piece of laboratory apparatus described in the book is a spirometer. Its use is correctly described as a simple testthat quickly measures the breathing capacity of patients withasthma and other respiratory diseases. However, there is no sci-entific evidence that spinal manipulation is effective againstasthma. Medical science, on the other hand, has made greatstrides in discovering factors that trigger asthmatic attacks, suchas allergies to dust mites and various foods. As the factorsChapter 19: Notes on a Leading Chiropractic Textbook 177 involved in asthmatic attacks have become clear, effective drugs have been developed based on an understanding of the mecha-nisms involved. In contrast to hypothetical chiropractic proce-dures, medical science has revealed the true nature of asthmaand has produced effective treatments. In comparison, chiro-practic has discovered nothing and knows little of the basics\u2014yet uses spirometry and spinal manipulations nevertheless. During the past 100 years, medical doctors have made tremendous strides in the diagnosis of thousands of diseasesand their causes, as evidenced in standard medical texts andjournals. The paucity of information in Haldeman's book pro-vides no reason to rely on chiropractors for diagnosis. The fourth section of the textbook deals with chiroprac- tic care. My overall impression from reading what it says aboutchiropractic's manipulative maneuvers is that their effects areentirely hypothetical. Chiropractors don't seem to know whatis being manipulated and what occurs as a result. In other words,they do not know exactly what they are doing. Haldeman basi-cally admits this on page 454, where he asks, \"What is one try-ing to achieve by spinal adjustment?\" His candid answer is: \"Un-fortunately, far more is speculated than is truly and scientifi-cally known about the mechanism of action of a manipulationor an adjustment.\" Another example of the difference between medical sci- ence and chiropractic is the amount of discussion devoted to thespeculative cause and treatment of headache. The book con-tains only one short paragraph on this subject, in which a num-ber of treatment outcome studies \"showing some value\" arelisted. In contrast, a leading medical textbook, the 20th editionof Cecil' s Textbook of Medicine , devotes six detailed pages to headache and describes the cause, pathology, prognosis, andtreatment of some 30 types of headaches such as migraine, braintumors, subdural hematoma, glaucoma, and sinusitis, none in any detail by Haldeman. The Cecil text also mentions a tension type headache that may grip the whole head like a vise. It is this type of headache178 Part IV: Additional Perspectives that chiropractic claims to relieve by \"adjusting subluxations\" in the neck. Many of these patients, states Cecil, are anxiousand depressed and may respond to appropriate antidepressantmedication\u2014 which, of course, chiropractors are not qualifiedor licensed to prescribe. Haldeman's text can also be compared with the recently published Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care , a 755-page work distributed by the American Medical Association. This book doesnot mention \"vertebral subluxations\" or recommend spinal ma-nipulation as a treatment. A chapter in Haldeman's text by John J. Triano, DC, describes the chiropractic \"subluxation\" as a hypotheticalconcept with multiple definitions, thereby admitting that noclear-cut anatomical abnormality exists. However, Trianosubstitutes the term \"functional spinal lesion (FSL),\" thedefinition of which appears to be just as nebulous. In another chapter, a dean and a professor at Palmer Col- lege say this about chiropractic's future: If continued scientific investigation of chiropractic were to elucidate the underlying principles, would such anundertaking undermine chiropractic's philosophical ten-ants and destroy the identity of the discipline and so thediscipline itself? Must chiropractic be prepared to aban-don its philosophy and identity, to adapt to scientificdiscoveries? These questions, of course, cannot be an-swered with certainty. Judged by scientific medical standards, this has already happened. Chiropractic, as defined in terms of \"subluxation,\"does not exist. The public interest would be served if chiroprac-tors admitted that their theory is false, abandoned it, and de-voted their energy to figuring out what they do that may beuseful.Chiropractors have long claimed that there are more complaints against medical doctors than there are against chiropractors. Theyhave used anecdotal evidence and testimonials almost exclu-sively to promote their cause. They point with pride to patientsatisfaction, while, at the same time, criticize medical doctorsfor using \"dangerous\" drugs and surgery. Their claims for fewer complaints against chiropractors may not be true, at least on a percentage basis in Connecticut,where in 1997 I found that there were 276 complaints against9,707 medical doctors versus 23 complaints against 648 licensedchiropractors. Percentagewise, this means there were more com-plaints against chiropractors, 3.55%, versus 2.88% against medi-cal doctors. The following example of a patient complaint ap-pears in the records of the Connecticut State Board of Chiro-practic Examiners. The patient was treated for chronic migraine headaches by a chiropractor who advised that he could cure her headachesand acne. During her first visit, she underwent standing and sit-ting full-spine x-ray examinations, which, she was advised, weredone to enable her treatment progress to be monitored. One part of her \"treatment\" was a \"coccygeal-meningeal procedure,\" during which the chiropractor inserted his hand intoher rectum to examine and manipulate it. This procedure wasadministered on at least five occasions. Upon learning that the patient was planning to take a trip in a pressurized airliner, the chiropractor advised her to self-administer this procedure while in flight. She was instructedthat the pressurized cabin would allow her to safely perform the 17920 Complaints against Chiropractors180 Part IV: Additional Perspectives procedure herself. The chiropractor gave her a rubber glove for this purpose and stated that the procedure was necessary forproper chiropractic \"adjustment.\" When the patient refused to continue with the proce- dure, the chiropractor said that he could not continue to treather. Nevertheless, he did so for several months. The patient's husband was also treated. He, too, under- went full-spinal x-ray examinations and was advised to havethe rectal procedure. He refused the treatment, however, andterminated his relationship. The chiropractor asked him to signa form relieving the chiropractor of all responsibility and liabil-ity, but the husband refused to sign and filed a complaint withthe chiropractic licensing board. The board concluded: No known manipulative technique is effective for treat- ing acne, and that the chiropractor's statement in thisregard constitutes material deception, as alleged. The chiropractor excessively x-rayed the patient by tak- ing full-spine films on three different occasions; this con-stituted incompetent practice. Rectal manipulation was not taught in any college of chiropractic approved by the board, and constituted il-legal conduct. The board, in effect, ruled that there should be scien- tific proof of a chiropractic procedure and, in referring to therectal manipulation, stated \"this approach is considered experi-mental and lacking current substantiation in the scientific lit-erature.\" It is of interest that the board made such a finding whenthe whole chriopractic \"subluxation\" theory lacks scientificproof. The board found the chiropractor guilty of a number of charges and made the following disposition: The chiropractor's license to practice chiropractic is suspended for a period of one year and he is ordered topay a civil penalty of $5,000. The period of suspensionshall commence 45 days from the date of the mailing of Chapter 20: Complaints against Chiropractors 181 this decision.The civil penalty shall be payable to the State of Connecticut. The respondent is also placed on aprobationary status for a period of three years. Duringthe period of probation, he must report on each patienthe has x-rayed, the dates of the x-rays and the preciseviews taken. Similar stories of weird treatments undoubtedly can be found among the medical profession as well, but there is goodreason to believe that they are far more common among chiro-practors. A few hundred medical doctors have embraced the ho-meopathic notion that \"remedies\" so dilute that they contain nomolecules of the original \"active\" substance can exert powerfultherapeutic effects. Other doctors use chelation therapy and allsorts of other dubious \"alternative\" medical treatments. How-ever, legitimate health professions do not have a senseless un-derlying theory but are based on the commonly shared knowl-edge of health and disease. Thus, unscientific practices are notwidely taught in medical schools, as they are in chiropracticschools. Moreover, chiropractic schools attract students who aremore prone to misbeliefs. Many have been \"raised in chiroprac-tic\" and come to school with deep-seated beliefs that health andillness are centered around the spine. For these reasons\u2014and more\u2014I believe that complaints and malpractice suits against chiropractors will grow exponen-tially as the silliness of subluxation theory becomes more widelyrealized. Insurance Fraud and Abuse Chiropractors also appear to be involved in an undue number of cases of insurance fraud and abuse. A prominent example is thecase of chiropractors Steven Verchow and AlexanderKuntzevich, who, doing business as V&K, operated a string ofclinics in New Jersey. In 1987, according to one press report,they began treating people for \"auto accident injuries that were182 Part IV: Additional Perspectives never inflicted, and pain and suffering never endured.\" Between 1987 and 1992, they collected $12 million from a state insur-ance fund and had billed out for $40 million more. According to press reports, chiropractors at their Acci- dent and Illness Center in Passaic saw an average of 100 pa-tients in an 8-hour shift. One doctor, who was dubbed \"The Fast-est Examiner in the West,\" allegedly did complex orthopedicevaluations on 222 patients in a single day and billed $45,256for that work. His examinations, some of his colleagues said,lasted mere seconds. Another of the chiropractors was called\"Dirty Harry.\" He moved about the corridors in a blood-stainedlab coat. His patients could be heard screaming from behindclosed examining room doors. He reportedly billed as much as$100,000 in a day. Many of the patients were generated by ar-ranging for carloads of poor immigrants to crash into each otherat speeds not exceeding 4 miles per hour. The cars were barelydamaged, but all passengers allegedly acquired whiplash inju-ries, with pain and suffering to follow. These descriptions come from depositions by doctors and patients during New Jersey's investigation of what lawenforcement authorities described as the biggest auto insurancescam in state history up to that time. For this, the chiropractorswere fined $750,000, surrendered their claim to the $40 million,and were suspended from practice for at least 5 years. Although some \"personal injury mills\" involve medical doctors as well, chiropractors appear to be proportionally moreinvolved and often instigate the MD/DC schemes.Since publication of the first edition of this book, four impor- tant controlled studies of chiropractic therapy have been pub-lished in major medical journals. The first of these compared the effect of active and simu- lated spinal manipulation on 80 children receiving medical treat-ment for asthma [1]. In this study, medical care with inhalantdrugs was continued along with the \"adjustments,\" because itwas considered unethical to discontinue the drug therapy. Thefindings and conclusion were clear and unequivocal: \"In chil-dren with mild or moderate asthma, the addition of chiropracticmanipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit.\" Thestudy should put to rest the false chiropractic claims that spinalmanipulation is an effective treatment for asthma. The second study compared the effect on low back pain of spinal manipulation, a physical therapy (using an exerciseprogram called the McKenzie method), and no therapy (merelygiving patients an educational booklet) [2]. The study involved321 adults. The cost per person was $429 for chiropractic, $437for physical therapy, and $153 for the booklet. The researchersconcluded: For patients with low back pain, the McKenzie method of physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation hadsimilar effects and costs, and the patients had only mar-ginal better outcomes than those receiving the minimalintervention of an educational booklet. Whether the lim-ited benefits of these treatments are worth the additionalcosts is open to question. 18321 Recent Studies on Tension Headaches, Low Back Pain, Asthma, and Colic184 Part IV: Additional Perspectives In an accompanying editorial, Paul Shekelle, MD, of the Rand Corporation, added, \"There appears to be little evidenceto support the use of spinal manipulation for non-musculoskeletalconditions.\" Referring the the fact that neck manipulation cancause a stroke, Shekelle also states that \"the use of cervicalmanipulation arouses far greater concern about safety than theuse of lumbar manipulation.\" [3] The third study, which involved 75 adults, compared the effect of chiropractic neck manipulation, bed rest, exercise,and ordinary activity on tension headaches. The researchers con-cluded that return to ordinary activity was superior to either ofthe other treatments and that \"as an isolated intervention, spinalmanipulation does not seem to have a positive effect on epi-sodic tension-type headache.\" [4] The fourth study examined the effect of chiropractic manipulation on infants with colic and found no benefit [5]. Three of the aforementioned studies tested claims based on chiropractic \"subluxation\" theory, and their results supportthe core challenge and conclusion of this book: that subluxation- based chiropractic is a hoax . The back-pain study data even challenge whether manipulation is effective or cost-effective fortreating back pain.

Archives of Diseases in Childhood84:138-141, 2001.This book's conclusion\u2014that chiropractic, as defined, is a hoax\u2014has been expressed by others many times before. Yet,despite this, chiropractic has flourished to the extent that as manyas 70,000 chiropractors in the United States are legally permit-ted practice this hoax in every state of the union. Many chiropractors offer \"nutritional counseling\" and (improperly) prescribe dietary supplements and herbs in an ap-parent attempt to compensate for their inability to prescribe stan-dard medications. A few, on the other hand, have renouncedchiropractic's subluxation theory and limit their treatment torelieving stiff muscles and joints. This book's main thrust andpurpose is to distinguish between scientific medical care basedon proven facts and chiropractic care based on a metaphysicalbelief. Chiropractic has many devoted, hard-core believers,whereas medical care has the scientific proof of the greatestadvances in health care in the history of humankind. This bookhighlights the difference between the two. My friends, including physician colleagues and even chiropractors, have asked me, \"Why are you so upset with chi-ropractic?\" They reason that if people want to risk their lifegoing to a quack, why not let them. It is, after all, a free countryand if they want that type of care, they are free to make thatchoice. It is admittedly difficult to deny freedom of choice as an inalienable right, especially in matters so vital as health, life,and death. However, chiropractic licensing carries with it theconnotation of the approval by our government agencies. Wehave, for better or worse, many government regulations to pro- 18522 Final Comments186 Part IV: Additional Perspectives tect consumers. I believe that if legislators license a hoax, con- sumers have a right to know that and to be informed by thosewho discern the truth. It should be clear from reading this book that chiroprac- tic is not based on science. Chiropractic \"subluxations\" do notpress on nerves that interfere with energy going down thosenerves, causing disease in the body's internal organs. It is, ofcourse, almost impossible to prove this negatively to everyone'ssatisfaction. After all, thousands even believe in UFOs and, inregard to health, believe in all sorts of alternative, unprovenhealth care claims. The facts presented in this book should lead you to con- clude that chiropractic's subluxation theory is a hoax, that backpain is not caused by \"vertebral subluxations,\" and that anypositive benefits from manipulation are not the result of \"cor-recting subluxations.\" Ian D. Coulter, PhD, a former president of Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, has hinted at the inevitabilityof science debunking chiropractic. In the textbook Principles and Practice of Chiropractic , he stated, \"The extent to which chiropractic has been, or is, a cult would be an interesting re-search topic.\" In another chapter of the textbook, a leading chi-ropractic historian wrote: If continued scientific investigation of chiropractic were to elucidate the underlying principles, would such anundertaking undermine chiropractic's philosophical ten-ants and destroy the identity of the discipline and thediscipline itself? Must chiropractic be prepared to aban-don its philosophy and its identity, to adapt to scientificdiscoveries? Consumer Reports answered this question in 1975, loudly and clearly: Not a single scientific study in the 80 years existence of chiropractic or the entire history of medicine shows thatmanipulation can affect any of the basic life patterns. Chapter 22: Final Comments 187 But a vast amount of evidence suggests it cannot. In 1895, neither D.D. Palmer (chiropractic's founder) nor his contemporaries could foresee that research. In the year2001, however, there is no excuse for ignoring it. Unless mostresearch in the 20th century is wrong, Palmer's disease theorybelongs in the pages of 19th century history, along with bleed-ing, purging, and the other blind alleys of medicine. I believe that chiropractors should admit that sublux- ation theory is a hoax and attempt to upgrade their colleges intoscientific institutions patterned after medical schools, as the os-teopaths have done. Until that happens, those who find chiro-practic to be unscientific and unconscionable will surely con-tinue to speak out\u2014as is done in this book. Is There a Solution? Can chiropractic survive if it remains based on a false theory? And even if it can, would this serve the best interests of patientswhose care is based on this theory? Might chiropractic be splitinto two parts, one that limits its care to evidence-based treat-ment of musculoskeletal problems and the other still ingrained\"subluxation\" concepts? I believe that the best solution would be to mirror the practice of dentists, optometrists, and podiatrists, whose scopeis sharply defined, but who practice independently. To do this,chiropractors would have to abandon subluxation theory andstop pretending that their scope is virtually unlimited. Theywould also have to restructure their educational programs sothat they produce graduates who can clearly distinguish who iswithin their scope of practice and who is not. During my visit to New York Chiropractic College, I suggested to the dean and to President Padgett that they (a) con-vert their handsome college into an accredited medical schooland (b) abandon the false beliefs that spinal \"adjustments\" cantreat disease and maintain wellness. I also sought the opinion of188 Part IV: Additional Perspectives chiropractor Lester Lamm, dean of continuing education at Western States Chiropractic College in Portland, Oregon. Both deans firmly rejected such a suggestion, but dean Lamm sentinformation about the college that may indicate a trend towardconversion. The college had instituted an \"integrated\" program in- tended to prepare chiropractors to be primary care physicians.The program was centered around two newly employed osteo-pathic physicians who would supervise a clinic where chiro-practic students could learn aspects of standard medicine. Theprogram, as described in the brochures, hardly constituted ad-equate training for managing the full range of patients who wouldbe seen in a typical medical office\u2014and I said this to the dean.He replied that it was as good as the training of nurses,physician's assistants, and nurse practitioners who function asprimary care providers. Furthermore, he was not about to aban-don chiropractic, which he insisted was a scientific practice. Despite the denial of these two deans, any bridging of chiropractic and medicine will inevitably be based on a medicalmodel of health and disease. Whether this can be done by(a) upgrading the current system, (b) affiliating with science-based universities or medical centers, or (c) convertingchiropractic colleges into accredited medical schools, remainsto be seen. But one thing is certain: As time goes on, the healthmarketplace will demand greater accountability. For chiropracticto survive, its practitioners will have to limit their scope tomusculoskeletal problems, improve the quality of their training,develop evidence-based treatment standards, and relegatesubluxation theory and its associated practices to the dustbin ofhistory.Part V Appendices Glossary Where to Get Additional InformationACA.
