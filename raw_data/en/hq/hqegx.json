He is Adjunct Professor of Journalism with Sydney's University of Technology (UTS) and has authored newspaper and magazine articles, as well as the book Killer Company (HarperCollins, 2009), a history of Australia's largest asbestos manufacturer, James Hardie which inspired the ABC Television miniseries, Devil's Dust .Full details of the experience, past appointments and achievements of each of the members of the ABC Board are available at: www.about.abc.net.au/who-we-are/the-abc-board/16 ABOUT THE ABCBoard Director s' statement Accessibility The ABC provides a wide range of services\u2014television, radio and digital\u2014available throughout the nation\u2014for all of us\u2014regardless of age, geography or income. It provides, and is committed to continue to provide, a range of shared experiences for Australians which nourish our sense of national identity, promote social cohesion and enrich and inform all aspects of Australian life, including the maintenance of a vibrant democracy. The Australian broadcasting system has developed on the principle of universal, free accessibility. The ABC is part of that system, together with commercial and community broadcasters, providing a distinctive, but sometimes similar, service. There is a broadly-based consensus in Australia that there is a core of programming that must be universally available. This is reflected, perhaps most clearly in the statutory \"anti-siphoning\" list, pursuant to which major sporting events must be offered first to free-to-air television. This consensus is not limited to sport. In order to maintain a cohesive society and a vibrant democracy, a wide range of programming must be available to all, to facilitate public debate and to ensure that the whole community understands its heritage and knows its own stories. In the traditional mixed model of the Australian broadcasting environment\u2014encompassing both commercial and public broadcasting\u2014the intrusion of advertising on free-to-air television and radio does not undermine the principle of universal availability. This model was underpinned by a mass media model which is now being challenged by niche, paid for and subscription services. These services, including pay TV and other new digital services, provide greater programming diversity, but for specialised audiences. The ABC has an express statutory obligation to offer services to the community as a whole, as well as to provide programming of special interest. The ABC has never in its 80 year history been merely a \"market failure broadcaster\", obliged to fill gaps in the programming provided by the commercial broadcasters. The ABC should fill gaps, but it is also directed, by statute, to provide \"comprehensive broadcasting services\". We must ensure that all Australians have access to quality media services, perhaps particularly access to reliable news and information about international, national, regional and local matters.One of the hidden dangers of the digital revolution is that it is now possible for citizens to retreat into an electronic village and insulate themselves from any opinion with which they might disagree. The role of public broadcasters to promote social cohesion and provide a forum for debate in a democratic polity as a whole remains of critical importance. The ABC provides shared experiences\u2014cultural experiences in the broadest sense of that term\u2014that are common to all Australians. It does so at a time when such common cultural experiences, based on media content, are less often available than in the past. For citizens A defining characteristic of public broadcasting is that it must treat its audiences as citizens and not merely as consumers. To act in this way\u2014both in the content of programming and the manner of interaction with audiences\u2014is an essential component of an ethos of public service that the ABC, by force of its statutory Charter, is obliged to adopt. Public service goes well beyond satisfying consumer demand. A person's interest as a \"consumer\" is only one part of the person's status as a citizen. Consumers have desires or needs. Citizens have rights and duties. Whilst satisfying community demand for program content, or at least for mainstream content, may be common to both commercial and public broadcasters, there are process and accountability considerations which commercial broadcasters either do not have or do not share in the same degree. Providing content that seeks to attract large audiences and ratings is not irrelevant to the functions of a public broadcaster, but our obligations extend to serving additional public values such as accessibility, openness, fairness, inclusion, impartiality, accountability, legitimacy, participation and honesty. The Corporation continues to serve this broad range of values by innovating and evolving, by being audience focused and audience responsive and by keeping pace with our audience's changing demands about how they want to experience ABC content. Digital services Like every other media organisation in Australia, indeed throughout the world, the ABC has had to adapt to the dramatic expansion of accessibility and 1ABOUT THE ABC 17been most dramatic on print journalism. They are also quite apparent amongst commercial broadcasters. Many media organisations have reduced their investment in in-depth public affairs journalism. Commercial media organisations are striving to develop a new business model, capable of being profitable in a digital age. Their ability to do so is still uncertain. In this context it is more important than ever that the ABC maintains its capacity to provide a bedrock of quality services, from a trustworthy source and accessible to all Australians wherever they live. The provision of such services, in news and current affairs reporting and forums for discussion, with a degree of certainty that may not be available from traditional sources is a fundamental aspect of the public benefit that the ABC delivers. Although a healthy media ecology providing diversity in the range of available voices may be restored by new digital providers, such providers will not for a considerable period, if at all, deliver the common cultural experience to all Australians, the significance of which is mentioned above. Nor will they, at least in the short term, develop the trust within the broader community that ensures that such common experiences have the positive social benefits of the past and the present. Throughout this year, public opinion polls have consistently reinforced the long existing finding that the Australian public places more trust in the ABC than in any other Australian media organisation. With the future of commercial journalism so uncertain, this extent of public trust coupled with the security of public funding, the ABC's role is, if anything, more important than ever. Board of Directors Simon Mordant AM was appointed to the Board of Directors for five years in November 2012. Matt Peacock was elected to the reinstated position of ABC Board Staff-Elected Director and commenced the position on 22 April 2013. The Board has throughout the year maintained an active oversight role across ABC operations and accountabilities, to ensure the ABC performs efficiently and with maximum benefit to the people of Australia, as required under section 8 of the ABC Act. navailability of media content arising from the digital revolution. Digital delivery enables any viewer or listener to arrange their own program schedules, to be accessed whenever they feel like it and to do so from an ever expanding range of sources, all accessible from rapidly converging hardware of increasing power. A highlight for the ABC in the year under review was the amendment to the ABC's Charter to include \"digital media services\" as a core function, and to prohibit advertising on those services. These amendments were the most significant changes to the ABC's Charter in its thirty year history. They were passed with bipartisan, indeed with unanimous, support by the Australian Parliament. The ABC has been in the forefront of experimentation in the Australian media with the digital revolution. It has introduced numerous initiatives and developed a wide range of services over the two decades since ABC Online commenced in 1994. The statutory amendment to the Charter secures the ABC's role in the digital future. Even in the course of this year there have been significant changes in digital media consumption. The prevalence of mobile media use has led to a significant expansion in the uptake of ABC mobile apps. This year a turning point was reached, when the number of Australians watching the ABC's iview service on mobile devices exceeded those accessing it on personal computers. As distinctions between platforms gradually dissolve in a digital environment, radio, television and print now converge in the same online space. This is impacting on the way the ABC organises itself internally. For example, the ABC's Audience Strategy Group has identified that the best converged content experience from mobile will begin with convergence and collaboration twinning ABC's radio, television and online content teams. Trusted journalism The digital revolution has unleashed waves of disruptive innovation throughout the media world. Whilst making available a range of information and creating content of historically unprecedented breadth, it has had negative consequences on traditional forms of public affairs journalism. These adverse effects have 18 ABOUT THE ABCKate Dundas Director of Radio BA (Comms) (CSU) Kate Dundas was appointed Director of Radio in March 2009.

The Corporation's triennial funding agreement for 2013-16, announced in the 2013 Budget in May, provided an additional $89.4 million over three years to broaden the focus of the ABC's news and current affairs services and support its delivery of digital content. In 2013-14, the Corporation will move swiftly to translate these funds into new and improved services for Australians. News for a converged environment Early in the year, the ABC will complete the second stage of its Newsgathering initiative, which was enabled by the Government's allocation in February 2013 of $10 million to support the recruitment of specialist reporters and delivery of stronger local and regional coverage. The Corporation will complete the process of recruiting and training new staff in July and will open new offices in Parramatta, Geelong and Ipswich to provide more diverse and representative metropolitan news coverage. In regional Australia, the ABC will engage and equip journalists to increase the level of original local journalism from each region, including delivering stories for hourly state and national radio news bulletins, radio current affairs programs, television news and ABC News Online. The Corporation will apply the additional news funding provided in the Budget to deliver more state-based current affairs, extend the seasons of its flagship current affairs programs and create more cross-platform news content for audiences. This third stage of the Newsgathering project will also focus on projects that appeal to younger audiences aged 25-49 and that maximise digital opportunities and audience engagement, including through the use of social media. Delivering online and mobile content The ABC's new funding agreement included $30 million over three years for online content distribution. This will assist the ABC to meet the growing demand for digital content and to extend the benefits of its digital services, running projects to explore new streaming options and to improve the quality of iview.Melbourne Accommodation Project In May 2013, the Government approved a $90 million loan to enable the Corporation to collocate its Melbourne operations in a new building consolidated with the existing ABC Centre at Southbank. The new facility will enhance cross-divisional collaboration and enable content sharing by bringing radio, television and online production together on the one site. The space will be optimised for public access and engagement, providing increased opportunities for the community to connect with the national broadcaster. The ABC will finalise the detailed design of the new premises in 2013, allowing demolition of the adjacent building and construction to commence early in the first quarter of 2014. The estimated project completion date is early 2017. Engaging with the wider media ecology In the second half of 2013, the Corporation will undertake several pilot projects to explore and respond to the porous nature of online news media and the ways in which audiences use it. The ABC will develop a linking service for its websites, modelled on the BBC's successful Newstracker, that provides links to relevant stories on other news services from the Corporation's own stories. In a similar fashion, it will trial a locally-focused smartphone app that showcases ABC local, national and international content for audiences in a region, alongside links to content produced locally by other media outlets and community groups. Indigenous employment The Corporation's Reconciliation Action Plan 2013-15 , which came into effect on 1 January 2013, extends the successes and responds to the failures of the previous Plan. In particular, it commits the ABC to recruiting and retaining greater numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and to meeting and exceeding a long-standing target of 2% Indigenous employment. In 2013-14, the Corporation will vigorously pursue these objectives by implementing its Indigenous Employment Strategy . n1ABOUT THE ABC 23 The ABC's strategic direction in 2012-13 was guided by the ABC Strategic Plan 2010 -13. The Plan is framed around the following six strategic goals: The ABC's performance against these goals is reported at page 135. Being audience focused To provide a range of media experiences to meet the needs and expectations of diverse audiences. Being high quality To consistently deliver content which reflects the ABC's commitment to quality, independence and high editorial standards. Being innovative To pursue new ideas, opportunities and partnerships, and grow our capabilities for the future. Being values based To demonstrate ABC Values in every aspect of our work. Being efficient To maximise the efficient and effective use of resources. Being responsible To be visible and active in the community, setting high standards of social, environmental and regulatory responsibility.Strategic objectives Reporting the ABC's performance The ABC strives to maintain the highest standards in every aspect of its operations. The Board and the Executive set those standards in the ABC's Values, its Strategic Plan and in its divisional business planning; Government sets them when funding is granted; and most significantly, audiences set them every time they turn to the ABC to be informed, engaged and entertained. The remainder of this report demonstrates the ABC's performance on all of those levels.As an audience- focussed media organisation, the ABC is constantly evolving, remaking itself to ensure the benefits of digital media are freely available to all Australians.

This is similar to the ABC's reach in 2012, which was 71%. 1 Community satisfaction The annual Newspoll ABC Appreciation Survey 2 provides insights into community perceptions and beliefs about the value of the ABC's contribution to Australian society. The 2013 survey was conducted nationally, by telephone, among a random sample of 1 903 respondents aged 14 years and over. The ABC Appreciation Survey has been conducted using the same methodology since its inception in 1998. Overall the 2013 survey finds little change in community opinion compared to the previous year. A large majority of Australians (85%) believe the ABC performs a valuable role, and a large majority believe it provides quality content, and that is doing a good job satisfying its Charter obligations. The respondents were asked about their views on the quality of ABC Television, ABC Radio and ABC Online. Consistent with previous surveys, most Australians (78%) believe the quality of programming on ABC television is 'good', while significantly fewer (44%) believe this about commercial television. Overall for ABC Radio, 64% of Australians believe the quality of programming on ABC Radio is 'good', compared to 61% in 2012-13. For commercial radio, approximately half (51%) the population believes it offers good quality programming, slightly down on last year (53%). There continues to be a greater similarity in Australians' overall perceptions about the quality of ABC and commercial radio than in their perceptions about the quality of ABC and commercial television. This reflects the far more fragmented and niche radio market, where audiences have a very wide choice of stations to listen to. 1 Newspoll, ABC Awareness and Usage Survey , June 2012 and 2013, in combination with ratings data, total 18 years and over population. 2 Newspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey , June 2013, national random sample (n=1 903) conducted by telephone, people aged 14 years and over.Audience trends28 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESRadio TelevisionAudience trends TELEVISION100% 80 60 40 20 0 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 29 2Quality of programming Independent research from Newspoll provides an overview of community attitudes and opinions about the ABC of Australians believe the quality of programming on ABC Television is goodof Australians believe the quality of ABC Radio programming is good , compared to 51% for commercial radio The vast majority of ABC Online users (86%) believe the quality of content is 'good', including 34% who rate it as 'very good'. These results are similar to last year's findings. Among frequent ABC Online users, the results are even more positive, with 93% of those who use the site at least once a week saying the quality of content is 'good' and 43% of this group saying the quality is 'very good'.Online The ABC Appreciation Survey explores public perceptions about the ABC's performance in relation to specific aspects of the Corporation's Charter. The majority of Australians remain of the view that the ABC is doing 'a good job' fulfilling its various Charter obligations. Compared with last year, the level of positive sentiment has risen slightly, after a dip last year. Community perceptions about the coverage of regional news and information remain far more favourable for the ABC than for commercial media among both people in capital cities and people residing in country or regional areas. Around 80% of Australians believe that the ABC does a 'good job' covering country and regional issues compared with 45% for commercial media. nNine in ten ABC Online users believe the quality of content on abc.net.au is good 78% 64% RADIO ONLINE30 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESAudience trends Measures of community satisfaction 2012-13 2011 -12 2010 -11 2009 -10 2008 - 09 Providing a quality service: % of people who believe the ABC Television 78 78 79 82 82 provides quality programming Radio 64 61 64 69 65 Online (among ABC Online users) 86 89 89 89 91 % of people who believe the ABC is balanced and even-handed when reporting news and current affairs 78 80 81 82 83 Providing a valuable service: % of people who value the ABC and its services to the community 85 86 87 88 89 Meeting the ABC's Charter obligations: % of people who regard the ABC to be distinctively Australian and contributing to Australia's national identity 82 83 83 84 86 % of people who believe the ABC reflects the cultural diversity of the Australian community 79 80 81 80 83 % of people who consider the ABC: encourages and promotes Australian performing arts such as music and drama 79 79 79 78 83 provides programs of an educational nature 83 82 84 86 88 achieves a good balance between programs of wide appeal and specialised interest 80 82 83 85 86 % of people who perceive the ABC to be innovative 73 72 75 74 75 Providing an efficient service: % of people who believe the ABC is efficient and well managed 69 66 70 73 72 Source: Newspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey 2013.100% 80 60 40 20 0 of Australians believe the ABC provides a valuable service to the communityValue 85% Based on a total sample aged 14 years and over. \"Don't Know\" and \"Not Valuable\" responses are not displayed.

Audiences have the choice of five television services on four television channels, an industry-leading catch-up service, an engaging online presence and the interactivity of social TV. Time-shifting and online viewing are now commonplace. Whilst the majority of television viewing is still via the traditional television set, Australians are increasingly using various devices to both consume content and to complement their television viewing. Regardless of how content was accessed, in 2013 the ABC provided a diverse range of compelling television content which attracted large audiences and an array of Australian and international awards. ABC television content is broadcast on five services across four channels: ABC1\u2014the Corporation's primary channel ABC2\u2014a digital service comprising two distinct schedules: - ABC2\u2014content for a younger adult demographic between 7 pm and 2 am; and - ABC4Kids\u2014content for pre-schoolers between 6 am and 7 pm.

AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 53 2AUSTRALIANS PLACE their trust in ABC news and current affairs, with 78% of Australians surveyed believing that the ABC is balanced and even-handed in delivering news. 64 At a time of rapid media change and fragmentation, that connection has never been more crucial. In 2012-13, the ABC allocated significant resources to covering a range of major events, including ALP leadership contests, the 2012 London Olympic Games, the United States Presidential election, the West Australian election and extensive summer bushfires in several States. 64 Newspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey 2013.Audiences continue to rely on the ABC as a uniquely independent and authoritative source of news and information.News and current affairs on radio News and current affairs on television News and current affairs onlineNews Percentage of Australians who believe the ABC 7 pm News does a good job of being balanced and even-handedBalance Independent research from Newspoll provides an overview of community attitudes and opinions about the ABC.91% NEWS54 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESThe ABC continued to make programs which set agendas and broke new ground, including: a Lateline interview that helped precipitate the announcement of a national Royal Commission into child sexual abuse by institutions; the exclusive Foreign Correspondent documentary \"Prisoner X\" that revealed the death of an Australian in an Israeli prison; and a ground-breaking Four Corners report on Lance Armstrong and doping allegations.The ABC embarked on two significant projects in 2012-13 to expand and enhance its news and current affairs programs. The first was a review of its newsgathering operations to ensure the most efficient use of resources in the delivery of high-quality journalism in a changing media environment. The second project aims to bring audiences more original, agenda-setting journalism from more places. This project is the result of additional resources allocated n the ABC triennial funding agreement 2013 -16.News Quality news and current affairs is a vital area of strength for the ABC across the country and into the region. The ABC stands alone as the leader in original journalism, providing broad, in-depth and comprehensive news coverage of significant issues. The ABC's commitment to high quality investigative journalism and breaking stories of significant impact was evident in the coverage of the case of Prisoner X. Until 12 February 2013, the identity of an inmate held in Israel's Ayalon Prison was known to only a very select group of people. But when Foreign Correspondent went to air with its careful examination of the evidence, the secrecy was broken, and the world would know that Prisoner X was a Melbourne man named Ben Zygier. ABC journalist Trevor Bormann's perseverance and skill in pursuing this complex story is an outstanding example of how good investigative journalism can instigate a debate amongst authorities and the community. NEWSForeign CorrespondentAUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 55 2Newsgathering review The objective of the review was to ensure that newsgathering resources are allocated and priorities set which ensure that news of the highest standard is gathered and distributed as efficiently as possible, across regional, state and international newsrooms. Recent major changes in the media environment, including in the way news is gathered and delivered, meant that it was timely to undertake a review and restructure of the ABC's newsgathering structure. The review led to the creation of a central newsgathering team serving the needs of daily news programs and platforms. The review also recommended the creation of a 'news now' model, where stories are filed to meet the needs of continuous news platforms, as well as key scheduled programs. News funding package Funds allocated in the ABC triennial funding agreement 2013-16 will allow the ABC to build upon its investment in specialist rounds and regional news, and to extend its current affairs programming. This project reflects concerns that the future of rigorous, independent Australian journalism may be under threat, with a loss of jobs across the media substantially reducing the amount of original journalism being produced in Australia. As Australia's primary public broadcaster, the ABC is the leading provider of independent journalism to the Australian community. The additional funds allocated in the triennial funding agreement 2013-16 will enable the ABC to increase its capacity to provide original, agenda-setting journalism in a range of areas. This will include the following initiatives, the roll-out of which will commence in 2013: the introduction of a new fact-checking unit the recruitment of additional national reporters to strengthen original reporting additional news bureaux in Geelong, Parramatta and Ipswich to contribute to more diverse news coverage; and increased number of cameras and links in some regional bureaus. News and current affairs on radio The ABC distributes news and current affairs content across a range of radio networks and on digital radio. In 2012-13, news and current affairs programs on ABC Local Radio reached, on average, 1.7 million people aged 10 and over each week in the five-city metropolitan market. 65 This was steady with 2011-12. The ABC NewsRadio network is a dedicated 24-hour radio service (see page 35).

The cleaner interface brings news to the foreground, showcasing radio and television content. Richer article pages allow users easy access to a wide range of content from different ABC sources including text, audio and video. The app includes a feature enabling people to 'Wake up with the ABC' by setting an alarm that links to the ABC program of their choice. ABC audiences can start the day by catching news, sport or weather in 90 seconds, ABC News 24 or a live radio program. Location Pilot Project The technical capacities of mobile devices are facilitating new connections between the ABC and its audiences. In late 2012, the ABC began a research and discovery project to explore and test the relevance of location for news and information seeking, in light of the capacity for mobile devices to identify their location. The research undertaken in Newcastle, Launceston, Geelong, Canberra and Mount Gambier sought to identify how smartphone users are currently getting their news and information, and whether the user's location is important in this process. On the basis of its research, the ABC is piloting a mobile product which provides a mix of local, national and international news combined with specific local information. The findings of this project will inform future ABC digital products, with a particular focus on opportunities for tailoring content and services based on someone's location. An extension of the pilot will include an experiment in encouraging discussion around local issues and topics of interest to individual communities. Pilots have been rolled out in Newcastle in New South Wales and Launceston in Tasmania and additional pilots will be trialled in other locations. Social media The rise of digital media consumption has been supercharged by social media. 72% of online Australians have at least one active social media profile and 37% participate in social TV. 92 As a media organisation, the ABC has been at the forefront of utilising social media to enhance the delivery of its services. The ABC has over 150 official Facebook pages covering ABC programs and content areas such as triple j, triple j unearthed, ABC News, ABC Television, ABC Radio National, ABC Technology and Games, Radio National Drive, ABC Local Radio stations and ABC iview. The ABC has over 200 official Twitter accounts. Social media is being utilised in innovative ways to interact with and build audiences, gather feedback, research and keep abreast of industry trends and as a new platform for the delivery of ABC content. Not only does social media give the ABC new ways of sharing, promoting and talking about its content, it has created a new kind of conversation in which audience members share their views and ideas with each other in real time. 92 Nielsen, Australian Connected Consumers\u2014Evolving patterns of media consumption in the digital age, February 2013. 62 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESOnline The ABC continued to enhance its use of social media for the benefit of audiences. In 2012-13, ABC staff attended craft sessions with experts from Twitter and YouTube to improve and update their social media skills. The ABC also joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in a 12-month pilot of two new social media tools which will enhance the ABC's ability to monitor social media conversations and adapt its social presence accordingly. Education portal In December 2011, the Federal Government announced the provision of $19.9 million over three years for the development of a new education portal for students, teachers and parents, to be built in partnership by the ABC and Educational Services Australia (ESA). The portal consists of two parts: the first is a media resource library which contains audio-visual material sourced from the ABC's extensive archive and collections. The second part is the delivery of several highly interactive, media-rich learning resources that will enhance students' learning experiences, including interactive games, immersive environments, and live events. In October 2012, phase one of the portal\u2014ABC Splash\u2014was launched, with a media library of 333 clips and 184 small interactives, curated and mapped in line with the Australian Curriculum. On 26 March 2013, the site was officially launched in Melbourne by the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education, Senator Jacinta Collins. The launch featured a Splash Live event, in which students from schools around Australia broadcast local news stories they had created with the help of ABC Splash resources. Reaction to the portal has been positive, with ABC Splash attracting 1.63 million page views and 367 000 visits as at May 2013. 93 93 WebTrends.Digital first storytelling projects In November 2012, the ABC launched the Opera House Project, a co-production between the ABC and the Sydney Opera House. The Opera House Project is a rich multi-media online documentary that tells the unique story of the iconic Australian building, Sydney Opera House, from its inception in 1954 through its complex design and construction, and through the past forty years of performance. The partnership with the Sydney Opera House has produced a unique digital journey of one of the world's most important buildings. The ground-breaking multi-media portal applies new methods of digital storytelling to offer viewers direct access to a wealth of information and resources on the nation's most famous landmark. The site contains over 24 hours of content, including archival and newly created video, audio, and still images, 3D rendered and interactive first-person environments. Through the specially developed digital interface, viewers can create their own documentary experience. The project involved collaboration with and contributions from a range of external partners, including State Library NSW, Powerhouse Museum, Arup, NSW State Records and many prominent historians and architects. The site was built as a HTML5 web app, making it platform-agnostic and able to be viewed in web browsers across desktop, tablets, smartphones and internet-connected televisions. The Opera House project was nominated for a number of web and creative awards. n AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 63 2FOR MORE THAN 70 years, the ABC has broadcast to millions of people across Asia and the Pacific through Radio Australia and, more recently, the Australia Network, supported by news and analysis from the ABC's Asia Pacific News Centre. In August 2012, the ABC and the Federal Government finalised a funding agreement for the provision of Australia's international media service. The new agreement enables the ABC to deliver a converged, multiplatform service encompassing the Australia Network television service, Radio Australia and a suite of online, mobile and social media services. The creation of a converged international media service reflects technological and behavioural changes across Asia and the Pacific. The ABC restructured its International Division and developed an audience-focused strategy to ensure delivery of a comprehensive service to diverse regional audiences on their chosen platform. The strategy is based on the cultural aspirations, media consumption habits, audience content preferences and the relative use of different media platforms in each regional market. In June 2013, the ABC and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade agreed on the converged service's first three-year Strategic Plan and annual Business Plan. Audiences In delivering its international services across Asia and the Pacific, the ABC is mindful of the significant differences in cultural and socio-economic conditions which exist across the target markets. The new converged service has adopted a strategy based on tailoring content and services to the greatest possible degree for the specific markets in which they will be received.International audiences ABC International engages international audiences in multiple languages, encourages awareness of Australia and builds regional partnerships.Audiences Content DistributionInternational Development International Relations 64 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES Australia Network Satellite distribution/footprint, including Radio Australia l Australia Network, 24-hours free-to-air Radio Australia l Radio Australia's 24-hour FM network l Shortwave transmission sites l Digital subscription radio Foreign Language ServicesThe trend of recent years of increasing mobile phone ownership and internet use continued strongly in the last year. Mobile phones are becoming one of the key means by which Asian audiences access information. In late 2012, there were an estimated 3.3 billion mobile phone subscriptions in Asia. 94 At the end of 2011, it was estimated that Asia had over one billion internet users. 95 Further, mobile phones are increasingly being used to access the internet. In China, it is estimated that one third of mobile phones are used for internet access. 96 And in the Pacific, with some of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world, access to social media sites through mobile phones is creating new opportunities to connect with audiences. 94 Paul Budde and Peter Evan, \"Asia\u2014Mobile Voice Market\", February 2013 (8th Edition). 95 CASBAA. \"Asia Pacific Multichannel TV 2012\", Report, p.4; while the report includes Australia and New Zealand, the small populations of those countries mean they are unlikely to distort the figures. 96 Nielsen Mobile Insights: China, March 2010.International audiencesAUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 65 2In some countries, audiences are reducing their use of television and radio as they make greater use of new digital platforms. In others, the effect of new media is additive, with total media consumption rising as audiences employ new technologies alongside more traditional media. Rates of access to television continue to grow and television viewing is expected to remain a key source of information for the foreseeable future. The use of radio in Asia varies significantly from country to country. In China, for example, fewer than 7% of adults use radio as a daily source of news. By comparison, in Indonesia, radio is used by 11% of adults and in Cambodia by 33%. 97 Radio remains an important means of reaching audiences across the Pacific regions. A key consideration for the converged service is the varying levels of development across markets within Asia and the Pacific. There are two distinct groups across the target markets for the ABC's international service: Developed media markets \u2014characterised by large urbanised populations, high levels of technological sophistication and advanced wireless infrastructure. The most common theme is high use of smart phones as primary source of media consumption. Emerging media markets \u2014characterised by use of traditional linear media such as print, radio and television. The ABC's international development projects are focused in these markets, where the ABC is a trusted and credible news source. Content The overarching aims of the ABC's international service are to share Australian stories that engage our neighbours in Asia and the Pacific region, and to promote regional dialogue and understanding between Australia and those countries. 97 InterMedia Survey Institute research.The ABC seeks to do this through quality, independent and pluralistic content delivered in relevant ways on relevant platforms. Content highlights in 2012-13 included: News and current affairs \u2014the ABC delivered its most comprehensive coverage of a critical regional story, \"Malaysia Votes\", covering the Malaysian elections. Coverage of the election was strong across platforms and programs, including on Connect Asia, Asia Pacific , the Malaysia Votes blog, Australia Network News, Newsline and social media platforms. Newsline broadcast six programs from Kuala Lumpur and crossed to ABC News 24. Southeast Asia Correspondent, Zoe Daniel and video journalist, Liam Cochrane provided coverage from across Malaysia with reports from Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak. The Melbourne newsroom also delivered a wide range of perspectives across our online platforms, including the Malaysia Votes blog and pushing content to YouTube and Facebook. ANZAC Day \u2014extensive coverage across platforms, including coverage of the dawn services held across Australia, the region and the world. Coverage of key events \u2014this included coverage of Cyclone Evan in the Pacific, Australia's bushfire emergencies and the devastating flooding in Jakarta. The Pacific Beat program continued to attract audiences across the Pacific and covered breaking issues including the burning of the draft constitution in Fiji, the torture of two detainees in Fiji and the abuse of the landlease system in Papua New Guinea. Business and finance news \u2014the ABC delivers reliable business and finance news from Australia and across the region, including daily market updates and in-depth features on industries and stories that matter to the region. ABC International's business and finance reporting is extended through collaboration with partners in key markets, including China's International Channel Shanghai and Korea's Arirang TV.66 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESInternational audiences English language learning \u2014Planet English , a 90-minute English language learning (ELL) program, was distributed to numerous partners across Asia. In addition, over 60 short pieces of original ELL content were created, coupled with over 300 social media posts and over 200 images which provided context to the language use. English Bites was also extended to offer Khmer and Vietnamese language versions. My Australia \u2014reflecting modern Australia to the region, a third series of My Australia was delivered, this series looking at Australia through the eyes of young people from the Asia Pacific region. Children's programming and Australian drama \u2014Australia Network television delivered the best of Australian children's content, including Giggle and Hoot, Play School , The Wiggles and Bananas in Pyjamas. Australian drama programs included Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and Redfern Now . Major sporting events \u2014Radio Australia broadcast ABC Grandstand's live commentary of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Pacific Beat delivered comprehensive coverage of the efforts of Pacific athletes in London. Other sporting coverage included the Melbourne Cup 2012, cricket tests, the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, the Australian Open tennis and the AFL finals and grand final. Pacific Break \u2014In its fifth year, the Pacific Break music competition showcased the best original music from the Pacific. Featuring over 100 songs, interviews and live performances across all platforms, social media was integrated into the campaign to engage young people in the region. Distribution The distribution of Australia's international broadcasting service takes place through a combination of various transmission platforms and technologies, country-specific syndication agreements and a growing online presence. The ABC has regard to the particular characteristics of a country when determining how best to distribute content.In 2012-13, Australia Network maintained its reach, estimated to be over 31 million homes, in over 46 countries within the footprint. 98 Rebroadcast arrangements with cable operators in the region numbered over 660 during the period. 99 Radio Australia distribution includes dedicated 24-hour FM transmitters in most Pacific Island capitals and selected locations in South East Asia. Nearly 100 partnerships with local FM radio stations facilitate the broadcast of Radio Australia programming throughout the wider region. A key component of the service's distribution strategy is to pursue partnerships with local media organisations in key markets. In April 2013, ABC International signed memoranda of understanding with media outlets in China, including Beijing TV, China Radio International, China National Radio and Beijing City Radio. The ABC extended its successful partnership with the Shanghai Media Group and China Central Television (CCTV), and initiated partnerships with China Daily, Sina.com and Tencent. In Indonesia, the ABC also entered into numerous syndication agreements with local media organisations and in India, the ABC finalised an agreement with Prasar Bharati, the national broadcaster of India. Distribution over non-broadcast platforms included an extensive online presence, podcasts and a catch-up service featuring over 100 programs.

Recognising the value of partnerships, relevant content is made available for syndication, maximising exposure to the target audiences. In China, the ABC is maximising market penetration and expanding opportunities to deliver its content through partners. In 2012-13 the ABC extended its strategic partnership with Shanghai Media Group to include special content events, weekly news crosses and regular contributions to flagship magazine programs. In the reporting period, the ABC also signed memoranda of understanding with Beijing Television, China National Radio, China Radio International, and Beijing City Radio. In Indonesia the ABC made significant progress in ensuring its content is carried on the biggest online news media outlets, substantially expanding the reach of the best ABC content to new Indonesian audiences. The ABC entered into partnership agreements with Detik.com, Kompas.com, Tribunnews.com, Republika Online, and Metrotvnews.com.68 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESInternational audiences International Development ABC International Development works to support the development of robust media institutions in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a self-funding enterprise with representatives in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Australia. ABC International Development offers assistance in the form of strategic advice, training and mentoring, technical support and secondments. The core goals of these activities are to support communications for development in partner countries, and increase the demand for better governance. These goals align with the strategic direction of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the principal source of funding for ABC International Development. During 2012-13, International Development continued to advocate the benefits of \"Communication for Development\" (C4D) in delivering assistance to developing countries. This approach considers how individuals and organisations, with access to information and the opportunity to voice views and opinions, can influence the decisions that impact their lives. In 2012-13, International Development continued major programs with Papua New Guinea's National Broadcasting Corporation, the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation, media organisations across the Solomon Islands, three of Cambodia's Provincial Departments of Information as well as the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme, which is a long-term program to support the media in 14 Pacific countries. ABC International received approval from AusAID to commence a pilot initiative in Myanmar to assist the national broadcaster Myanmar Radio and Television produce radio programs aimed at providing maternal health information to women living in rural communities. The initiative is due to commence in the third quarter of 2013. International Relations The ABC's International Relations department facilitates interaction between the ABC and public broadcasters and broadcasting associations around the world. This is effected through participation at relevant regional conferences and forums, and through facilitating visits to Australia by international media organisations. The aim is to develop complementary partnerships, raise the profile of public broadcasting, support regional broadcasters and participate in relevant strategic forums. During the year, ABC International represented the ABC at various regional conferences, including: the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union's General Assembly in Seoul; the ABU-AIBD's Pacific Islands Media Partnership workshop in Samoa; DG7 (group of 7 international broadcasters) in Germany; the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting Association of Asia conference in Hong Kong; the Media Partners Asia Pay TV Operators Summit in Bali; and the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development's Asia Media Summit in Manado, Indonesia. In addition, ABC International facilitated visits from international media organisations from China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, India, Myanmar, India, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. n AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 69 2ABC COMMERCIAL provides a revenue stream through its commercial activities to assist the ABC to fulfil its Charter obligations as the national public broadcaster. ABC Commercial aims to enhance the experience and extend the engagement of ABC audiences by meeting their desire for enduring tangible products and services. The division is responsible for the management of a range of media businesses which create, license and market products and services related to the programming and Charter activities of the ABC. ABC Commercial is responsible for the development of new revenue streams for the Corporation, and continues to position itself to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the ever expanding digital market. Financial performance ABC Commercial's full year net result was $1.1 million, down from $5.5 million in 2011-12. ABC Commercial's full year result reflects the significant challenges facing the retail sector and the impact of declining product formats such as DVD. Despite above-budget performances from key businesses such as Music, Publishing, and News and Current Affairs Sales, as well as strong revenue growth results from Non-Theatric Sales, the performance of ABC Retail and ABC DVD (both traditionally major contributors to ABC Commercial's net profit) were the main impediment to a stronger result in 2012-13. A number of strategies were implemented to improve the short-term performance of ABC Retail, with specific regard to ABC Shops' market presence, product offering, customer experience and resourcing. Several opportunities were identified in 2012-13 for reform, and efficiencies have since been achieved through the new ABC Retail Agreement 2013-16 and a restructure of the Retail Support Office.ABC Commercial manages a range of media businesses delivering products and services to the global marketplace.

These changes, along with the implementation of proven retail methodologies, have all contributed to the improvement in performance most evident in the last few months of the financial year. ABC management and the ABC Board are closely monitoring ABC Retail's performance and are assessing the optimal operating model for the business in order to mitigate future risk. Contribution to revenue A proportion of the ABC's funding comes from its commercial activities.ABC Retail ABC Retail's strategy of transitioning from a DVD/ CD based product range to a broader product range encompassing children's toys, clothing and general merchandise continues to deliver improved results in these categories. Toys, clothing and general merchandise categories have grown to represent over 30% of ABC Retail turnover (from 8% in 2010). Sales of children's DVDs have shown growth on last year, and ABC Retail continues to leverage the interest in this category, along with a focus on the children's and adult books categories, both of which are performing well. ABC Commercial Amount contributed to ABC net revenue by ABC Commercial$1.1 million COMMERCIALAUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 71 2Revenue by activity The ABC generates revenue from a wide range of business activities.ABC Retail recently undertook a pricing review and implemented a strategy to improve the value proposition to customers in order to increase the average sale spend. Significantly improved results in May and June demonstrated that the strategy has had some early success. The ABC Shop's loyalty program, ABC ViP continued to grow and had registered more than 363 000 members at 30 June 2013, an increase of 26% from 2011-12. The ABC Retail Agreement 2013-16 was certified by the Fair Work Commission Australia in May 2013. The Agreement covers 294 ABC Retail employees and took effect in June 2013. The Agreement strikes a balance between two key business objectives: the need to ensure that ABC Retail continues to maintain a strong presence in the retail market; and the need to promote equity in the workplace, team engagement and career paths for employees. Percentage of ABC Commercial's revenue that came from its retail business67.3% 72 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESABC Commercial ABC Digital In May 2013 ABC Digital launched ABC Mathseeds, a fun, online mathematics program for children aged 3-6 years. Mathseeds was created by the same team that developed ABC Reading Eggs. It is designed to teach pre-schoolers core maths and problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. Mathseeds joins a suite of digital products, which includes the successful ABC Reading Eggs products and the Bananas in Pyjamas iOS apps. ABC Digital, in partnership with the University of Melbourne, and the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health launched the initial beta phase of the ABC's new brain training product, Active Memory, in June 2013. The product is a personalised brain training program. ABC Music and Events Music ABC Music's digital revenue continued to increase, further cementing this channel as a significant revenue stream and a means to deliver ABC Music content. This year, ABC Music focussed on digital products and developed concerted digital marketing campaigns for all releases. ABC Music's previous global digital distribution partner IODA was acquired by The Orchard during the reporting period. The Orchard is a large, pioneering, global leader in music and video distribution and the acquisition will mean that ABC Music now reaches over 125 digital service providers in 240 countries. This alliance also makes ABC Music's content more widely accessible on multiple platforms including Amazon.com, Spotify and YouTube.Following on from The Orchard's acquisition, ABC Music has been able to accelerate the project of uploading the back catalogue of ABC Classics onto The Orchard digital platform. Much of that back catalogue has not previously been available for download. During the year ABC Music released 213 titles: 101 titles for ABC Classics; and 112 titles for Contemporary (including 32 ABC for Kids titles). Many of these titles achieved top 20 places in the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) charts including triple j's Hottest 100 Volume 20 , triple j's Like a Version Volume 8 , triple j's Like a Version Anthology , Lee Kernaghan's Beautiful Noise, Classic 100-Music at the Movies , Amy Dickson's Catch Me If You Can and Joseph Tawadros Chameleons of the White Shadow . ABC Music released triple j's Hottest 100 Volume 20 in February 2013. The album reached number one on the ARIA charts upon release and achieved a record number of digital downloads for a Hottest 100 compilation. As at 30 June 2013, the album had sold over 94 000 copies and was the best selling release for 2013. Social media channels reflected the high level of interest and success of the album release. The reach of triple j's Hottest 100 Facebook page grew by 150% throughout the year, acquiring an additional 73 800 likes. At the end of the financial year, triple j's Like a Version Volume 8 had sold over 45 000 editions and triple j's Like a Version Anthology had sold over 35 000 copies. ABC Music's ABC for Kids label continued as the number one selling label for children in Australia. ABC Music titles were recognised in the November 2012 ARIAs with 7 awards from 23 nominations across 9 categories (see page 237).AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES 73 2The ABC returned to consumer affairs coverage with its new satirical show, The Checkout . Featuring Craig Reucassel and Julian Morrow ( ), Kirsten Drysdale ( Hungry Beast ) and Kate Brown from consumer group CHOICE, The Checkou t looks beyond the hype and spin and puts consumer issues in the spotlight. Drawing on CHOICE's expertise and research, The Checkout set out to challenge brands, retailers, industry and regulators to initiate debate and smarter spending decisions. The series included features on topical industries, products and services and the marketing and brand management that goes with them. Topics included milk permeate, ticketing agencies, therapeutic goods, baldness cures, pricing of digital music downloads and lengthy 'terms and conditions' agreements. The program also sought interaction with its audiences through a segment in which viewers made and submitted their own videos addressing their concerns and complaints, with the best included in that week's episode. COMMERCIAL The Checkout74 AUDIENCE EXPERIENCESEvents ABC Events staged 71 Giggle and Hoot and Friends shows since January 2013 reaching an audience of just over 56 000. The Giggle and Hoot and Friends show joins ABC Events' successful Play School concert series which also toured nationally during 2012-13. Throughout the year, over 75 000 children around Australia enjoyed ABC for Kids events at shopping centres, community festivals and key community events. During the year, the first Good Game Live event was held at the Sydney Opera House as part of the Graphic Festival. The event featured the presenters Bajo, Hex and the \"not so nice\" Robot Darren, along with a panel of gamers, in quiz show format. Logo licensed events through the year included: two major events with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, The Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular; Wallace and Gromit's Musical Marvels; a theatrical version of Yes, Prime Minister ; the Grand Designs Expo in Melbourne with host Kevin McCloud; and national tours by two British comedians Bill Bailey and Jack Dee. ABC Publishing and Licensing Publishing During the year, ABC Books published approximately 90 new titles in print form and approximately 95 titles in eBook format.

Two new titles were launched by ABC Magazines for preschoolers and children over the reporting period: Giggle and Hoot and The Octonauts . In the Audit Bureau of Circulation report for June-December 2012, ABC delicious magazine was audited at 115 162 copies, an increase of 4.6% on the previous audit reporting period of January to May 2012. This increase is a positive result given the overall decline in the total magazine market of 5.8% during that period. As at 30 June 2013, ABC delicious held a 16.5% share of the food category and maintained its presence internationally with magazines published in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. The ABC delicious home wares range was also launched in the United Kingdom. Licensing Licensing continued to deliver excellent sales throughout the year with Giggle and Hoot merchandise remaining strong. ABC Licensing extended the Giggle and Hoot merchandise range to include back-to-school merchandise (such as lunch boxes), footwear, headwear, eyewear and other accessories. The Giggle and Hoot brand continued to be stocked in the major retailers, Target, Big W, Myer and Toys R Us. The new Giggleosauras Plush Toy was also released during 2012-13. New Play School apparel and toys were similarly launched, including back packs, clothing, umbrellas, building blocks and puzzles.

These partners include: Microsoft; Sony; Samsung; Google Play; iTunes (Europe); and the aggregator, Cinedigm which manages sales to key platforms in the Americas. ABC Commercial has been a distribution partner with BBC Worldwide on the release of audio-visual products in Australia for in excess of 15 years. In 2012-13, the BBC announced its decision to shift broadcast platforms to subscription television. This decision is expected to reduce revenue for BBC/ABC co-branded DVDs and BluRays in future years. Content Sales Format sales continue to grow with added marketing support and international exposure. Notable recent format sales have been for Who's Been Sleeping In My House and Review with Myles Barlow . The Four Corners investigative documentary \" The World According to Lance\" has been sold to over 15 countries. ABC Library Sales Programs have managed to minimise the impact of the decline in the DVD market through the distribution of a wider selection of non-ABC broadcast content, a more diverse range of licensing options and stronger marketing initiatives. Library Sales Programs have worked with physiotherapist Anna Louise Bouvier to develop Happy Body at Work , a new multimedia training program aimed at government and business clients. The launch is planned for October 2013.

The ABC Editorial Policies are the ABC's leading standards and a day-to-day reference for makers of content for radio, television, online and print. They give practical shape to statutory obligations in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , in particular the obligations to: provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. The ABC Editorial Policies set out the ABC's self- regulatory standards and how the Corporation enforces them. They are also the source of the ABC Code of Practice , which the ABC notifies to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). Management of editorial matters The Editorial Policies Division was established in January 2007 with a mandate to rethink and rewrite the ABC Editorial Policies with convergence in mind; reform the self-regulation framework; adapt policy to the impact of social media; and modernise the system of free election broadcasts by eligible political parties. By the end of 2012, these tasks were complete and the ABC had a well established and sophisticated approach to issues of editorial standards and governance. Following the departure of Paul Chadwick (Director Editorial Policies), the Editorial Policies division is being restructured. The Editorial Policies Group (EPG), which reports directly to the Managing Director, is responsible for providing advice to the Corporation in relation to the interpretation and application of the ABC Editorial Policies , as well as for the ongoing review and revision of those policies. This advice is provided in conjunction with editorial policy specialists within each content-making division who deal with day-to-day editorial issues, following the longstanding procedure for upward referral. The ABC Editorial Policies are the principles and standards which are applied across the Corporation to maintain high-quality output and performance.ABC Editorial Policies Management of editorial matters Review of editorial standardsMaintaining high standards Election coverage review80 INSIDE THE ABCEditorial standards The EPG meets monthly to share information and advice about issues that arise across the ABC in order to improve the clarity and consistency of the ABC Editorial Policies and their application. The EPG chair is filled on a six-monthly rotating basis by appointment from the Managing Director. Review of editorial standards Ongoing review and revision of the ABC Editorial Policies and ABC Code of Practice ensures the standards stay up-to-date and effective in a fast-changing media environment. The EPG undertakes regular consultation with the ABC's content-making divisions in order to identify areas of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice that may require amendment and assesses whether additional or revised Guidance Notes or policies may also be required. Guidance Notes underpin and explain the application of the ABC Editorial Policies . Guidance Notes are developed through the EPG and are authorised by the Managing Director. In 2012-13, the following Guidance Notes were issued or revised: Northern Territory election 2012 (issued 10 July 2012) Australian Capital Territory election 2012 (issued 27 August 2012) Children and young people: Managing their participation online (revised 9 October 2012) West Australian election 2013 (issued 24 January 2013); and Secret recording devices in news, current affairs and other factual content (revised 17 May 2013). Amendments to the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice must be approved by the ABC Board.On 28 June 2012, the Board approved an amendment to the ABC Code of Practice which came into effect on 1 January 2013. The amendment to the Television Program Classification Associated Standard involved changes to the classification time-zones to better reflect the specialised nature of the ABC's digital multi-channels. The Television Program Classification Associated Standard now contains different time-zone charts for each service, replacing the single framework which was previously in place to manage the classification of programs on all ABC television services (other than ABC News 24 which is not subject to classification requirements). Some modifications were made to the time-zones. The ABC Code of Practice is set out in Appendix 5 (page 222). The ABC Editorial Policies and Guidance Notes are available at about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/ what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies. Maintaining high standards The ABC ensures compliance with the ABC Editorial Policies through regular training and monitoring, as well as through well established complaints-handling processes. See Section 3, Inside the ABC (Editorial Standards) and Section 5, Governance (Complaint Handling). Outcomes of complaints are discussed within program teams and used as a tool for continuous improvement. As required, tailored editorial policy training was provided to independent producers who work with the ABC, and editorial policy guidance is provided on the ABC's Independent Production site: abc.net.au/tv/independent. \"Editorial Policies Month\" is an ongoing annual training initiative in the Radio Division which aims to strengthen editorial policies skills. Activities are designed to sharpen ongoing application of editorial policies in content making. A range of activities are planned around regular team editorial meetings to discuss real case studies and scenarios. Sessions are run in a radio format with a panel of experts from INSIDE THE ABC 81 3across the ABC providing staff with the opportunity to pose questions via talkback. A new Editorial Policies Tumblr delivered a \"daily dose\" of editorial experiences, tips and advice through multimedia capsules accessible to all staff through their computer and at their own convenience. It provides an ongoing repository and resource for Ed Pols training. Editorial Policies Month concluded with an event on 12 September on Reporting Elections for our Audiences , which was held in Sydney's Studio 227. Editorial Policies training is a compulsory component of Induction training for new Radio employees. In 2012-13, employees with editorial responsibilities in the ABC Television Division were given access to a range of training opportunities: Nine Editorial Policies overview workshops, designed for new starters (attended by 50 employees) Eight specialist Editorial Policy workshops, designed for senior editorial managers and tailored groups (attended by 27 employees) Six Moderating UGC and Facebook workshops (attended by 19 employees); and Five classification information sessions (attended by 26 employees).Election Coverage Review When an election is called in any Australian jurisdiction, the ABC convenes an Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) to administer the free time election broadcasts system, under which the ABC broadcasts announcements by eligible political parties, and to monitor coverage to ensure adherence to standards. The Chair of the ECRC is appointed by the Managing Director.The ECRC monitors the amount of coverage given to candidates and party officials (share-of-voice data) across ABC platforms to ensure that ABC standards are upheld. This data assists the ABC in ensuring that election coverage meets requirements. Share-of-voice data is not intended to be a definitive measure of impartiality. The ECRC Chair also administers the ABC's allocation of free broadcast time to political parties during election campaigns. Under this arrangement, the ABC makes allocations of free broadcast time on ABC Radio and Television during federal, state and territory election campaigns for party political purposes. Elections were held in the Northern Territory on 25 August 2012, in the Australian Capital Territory on 14 September 2012 and in Western Australia on 9 March 2013. nIn May 2013, the ABC launched its new online arts portal\u2014a genuine multi-platform offering that brings together the best of the ABC's arts content. The new portal features coverage from ABC Television, ABC Radio and ABC Online, with short-form video, artworks and text based blogs and also provides a space for collaboration for the arts sector across the country. The portal is a vibrant online presence that not only mines the rich arts coverage on offer across the ABC, but also commissions exclusive online content including long-form articles, mini arts documentaries and artworks. It is the place to catch up on the day's arts news, listen to great arts stories from ABC Radio, watch short and long-form arts documentaries, and read in-depth arts journalism from some of Australia's leading critical thinkers.

Technology roadmaps set out divisional challenges and imperatives, as well as ABC-wide objectives, providing opportunities for increased collaboration and alignment of activities. Work commenced on the development of an ABC-wide ICT Enterprise Architecture which will guide the ongoing implementation of technology projects. During 2012-13, a range of process and systems changes were implemented to improve technology service delivery. A new broadcast support and office-based technology model has been implemented ensuring greater alignment with current ABC business needs, and enhanced service and reductions in costs have been achieved through standardisation of infrastructure with niche broadcast-industry technology vendors. The ABC commenced work on the first stage of the implementation of an integrated media system, which will replace the three existing delivery systems for daily news and radio programming. Technology security was a key issue for the ABC in 2013. On 27 February, the ABC became aware that a third-party website associated with an ABC Television program had been hacked. The website was the companion site to the television series Making Australia Happy which was broadcast in late 2010, and contained audience data. The ABC immediately deactivated the site and notified affected audience members of the breach. The ABC undertook an assessment of all other sites which hold audience data to assess and, as needed, aleviate security risks. The Operations Group provides and maintains many of the critical resources needed to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the ABC's core business. INSIDE THE ABC 83 3Notes 1. No. of Transmitters: The number of transmitters includes both analog and digital television and radio. If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days it is included within the report. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Provider): The transmission network performance is reported by Broadcast Australia as a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by the ABC as detailed in contract management plans. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to an SLA or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis.4. Total \"On-Air\" Availability: The figures show \"off-air\" occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and / or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken at night so as to lessen the impact on audiences. General CommentsDuring the period the total number of analog television transmission services declined compared to the previous year due to the conversion of analog television to digital television. Overall almost all networks indicated slight improvement in on-air availability and the overall transmission performance was in line with expectations. Rather than have a service off-air completely with no signal to the audience, the ABC agreed to operate services below specification whilst the issues were corrected by the supplier. The figures reported above relate to ABC transmission services under direct contract. The ABC has no control over ABC television and radio services retransmitted under Sections 212 or 212A of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Performance 2012 -13 No. of Broadcast Australia Total Network Total \"On-Air\" ABC Service Transmitters Transmission Network Availability Availability (See Note 1) (See Note 2) (See Note 3) (See Note 4) Target 2012-13 2011 -12 2012-13 2011 -12 2012-13 2011 -12 % % % % % % % Classic FM 68 99.83 99.93 99.90 94.13 92.73 99.83 99.85 99.97 Analog Radio and NSW/ACT 198 99.80 Digital Television 99.80 99.56 99.75 99.64 * Figures do not include DAB+84 INSIDE THE ABCInfrastructure and operations Transmission and distribution of ABC services Digital television conversion continued at an increased pace in 2012-13, with the network reaching 98.53% of Australians by the end of 2012. By 30 June 2013, all regions had converted other than the Darwin, Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas and some remote areas. Seven new ABC NewsRadio terrestrial analog radio transmitters were added to the network in regional Queensland and New South Wales. Remote Area Broadcast Service (RABS) satellite radio channels were converted to Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST). The VAST service will bring operational and resiliency benefits to the ABC's existing distribution networks. A number of additional channels were also added to the VAST service, including ABC Local Radio and Radio National Tasmania, and the ABC Digital Radio channels: triple j Unearthed; Grandstand; ABC Digital Extra; ABC Country; ABC Jazz; and ABC Dig. Regional terrestrial radio transmission sites served by the RABS satellite also commenced the change to VAST. Two specialised emergency radio channels were also added to the VAST system. These can be activated at any time to assist with ABC emergency services broadcasts. Terrestrial fibre and other video and audio links were transferred to new Telstra services as the new Telstra Digital Video Network II was tested and installed. Australia Network television operations were transferred to MediaHub, with a new international satellite uplink established at Oxford Falls, New South Wales for distribution of Australia Network services in the Pacific, Asia and Indian regions.ABC Broadcasting Coverage as at June 2013 Proportion of the population able to receive transmissions from ABC broadcasting services Australia NSW/ACT Vic Qld WA SA Tas 0.00% 0.68% 0.00% derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2011 Census data.

As part of the ABC's emergency broadcasting activities, ABC crews covered floods in Queensland and New South Wales; fires in Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales; and a cyclone off Western Australia. The ABC continues to deploy new technology, consolidate services and improve workflows to deliver increased services, with an emphasis on improving mobile facilities. This included the supply of a new Outside Broadcast (OB) vehicle in the Northern Territory as two other OB vehicles underwent technology refits. There was a significant increase in live-linking with portable facilities acting as a back-up/secondary facility; boosting reporting capability for ABC News in rural, regional and capital cities. New links were ordered for New South Wales and Victoria and portable Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) link kits were delivered to other states. The move to tapeless technology in ABC productions continued in 2012-13. ABC News systems were further improved by in-house designed file based syndication software that speeds the transfer of files across the network. The extensive resources of the ABC's archives were utilised in support of a range of ABC activities, including delivering content across a range of platforms.Embracing mobileAudiences' interaction with the ABC is increasingly on a mobile device, connected to the internet and with a sophisticated operating system. The mobility of these devices facilitates media access across a range of locations and situations, and has expanded the number of media 'occasions' in day to day life\u2014people are looking to fill these occasions with small pieces of news, information and entertainment and the ABC is placing a priority on being a part of those occasions. The ABC sees mobile as an opportunity to enrich and deepen the audience's experience of its services. The ABC initiated a number of projects to ensure it is keeping up with changing audience behaviour. The ABC's new adaptive delivery platform senses what kind of mobile device a person is using to access ABC Online and then sends them the most appropriate web page for that device. Using this technology, the ABC also built a version of the ABC homepage optimised for smartphones. In the past year, the ABC released refreshed flagship ABC apps for iPad, iPhone and Android, offering new functionality and a more intuitive user experience. INFRASTRUCTURE86 INSIDE THE ABCInfrastructure and operations There were further improvements in the delivery of television and radio services by ABC Broadcast Operations and MediaHub. Continued television service improvements saw on-air faults fall for the second consecutive year, from 279 in 2011-12 to 263 in 2012-13. Faults-per-hour of broadcast were lower than at any time recorded in the ABC's television history. The total number of fault-free days across all television services also improved, increasing to 186 (from 175 in 2011-12). Total radio faults (all networks and local services) fell in 2012-13 to 1 190 incidents (from 1 295 in 2011-12). Available labour and spare facilities capacity was sold to the market, generating a net return of $1.65 million (a decrease of $140 000 from 2011-12). The decline in revenue was primarily due to an overall decline in available capacity for external hire. Improving digital delivery Content Delivery Network A new web content management system has been implemented. The system will improve the production and delivery of digital content created by ABC News and ABC Radio. The next phase of the project will provide all ABC online and digital content producers access to enhanced tools, including mobile website, video player and social media interfaces. This project is an integral part of the ABC's digital strategy, through which the ABC seeks to connect with audiences on the mobile platform of their choice.Capital works Parliamentary approval and Federal Government support for the construction of the ABC's new Melbourne headquarters was received in 2012-13. Collocation of operations at Southbank will further encourage engagement with audiences; enrich content creation, re-use and delivery; streamline processes and workflows; and facilitate improved flexibility by providing integrated and sustainable systems to keep the ABC on-air and online. The proposed design integrates the new building with the current Southbank premises to deliver a single contemporary building. The consolidated building will accommodate Melbourne staff and facilities across all operational and program-making areas. The new ABC Mackay premises were opened in June 2013 by Managing Director Mark Scott in a community celebration. The building has been located to minimise the impact of flooding and is built to a Category 4 cyclone rating. In addition, the building has a four-star NABERS rating (National Australian Built Environment Rating System). Combined with state-of-the-art production areas, the new premises provide the region with enhanced media service capability and reliability. n INSIDE THE ABC 87 3IN 2013, THE ABC was recognised as Australia's most attractive employer at the annual Randstad awards, which measure employer attractiveness. In 2012-13, the ABC employed 5 446 people across every state and territory, equivalent to 4 664 full-time employees. The majority of staff were content makers. ABC values and workplace behaviour The ABC strives to foster a values-based culture, incorporating its values\u2014Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation\u2014into all aspects of its organisational behaviour. The ABC Values, and values-based behaviour, are embedded in the performance management system for all ABC Executives. The Executive Behavioural Framework is a values-based capability framework linked to how Executives achieve their performance objectives. The inclusion of the Framework provides an opportunity to measure how the ABC Values are translated into appropriate behaviours and enables feedback to be given on the way Executives demonstrate the values in action. ABC policies and procedures, including the Conflict of Interest Policy , which was developed as part of a move towards a more values-based culture at the ABC, and the Workplace Behaviour Policy underpin the ABC Values and provide guidance about appropriate behaviour. Different areas across the ABC, including the Operations Group and People and Learning, are actively promoting and recognising values-based behaviour with recognition programs and awards for employees who best exemplify the ABC Values in action. ABC people The ABC is a diverse organisation with staff working across Australia and the world. The success of the Corporation is built on the commitment, creativity and skills of its people. ABC values and workplace behaviour Training and development Industrial instruments88 INSIDE THE ABCABC people ABC Values were also reflected in strategies arising from the ABC's Equity and Diversity Plan and Reconciliation Action Plan . Corporate values and ethical decision-making are incorporated as key reference points in the ABC's media leadership training programs. Training and development The ABC provided a range of training and development opportunities focused on both strategic and operational priorities. Training and development was provided via classroom based courses and seminars, on-the-job projects, coaching sessions and remotely, using webinars and eLearning packages. Formal structured training was offered across 27 skill areas including digital skills, editorial quality, leadership and management, technical operations, cross-media production, and health and safety. Throughout 2012-13 the ABC continued to prioritise the delivery of training in digital skills, editorial quality and leadership and management. Priority was also given to the design and delivery of development programs that supported major change initiatives, such as the ABC Newsgathering Project (see page 54). A breakdown of training provided in 2012-13 by category, duration and participation is available at about.abc.net.au/what-guides-us/corporate responsibility.Total Training Hours Almost 71 000 hours of structured training were delivered in 2012-13, supported by less formal development activities such as mentoring programs, scholarships and master-classes.

Development opportunities are targeted and relevant. As much as possible, training is accessible to all staff regardless of location. This has led to an increase in flexible, virtual and blended learning delivery, and a decrease in classroom-based activities. The provision of training via webinar continued to rise in 2012-13 with over 80 sessions available to staff in regional and remote areas, and more than 40 courses available to staff through the online training portal \"ABC Connect\". 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500TechnologistSenior ExecutiveRetail Staf fContent MakerAdministrative/ Professional INSIDE THE ABC 89 3By division Distribution of staff by division shows how the ABC is allocating its resources within its internal structure.By job group The ABC employs staff across five broad categories, each of which performs an important function in the ABC's operations.Distribution of employees By region The distribution of staff by region demonstrates the ABC's localism, as well as the spread of employment opportunities offered by the ABC.

This training enabled staff to keep up to date with technological changes and to incorporate new tools and platforms in to their work. Over 20 000 hours of training were delivered in this category, with courses ranging from desktop editing to social media. Editorial training The focus of editorial training in 2012-13 was the introduction of a new program for senior staff in all content areas on Editorial Leadership. The three-day course was attended by 88 editorial decision makers from five divisions across the country. This program focused on strengthening editorial leadership at the ABC to support the consistent application of high editorial standards. Editorial policies training was also delivered to content making staff across the News, Radio, Television and Innovation divisions via webinar, conference presentations, classroom sessions and online. Leadership training In 2012-13 a total of 39 employees participated in targeted leadership and management programs, with an additional 88 employees attending editorial leadership programs (see above). The ABC Managers' Program was attended by 23 staff members from nine divisions across the ABC. Over a six-month period, participants studied team leadership and management principles, and on successful completion received a Diploma of Management from the University of New England.The Advanced Media Leadership Series was completed by 16 staff members in 2012-13. This was a new program focussing on specific skills required to lead in a broadcast environment. Participants were drawn from offices in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra, and were selected jointly by the Managing Director and Divisional Directors. The modules studied included a Social Leadership project, where participants were able to use the skills they developed working with non-profit making organisations on a real-life improvement project. The Advanced Media Leadership Series replaced the Advanced Managers Program and the Accelerated Leaders course.

The Agreement sets the terms and conditions of employment for approximately 4 000 employees, who are classified as Content Makers, Technologists or Admin/Professionals. The ABC initiated bargaining with the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) and the Media Entertainment Arts Alliance (MEAA) (as bargaining representatives for employees) for a new Agreement on 1 April 2013. It is anticipated that a new Agreement will be approved by employees and lodged with Fair Work Australia in the second half of 2013. The ABC Retail Agreement 2013-2016 was certified by the Fair Work Commission on 28 May 2013. The finalisation of the Agreement was the result of constructive consultation and negotiation between the ABC bargaining team, ABC Retail employees and the CPSU bargaining representatives. The new ABC Retail Agreement 2013-16 covers almost 300 ABC employees. It took effect on 5 June 2013. n In March 2013, legislative amendments were made to the ABC's Charter to expressly reflect the range of existing services, including online activities, currently provided by the Corporation. The existing Charter was devised in 1983, long before the arrival of digital platforms. The amendments were the most significant changes to the ABC's Charter and Act in its thirty year history. The changes recognise that an increasing proportion of Australians now use online and mobile devices and that if the ABC is to honour its role to \"inform, educate and entertain\", then the reality of convergence must be written into its mission statement. The incorporation of the ABC's responsibilities in digital media have secured the ABC's role in the digital future and acknowledges the immense contribution the ABC has made to digital media since ABC Online began almost two decades ago. The ABC also welcomed the change to its Charter to include the provision of international services by the ABC as it recognises the ABC as the appropriate broadcaster responsible for providing these important services. 92 INSIDE THE ABCHealth and Safety Management of WHS On 16 July 2012, the ABC launched a three-year Work Health and Safety (WHS) project to improve safety performance across the ABC. The ABC engaged external consultants The Brief Group to: conduct an extensive review of the ABC's existing WHS management systems; advise on areas of strength and weakness; develop a new WHS management system; and assist with the development of appropriate WHS management plans. The first stage of the project\u2014the organisational review\u2014was conducted between November 2012 and March 2013. The second stage\u2014The Brief Group's analysis and reporting of the results of their assessment\u2014commenced in June 2013 and will continue through the second half of 2013. The Managing Director and Board monitor the progress of the project at each Board meeting. Health and safety induction In 2012-13, there was 88% compliance with the ABC's compulsory Day One OHS and Workplace Behaviours Induction program, an increase from 79.1% in 2011-12. The program is delivered to new employees on their first day or shift. Attendance at induction is required for new and recommencing full-time, part-time, specified task and specified contract employees. Completion of the program by employees engaged in other forms of employment (such as casual, sessional and run-of-show) is currently not measured. New employees engaged for six weeks or longer are also required to complete the ABC Online Induction program. In 2012-13, there was 79% compliance with this requirement.Management of WHS Health and safety induction Work-related incidentsWorkers' compensation claims Notices and investigations Workers' compensation premiums Health and safety committees The ABC aims to achieve the highest standards of work health and safety across all aspects of its operations and locations by providing a safe environment to prevent the ongoing effects of work-related injury and illnesses to its workers and visitors.INSIDE THE ABC 93 3Work-related incidents ABC Worksafe is the ABC's database for recording all WHS incidents, including those to visitors, contractors and ABC employees. In 2012-13, a total of 237 work-related incidents were reported in ABC Worksafe (compared with 275 in 2011-12). An additional 26 incidents were reported but were categorised as \"non work-related\". 101 One incident was incorrectly reported twice. An incident is notifiable to Comcare if it results in death, medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital, immediate treatment for a serious injury, infection with a prescribed illness, or involves a dangerous occurrence. The ABC must ensure that notification is made to Comcare immediately after becoming aware that a notifiable incident has occurred. In 2012-13, of the 237 work-related incidents at the ABC, three were notifiable incidents and Comcare was notified accordingly. 102 % Incident Severity Total of total No treatment required/no injury 50 21.1% Near hit incident/no treatment required 29 12.2% Dangerous occurrence 15 6.3% First aid treatment only 64 27.0% Prescribed illness 1 0.8% Personal injury/illness- Off work for one day or less 54 22.4% Serious personal injury/illness- Off work for two days or more 20 8.4% Medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital 3 1.3% Personal injury\u2014treatment by GP or hospital and incapacity for 30 days or more 1 0.4% Fatality 0 0 0 Total 237 100% 101 Non-work related incidents consisted of 13 reported incidents commuting to work, 11 personal illness reports, and two motor vehicle accident/insurance reports. 102 A total of seven incidents were notified by the ABC. Four were downgraded by Comcare as not notifiable.In 2012-13 the ABC changed its reporting criteria to better reflect the consequence of illness and injuries reported, and to align the ABC's WHS incident reporting with the incident notification requirements in Part 3 of the Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act 2011 . Once an incident is notified in ABC Worksafe, the nominated line manager is responsible for managing the incident, investigating the root causes and contributing factors surrounding the incident, and implementing reasonably practicable WHS risk control measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. When required, assistance was provided by the WHS Manager. As at 30 June 2013, these steps had been completed in 70% of the work-related incidents which occurred in 2012-13.

There have been significant reductions in the number of claims relating to falls, trips and slips of a person, hitting objects with a part of the body, and being hit by moving objects. These reductions reflect increased awareness of health and safety in the workplace, as well as changes in the nature and scale of the ABC's operations in areas where these incidents are most common. The number of mental stress claims has decreased since 2009 -10. The costs of mental stress claims however, are high relative to other claim types and therefore represent a significant percentage of total workers' compensation costs for the ABC. The three claims covered in the 'other and unspecified' mechanism of injury category are diagnostically unique, complex or involve post-treatment complications that require extended periods off work. As a result, these claims have a relatively high average cost. 103 A further 21 claims were accepted in 2012-13 relating to incidents which occurred in previous reporting periods.Number of claims by mechanism of incident group Average Mechanism of Incident cost-to-date ($) Number of claims Major Groups (2012-13) 2012-13* 2011-12* 2010 -11* 2009 -10 Falls, trips and slips of a person 6 917 11 17 19 22 Hitting objects with a part of the body 29 303 1 7 6 8 Being hit by moving objects 9 999 3 6 5 9 Sound and pressure 1 589 1 0 1 0 Body stressing 6 194 23 52 49 61 Heat, electricity and other environmental factors 0 0 0 1 1 Chemicals and other substances 0 0 0 1 0 Biological factors 0 0 0 0 1 Mental stress 41 565 1 4 5 4 Other and unspecified 39 851 3 2 5 2 All claims 10 296 43 88 92 108 * The data is immature and the ultimate number and cost of accepted claims may differ from the data reported as new claims may be lodged in a later period.

Comcare has the power to conduct an investigation at an ABC workplace at any time to ascertain whether the requirements of WHS legislation are being complied with, regarding a breach or suspected breach, or concerning an accident or dangerous occurrence that has occurred. In 2012-13, Comcare conducted one investigation on 25 July 2012, being a verification inspection to review the actions taken regarding recommendations made in an earlier Comcare Investigation Report. The ABC has met the commitments and agreed outcomes identified in the Inspector Report dated 26 July 2012. Workers' compensation premiums In July 2012 the ABC's workers' compensation premium rate was set for 2012-13 at 1.92%. This figure was reported by Comcare to be the result of worse-than-average performance in ABC injury prevention and management when compared to other Comcare-insured agencies in 2011-12 (1.77%). This premium rate was revised downward in June 2013 to 1.74% primarily due to a significant improvement in injury prevention and actual claim numbers in 2012. The overall premium rate for all Commonwealth agencies combined has increased to 1.81% for 2013-14 to meet the estimated cost of claims in the scheme, specifically due to an increase in the length of time it takes to return injured workers to employment. The ABC workers' compensation premium for 2013-14 is $7.2 million, a reduction of $1.4 million from 2012-13. This reduction is primarily due to the decrease in the number of claims in 2012. The ABC was due to receive a bonus of $812 115 in 2012-13 due to the revision of the premium rate. However, an actuarial assessment of scheme funding up to June 2012 undertaken by Comcare found an underpayment of premiums by all agencies since 2002. Accordingly, the ABC bonus was converted to a $21 855 penalty, with the difference of $790 260 being the ABC's contribution to the underfunding ratio (currently 65%). Health and safety committees Health and Safety Committees have been established in each state and territory. Health and safety is also monitored nationally by three committees which focus on specific operational areas: the National ABC Resources WHS Committee; National Radio WHS Committee; and the National Technology WHS Representative Committee. Membership of the state and territory WHS Committees is in accordance with the current ABC Health and Safety Management Arrangements. Details of membership and meeting dates of each Committee are available at about.abc.net.au/what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility. n ABC Workers' Compensation premium rates ABC performance against Australian government agencies combined Premium rates 2013 -14 2012-13 2011-12 2010 -2011 2009 -10 1.20% 1.25% 96 INSIDE THE ABCCorporate functions Corporate Strategy The Strategic Policy Group provides analysis and advice to the ABC Board and management on technological innovations, regulatory changes and world-wide media trends to inform strategy formation and decision-making. It supports the Audience Strategy Group.

The trailer visits a range of events and, more recently, schools throughout Australia. In the past year the trailer has travelled over 12 000kms, covered seven states and territories, exhibited at over 14 events, visited 22 schools and recorded more than 5 730 television and radio performances in the mock studios on board.Public tours of the ABC Ultimo Centre in Sydney attracted 6 387 visitors to the complex in 2012-13. A total of 4 594 students from different schools and colleges, 1 087 seniors from community groups, and 706 adults visited the centre. Currently there are 19 volunteer tour guides in the Ultimo Tours program. State and Territory Directors Reporting to the Director of Corporate Affairs, the State and Territory Directors represent the ABC at a local level across Australia. They play a key external role in communicating the ABC's strategic objectives, liaising with stakeholders, as well as building relationships with local communities and providing a central point of contact. Internally, the Directors oversee the business of the ABC in their regions to promote and facilitate whole-of-business and cross-divisional outcomes in line with strategic goals. State and Territory Directors undertake a range of strategic and innovative project work and chair or make significant contributions to a range of ABC national bodies, including the Work Health and Safety Committee, the Corporate Responsibility Group, the Election Coverage Review Committee and the Executive Risk Committee. State and Territory Directors also chair local Leadership teams, Workplace Giving Committees and Green@Work Committees. They actively support the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan, with involvement in the work of the Bonner Committee, leadership of local Indigenous Working Groups, building relationships with local Indigenous communities, developing employment opportunities and coordinating local activities for both Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC Week. State and Territory Directors co-ordinate local emergency work chairing Emergency Planning Committees, leading any emergency response, as well as maintaining contact with external emergency agencies, ensuring that protocols are in place for emergency broadcasting and business continuity.98 INSIDE THE ABCCorporate functions Buildings and accommodation are a key responsibility. The Victorian State Director has a leadership role in the Melbourne Accommodation Project which will develop new integrated premises for the ABC in Victoria. To enhance relationships with local communities State and Territory Directors participate in or chair more than 20 external advisory committees, boards, trusts and foundations and attend many external events and functions. Directors also host a number of community forums where the ABC gathers first-hand feedback from audiences, particularly those in regional Australia. Legal ABC Legal provides a comprehensive range of legal services to the Corporation including pre-publication advice on a 24-hour, seven-days-per-week basis; conducting litigation on behalf of the Corporation; providing advice on contractual and rights issues, regulatory regimes and the statutory obligations of ABC divisions; and providing advice on legal aspects of policy issues and developing submissions to parliament, government and other organisations about law reform including the Convergence Review. This review ultimately resulted in an amendment to the ABC Charter in March 2013 to explicitly recognise online and other digital media services provided by the ABC. ABC Legal contracted over 100 television productions during 2012-13. These included programs such as The Agony of Life, Whitlam, Gardening Australia, Carlotta, Tractor Monkeys, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries Series 2, Rake Series 3, Wednesday Night Fever and The Broken Shore . Lawyers also assisted the Radio and News divisions on a large number of matters including the renewal of the National Rugby League radio rights, providing advice on complex rights issues during the ABC's coverage of the London Olympics and Paralympics, and ensuring international news agency arrangements were in place for the ABC's cross platform needs. In 2012-13, ABC Legal also provided pre-publication advice on a number of controversial programs, including for Four Corners, Lateline, 7.30, Background Briefing, Australian Story and The Checkout . In 2012-13, ABC Legal drafted and negotiated a five-year agreement with Telstra to provide the ABC with managed data networks, mobile data and voice services, fixed voice services and digital video network services. Legal also assisted the Technology and Communications Networks teams to negotiate contracts for digital television associated with the restack of radio frequency spectrum and the continuing rollout of digital television services across Australia. ABC Legal assisted Innovation with the negotiation of a variety of contracts related to the launch of the ABC's education portal ABC Splash. Legal continued its media law training program, which is aimed at minimising the ABC's exposure to legal proceedings, while enabling stories to be told, by delivering a series of specialised media law workshops for journalists and content-makers across all ABC divisions. The program covers topics such as contempt of court and defamation. Business Affairs Business Affairs is responsible for negotiating the rights required by the ABC in content produced, commissioned and acquired by the ABC including ABC International, as well as associated rights required by ABC Commercial. In 2012-13 Business Affairs continued to negotiate the renewal of the ABC's contractual relationship with the state symphony orchestras. Business Affairs has also assisted the ABC's Innovation division, in consultation with ABC Television and ABC Commercial, on the commissioning process and rights requirements for ABC Splash.INSIDE THE ABC 99 3Business Affairs has worked closely with ABC Television to finalise new terms of trade with the independent production sector, which are an important part of the ABC's commitment to transparency in its dealings. These new terms respond to the changing media environment and secure the ABC's strategy to consolidate its online presence through iview. Business Affairs have also continued to streamline the contracting process which will ensure the ABC is responsive to changes in the industry for the production, financing and distribution of television content. Business Affairs works in consultation with, but independently of, the ABC output divisions and continues to play an important role in corporate governance. Business Affairs has worked closely with the Television Division to update procedures for commissioning programs and to implement a new governance framework for acquiring programs. Work has been undertaken to streamline and standardise the cross-divisional approval of high value program acquisitions. Business Affairs has continued to work with all ABC divisions to maintain fairness, consistency and value for money in the ABC's deal terms and to secure the necessary rights for the ABC's broadcast and digital strategy. 2012-13 saw a significant growth in the workload of drama production and, with the support of ABC Television, Legal and Business Affairs have successfully managed and finalised the negotiation and contracting of these complex deals. nThe ABC is a trusted source of educative and entertaining content for children.

In 2012, the ABC4Kids and ABC3 platforms were joined by ABC Splash, a specialist online portal featuring the best Australian educative content from ABC television and radio, curated and mapped for students, teachers and parents. The Splash library now includes over 750 items. The March 2013 launch of Splash was timed to coincide with the final event of 'Splash Live', an initiative where students created news stories about local sustainability issues. Junior reporters were responsible for all stages of story creation, including generating an original story idea, interviewing and filming local community members and editing their news reports. The final Splash Live event at the Splash launch allowed students to present their news stories in a four-way live video conference with students from other schools.ABC Splash website ONLINEThe role of the Corporate Responsibility report is to provide an assessment of the ABC's performance against the high standards it has set for itself for corporate citizenship, social responsibility and environmental sustainability.

However, responsibility for implementing and demonstrating corporate social responsibility rests with every employee and manager across the Corporation. A number of senior management positions within the ABC include a reference to corporate responsibility priorities as part of their roles, including: Head Corporate Governance; Equity and Diversity Manager; Green at Work National Coordinator; Work Health and Safety Manager; Manager Risk and Insurance; and State and Territory Directors. The ABC's Corporate Social Responsibility Policy reinforces the ABC's commitment to acting ethically and responsibly in all areas of its operations. The Policy outlines the ABC's commitment to key principles of corporate social responsibility, which include adhering to relevant laws and regulations, respecting human rights, and engaging with both internal and external stakeholder groups. The Corporate Responsibility Group (CRG) was established at the end of 2009 to help integrate responsible Corporate practices and reporting across the corporation. In 2012-13, the CRG met five times. Meetings covered topics related to the ABC's procurement policies and practices, energy consumption and management and waste disposal and measurement. Other topics included the ABC's work health and safety performance, and trends and legislative changes shaping equity and diversity priorities for the ABC, such as accessibility and workplace flexibility. The Group also re-evaluated the organisation's corporate responsibility priorities to identify those areas representing the greatest risk to the Corporation and the greatest opportunity for improvement in performance.The ABC is committed to fulfilling its functions in a manner that is ethical, financially responsible, minimises any adverse impacts on the environment and individuals, and is beneficial to the community.Management of corporate responsibility Reporting performance Scope and boundaryMateriality Stakeholder inclusiveness Contact 104 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYCorporate responsibility Reporting performance In 2012-13, the ABC continued to align its sustainability data and reporting with the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework for sustainability reporting and indicators from the GRI Media Sector Supplement (MSS). The MSS contains the guidelines for sustainability reporting in the media sector. The GRI framework provides a common language for organisations to measure and report their sustainability performance so that stakeholders are able to view a more complete picture of the organisation's financial and non-financial activities and performance. The report has been structured to reflect each of the dimensions referred to in the GRI\u2014economic, environmental and social. 104 During the reporting year, the ABC worked on improving the completeness, composition and quality of data. This is consistent with the strategic priority of applying \"best practice standards of financial and corporate governance and public accountability\". Reviews of the methodology for collecting waste and energy data helped improve understanding about the data, ways to improve how it is collected, and accuracy. Significant changes to the way data is collected, or the number of sites from which data is collected, are noted in the relevant tables in the report. 104 The ABC's economic performance and sustainability is addressed in Section 6, Financial Performance.Scope and boundary The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance annually, with the current report covering the financial year from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. Additional corporate responsibility and sustainability information and a GRI Content Index is available on the ABC's website: about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility. Other than references to the activities of ABC International, the report is limited to domestic operations. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited, and National DAB Licence Company Limited are not included in the report. Any additional limitations to the scope or completeness of particular data are identified within the reported data. Materiality In 2012-13, the ABC reviewed and updated the materiality analysis which was extensively conducted in 2010 -11. The materiality analysis enables the ABC to identify the issues most important to report about the sustainability of the Corporation. The relative importance of each indicator was determined having regard to a range of factors, including whether the indicator: emerged as important to stakeholders constituted a future challenge for the media and broadcasting sector was regularly reported by others in the industry presented an opportunity for the ABC to manage its impacts or affect the priorities of its stakeholders was recognised by experts or the scientific community as a risk for sustainability contributed to the successful implementation of corporate strategy or reinforced ABC Values; and was recognised as a risk in the corporate risk process.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 105 4The review included a scan of performance against the ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 , the ABC's updated corporate risk profile, outcomes from stakeholder engagement processes, developments relevant to the media sector, and relevant submissions to government. The priorities identified by the CRG and amendments to the ABC Charter were also taken into account. Stakeholder inclusiveness The content in the 2013 Sustainability Report is informed by the outcomes of engagement with internal and external stakeholders on a range of sustainability related subjects. Internal stakeholders are those engaged within the organisation's boundaries, including employees, structural divisions and departments, executive and non-executive committees, and project teams that influenced or had control over aspects of sustainability. External stakeholders were those directly impacted by the ABC outside its structural boundaries, partners and major suppliers, the community, audiences, and government. Stakeholders were prioritised according to the extent to which they had influence or control over the ABC's economic, social or environmental impacts, or were affected by the ABC's impacts. In 2012-13, mechanisms for engaging with external stakeholders included: ABC Community Forums (see page 98) formal audience contacts and complaints processes (see page 132) the annual Newspoll ABC Appreciation Survey (see page 27); and online feedback mechanisms specific to ABC content areas. Internally, the ABC engaged across divisions and departments regarding sustainability performance and reporting relevant to material indicators.

Those indicators relate to aspects such as freedom of expression and pluralism, accessibility of content, reflecting culture and values, and the role of the media in providing information and education. Protecting freedom of expression Freedom of expression, as a fundamental human right which is recognised in Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights , is enshrined in the ABC Editorial Policies . The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the need for a democratic society to deliver diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: a balance that follows the weight of evidence fair treatment open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. See Editorial Standards (Inside the ABC), page 79. Accessibility of content In 2012-13, the ABC continued to improve the accessibility of its content and services to Australians, whatever their level of ability. The ABC Ramp Up website provided news, discussion and debate about disability issues in Australia. The Ramp Up Editor works in consultation with other ABC departments to raise awareness and implement accessibility across the ABC. ABC Shop designs and layouts are approved by council prior to opening to ensure they meet with the appropriate legislative and regulatory requirements for each location. Shop counters are designed to meet the needs of customers in wheelchairs. With an average national audience reach of 73% across television, radio and online, the ABC is uniquely placed to impact the lives of Australians. Protecting freedom of expression Accessibility of content Protecting young or vulnerable audiences Reflecting Australia's culture and values Information and educationCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 107 4In February 2013, ABC Retail distributed the Welcoming Customers with Disabilities handbook from the Australian Network on Disability to staff in all ABC Shops and Centres. The handbook provides guidelines for assisting customers with disabilities in a retail environment. Captioning Captioning is the process by which speech or scenes are described in text for viewing on screen. Closed captioning indicates the availability of text that can be activated by users if required. The ABC provides a closed captioning service on ABC1, ABC2, ABC4Kids, ABC3 and ABC News 24. The ABC exceeds the captioning requirements contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 . In 2012-13, the ABC captioned 97% of prime time on ABC1; 100% of prime-time programs on ABC2; 92% of all programs on ABC4Kids; 93% of all programs on ABC3; and 85% of prime-time programs on ABC News 24. All captioned prime-time content on ABC1 and ABC2 is captioned on iview. Popular content that was captioned during 2012-13 included coverage of: the 2012 London Paralympics; Anzac Day; Prime Minister Spill; National Apology for Forced Adoptions; Inaugural Papal Mass; and the Australian Workplace Relations Debate. In addition, growing numbers of media conferences are including signing for the deaf, and wherever possible vision of the signer is included in the ABC's coverage, both on ABC1 and on ABC News 24. An increased number of children's programs were captioned on iview in 2012-13, with a particular focus on content for older children on ABC3. Captioned children's programs on iview included Dance Academy, Bushwhacked, Good Game SP, Prank Patrol (Road Trip) and Pet Superstars . Content clips on ABC Splash, the ABC education portal, have closed captions and transcripts.The ABC has given an undertaking to the Australian Human Rights Commission to always attempt to source items that have closed captions (where the Australian distributor has the authorship rights to allow for this). This requirement has been included in ABC Retail's terms of trade with suppliers. The majority of ABC DVDs (excluding pre-school titles) have closed captions. The availability of closed captioned DVDs is clearly signposted in all ABC Shops and Centres. In 2012-13, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs logged 106 complaints relating to closed captioning of television programs. These included complaints about the quality of captions, as well as complaints about a failure to provide captions on various programs. Fifteen of the complaints investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs resulted in findings that the ABC had failed to satisfy the captioning requirements set out in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 . The majority of the breaches related to technical issues or equipment failures, and these were followed up with the relevant department. The Australian Communications and Media Authority advised that it finalised five investigations into complaints about closed captioning; all resulted in breach findings of section 130ZR(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 . Improving access for people with a visual impairment From 5 August to 4 November 2012, the ABC conducted a technical trial of audio-description on ABC1. An audio-description service assists people with a vision impairment to access television by adding a verbal commentary to complement the soundtrack of a television program. The technical trial tested the broadcast path for the additional audio track by broadcasting a total of 237 hours of programs with audio-description in prime-time on ABC1. A report on the results of the trial was provided to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in December 2012. 108 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYCorporate responsibility in a broadcasting context There were 325 complaints about the ABC's audio- description trial. The majority of the complaints were from viewers who considered that the narration was \"unnecessary\" and \"intrusive\", and were unaware that they could switch off the feature. Some complaints were received about audio problems associated with the trial, such as fluctuating volume, loss of audio and an inability to record programs using a Personal Video Recorder. The ABC received 365 requests, mostly for a further trial of audio-description or implementation of a permanent service. In developing the ABC Radio app launched in July 2012, Radio Multiplatform worked closely with Vision Australia on the voiceover component to enable best practice accessibility to those who are fully blind.In 2012-13, ABC Books expanded their list of Braille and large print books for the visually impaired with the publisher Read How You Want producing seventeen new titles. ABC Books also added titles to ABC Digital's Story Cloud application for children which allows audio recording and playback of stories. ABC Audio released 54 ABC front list titles in physical and digital formats and 23 ABC back list titles in digital formats in 2012-13 through the license agreement with Bolinda, Australia's premier audio book publisher. ABC Commercial makes available an extensive range of unabridged new release audio books across a wide range of genres for all ages. TV Multiplatform continues to improve the accessibility of online content and services in a number of ways, with the aim of conforming with the Federal Government endorsed Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to level AA.The ABC was the official Australian broadcaster at the London 2012 Paralympics and provided exceptional television, radio and online coverage across the 11 days of competition. The ABC broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies live, along with daily early morning coverage on ABC1 and packaged highlights of each day's competition in the evening. On ABC2, live evening coverage attracted ABC2's highest ever weekly primetime audience share. On a night when Australian swimmer Jacqueline Freney won her sixth gold medal in the pool, Games programming on ABC1 and ABC2 reached 1.8 million people across the five mainland capital cities. Coverage was also available on digital radio, with a whole channel, ABC Extra, dedicated to the event. ABC2's coverage also featured a series of very short interstitials, Kane and Disabled , featuring ABC presenters Lawrence Mooney and Sam Pang with Australian Paralympic athletes. The satirical series was aimed at removing the taboo of disability by speaking about it loudly and comically. The popularity of the event on ABC Television was acknowledged with a nomination for Most Popular Sports Program at the 2013 Logie Awards.

The ABC Editorial Policies contain Principles and Standards in relation to Harm and Offence, Children and Young People and associated Guidance Notes and material. These Principles and Standards guide content-makers on a daily basis. The ABC has an experienced in-house classification team who classify television content against the Editorial Policies' Associated Standard of Television Program Classification . Content is allocated to individuals within the classification team on a rostered weekly basis. Second opinions are sought in relation to programs which contain a difficult or borderline classification issue, and the matter upwardly referred if an appropriate classification cannot be agreed. Content on ABC4Kids and ABC3 is specifically targeted and appropriate for younger audiences. The ABC4Kids and ABC3 websites were designed as safe destinations for younger audiences, where audience participation is pre-moderated and closely monitored and by trained moderators. Participation in online services is controlled by tools that limit the extent of personal or identifying information that can be posted online about individuals, schools or sports teams for example. Products sold in ABC Shops, Centres and ABC Shop Online meet relevant classification standards and appropriate warnings and guides are attached to each product. Reflecting Australia's culture and values Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community [and] to enjoy the arts...\" The GRI recognises that the media provides society with tools to exercise these rights, and that media organisations play a key role in promoting and contributing to exercising cultural rights. For the ABC, the obligation to reflect Australia's cultural diversity is entrenched in the ABC's Charter. 105 In doing so, the ABC contributes to the cultural life of all Australians. For example: Between 8 and 11 February, the traditions and customs that surround Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year) and other aspects of contemporary Asian culture were explored through stories about how the event is celebrated in Australia As well as being simulcast on Radio Australia, this was also part of a four day special event digital radio station on ABC Extra which showcased the best of ABC Radio programs about Asia and Asian culture, including programs on food, history and music; and On 26 February, Egyptian-born Australian Akmal Saleh was featured on Conversations with Richard Fidler talking about his life as a comedian and his latest project\u2014a documentary about life under Hosni Mubarek's regime, which he made after spending an extended period in Cairo exploring his birth culture. A significant element of reflecting Australia's cultural diversity is the representation and awareness of Indigenous culture in ABC content. The ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan includes a commitment to demonstrating a stronger Indigenous presence in ABC content (see page 149). In 2012-13, the ABC delivered on this commitment across platforms. Content included: On 1 June, the opening of \"My Country, I Still Call Australia Home: Contemporary Art from Black Australia\" Radio National's Weekend Arts program was broadcast live from the Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA) Brisbane. The exhibition was GOMA's largest ever exhibition of contemporary art by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists 105 Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, s.6(1)(a)(i)110 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY On 2 July, RN's Big Ideas partnered with the National Archive of Australia for a Constitution Day Forum in the Eugene Goossens Hall of the ABC Ultimo Centre in New South Wales. The event featured a panel consisting of Mick Dodson, Father Frank Brennan AO, Alison Page and Mick Davis addressing the question \"What are the next steps towards Constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians?\" The forum was broadast on Big Ideas on 9 July On 11 August, the National Indigenous Music Awards were recorded and broadcast on Local Radio and digital radio from the Botanic Gardens Amphitheatre in Darwin, Northern Territory On 28 August, ABC Illawarra conducted an outside broadcast from the Indigenous Employment Expo in Nowra New South Wales. Local Indigenous employee Kelly Ann Brent broadcast from the venue along with Indigenous ABC News 24 presenter, Miriam Corowa, who was the Expo ambassador ABC Open's \"Me and Mine\" project continued through the second half of 2012. \"Me and Mine\" invited Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to share a story of a special relationship; and On 31 May, 105.7 ABC Darwin broadcast from the Bagot Indigenous Community in the middle of Darwin. The Drive special \"Say Hello to Bagot\" featured live music from a local band as well as community activities. By reflecting Australia's regional diversity, the ABC contributes to better understanding and social cohesion and inclusion. The ABC's presence in regional Australia through its extensive Local Radio network (see page 31) means that the ABC is a part of community life in those regions as well as having an important role in covering and reporting on issues from those areas. The following initiatives are indicative of the regional diversity of the ABC's operations and content: ABC Open's \"Day in the Life\" project features more than 200 video contributions exploring someone's life in the story of a day. The collection provides an insight into the lives of Australians from all locations and walks of life In July 2012, ABC Local Radio, Tasmania joined forces with Hobart's Festival of Voices in a series of three events themed around the notion of \"change\". The event brought together national and local identities to reflect on past experiences, discuss challenges and explore ideas for the future. Topics for discussion included Change Your World, Change Your Neighbourhood, and Change your Life On 1 August, ABC Coast FM on the Gold Coast, Queensland, broadcast from the Homeless Connect charity soccer match. The match between the ABC Radio team and the Homeless Connect street kids team and was called by ABC Grandstand's Zane Bojack On 24 October, the ABC Ballarat Mornings presented an outside broadcast from the home of a local foster carer highlighting issues around state care and children at risk. The program featured foster carers, foster children and professionals working in this field On 31 October, 702 ABC Sydney Mornings was broadcast from the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern to coincide with the ABC TV launch of the series Redfern Now ; and From 20-24 May, 783 ABC Alice Springs Mornings broadcast from various venues across Tennant Creek and Ali Curung, showcasing the diversity in the Barkly shire. The shire is the second largest local government area in the world. These initiatives are in addition to the comprehensive services the ABC has been delivering outside the major capital cities over many decades. Corporate responsibility in a broadcasting contextCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 111 4The ABC provides a range of programs and services that reflect regional Australia and meet the needs of rural and regional communities in a variety of ways. This includes services that are produced in and for specific regional communities across the country and offer localised coverage of news, events, issues, personalities and emergencies. Similarly, a number of the Corporation's state-based and national services specifically or regularly cover regional issues and reflect rural and regional areas to the nation\u2014or, in the case of most online services, the world. In addition, the ABC offers a unique online environment in which regional and rural communities can connect, learn and contribute. Further information on the ABC's commitment to regional areas is available at about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/senate-standing-committee-on-environment-and-communications-inquiry-into-the-australian-broadcasting-corporations-commitment-to-reflecting-and-representing-regional-diversity-jan Information and education Improving media and digital literacy The ABC sought to improve the media and digital literacy of Australians through its content and services, with a particular focus on people living in rural and regional areas and young people. ABC Open provided opportunities for people living in regional Australia to learn new digital skills and to share their own content through the ABC. Operating from 43 locations in regional Australia ABC Open Producers provided multimedia training and mentoring opportunities for more than 12 000 people aged between 15 and 80 years. A total of 2 515 workshops and other teaching/mentoring sessions were held around the country. In 2012-13, ABC Open offered 31 projects (13 photo, two photo or video, 12 text and photo, four video). ABC Open projects generated 22 590 contributions from 3 637 individual contributors. ABC Open Producers were involved in 314 events and exhibitions which were attended by approximately 30 000 people. In 2012-13, in partnership with the State Library of Queensland, the ABC conducted a touring exhibition Floodlines , which shared content from ABC Open's Aftermath project. The exhibition was seen in 11 regional libraries by approximately 37 300 visitors. In 2012-13, the ABC delivered content which provided insights for audiences in relation to changing technology. For instance: In January 2013, 891 ABC Adelaide Afternoons broadcast a series of program segments aimed at educating older listeners on the use and benefits of social media RN's weekly Download this Show program explored current issues in technology, social media, consumer electronics and digital culture; and Each Tuesday, 783 ABC Alice Springs Drive presenter road tests an app to inform audience of the pros and cons of various changes in online media. The participation by children in creating content has been a significant area of focus for the ABC. For instance: A variety of online games have been launched which allow children to engage with content online and improve digital literacy, such as Club3 on the ABC3 site. The game enabled school age children to create avatars for themselves from cartoon characters and to contribute on noticeboards in a moderated environment; and ABC4Kids enhanced the media literacy of pre-school audiences both online and with apps. ABC Children's Television's first touch-based tablet app, the Play School \"Art Maker\", has had sustained success since launching in late 2011. With over 500 000 downloads since its launch, the app has consistently ranked in the top five most popular ABC apps.112 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYProviding educational and educative content The ABC's Charter includes a requirement that the Corporation broadcast programs of an educational nature. 106 In 2012-13, the ABC pursued this across all platforms. On 26 March 2013, ABC Splash\u2014the ABC's new education portal for students, teachers and parents\u2014was officially launched at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne by Senator Jacinta Collins, Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations. ABC Splash was produced in partnership with Educational Services Australia. The launch was timed to coincide with the final event of \"Splash Live\", where students from four NBN-connected schools were engaged in a live video broadcasting event to broadcast local news stories that they had constructed as part of the \"Splash Live\" program. In 2012-13, a series of \"Splash Labs\" were conducted in Sydney and in Melbourne. The workshops gave educators and digital specialists the opportunity to collaborate, incubate and pitch ideas for development by ABC Splash. Each \"Splash Lab\" had over 100 participants with an equal engagement of people from the education and digital production sectors. The ABC's daily \"education block\" has featured on ABC1 for over 40 years. Behind the News remained at the heart of this block, and continued to offer insight into issues such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture, Australia's engagement with Asia, and sustainability issues. In 2012-13, television content supported the new National Australian Curriculum by offering relevant programs accompanied by study guides, website materials or downloadable classroom activities. 106 Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, s.6(1)(a)(ii)As well as educational content, the ABC broadcasts a significant range of content which is educative. For instance: ABC3 broadcast educative programs for children across a range of genres, including My Great Big Adventure which explored social issues; science- based programs Steam Punks, Backyard Science , and Studio 3 with Dr Ruben Meerman ; and historical drama My Place Each week in 2012, Local Radio Victoria's Sunday program worked through one of the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) texts with a teaching expert. Podcasts of the segments were available online after the show. This culminated in the Sunday School Live! broadcast on 21 October at the ABC Southbank, prior to VCE exams on 1 November RN introduced an \"Any Questions\" segment in the Drive program. A question generated by an audience member is answered by an expert in the field. Topics covered included church and taxes, the origins of Halloween, and a new scientific paradigm called Complexity Theory ABC Classic FM's education program Keys to Music explored elements of music theory, such as the ways in which composers use chords, and the outlines of chords, as expressive devices The University of New England in New South Wales is using an RN Life Matters program on Ageing and Sexuality, broadcast on 6 November, as an educational resource for a module on sexually-based prejudice and discrimination; and On 28 November, ABC Local Radio in South Australia undertook The Great Koala Count in conjunction with the University of South Australia and the South Australian Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The multiplatform citizen-science project represented the first official attempt to record koala numbers in their natural environment anywhere in Australia. The project has been included in the science curriculum of 50 primary schools in South Australia. nCorporate responsibility in a broadcasting context CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 113 4Energy consumption In 2012-13, the ABC's total energy consumption decreased by 5 547GJ, or 3.2%, from 2011-12 levels.

Gas data is based on 87% actual consumption and 13% forecast consumption. b 2011-12 data is actual billed electricity and gas consumption. In 2012-13, the ABC sought to implement a range of initiatives to improve energy consumption. The ABC has enabled power-management features on non-broadcast ICT equipment, with particular focus on desktop computers. Where deployed, desktop computers and monitors go to \"sleep mode\" after a period of inactivity. Approximately 15% of desktop computers have the power-saving feature installed. Power management features have also been enabled for new printers. Testing is underway to roll-out the initiative in the second half of 2013 as an automated setting. In 2012-13, the ABC implemented lighting upgrades at a number of its sites. These are estimated to have achieved a consumption saving of approximately 231 908kWh (equivalent to a saving of approximately $42 284 per annum). Lighting upgrades focused on converting fluorescent and halogen lights to energy-efficient LED light fittings. Environmental responsibility The ABC has implemented a range of initiatives to reduce its environmental impact whilst at the same time delivering a range of business benefits.Energy consumption EmissionsWaste and recycling Materials Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Travel and transport Water consumption Green@Work 114 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYEnvironmental responsibility The upgrades were undertaken at: Wagga Wagga, New South Wales\u2014all fluorescent and halogen lights in office areas, studios and external lighting (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by lighting by 70% and total annual electricity consumption by 18%) Canberra, Australian Capital Territory\u2014all T8 fluorescent lights throughout general office areas (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by lighting in these areas by 50%) Albany and Bunbury, Western Australia\u2014flood lighting (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by flood lighting load by more than 80% at each site) Melbourne, Victoria\u2014Television Studios 38 and 39 (estimated to achieve a 12% reduction in studio lighting electricity consumption) Southbank, Victoria\u2014atrium and foyer (estimated to reduce the lighting electricity consumption in this area by 67%) Hobart, Tasmania\u2014Emergency and Exit lighting and passageway lighting (estimated to achieve an average lighting electricity consumption reduction in these areas of 67%); and Adelaide, South Australia\u2014Studio 891 Office area (estimated to achieve a reduction in electricity consumed by lighting in this area of 21%). In Ultimo, New South Wales, Passive Infrared Motion Sensor lighting control was installed in common areas, including corridors and the Eugene Goosens Hall Green Room. In addition, lighting control incorporating ambient light sensors during business hours and motion sensors after hours were installed in some lift foyers to maximise the efficiency of required lighting. This provided better lighting control after hours and in areas that are infrequently visited. As well as initiatives to directly reduce consumption, the ABC sought to implement process changes which will have a positive impact on energy usage. For instance, an initiative was implemented to rebalance heating, ventilation and air conditioning air distribution throughout the ABC Ultimo Centre, New South Wales, to ensure that the air-conditioning load balance is proportional and that it services changed floor layouts and current heat load demands more efficiently and effectively. The ABC uses relatively small quantities of renewable energy. Solar hot water systems are installed at ten sites: Brisbane and Gold Coast (Queensland), Port Pirie (South Australia), Launceston (Tasmania), Albany and Broome (Western Australia), Canberra (Australian Capital Territory), Alice Springs (Northern Territory), and Port Macquarie and Newcastle (New South Wales). The impact of the ABC's solar hot water usage on its direct energy consumption is not measured. The use of blended E10 fuels is reported in the emissions table (see page 115), however the renewable ethanol content of the fuel is not reported separately. The ABC does not directly source energy from other renewable energy sources. Emissions In November 2007, the ABC announced it would aim to reduce emissions by 40% by 2020, and by 60% by 2050 over a 1997 base year. Emissions in 1997 were estimated at 60 682t CO 2-e. In 2012-13, the ABC's emissions were 44 600t CO 2-e, a reduction of 16 082t CO 2-e, or 26.5%. The ABC uses the National Green Accounts Factors (July 2012) published by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to identify and quantify green house gas (GHG) emissions. These are further classified as electricity, waste and fuel. Data is reported in the Commonwealth Government's Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting database.CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 115 4Greenhouse Gas Emissions Raw Figure and Unit of Measurement 2012-13 tCO 2-e 2011-12 tCO 2-e % Categories 2012-13 2011-12 Unit Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3 GHG Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3 GHG tCO 2-e tCO2-e Electricity 41 652 227 42 772 680 kWh 0 37 107 5 975 43 082 0 38 024 6 127 44 151 -2.4% Gas 16 146 391 17 660 045 MJ 827 0 151 978 905 0 171 1 076 -9.1% Greenpower 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Automotive diesel (non-transport) 10 000 10 000 L 27 0 2 29 27 0 2 29 0.0% Other buildings 854 37 107 6 128 44 089 932 38 024 6 300 45 256 -2.6% LPG 3 733 1 151 L 6 0 0 6 2 0 0 2 200% E10 133 631 143 691 L 279 0 45 324 300 0 49 349 -7.2% Automotive gasoline (petrol) 285 972 422 661 L 731 0 58 789 1 081 0 86 1 167 -32.4% Automotive diesel (car) 0 0 L 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Passenger vehicles 1 016 0 103 1 119 1 383 0 135 1 518 -26.3% Automotive diesel (transport) 194 960 161 376 L 526 0 40 566 435 0 33 468 20.9% Automotive gas (petrol) 0 0 L 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aviation turbine fuel 90 753 107 165 L 233 0 18 251 275 0 21 296 -15.2% Other transport 759 0 58 817 710 0 6.9% -1 424 categories 2 629 37 107 6 289 44 601 3 025 38 024 6 489 45 796 -2.6% Waste and recycling The ABC disposed of 5 951m3 of waste from its capital city sites in 2012-13. Total recycled waste constituted 2 725m3 (representing 46% of total waste disposed) while 3 226m3 was sent to landfill (54% of total waste disposed). Waste is made up of secure waste, co-mingled recycling, recycled paper and cardboard, and landfill. Waste disposal data is currently reported for capital city sites only, based on billing information received from the ABC's waste disposal contractors. The ABC has continued to improve the scope and quality of waste and recycling data. Waste disposal data for a greater number of sites has been included in the reported data. Accordingly, meaningful comparisons with previous years' performance cannot be made. The ABC did not dispose of any hazardous waste in 2012-13. The ABC operates separate waste and recycling collection streams at all capital city sites. Collection receptacles are distributed throughout each site to provide co-mingled recycling collection, general waste collection, e-waste collection, fluorescent tube recycling collection, toner cartridge recycling collection, secure paper destruction collection and mobile phone recycling collection. 116 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYIn 2012-13, the ABC implemented a sustainable catering project at the ABC Centre Ultimo, New South Wales to provide a catering kit for use at staff functions. The initiative aimed to reduce both cost and waste associated with the purchase of disposable items. The effectiveness of the project will be assessed to determine whether the initiative should be extended to other sites. The ABC's major IT suppliers are signatories of the Australian Packaging Covenant 107 and have taken steps to minimise their packaging, using air-pillows in their packaging rather than polystyrene foam. When selecting commercial waste disposal contractors, whilst having regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the requirement to achieve value-for-money, the ABC sought to engage contractors which have demonstrated responsible environmental credentials and the capacity to maximise appropriate recycling and disposal avenues for individual waste streams. 107 The Australian Packaging Covenant is an agreement between industry, government and community groups that aims to reduce waste from packaging.Materials In 2012-13 the ABC purchased 30 700 reams of paper, similar to 2011-12. 86% of the paper purchased contained recycled content.

ABC Publishing continued to produce products in an environmentally responsible manner. ABC Organic Gardener magazine, ABC delicious magazine and ABC Gardening Australia magazine were all produced with sustainably sourced and certified paper and printed utilising processes certified under ISO 14001. ABC Limelight magazine was produced on paper sourced from Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certified forests. 112 The details of these activities are noted on the mastheads of the relevant magazines. Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Where appropriate, tender documentation and evaluation criteria required information about suppliers' corporate responsibility (including environmental) commitments and practices. Mandatory environmental standards (ES1 and ES2) of the Federal Government's ICT Sustainability Plan 2010-2015 were applied to all ABC procurements of ICT equipment. ABC Retail provides and maintains Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Approved Products for usage in ABC Shops. Risk Assessments have been performed on these products, revealing some of the safest, cost effective and environmental choices available nationwide. ABC Video Entertainment and Distribution undertake business checks for all new and potential partners with consideration given to these factors. 112 The Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is a global organisation that promotes sustainable forest management through independent third party verification. It is non-profit and non-governmental.Travel and transport The nature of the ABC's operations, in particular its news and current affairs activities, necessitates frequent domestic and international travel. In 2012-13, ABC staff travelled a total of 23 324 606km by air (a 3.8% decrease from 24 240 377km in 2011-12). In 2012-13, 4 319 447km was travelled in domestic fleet vehicles. Of the 385 vehicles in the fleet: Nine (2.3%) are hybrid vehicles; and 232 (60.3%) have a Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating of 10 or more. Fuel consumption (LPG, E10, Petrol, Diesel and Aviation turbine) is reported in the emissions table (see page 115). In 2012-13, total fuel consumption was 709 049L, a reduction of 15.2% from 836 044L in 2011-12. Video-conferencing facilities are available and encouraged to be used in every ABC capital city site to reduce the travel expense and impact of non-content making activities. In 2012-13, 1 424 tonnes of the ABC's fleet related GHG emissions were offset through arrangements with the not-for-profit organisation, Greenfleet. 113 The ABC provides facilities for staff to enable travel to and from work using sustainable forms of transport. End-of-trip facilities including secure bike parking, showers and lockers are provided in most ABC capital city sites. Information about public transport in each state and territory is provided on the ABC's intranet. The ABC continued to support and promote National Walk to Work Day and National Ride to Work Day to staff. In 2012-13, 131 ABC staff registered for Ride to Work Day, and approximately 80 ABC staff participated in National Walk to Work day. 113 Emissions were offset by the planting of 5 314 trees. The number of trees planted is a reasonable estimate made by Greenfleet of the number of trees required to be initially planted to sequester the total quantity of carbon purchased and takes into account that not all trees initially planted will survive due to the natural survival rate of trees. Accordingly, trees that do not survive following initial plantation may not necessarily be replanted.118 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYWater consumption In 2012-13, the ABC's water consumption was 72 375kL, similar to 2011-12.

Total ABC consumption includes nine capital city sites (from a total of 11) and 33 regional sites (from a total of 50). 115 2011-12 is actual billed consumption other than Tasmania. Tasmania data includes additional consumption for Hobart (not reported in 2011-12) which is calculated on manual meter readings.Environmental responsibility of 276.2kL. Metering installed on 12 of those tanks indicates that rainwater collection was (on average) nearly five times tank capacity. Harvested rainwater was used for toilet flushing, irrigation and cooling tower supply. Green@Work The Green@Work program coordinated various campaigns and events throughout the year to raise awareness amongst staff on how they can lessen their impact on the environment. Nation-wide \"Switch Off\" campaigns were conducted during September 2012 and over the Christmas and New Year period. The awareness-raising campaigns reminded staff to switch off energy-consuming devices when not in use. Electricity usage was monitored over the duration of the campaigns. During the September \"switch-off\" (held 3 - 9 September 2012), ABC capital cities and selected regional sites reduced their lighting, general power and air-conditioning load by a total of 3.1% (compared with the previous week). Other events were organised to contribute to environmental awareness and sustainability beyond the workplace. For instance: The ABC hosted a two-day electronic waste recycling collection at the Ultimo Centre, New South Wales at which staff were invited to recycle their personal e-waste items. Over 120 items of electronic waste weighing 519kg was collected. Recycling these products was estimated to result in greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to 2.2 tonnes of CO 2 Composting and gardening workshops were held in Sydney and Adelaide led by Gardening Australia presenters, Costa Georgiadis and Sophie Thomson. The workshops demonstrated to staff how they can grow their own vegetables at home and reduce their food waste; and Staff community gardens in Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra and Hobart provided staff with the opportunity to learn the techniques of organic gardening. n CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 119 4Impact on communities Unlike other industries, where the impact on communities may be adverse and require remediation, the ABC's impact is a positive one, and is a key element of operations rather than a side-effect. ABC Community Forums ABC Community Forums are one way the ABC engages with the community for their views on issues that are important to them. Local community stakeholder representatives and members of the public are invited to attend the open meetings and provide their views on issues that are important to them, as well as views about how the ABC is run. Community feedback obtained at the forums informed the planning of the ABC's content and community activities. In 2012-13, six forums were hosted by ABC State and Territory Directors. Forums were held in Victoria, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Details of Community Forums held in 2012-13 are available on the ABC's website: about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/ what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility. Community Service Announcements The ABC broadcasts Community Service Announcements about community issues or events which are in the public interest, subject to the ABC Editorial Policies Standard 9 (Public access and participation). Due to its localisation and immediacy, radio is the primary medium for the ABC to broadcast Community Service Announcements. Community Service Announcements are an important means of communicating information about what to do when faced with an emergency. In those circumstances, announcements are compiled in consultation with relevant emergency services organisations to ensure accurate information about the type and nature of warnings and alerts as well as ways in which communities can prepare.Social responsibility For the purposes of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), reporting on social responsibility includes: impact on communities; product responsibility, employment practices, and human rights. Impact on communities The ABC's role as emergency broadcasterProduct responsibility Employment practices 120 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYExamples of Community Service Announcements broadcast in 2012-13 include: In August, ABC Local Metropolitan and Regional Radio in Victoria, in conjunction with the Victoria State Emergency Service and the Bureau of Meteorology, prepared Community Service Announcements for Storm Safe Week; and In September, 1233 ABC Newcastle prepared a range of Community Service Announcements for broadcast on Fire Awareness Day. Packages were prepared in conjunction with the local Rural Fire Services training unit and gave listeners wide ranging information to increase awareness of fire safety and preparation. Community activities The ABC operates from an extensive network of locations around the country, including remote and regional areas. The ABC and the people who work there play an important role in the life of many communities, delivering a public benefit beyond broadcasting activities. For instance: On 3 August 2012, 702 ABC Sydney hosted the 10th and final ABC Knit-In at Ultimo and at Erina on the New South Wales Central Coast. Local Radio supported over 50 other Knit-In events throughout New South Wales. This initiative has been run in association with the charity Wrap With Love which distributes blankets and wraps to those in need in Australia and overseas. More than one million squares have been knitted by thousands of people in schools and communities across New South Wales and at the annual event since the ABC Knit-In began in 2003, contributing to 42 000 blankets. More than 1 100 people came to Ultimo and approximately 500 to Erina. The Knit-In event at Hornsby attracted 1 300 attendees. The ABC broadcast the 702 ABC Sydney Breakfast and Mornings programs live from the atrium of the Ultimo Centre In October 2012, the ABC conducted an outside broadcast at the Tauondi College Open Day. Tauondi College is an Aboriginal Community College located at Port Adelaide which has been delivering a range of vocational courses to the Aboriginal Community since 1973. The partnership explored ways that the ABC can work with the College In November 2012, the ABC Eyre Peninsular broadcast its Mornings program live from Cummins Area School as part of Bushfire Action Week. Local Community Fire Service (CFS) crews attended with three CFS trucks and gave tours to students and other visitors. A CFS water bombing aircraft also performed two training runs over the school agriculture block, and demonstrated \"water drops\" In December 2012, 105.7 ABC Darwin collected surplus food and household items at its station in Darwin as well as at ABC Shops in Casuarina and Palmerston. The donations were then distributed by Foodbank NT to those in need; and In May 2013, 720 ABC Perth joined in the Mothers Day Classic at Langley Park as a media partner of the fun run/walk which raised funds for breast cancer research. Afternoons presenter Gillian O'Shaughnessy was MC for the event and conducted on-stage interviews with key people working in the field of breast cancer research, whilst also motivating participants before they tackled the 4km or 8km course. During 2012-13, the ABC provided both community groups and staff with the opportunity to jointly recognise commemorative days which draw attention to environmental, health or other community issues. Regional and capital city offices in each state and territory took part in a variety of activities related to the Biggest Morning Tea, Harmony Day, Green Week, International Women's Day, National Diabetes Week, Reconciliation Week, National Indigenous Literacy Week, Walk to Work, Ride to Work, and NAIDOC Week.Social responsibilityCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 121 4In 2012-13, the ABC Exhibition Trailer travelled over 12 098kms, covered seven states and territories, exhibited at over 14 events, visited 22 schools and recorded more than 5 730 television and radio performances in the mock studios on board. In 2012-13, ABC employees participated in the ABC's Workplace Giving program. Through the program, 27 charities were supported and a total of $97 000 was contributed from employees' salaries, a 7.7% increase in contributions from 2011-12. The ABC's role as emergency broadcaster During times of emergency the ABC provides an important service to communities. Emergency broadcasting Local Radio stations in affected communities broadcast updates, emergency information and warnings as required, with information also updated on ABC Local and through the ABC Emergency website. ABC Radio's Multiplatform ensured emergency information online and on social media was continually updated. Emergency coverage included: During August 2012, ABC Southern Queensland (Toowoomba) covered grass fires/highway closures in Lockyer Valley and Local Radio NT covered fires near Katherine, as well as fires affecting roads in Darwin and along the Stuart Highway; and 774 ABC Melbourne broadcast a \"Watch and Act\" warning in relation to hazardous materials and half hourly updates throughout an afternoon. A \"Watch and Act\" is an alert level used to indicate a level of threat from a fire. Over December 2012 and January 2013, extreme weather patterns were experienced leading to major bushfires in Perth, regional South Australia, Tasmania, north western New South Wales and Victoria's Gippsland region while tornados, catastrophic flooding and heavy rains have affected a number of regions in Queensland and parts of New South Wales. On 21 January, the focus shifted to coastal regions from Rockhampton through to northern New South Wales, which experienced significant emergencies including tornados, high tides, extreme rains and catastrophic floods. Heavy rains spread further south into New South Wales, including Sydney and the Illawarra regions Warnings were carried on all platforms when necessary. On 12 January at 11 pm, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service requested the Standard Emergency Warning Signal (SEWS) be broadcast on radio and television outlets, and this was carried on ABC1, ABC2, ABC News 24 and all ABC Local outlets within 15 minutes In January, at the height of flooding in Rockhampton, Queensland, Telstra outages resulted in major dislocation to ABC Radio regional broadcasting. ABC Radio was unable to broadcast from Townsville and unable to broadcast locally to Rockhampton. Special programs were broadcast from Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast for regional areas in order to issue all necessary warnings; and Over February and March in Western Australia there were seven emergency level fires, three of which utilised the SEWS siren alert. Tropical Cyclone Rusty in the far north of the state also saw many communities evacuated. Each incident was covered by formal warnings as per the Emergency Broadcasting schedule with the frequency of warnings determined by intensity of incident. Strengthening emergency broadcasting capabilities In 2012-13, ABC Local Radio implemented new Emergency Broadcasting Guidelines which were developed following the Emergency Broadcasting Review. The Review was conducted after the devastating Queensland floods in 2011.122 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYFormal partnerships with emergency broadcasting organisations are maintained through Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). The ABC liaises with relevant organisations prior to the start of each emergency season, and again afterwards to debrief and review protocols and practices. For instance: In July 2012, all Local Radio Regional Content Managers in Western Australia met with emergency services media and personnel (police, fire agencies and the Bureau of Meteorology) to build relationships and to identify and address issues to improve the service provided to communities In August 2012, a number of Queensland Regional Content Managers met with their relevant emergency services to discuss the upcoming emergency season In September 2012, the Local Content Manager, South Australia met with senior local Police to discuss existing emergency broadcasting arrangements and how to improve overall communication In October 2012, the Local Content Manager South Australia presented a training program to the Country Fire Service on emergency incident management outlining the ABC's approach to emergency broadcasting In October 2012, 666 ABC Canberra held a seasonal briefing with the Australian Capital Territory Emergency Services Agency along with ABC staff In March 2013, Local Content Manager Tasmania met with the Tasmanian Fire Service to discuss the challenges and responses with regard to the bushfire emergencies in that state in January; and In May 2013, Local Content Manager and the Content Directors for metropolitan and regional radio in Victoria met with representatives of the Emergency Services Commissioner to debrief on the bushfire season and discuss a revision of future protocols and practices.Over the last three years, CSIRO has developed technologies to support automated analysis of social media content. The ABC entered into a 12-month pilot of the CSIRO Emergency Situation Awareness tool in January. Using the tool, the ABC is able to set a baseline of conversation on Twitter to monitor and detect variations at very low volumes with the aim of detecting emergencies early. Recovering from emergencies In 2012-13, the ABC played an active role in the physical and emotional recovery of communities affected by emergencies. The ABC's Local Radio network provided opportunities for communities to discuss and share the impact of an event, and to bring survivors together to support their emotional recovery. For instance: Following fires which affected parts of Gippsland in January, the ABC 774 Melbourne Drive program was broadcast live from Heyfield, a small town in the fire affected area on 21 January. Presenter Lindy Burns spoke in depth with locals who had lost homes and livestock, local business owners and local politicians On 18 January, 666 ABC Canberra broadcast its Breakfast program from Mt Stromlo as part of Canberra Remembered , commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Canberra fires in 2003. A special edition of Now Hear This , 666 ABC Canberra's storytelling night, was also held at Mt Stromlo with guests invited to talk about their experiences during that time; and In May, ABC Coast FM (Gold Coast) Drive presenter Scott Lamond hosted the Rise and Shine event on Mt Tamborine for those affected by Cyclone Oswald. This event was part of the Queensland Government and Queensland Music Festival Rise and Shine Queensland tour visiting regions affected by severe weather events earlier in the year. Social responsibilityCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 123 4Product responsibility Product information and labelling The ABC ensures that all products are appropriately labelled. If applicable, packaging displays information about appropriate methods of disposal particularly in relation to safety, such as: \"Warning! Plastic Bag can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation keep this bag away from babies and children. Please dispose of all packaging responsibly\"; and \"Dispose of all packaging ties before giving to your child.\" Similarly, licensed ABC merchandise packaging is clearly marked if the packing is a potential hazard. Information on DVD packaging is provided about the nature and classification of the content, including running time; aspect ratio; sound format; region encoding; number of discs; and captioning information. Consistent with safety testing procedures for toys (such as AS/NZS ISO 8124), products were appropriately labelled. For instance, products which contain small parts included a \"Not suitable for children under 18 months of age\" warning. In 2012-13, one complaint was made to the ABC regarding product information and labelling. The complaint related to David Starkey's Monarchy- The Complete Series 1-3 , which was labelled as closed captioned, however only Series 2 and 3 were closed captioned. The box-sets were re-stickered to correct the captioning information. Quality assurance In 2012-13, the ABC continued to implement comprehensive quality assurance processes to ensure the quality and safety of products which are offered for sale.ABC Video Entertainment and Distribution monitored and assured product quality by ensuring that DVDs were subject to manufacture under ISO 9000 quality assurance procedures. The ABC's DVD manufacturer, Technicolor, carries the ISO 9001-2008 Anti-piracy: Australia\u2014Certified CDSA (Content & Storage Association) Content Protection and Security Program\u2014Certified CDSA (Content Delivery & Storage Association); and Environmental: Australia\u2014Certified EMS 14001:2004. All licensees are subject to contractual obligations to manufacture high-quality products that meet Australian Standards applicable to the product. Children's products are Safety Tested to the Standards AS/NZS ISO 8124 Parts 1, 2 and 3 (as applicable). Licensees are required to provide certificates to prove the test results. If there are no applicable Australian Standards or testing procedures for a product aimed at children, ABC Licensing requires licensees/manufacturers to perform tests that conform to American or European testing requirements. Apparel products are tested by licensees for colour fastness, shrinkage and flammability. Quality assurance processes are reviewed on a regular basis. ABC Licensing is a certified member of the Australian Toy Association (ATA) and receives regular industry notifications on changes to mandatory and voluntary Australian standards. ABC Licensing also works closely with the ATA and testing agencies to implement appropriate processes and testing. 124 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITYABC Licensing requires suppliers to provide a certification that their overseas manufacturers are Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) certified. WRAP is an independent, objective, non-profit team of global social compliance experts dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing around the world through certification and education. Product complaints and recalls The ABC has processes in place to address a potential product recall. Licensee agreements expressly provide for (amongst other things) public and product liability insurance and product recall insurance up to a specified quantum. Product recall strategies are put in place and a risk assessment undertaken in circumstances where adequate insurance is not provided. In 2012-13, the ABC voluntarily recalled one product\u2014the Lullaby Hoot Interactive Plush Toy. The recall was conducted in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the licensee. The decision to remove this product from sale and announce a product safety recall was made following the identification of a safety issue associated with the toy's battery compartment. There were no reported injuries associated with the use of the Lullaby Hoot Interactive Plush Toy.Employment practices Gender equality Whilst the ABC is not governed by the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 , the gender equality indicators in that legislation provide a useful benchmark for monitoring gender equality.

A total of 239 employees took parental leave in 2012-13, comprising 228 women and 11 men. Under the ABC's Leave Policy, additional leave may be available to employees to meet particular needs. In addition to entitlements to personal leave and parental leave, employees may apply for Miscellaneous Paid Leave or Leave Without Pay. Section 12 of the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2010-2013 makes specific provision for Individual Flexibility Arrangements to be entered into. Social responsibilityCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 125 4Diversity The ABC reports diversity information in its Equity and Diversity Annual Report . Those reports are prepared in accordance with s9(2) of the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 , and cover the 12-month period between 1 September and 31 August. Current and historical Equity and Diversity Annual Reports are available on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/reports-and-publications. The ABC has set specific targets for Indigenous employment in its Reconciliation Action Plan (see page 149).

For instance: Customer service\u2014Ongoing ABC Retail staff are able to study for either: a Diploma in Retail Management; Certificate IV in Retail Management; or Certificate III in Retail. These programs, facilitated by the Australian Retailers Association, provide staff with the tools and knowledge to understand the operational requirements of the business and to deliver optimised customer service Surviving hostile regions\u2014The ABC held two hostile environment courses in conjunction with an external training provider, attended by 22 ABC News staff Outside broadcasts\u2014Specific manual handling training was provided to ABC Resources staff who performed tasks associated with Outside Broadcasts Trauma Awareness\u2014This program, developed by the News division, is designed to support employees whose work involves covering or dealing with potentially traumatic incidents. ABC News ran trauma awareness training sessions for the 2013 intake of cadet journalists, involving seven staff; and Emergency broadcasting\u2014In accordance with recommendations arising from the Emergency Broadcast Review, all staff assisting with emergency coverage received emergency broadcasting training. Additional managers were allocated to guide and support staff, and mental health and fatigue protocols were implemented.

In particular, s.6 of the Act\u2014the ABC Charter\u2014outlines the functions of the Corporation and s.8 lays out the duties of the Board (see Appendix 1, page 216). The ABC Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability. In March 2013, legislative amendments were made to the ABC Act. The amendments represent the most significant changes to the ABC's enabling legislation. The ABC's Charter was amended to include in the ABC's functions the requirement \"to provide digital media services\". 116 This amendment recognises the existing digital services currently provided by the Corporation, and expressly incorporates them into the ABC's functions. A further amendment was made to the ABC Act to prohibit the Commonwealth from entering into contracts for international broadcasting services with any person or body other than the ABC. 117 Governance and management processes Board governance The roles and responsibilities of the Board are described on page 12. The ABC Board held six meetings during 2012-13. The Audit and Risk Committee met on five occasions and the Finance Committee met on four occasions. The Human Resources Committee did not meet during 2012-13, as all pertinent matters were dealt with by the full Board. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendix 2 (see page 217). 116 ABC Act, s.6(1)(ba). 117 ABC Act, s.31AA.Enabling legislation Governance and management processes Corporate strategy settingMeeting the ABC's reporting obligations The ABC Board and management apply a corporate governance framework that aims to balance the ABC's performance as a creative media organisation, on the one hand and its need to comply with the formal obligations of a statutory corporation on the other.130 GOVERNANCECorporate governance Management processes The Managing Director chairs a monthly meeting of the Executive, comprising Divisional Directors and the Heads of specialist support units reporting to him. This group also convenes briefly each Monday morning. The Audience Strategy Group, comprising the Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer and Directors of content areas (Radio, News, Television, Innovation) is responsible for coordinating the ABC's cross-divisional content strategy. The ABC's governance framework includes a number of executive and advisory groups which provide guidance and leadership around areas such as risk management, information technology, work health and safety, and policy development. Internal audit Group Audit provides an independent and objective audit and advisory service which is designed to add value and improve the Corporation's operations. Group Audit helps the ABC to achieve its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. In 2012-13 Group Audit completed scheduled audits which included comprehensive, compliance, information technology and project assurance audits. Group Audit also performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to use technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. As in previous years, Group Audit used a combination of in-house staff and external companies to deliver audits and provide the most appropriate industry experience and technical expertise. Group Audit also provided guidance and advice to ABC management and staff on good governance, risk management, controls and policies. As part of the ABC's best practice arrangements, the Head Group Audit met regularly with the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee during the course of the year in addition to formal Committee meetings. In 2012-13 Group Audit's processes were reviewed against the Australian National Audit Office Better Practice Guide on Public Sector Internal Audit , which confirmed they align with better practice. Further information is provided in Appendix 2 (see page 217).Fraud control In 2012-13, the ABC continued to implement its Fraud Control Plan 2011-13 to ensure the Corporation met the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines . It promoted awareness of its fraud control measures, including the Confidential Fraud Hotline. The Corporation also participated in the annual ABC Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines Annual Reporting Survey , which was administered by the Australian Institute of Criminology. The Managing Director is satisfied that the ABC has in place appropriate procedures and processes relating to fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection, and that these comply with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines . Risk management The ABC conducts a review of the ABC's Corporate Risk Profile of strategic risks twice annually to ensure they adequately reflect the current operating environment. This involves Executive Risk Committee (ERC) members, comprising representatives from each division, who canvass and table the views of their respective divisions. Once consolidated, the final outcome is discussed and endorsed by the ERC, the ABC Executive and the Audit and Risk Committee. Operational risks are identified and reviewed on an ongoing basis, and may be proactive and relate to planning activities, or reactive and relate to incidents that have occurred. The operational risks managed through this ongoing process provide a day-to- day identification and reporting mechanism within divisions.GOVERNANCE 131 5The ABC participated in Comcover's 2013 Risk Management Benchmarking Survey of 143 government agencies, which rated the Corporation's risk management practices as \"Structured\", representing a score of 7.8 out of 10. The ABC continues to maintain strong results when compared to the average maturity level of overall Commonwealth government departments and agencies, and in relation to the ABC's peer group. As a part of the ABC's overall governance and risk management framework, the ABC is committed to maintaining the stability and resilience of its operations before, during and after any business disruption event. This includes prioritising the safety and welfare of its staff at all times. The ABC achieves this through its Business Continuity Management (BCM) program, which oversees the operational, process and management planning for potential business disruption, as well coordinating crisis and emergency management and recovery activities. Corporate strategy setting Section 31A of the ABC Act requires the Board to develop corporate plans that set out the strategic direction for the ABC. During 2012-13, the ABC developed a new three-year Strategic Plan for the period 2013-16. The Strategic Plan 2013-16 reinforces the ABC's six high-level strategic goals: Audience-focused High-qualityInnovativeValues-basedEfficientResponsible The new Plan recognises the change made to the ABC Charter in 2013 to include the provision of digital media services. Increased focus on online and mobile services, continued provision of high quality content, exploring the potential of emerging platforms and devices, and performing its functions efficiently and responsibly are the cornerstones of the new Plan.The Strategic Plan 2013-13 will come into effect on 1 July 2013. Meeting the ABC's reporting obligations Report against the ABC Strategic Plan The ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 sets out: Goals\u2014the ABC's strategic objectives. The goals align with corporate strategy established by the Board and management and the ABC's Charter obligations. Strategic Priorities\u2014statements describing the behaviour and activities which will enable the achievement of the goals. Performance Measures\u2014a mixture of qualitative and quantitative metrics which are used to assess performance. Performance against the ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 is set out at page 135. Compliance reporting In June 2008, the Department of Finance and Deregulation issued Finance Circular No. 2008/5 relating to Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (\"CAC Act\") bodies in the general government sector. The Circular requires the ABC Board to report on compliance with the CAC Act, CAC Orders 2011 and CAC Regulations 1997 and the Corporation's financial sustainability to the Minister of Finance and Deregulation and the ABC's responsible Minister by 15 October each year. To meet these requirements, the ABC has established an internal compliance reporting framework. The Board signed and submitted the Compliance Report relating to the 2011-12 reporting period before the due date in October 2012.132 GOVERNANCEAudience contact Another important avenue for assessing the ABC's performance with its core constituency is through audience feedback, including complaints. Written complaints about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content are referred to the ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. Audience and Consumer Affairs is independent of ABC program areas and can investigate written complaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice . The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programming and policy enquiries. The ABC Reception Advice Line is the first point of contact for viewers and listeners experiencing technical problems receiving ABC television or radio. A summary of audience contacts to the Reception Advice Line is set out at page 147. In 2012-13, Audience and Consumer Affairs logged 47 205 audience contacts, a 0.3% increase on the 47 050 contacts logged by Audience and Consumer Affairs in 2011-12. The profile of contacts reported by Audience and Consumer Affairs reflects the particular remit of the unit. Written complaints alleging a breach of the ABC Code of Practice or ABC Editorial Policies received elsewhere in the ABC are required to be referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs in the first instance, whereas requests, suggestions, praise and other comments are not. This, and the unit's specialist complaints-handling focus, means that the proportion of contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs which are complaints will generally be higher than the proportion received elsewhere throughout the Corporation.Corporate governance Freedom of information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (\"FOI Act\") gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. During the past year, the ABC received 43 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Six requests were granted, six were granted in part, ten were refused, 13 were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, and one was dealt with outside of the formal FOI process. Seven requests were still being processed at the end of the financial year. Of the ten requests which were refused, seven were outside the scope of the FOI Act. Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act specifically excludes documents relating to the ABC's program material from the operation of the FOI Act. In accordance with s8(1) of the FOI Act, the ABC has prepared an Agency Plan which describes how the ABC will comply with the Information Publication Scheme requirements set out in Part II of the FOI Act. The ABC's Agency Plan and Disclosure Log are published on the ABC's website: about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/freedom-of-information/ Annual report The ABC is required by s.9 of the CAC Act to prepare an annual report. The report must be submitted to the responsible minister for presentation to the Parliament. The ABC Annual Report 2011-12 was submitted to Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and was tabled in Parliament on 12 October 2012. The ABC Annual Report 2011-12 received a gold award in the Australasian Reporting Awards for the quality of its content and presentation. This was the tenth successive ABC Annual Report to win gold.GOVERNANCE 133 5Summary of Contacts Received Contact type Email/Letter/Other Number % Complaint 21 857 46.3 Request/Suggestion 17 226 36.5 Other 4 215 8.9 Appreciation 3 907 8.3 Total 47 205 100.0 Subject Matter of Contacts Received Email/ % Subject Letter/Other Total Requests for information, programs, product availability and other matters 21 441 45.4 Complaints about program standards, scheduling and other matters 16 225 34.4 Appreciation of programs and presenters 3 907 8.3 Party political bias 2 139 4.5 Bias (other than party political)* 1 523 3.2 Complaints of factual inaccuracy 1 385 2.9 Lack of balance 585 1.3 Total 47 205 100.0 * Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as sport and religion. Key concerns reflected in audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year included 590 written complaints in relation to promotions about specific programs as well as promotions generally. Concerns raised included that promotions were intrusive, too loud and that there were too many of them.There were 523 complaints about a 7.30 interview between Leigh Sales and Opposition Leader, the Hon Tony Abbott MP on 22 August 2012. The majority of the complaints were that the interview reflected anti-Opposition bias or that it was conducted aggressively. There were also 376 appreciative contacts about the interview. There were 394 complaints about the ABC's coverage of the 2012 London Paralympics, primarily that there was too much focus on commentators in the studio and that the commentary itself was of poor quality. There were also 456 appreciative contacts from viewers who praised the coverage as professional, informative and passionate. The ABC received 375 complaints from viewers who were disappointed with the ABC's decision to discontinue production of the Marngrook Footy Show. Of the 21 857 complaints received, 3 662 were claims of party political or other bias, 585 alleged lack of balance and 1 385 were claims of factual inaccuracy. These complaints related to a broad range of ABC programs and services. Timeliness Audience and Consumer Affairs seeks to respond to all contacts within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures. Written complaints finalised Number % Number % Response Response made 5 527 74.3 from A&CA within 30 days Response made 7 242 97.3 within 60 days 7 440 35.0 Referred to other areas of the ABC for direct response 8 148 38.3 No response required 5 692 26.7 Total written complaints finalised 21 280 100.0134 GOVERNANCEBetween 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs responded directly to 13 608 audience contacts. Of these, 9 820 (72.2%) received responses within 30 days. Complaint outcomes During 2012-13, 21 280 written complaints were finalised by Audience and Consumer Affairs. The unit provided a personal response to 7 440 of these complaints (comprising 7 480 issues), of which 5 527 (74.3%) received responses within 30 days. There were 8 148 complaint contacts referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response and no substantive response was required for 5 692 complaint contacts. These 7 440 responses to complaints sent by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year includes two distinct groups of complaints: complaints investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs which alleged breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice ; and complaints about matters of personal preference which do not raise issues of compliance with the ABC's editorial standards, and for which Audience and Consumer Affairs provide an audience liaison service. This latter group of complaints makes up the larger number of the total. As these complaints do not go to the ABC's editorial standards, they are not formally investigated and are not capable of being upheld. During 2012-13, 3 177 complaint issues were investigated. A total of 220 (6.9%) were upheld in cases where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. A further 90 issues were resolved (2.8%) after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2012-13, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included written apologies to complainants; on-air corrections; counselling or other action with staff; removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website. Australian Communications and Media Authority Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2012-13, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 47 such matters (compared to 55 in 2011-12). In one case in 2012-13, the ACMA found a breach of the ABC Code of Practice : Fair and honest dealing: ACMA concluded that a Media Watch segment made an allegation against a journalist and was obliged to offer him a fair opportunity to respond. ACMA was satisfied with actions taken by the ABC in response to this finding and did not invoke its further statutory powers that allow it to recommend that the ABC take further action. Commonwealth Ombudsman The Ombudsman's office commenced one investigation into the ABC's handling of a complaint during the current reporting period. The Ombudsman's office decided that the complaint did not warrant further investigation and therefore made no finding. nCorporate governance GOVERNANCE 135 5The ABC is required by the ABC Act to prepare corporate plans which outline the overall strategies and policies that the Corporation will follow to achieve its objectives and fulfil its functions. This report documents the ABC's performance against the six strategic goals in the ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 . The ABC's performance is reported on two levels: Goals : A \"dash-board\" summary of the ABC's performance in relation to its six strategic objectives.Indicators : Summary results against specific measures, with cross-references to data and information which demonstrates the ABC's performance.Performance against the ABC Strategic Plan 2010-13 Goal Audience focused : To provide a range of media experiences to meet the needs and expectations of diverse audiences.

The inaugural ABC RAP spanned the period from November 2009 to October 2012. During the first half of the reporting period, the Corporation developed a new RAP for 2013 -15 that built on the successes of the RAP 2009 -12, while applying new approaches to areas where targets were not achieved. The RAP 2013-15 came into effect on 1 January 2013. In December 2012, the ABC extended the reporting period of the RAP 2 0 0 9 -12 to 31 December 2012 so that it aligned with the new RAP . In February 2013, the ABC published its third and final report against the RAP 2009 -12, covering the period November 2011 to December 2012. The RAP 2013-15 and the ABC's reports against its RAP are available on the Corporation's website (about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/our-plans/). Overall achievement In comparison to the first two years of RAP 2009 -12, during which a number of major changes or new programs were introduced, the final year was characterised by smaller, incremental improvements and the maintenance of programs and levels of activity that had been achieved in the first two years. The richer and more extensive NAIDOC celebrations on air and at ABC offices around the country that began in the first year of the Plan continued in 2012. ABC Radio once again mounted a dedicated digital and online service, ABC NAIDOC, throughout the week. ABC Radio also broadcast a significant range of programs to recognise National Reconciliation Week 2012.Overall achievement Areas for improvementReconciliation Action Plan 2013-15 The Bonner Committee Through the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) program, organisations develop business plans that document what they will do within their sphere of influence to contribute to reconciliation in Australia. The ABC's RAP outlines practical actions the Corporation will take to build strong relationships and enhanced respect with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.150 GOVERNANCEReconciliation Action Plan During the reporting period for the final report against the RAP 2009-12, ABC Television broadcast 110 Indigenous television programs and programs with segments explicitly covering Indigenous people, communities and/or issues. ABC Radio and News continued to focus on initiatives that create opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment, particularly in program making and cadet roles, in order to lay the ground for future Indigenous involvement in content production. The Corporation's State and Territory Directors continued to develop and deepen relationships with Indigenous communities and organisations around the country. Areas for improvement While the ABC achieved the majority of its objectives\u2014both in the final year and over the life of the RAP as a whole\u2014in relation to respect, relationships and content, it was less successful in relation to its employment-related objectives. In particular, the Corporation failed to significantly increase the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff within its workforce or to reach the 2% target specified in the RAP . Indigenous staff comprised approximately 1.5% of the ABC workforce throughout the life of the Plan. Similarly, while a number of divisions actively sought to attract Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, the Corporation as a whole failed in its objective of targeting 20 positions to increase Indigenous employment. In both cases, it became clear that the RAP lacked a mechanism for coordinating activity to ensure overall achievement of these objectives. The ABC remains fully committed to increasing Indigenous employment opportunities. Accordingly, a new ABC Indigenous Employment Strategy 2013 -15 was developed, to increase Indigenous employment levels in a coordinated and strategic manner. The Strategy came into effect on 1 January 2013 and operates in parallel with the RAP 2013-15 .In addition, there were two areas in which the ABC achieved its stated objective, but nonetheless identified ways in which the initiative might have been improved. The first related to its program to encourage understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures among ABC staff, which had a relatively low completion level. The second was a commitment to develop induction and mentoring support for new Indigenous staff, which was inconsistently supported by divisions. The ABC remains committed to both these programs and will review and improve them as part of the RAP 2013-15 . Reconciliation Action Plan 2013 -15 The development of the RAP 2013-15 was overseen by the Bonner Committee, the ABC's primary advisory and representative body on matters relating to Indigenous staff, content and communities. The Committee consulted widely, including with Indigenous ABC staff, ABC divisions and their Indigenous Reference Groups, ABC State and Territory branches, policy managers and interested individuals within the Corporation. The RAP incorporates a new Indigenous Employment Strategy and adds a number of new initiatives. In particular, the ABC will recognise and celebrate National Reconciliation Week and has committed to exploring the use of Indigenous suppliers. It will also adopt appropriate cultural protocols for use by content makers and ensure that the public areas of ABC offices contain visible recognition of the traditional owners of land and the contribution of the Corporation's Indigenous staff. The RAP was amended in April to reflect minor changes proposed by Reconciliation Australia\u2014 the organisation that oversees the RAP process.GOVERNANCE 151 5The RAP 2013 -15 comprises the following 25 initiatives: Respect Support the Bonner Committee, the ABC's Indigenous advisory group, which monitors and coordinates the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan Provide staff with ongoing access to the \"Indigenous Culture in the ABC\" program Use appropriate cultural protocols including Acknowledgement or Welcome to Country at events Adopt appropriate cultural protocols for content makers Continue to recognise and participate in NAIDOC Week Establish an Indigenous site on the ABC Intranet to provide a unified source of information in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and issues; and Install signage and other physical recognition of the traditional owners of land and the contribution of Indigenous ABC staff in the public foyers and reception areas of ABC offices.Opportunities-employment Implement the ABC Indigenous Employment Strategy Undertake activities to increase the number of Indigenous employees at the ABC to 2% within two years (end 2014) and exceed that target in 2015 Undertake \"pipeline\" activities to increase awareness of potential jobs and careers at the ABC among Indigenous secondary and tertiary students Provide career development opportunities for Indigenous employees Develop a framework to maximise retention of Indigenous employees; and Contribute to the growth of Indigenous employment opportunities in the wider media industry. Opportunities-Content Demonstrate a stronger Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander presence in ABC content, including regional content, and in subsequent scheduling and marketing/promotionThe ABC's RAP requires the Corporation to use its broadcasting platforms to showcase the stories of Indigenous Australians. In November 2012, the ABC debuted the groundbreaking drama Redfern Now , produced and directed by Indigenous film makers. Over the course of six episodes, Redfern Now set a new standard for telling stories from and about Indigenous Australians. The series was produced and directed by Indigenous film makers, starred an Indigenous cast and was mostly shot in and around the Sydney suburb of Redfern. The series also created employment and professional opportunities for the Indigenous film makers. The series was very popular with audiences, with the first episode watched by a national average of 1.1 million viewers. Redfern Now152 GOVERNANCE Improved integration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the content-making process, including new projects Target and develop Indigenous on-air presenters; and Develop internal and external communication to improve awareness of Indigenous achievement and activity in the ABC. Relationships Create opportunities to build strategic partnerships and projects with Indigenous communities and relevant external organisations, with a focus on regional opportunities Develop opportunities with Indigenous suppliers; and Recognise and participate in Reconciliation Week. Tracking Progress and Reporting The Bonner Committee will monitor and report on RAP actions Contribute to Reconciliation Australia's RAP Impact Measurement Questionnaire Divisional Indigenous Reference Groups (IRGs) will continue to meet State and Territory Indigenous Working Groups (IWGs) continue to operate; and The ABC will refresh the RAP . The Bonner Committee The Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory body on issues relating to Indigenous staff, content and communities. The Committee comprises a geographically-diverse mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff. The Committee's Chair is responsible for providing advice to the Managing Director in relation to issues of relevance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and relationships with Indigenous communities. The Committee met four times during the reporting period. It was responsible for monitoring progress against the ABC's RAPs and oversaw the development of the RAP 2013 -15. The Committee is named after the late Neville Bonner AO, who was an ABC Board Director from 1983-91 and Australia's first Indigenous Senator. nReconciliation Action Plan The ABC's new Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) lists the ways in which ABC divisions, including Radio, Television and News are working to improve opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The RAP was launched in Canberra, as part of the Reconciliation Action Plan showcase, celebrating the success of RAPs across a wide range of Australian organisations. The ABC's new RAP helps the Corporation monitor its efforts to improve opportunities for Indigenous people. This is the ABC's second RAP, and spans the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015. It builds on the successes of the first RAP (November 2009 to December 2012), while absorbing the lessons learned from it. The development of the current RAP was overseen by the Bonner Committee, the ABC's primary advisory and representative body on matters relating to Indigenous staff, content and communities. The Committee consulted widely, including with Indigenous ABC staff, ABC divisions and their Indigenous Reference Groups, ABC State and Territory branches, policy managers and interested individuals within the Corporation.

Financial Outcome 2012-13As in previous years, the ABC operated within its total sources of funds and revenue from Government for the 2012-13 financial year. Sources of Funds 2012-13The ABC was allocated $1 030.2 million in the May 2012 Federal Budget and $12.1 million in the 2012-13 Additional Estimates process, totalling $1 042.3 million for the 2012-13 year. The amount allocated to the ABC in the 2013 Federal Budget.$1.03 billionThe ABC also received $158.2 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial. The chart \"ABC Source of Funds\" depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2012-13 and its budgeted sources for 2013 -14. Application of Funds The chart \"Split Actual Expenditure 2012-13\" broadly represents the ABC's application of funds by function for the 2012-13 financial year.160 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEFinancial summary The Year Ahead Revenue from Government The May 2013 Federal Budget maintained the ABC's funding base, provided a $90 million loan from government over three years to assist with the cash flow requirements of the Melbourne Accommodation Project, and provided additional funding for journalism, digital content delivery, increased digital television coverage, and ANZAC Centenary programming. The ABC's funding for the 2013 -14 financial year is: $m Total revenue from Government per Outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and including equity injection/loan 1 077.1 Less Analog Transmission funds 80.4 Less Digital Television Transmission funds 109.1 Less Digital Radio Transmission funds 3.7 Less Loan funds 20.0 Total Revenue from Government 863.9 The chart \"ABC Revenue from Government by Program 2013-14\" broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by Program for the 2013-14 financial year. Budget StrategyWhile some additional funding was provided in the May 2013 Federal Budget, this funding is tied to specific initiatives, and terminates after three years, and is not available to address the continual cost pressures arising from the ABC's existing cost base. Additional funding announced in the 2013 -14 Budget will allow the ABC to increase the reach, impact and local relevance of news services, to develop documentaries for the ANZAC Centenary, to increase digital television coverage, and to meet the increasing demand for digital content delivered to audiences via web-based and mobile device platforms. Government loan funding will also assist the ABC in meeting the cash-flow requirements for the major property redevelopment in Melbourne. The continuing decline in the contribution from ABC Commercial has placed further pressure on the Corporation's financial resources. Other cost pressures have also compounded this situation, especially in the areas of insurance, employer superannuation contributions, and electricity. In this challenging environment, the 2013 -14 Budget Strategy aims to deliver a balance between applying modest funding towards the critical move into mobile and online environments, while also addressing cost-base sustainability issues faced by the ABC, and ensuring existing activities are maintained at current levels and recurrent activities are funded from recurrent sources. In the May 2013 Budget, the Government did not address the long-outstanding issue of the adequacy of ABC capital asset replacement funding. The ABC is currently assessing the implications for ABC activities in the medium term, and working on developing options to address this situation. Comparative Revenue from GovernmentThe 2013 -14 operational revenue from Government of $864 million represents a decrease in real funding of $251 million (or 22.5%) since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart \"ABC Operational Revenue from Government\". n5005506006507007508008509009501000105011001150 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 161 6Revenue from government The ABC operational revenue from Government graph demonstrates the value of funding in real terms over time.Five-year Analysis 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 ABC Operating $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Cost of Services 1 167 877 1 179 929 1 134 969 1 101 074 1 078 755 Operating Revenue 158 853 173 134 181 361 184 260 234 222 Net Cost of Services (a) 1 009 024 1 006 795 953 608 916 814 844 533 Share of (deficit)/surplus from jointly controlled entities (2 311) (2 317) (1 732) 468 - Revenue from Government 1 023 700 997 403 955 516 915 058 858 411 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Financial Position $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Current Assets 314 234 548 237 927 275 761 Non-Current Assets 976 657 1 012 702 985 096 1 004 396 948 920 Total Assets 1 291 000 1 124 506 1 219 614 1 242 343 1 224 681 Current Liabilities 242 107 223 918 225 608 241 388 230 403 Non-Current Liabilities 35 081 29 022 20 590 24 161 48 187 Total Liabilities 277 188 252 940 246 198 265 549 278 590 Total Equity 1 013 812 988 566 973 446 976 774 946 091 Ratios Current Ratio (b) 1.30 1.02 1.04 0.99 1.20 Equity (c) 79% 80% 80% 79% 77% (a) Net cost of services is cost of services less operating revenue.

Directors' Responsibility for the Financial StatementsThe directors of the Corporation are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , including the Australian Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's ResponsibilityMy responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on my audit. I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. These auditing standards require that I comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Corporation's preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.Auditor-General for Australia GPO Box 707 CANBERRA ACT 2601 19 National Circuit BARTON ACT Phone (02) 6203 7500 Fax (02) 6273 5355 Email ian.mcphee@anao.gov.auFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 163 6Independence In conducting my audit, I have followed the independence requirements of the Australian National Audit Office, which incorporate the requirements of the Australian accounting profession.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\") are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. The financial report for the Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2013 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 26 July 2013. 1.1 Objectives of the Corporation The Corporation is an Australian Government controlled not-for-profit entity. The objectives of the Corporation are derived explicitly from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and are: Objective 1\u2014Ensure the Corporation's independence, integrity and high standards; Objective 2\u2014To be recognised as the leading Australian public media space where people engage with issues and ideas; Objective 3\u2014Deliver maximum benefit to the people of Australia through the effective and efficient delivery of the Corporation's services; and Objective 4\u2014Sustain and grow the Corporation through high quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity. The Corporation is structured to meet four outcomes: Outcome 1\u2014Audiences throughout Australia, and overseas, are informed, educated and entertained. Outcome 2\u2014Australian and international communities have access to at least the scale and quality of satellite and analog terrestrial radio and television transmission services that existed at 30 June 2003. Outcome 3\u2014The Australian community has access to ABC digital television services in accordance with approved digital implementation plans. Outcome 4\u2014The Australian community has access to ABC digital radio services in accordance with approved digital implementation plans. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament for the Corporation's administration and programs. During 2012-13, two changes were made to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act (1983) to: (1) include specific reference to the provision of digital media services as one of the functions of the Corporation, and (2) that only the ABC or a prescribed company, can be the provider of Commonwealth funded international services. 1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements and are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) for reporting periods ending on or after 1 July 2012; and Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FMOs, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Balance Sheet when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation or a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under executory agreements are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013174 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements continued Liabilities and assets that are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments or the Schedule of Contingencies (other than unquantifiable or remote contingencies, which are reported at Note 13: Contingent Assets and Liabilities). Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, income and expenses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when and only when the flow, consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.3 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied the following estimates and assumptions: Long service leave, as detailed in Note 1.11: Employee Benefits; Provision for make good, as detailed in Note 1.12: Leases; Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 1.21: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale; Depreciation, as detailed in Note 1.21: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale; Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 1.22: Impairment of Non-Current Assets; and Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 1.24: Inventories. No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year. 1.4 New Australian Accounting Standards Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements No accounting standard has been adopted earlier than the application date stated in the standard. The following adopted requirements have affected the amounts reported in the current or prior periods or are estimated to have a financial effect in future reporting periods. AASB 2011-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Incom e. This makes a number of changes to the presentation of other comprehensive income including presenting separately those items that would be reclassified to profit or loss in the future and those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss and the impact of tax on those items. The changes required by this standard have been incorporated in the Statement of Comprehensive Income under the category of Other Comprehensive Income. AASB 2010-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets . These amendments clarify that the tax base of investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with AASB 140 Investment Property is based on the premise that the carrying amount will be recovered entirely through sale rather than use. This has had no impact on the ABC. Other new, revised or amending standards or interpretations that are applicable to the current reporting period did not have a material financial impact, and are not expected to have a future financial impact on the Corporation. 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 175 61.4 New Australian Accounting Standards continued Future Australian Accounting Standard Requirements The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations have been issued by the AASB but are effective for future reporting periods. The impact of adopting these pronouncements, when effective, will not have a material financial impact on the Corporation's financial statements. AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and include changes to classification and measurement, impairment methodology and hedge accounting measures as well as reducing the categories of financial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value. As a result, the Corporation will be required to classify its held to maturity investments and loans and receivables at \"amortised cost\". The Corporation has elected not to early adopt this standard to be consistent with the current FMOs. AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements . AASB 10 introduces a new approach to determining which investees should be consolidated. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. It is expected to have minimal impact on the ABC. AASB 11 Joint Arrangements . If the parties have rights to and obligations for underlying assets and liabilities, the joint arrangement is considered a joint operation and partial consolidation is applied. Otherwise the joint arrangement is considered a joint venture and they must use the equity method to account for their interest. The Standard applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 for not-for-profit entities. The Corporation does not expect this standard to have a material impact in future years. AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities . AASB 12 contains the disclosure requirements for entities that have interest in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or unconsolidated structured entities. The Standard applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 2011-8 indicates changes to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 13) . AASB 13 explains how to measure fair value when required to by other AASBs. It does not introduce new fair value measurements, nor does it eliminate the practicability exceptions to fair value that currently exist in certain standards. The provisions of this are mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. AASB 119 Employee Benefits . The main change arising from this amendment relates to the treatment of actuarial gains or losses of accrued benefits. This standard applies for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The Corporation has elected not to early adopt this standard to be consistent with the current FMOs. AASB 2009-11 Amendments to the Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 [AASB 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 136, 139, 1023, 1038 and Interpretations 10 and 12] . The amendments to these standards arise from the issue of AASB 9 Financial Instruments as discussed above that sets out requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. This standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. As the Corporation has chosen not to early adopt AASB 9 the amendments to these standards will also not be early adopted. AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB (December 2010) . This adds the requirements in AASB 139 in relation to the de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities to AASB 9. AASB 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets; amortised cost and fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The Standard applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. AASB 2011-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards to Remove Individual Key Management Personnel Disclosure Requirements . This removes the requirements to include individual key management personnel disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2013. This should have minimal impact on the ABC. The ABC is governed by the disclosure requirements as set in the FMOs. Early adoption is not permitted.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013176 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.4 New Australian Accounting Standards continued Future Australian Accounting Standard Requirements continued AASB 2012-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosures\u2014Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (June 2012) . AASB 7 is amended to increase the disclosures about offset positions, including the gross position and the nature of the arrangements. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. AASB 2012-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (June 2012) . The amendments to AASB 132 clarify when an entity has a legally enforceable right to set off financial liabilities permitting entities to present balances net on the balance sheet. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Other new, revised or amending standards or interpretations that were issued and are applicable to future reporting periods are not expected to have a material financial impact on the Corporation in future reporting periods. 1.5 Foreign Currency Transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 1.6 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes relevant to the Corporation is presented in Note 21: Reporting by Outcomes. Any intra-government costs are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia. 1.7 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; the Corporation retains no managerial involvement or effective control over the goods; the revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of GST upon delivery of the goods to customers. Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. Revenue is recognised when: the amount of revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits with the transaction will flow to the Corporation.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 177 61.7 Revenue continued The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Receivables for goods and services, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due, less any Impairment allowance for bad and doubtful debts. The collectability of debts is reviewed at the balance date. Provisions are made when the collectability of debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Revenue from Government Parliament appropriates monies to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, which is then distributed to the Corporation and recognised as revenue from Government. The full amount received in respect of departmental outputs for the year is disclosed in Note 6: Revenue from Government. Revenues from Government receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts. 1.8 Gains and losses Sale of Assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. 1.9 Grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have not been provided or eligibility criteria have not been met. 1.10 Transactions with the Government as Owner Where the Corporation is required to return unspent funds to the Government and this return is discretionary, amounts returned are recognised as a return of equity in the year in which the Minister agrees to the return amount. Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as contributed equity in accordance with the FMOs. Other Distributions to Owners The FMOs require that distributions to owners be debited to contributed equity unless it is in the nature of a dividend. Contributions Income is measured at the fair value of the contributions received or receivable. Income arising from the contribution of an asset to the Corporation is recognised when the entity obtains control of the contribution or the right to receive the contribution, it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the Corporation and the amount of the contribution can be measured reliably.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013178 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.11 Employee Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extent that they have not been settled. Liabilities for short-term employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits ) and termination benefits expected to be settled within twelve months are measured at their nominal amounts. The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave for the Corporation has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, Professional Financial Consulting Pty Ltd, as at 30 June 2013. The liability for long service leave represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to the balance date. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance and Deregulation as an administered item. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2013 represents outstanding contributions at the end of the period. 1.12 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases and operating leases. Finance leases effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets. An operating lease is a lease that is not a finance lease. In operating leases, the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Operating lease rentals are not segregated between minimum lease payments, contingent rents and sublease payments, as required by AASB 117 Leases , as these components are not individually material.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 179 61.12 Leases continued Lease incentives taking the form of 'free' leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. Provision for Make Good A provision for make good exists when the Corporation has an obligation to 'make good' leased properties at the end of the lease term. As many of the leases are negotiable, the Corporation has determined the provision as set out below. Retail leased premises A provision has been recognised for retail leases where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement to make good the site or where the Corporation believes there is some probability that it will incur costs to make good the site. The provision is calculated based on the estimated average cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. Other leased premises A provision has been recognised for other leases where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement to make good the site or where the Corporation believes there is some likelihood that it will incur costs to make good the site. The provision is calculated based on the estimated cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. 1.13 Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. 1.14 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts. Cash and cash equivalents include: cash on hand; and cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 1.15 Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held-to-maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) where the financial assets: a. have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; b. are derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument; or1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013180 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.15 Financial Assets continued Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss continued c. are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through profit or loss except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss. Held-to-Maturity Investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash has been invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as 'other receivables'. 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedLoans and Receivables Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 181 61.15 Financial Assets continued Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. Trade receivables are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due, less an allowance for impairment. Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each balance date. Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for loans and receivables or held to maturity investments held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced by way of an allowance account. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the likelihood of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. 1.16 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as 'other financial liabilities' in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . The Corporation has no interest bearing liabilities at 30 June 2013. Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. The fair value of loans from Government is deemed to be the initial principal amount. The Corporation does not have any loans from government or commercial bank loans. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Corporation has the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Supplier and other payables are recognised at amortised cost. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Standard ABC settlement terms are 30 days commercial. 1.17 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013182 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.18 Joint Ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and the FMOs. Further details relating to joint ventures, to which the Corporation is a party, are provided in Note 8: Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method. 1.19 Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are disclosed in the relevant schedule and Note 13: Contingent Assets and Liabilities. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability, or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. 1.20 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are recognised as assets at their fair value, at acquisition date. 1.21 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Balance Sheet. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Basis of Revaluation Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value. Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below. Asset Class Fair Value Measured at Freehold Land Market Value Freehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Land Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Improvements Depreciated replacement cost Infrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Following initial recognition at cost, property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary, with the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised through profit or loss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit or loss except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 183 61.21 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale continued Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are initially based on the following useful lives: 2013 2012 Leasehold land\u2014long term 99 to 120 years 99 to 120 years Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold buildings Life of Lease (up to 50 years) Life of Lease (up to 50 years) Leasehold improvements 5 to 50 years 5 to 50 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years 3 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation and amortisation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 4C: Depreciation and amortisation. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are stated in the Balance Sheet at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of assets classified as held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell. Any gains for subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell for assets classified as held for sale are recognised only to the extent that they are not in excess of the cumulative impairment losses that have been recognised in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations or previously in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . If any assets classified as held for sale no longer meet the criteria under AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the Corporation will cease to classify the asset as held for sale. Non-current assets that cease to be classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of: a. the carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale; and b. the recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. 1.22 Impairment of Non-Current Assets All non-current assets except: inventories; assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; and non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . At the reporting date, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired. 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013184 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1.22 Impairment of Non-Current Assets continued Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 1.23 Intangible Assets The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use, broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2012 3-8 years). These assets are assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amounts of impaired assets are written down to the lower of their net market selling price or depreciated replacement cost. The Corporation's right to use broadcast licences and spectrum are held at their fair value. 1.24 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced Programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Balance Sheet. The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics\u2014100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies\u2014straight line over three years from completion of production; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; and Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. The costs of programs produced for Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Write-down of Merchandise Inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 185 61.24 Inventories continued Write-down of Inventory Held for Distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. 1.25 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 1.26 Taxation Income Tax The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive since the year ended 30 June 2000 up to and including 30 June 2013. The Corporation's equity interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Pty Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, gains, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Balance Sheet while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet. Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a net basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from or payable to the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed on a net basis. Net GST commitments recoverable from, or payable to the ATO are disclosed. 2.

The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a continuous basis. To meet the Corporation's financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested into short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as 'other receivables'. The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies as approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 18.4 Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the net fair values: Cash, receivables, payables and short term borrowings The carrying amount approximates the net fair value because of the short term maturity. Loans from Government The net fair values of long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. At 30 June 2013, the Corporation had no loans from Government.18. Financial Instruments continued 18.2 Categories of Financial Instruments continued Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013208 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE18.4 Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Forward exchange contracts The net fair values of forward exchange contracts are taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

The Corporation has adopted the amendment to AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1\u2014quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2\u2014inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3\u2014inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The Corporation has no level 1 financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, or trading and available-for-sale securities) that are based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using valuation techniques. The Corporation uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts are determined using a level 2 technique based on the forward exchange market rates at the end of the reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts at 30 June 2013 was $413 868 (2012 $68 091). The Corporation has no level 3 financial instruments where a valuation technique for the instruments is based on significant unobservable inputs. 18.6 Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and derivative instruments. The Corporation has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. 18. Financial Instruments continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 209 618.6 Credit Risk continued The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties ar e banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poors. The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of allowance for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in the Balance Sheet. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts, as disclosed.

The Corporation is not exposed to any other price risk on financial instruments .18. Financial Instruments continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013210 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE18.8 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in foreign exchange rates. The Corporation's activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not Australian dollars. The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk arising from some of these transactions. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges. The Corporation is exposed to foreign currency denominated in United States Dollars (USD), Great British Pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR). The following table details the effect on the profit and equity as at 30 June 2013 from a 15.7% (2012 15%) favourable/unfavourable change in the rate of the Australian Dollar (AUD) against the curr encies to which the Corporation is exposed, with all other variables held constant. Foreign Currency Sensitivity 2013 2013 2012 2012 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Foreign Currency outstanding positions at: Profit and Equity Profit and Equity Loss Loss USD AUD / USD +15.7% (2012 +15%) (481) (9) (423) - AUD / USD -15.7% (2012 -15%) 481 9 423 - (202 289 - 196 - EUR AUD / EUR +15.7% (2012 +15%) (27) (177) (61) (26) AUD / EUR -15.7% (2012 -15%) 27 177 61 26 The impact on the Corporation's surplus is not material. 18.9 Hedging Instruments Specific Hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50 000 or greater (equivalent) are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. The balance of the hedging reserve in equity reflects a net gain of $74 231 (2012 net loss of $4 671) on specific hedges of foreign currency purchases as at 30 June 2013. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective during the period. The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. Sell Australian Dollars Average Exchange Rate 2013 2012 2013 2012 $'000 $'000 Buy USD Less than 1 year 1 921 1 598 1.0300 1.0245 Buy GBP Less than 1 year 1 392 769 0.6465 0.6505 Buy EUR Less than 1 year 1 125 274 0.7508 0.7818 18. Financial Instruments continuedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2013FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 211 618.9 Hedging Instruments continued General Hedges The Corporation also enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50 000 (equivalent) of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is typically held between 40% and 60% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to profit or loss. The net gain of $339 637 (2012 net gain $72 672) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2012 to June 2013 has been recognised at balance date through profit or loss. 18.10 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Corporation is typically not exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings, as all borrowings are at fixed interest rates and the Corporation repaid its loan in full before 30 June 2012. The Corporation derives interest revenue from funds invested, which is impacted by interest rate fluctuations. Although the Corporation is not dependent on interest revenue to continue operations, a 1.20% (2012 1.40%) decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease in interest revenue of $2 032 594 (2012 $1 990 599) and a 1.20% (2012 1.40%) increase in the interest rate would result in an increase in interest revenue of $2 032 594 (2012 $1 990 599). The change in interest revenue is proportional to the change in interest rates. 18.11 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Corporation will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Corporation is dependent upon revenue from Government. At 30 June 2013, in excess of 86% (2012 85%) of normal activities are funded in this manner, and without this revenue, the Corporation would be unable to meet its obligations.

During 2012-13 Group Audit continued to operate with a combination of in-house staff and outsourced external providers. This provided access to expertise in specialist areas and supplemented internal resources and experience. The external providers were appointed following an open market tender conducted in the first half of 2012-13. Coordination with external auditors Group Audit continued to liaise with the ABC's external auditors, as well as the ANAO and its nominated representative, KPMG, who were appointed during 2008-09. It sought advice regarding proposed areas of focus, the identification of areas of potential external audit reliance on Group Audit and to ensure that there was minimal duplication of audit coverage.

(acting) Director, Victoria Randal Mathieson Director, WA Geoff Duncan In 2012-13, the ABC Advisory Council met three times. It made three recommendations and 25 commendations. Advisory Council members Member Ms Joan McKain, Convenor (Lake Cathie, NSW) Dr Patrick Bradbery (Rock (Glenside, SA) Mr Nakul Legha (Gungahlin, Leong (Burwood, Victoria) Ms Tania Penovic (Surrey Hills, Victoria) Mr Rob Ryan (Holland Park East, Queensland)Mr Taylor Tran (Naremburn, NSW) Summary of recommendations, responses and commendations 2012-13 Recommendations Recommendation R1/2/12\u2014ABC Shops The ABC Advisory Council recommends the inclusion of iview, ABC weblinks, feedback forms and program newsletters in ABC shops. As ABC Shops are an important part of the public face of the ABC, these initiatives would provide greater opportunity for audience feedback, cross promotion and exposure to ABC offerings. Director of ABC Commercial : ABC Commercial would like to thank the Advisory Council for their recommendation on ABC Shops. Each ABC Shop already has a \"Please Take One\" stand that is designed specifically to carry available newsletters, information sheets, playlists and feedback forms relating to the ABC's activities. This is placed in a prominent position on the counter in every ABC Shop. Each ABC Shop also has a customer \"touch-point\", which is a computer kiosk facility where customers are encouraged to \"Find, Watch, Listen, Connect\". Unfortunately, ABC Shops have been unable to play iview in the past due to bandwidth restrictions. However, a project is underway to increase bandwidth capability to enable in-store access to iview. Streaming performance is being tested before the project is officially launched. Recommendation R2/2/12\u2014Q&A The ABC Advisory Council recommends some changes to Q&A based on recent community feedback, namely: inviting a wider diversity of guests; fewer repeat appearances, especially by politicians; more frequent Indigenous representation, including dedicating a program to an Indigenous panel; and the inclusion of other articulate community representatives who could be sourced through ABC activities, such as ABC Open. Director of Television : The number of politicians who are willing and able to deal with Q&A 's format and to speak with authority on relevant issues is limited. Inevitably there will be return appearances by politicians. Q&A recognizes the importance of broad representation and is looking at opportunities to increase the diversity of panels. Q&A is collaborating with ABC Open, including facilitating video questions from regional areas and exploring opportunities for regional audiences to be more involved in Q&A . Recommendation R1/3/12\u2014Q&A The ABC Advisory Council recommends consideration be given to extending the number of regional Q&A events in future. This would take Q&A to a wider audience and encourage local participation from a new and diverse guest-base, and would enable the program to focus on local issues from across Australia. Director of Television : The ABC believes it currently delivers regional diversity across all its platforms and continues to work hard to fulfil its Charter. The ABC has increased the number of Q&A episodes in recent years, and is seeking to extend the reach of this important program.Appendix 4\u2014ABC Advisory CouncilAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2013222 APPENDICESAppendix 4\u2014ABC Advisory Council continued Commendations The ABC Advisory Council made a number of commendations relating to the ABC's people, content and activities during 2012-13. In relation to coverage of issues and events, the Council commended for the ABC for the range of excellent multi-platform content relating to the twentieth anniversary of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case; and for commissioning the telemovie Dangerous Remedy . The Council commended ABC News 24 for its ongoing coverage of significant world events such as the Leveson Inquiry and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Council recognised the efforts of various production teams and commended the Australian Story team for its continuing high standards; the ABC Indigenous Department and those involved in the making of Redfern Now ; the Foreign Correspondent team for providing 20 years of high quality educational and informative journalism; Costa Georgiadis and the Gardening Australia team for the stories about remote Aboriginal communities in episode 25, 'Connections to Country'; Poh Ling Yeow and the ABC's production team in South Australia for the creation of Poh's Kitchen Lends a Hand ; the Good Game team on Good Game (ABC2) and Good Game Spawn Point (ABC3); the producers, directors, cast and crew of Devil's Dust for their informative and challenging mini- series; Breakfast teams on ABC Local Radio around Australia; and the entire ABC team responsible for the coverage of the London 2012 Paralympics. The Council commended the following programs and products: The Doctor Blake Mysteries series; Rage on reaching its silver jubilee; the documentary Utopia Girls ; triple j for the One Night Stand concert in Dalby, Queensland; and ABC Reading Eggs. The Council commended the ABC for making each episode of season 7 of Dr Who available on iview immediately after it was first broadcast on the BBC. The Council recognised the efforts of ABC staff, and commended the late Dr Alan Saunders for his work and his many years of service to the ABC; staff of the ABC Shops throughout Australia; and journalist Matt Peacock for his ongoing commitment to raising awareness about asbestos-related disease. The Council recognised the important role the ABC plays in Australian communities, and commended the partnership between ABC Brisbane and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra; 612 ABC Brisbane for supporting the 2012 Kids in Care Christmas Appeal, which resulted in the collection of more than 11 000 gifts for children in State care; and ABC Local Radio across the country for the pivotal role it played providing information to the public on all platforms, including pop-up digital stations, during recent times of crisis and emergency. The Council commended the ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs department for providing comprehensive Audience Contact Reports. The Council commended the ABC for 80 years of broadcasting high quality content. Current as at 30 June 2013; last updated 1 January 2013 I. Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under section 8(1)(e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (\"the ACMA\"). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (\"the BSA\") to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. Section 150 of the BSA empowers the ACMA to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. The ACMA can decline to investigate the complaint under section 151 of the BSA if it is satisfied that the complaint does not relate to the ABC Code of Practice, or that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the ACMA has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 of the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either \"prohibited content\" 1 or \"age-restricted content\".2 The ACMA is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code developed by the Internet Industry Association and registered as an industry code with the ACMA under clause 85 of Schedule 7 of the BSA. The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice Footnotes appear on page 223 opposite.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2013APPENDICES 223 7Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: section 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. This Code does not apply to any complaint which the ABC had decided not to investigate or, having accepted it for investigation, decided not to investigate further, where the ABC was satisfied that: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the ABC accepted the complaint for investigation after being satisfied that it was appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ABC's ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly; or the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). To avoid any doubt, the ABC intends that any complaint falling within the terms of any one of the above categories is not relevant to the ABC Code of Practice, for the purposes of section 151(2)(b) of the BSA. In effect, this means that only complaints which the ABC has accepted for investigation in accordance with the above criteria are eligible under this Code to be reviewed and investigated by the ACMA. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations\u2014for accountability and for high quality\u2014can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. 1 Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use; and age-restricted content. 2 Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2013224 APPENDICES2. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong. Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2013APPENDICES 225 7Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate. Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording devices, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: a. justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or b. consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or c. the deception is integral to an artistic work and the potential for harm is taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances. Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2013226 APPENDICES7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. Innovation involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. This can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. The ABC must also be able to provide content for specific target audiences whose standards may differ from generally held community attitudes. Applying the harm and offence standard requires careful judgement. Context is an important consideration. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Consideration of the nature of the target audience for particular content is part of assessing harm and offence in context, as is any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs\u2014with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events\u2014are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways\u2014as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself. In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2013APPENDICES 227 7V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs\u2014with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events\u2014are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 . The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL (G programs may be shown at any time) G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children. The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2013228 APPENDICESPG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown: on weekdays between 8.30 am and 4.00 pm and between 6.00 pm and 6.00 am; and on weekends at any time except between 6.00 am and 10.00 am. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous. M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown: on weekdays that are school days, between noon and 3.00 pm; and on any day of the week between 8.30 pm and 5.00 am. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category\u2014the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity : Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continuedAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2013APPENDICES 229 7MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) MA15+ programs may be shown between 9.00 pm and 5.00 am on any day of the week. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category\u2014the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown, but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines Application of classifications to specific channels: ABC4Kids\u2014G only programming all day (5.00 am to 7.00 pm) ABC3\u2014M programming will not apply between 12.00 pm and 3.00 pm. The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. For example, a PG program or segment of a program designed for teenage viewers could appear between 4.00 pm and 6.00 pm on a week day if that is the time most suitable for the target audience. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside their normal classification time zone, provided that a clear indication of the nature of the content is given at the beginning of the program. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia and ordinarily receives the ABC's SA TV services. Given the time zone difference, in the rare cases when Broken Hill receives ABC NSW TV services, some programs may be broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program.
