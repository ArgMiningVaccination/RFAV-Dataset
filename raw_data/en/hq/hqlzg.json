Sexualizing Cancer will be a welcome resource for scholars, clinicians, and policymakers.\" Laura M. Carpenter, Vanderbilt University \"Mamo has put together an exciting and lively read, highlighting historically through to the present day the many ways in which assumptions about gender and sexuality underpin much of public health decision making. With a focus on HPV, she sets out an extremely compelling and well written narrative that places current debates within their larger economic, social, cultural, and political contexts. Weaving together the local and the global, she ultimately asks us to query how our own assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, and class impact how we read and understand public health, and the social connections and actions we take.\" Introduction: The Sexual Politics of Cancer and a New Regime of Cancer Prevention Chapter One: Producing and Protecting Risky Girls Chapter Two: \"What's In It for the Boys?\" Chapter Three: The Cancer That Dare Not Speak Its Name Chapter Four: A Tale of Two Trials: Settling Debate through Evidence-Based Medicine Chapter Five: A \"Coming Epidemic\" of HPV-Associated Oral Cancer Chapter Six: Sex at the Oncology Office: Oral Cancer Care and the Politics of Prevention Chapter Seven: Cervical Cancer's Screening Politics Chapter Eight: The Precision Imaginary: Optimizing Cancer Prevention Tools Chapter Nine: Commodities of Sexual Health Care Acknowledgments Notes Bibliography Index "}
