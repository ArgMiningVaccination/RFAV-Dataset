Question: Is my Schefflera plant a goner? My Mom had this plant, it slowly died. She didn t know what it was, and was just going to throw it away. It still had some life so I said I would take it.

So recently we had some work done in our office. I was in charge of organizing it and I had a contractor to deal with. He sent a girl who was quite young to paint our rooms. They were painted and were filled with paint all over the floors even when I gave her drop cloths. She didn't use them. She filled our sinks which got totally coated in scunge from her brushes that she never cleaned. She showed up 2 hours late almost every shift and.... She actually we found out today had taken some slats off the wall to paint.... And then she put them back and obviously used longer nails or put them in the wrong place because she drilled right through an electrical wire and now the electricity im our back room is completely out. Now they have to rip apart the wall and the new paint job which by the way she screwed the detail work up massively. Has anyone experienced something like this?

Question: How to improve breaking off the LOS as a big WR, improve route running? So this summer I'm working everyday on my route runnings/get offs. Because I'm 6'3 185 and bulked up since I started and I'm very fast, but my route running needs a lot of work. I've been doing drills for hours with my coaches on breaking off well but no matter what they say it's very hard for me. All the techniques don't seem to be working.It's really frustrating because I am pretty naturally athletic and good at every sport.

Should Pedro be sacked? I mean there are no excuses. Rangers are a much better team than Progres. Look at the players at Rangers, Progres are a team of nobodies. Yet the team from Luxembourg in a way deserved their win. Pedro has to take most of the blame. Whatever excuses he may have, won't wash either. I have a feeling that he didn't prepare the players properly as it is still so early before the season starts. Maybe he overlooked Progres, thinking it would be an automatic win over them. Whatever his excuses are, their not good enough. What do Rangers fans think? Should Pedro get the sack? Question: why is there alligators in golf courses?

I am going to do cross country, and i have been running for about a month and a half. I am a 15 year old female and i have never done much running before. I was going to start training at the beginning of may but i couldnt because I was sick and life got really busy. But I started running when school got out and so far i can only run a 27 minute 5k, i have been running a ton and i just cant seem to get better. I am so stressed out and worried i will be the worst one on the team and let everyone down.

Will i be one of the worse runners? Will i finish in last place? I have never done cross country before and i dont know what to expect for times. I never expected to be really good at it, i just dont what to be the worst. Question: Puppy Agression/Potty Training Help!? I adopted a rescue puppy from a shelter about two weeks ago. He just turned two months old. The first ten days that he was home he was extremely obedient and was doing well in his training and potty training he would only have one accident or two ((he s inside of the house). He is a Shepherd Mix with some Dobbie and Labrador.) I took him on a road trip with me out of town this weekend and he completely transformed. He began biting, growling and non-stop barking on the last day of the trip. We are already home and have been for two days but this behavior only continues. In fact is it WORSE.

In Sept, my air conditioner pipes leaked on my water heater & shorted a fuse. My air unit is installed above my water heater in a closet. My apartment maintenance guy replaced this fuse and caulked the panel shut in case there was another leak. Almost a year later my fire alarm went off one again. I noticed my water heater was incredibly hot. My bath water has been scorching hot, to a point to where I have to turn on the cold water to get it comfortable. After my fire alarm went off, I unplugged the system, waited an hour or two, and went to sleep. Today, I decided to not take a shower at my gym & plugged in my water heater. I went to work & came home to find a lingering wire burnt smell. I unplugged my water heater & called maintenance, which I had to leave a voicemail since it is the 4th. My question is: will unplugging my water heater without flipping the breaker cause any harm? Will it do any good at hopefully preventing fire? Does the caulking on the panel of the water heater do damage? Why would they do that? I am losing so much sleep over this. If this problem persists, I'm going to call the fire marshal to come check things out if I suspect subpar maintenence. Could the thermostat in the water heater get damaged? Shouldn't the breaker trip? I'm more concerned about leaving my dog alone than anything and want to ensure that my apt is safe to be in. If anyone can, please help.

Question: No Jawline Yet Skinny? (Read details for full story)? Ok So I'm 1.8m, 54 kg, and 16 years old. I'm a skinny guy but what's funny is that my jaw literally looks like its connected to my neck. Especially when I am looking down, it's as if I dont have a jaw, It's like I have a head and a neck. I did some research on platysma muscle, the stronger it is, the tighter it holds all that meat and everything, Could that be my problem? Also when I make a smooch face or anything, my jaw looks super defined, I have a good head structure but i have annoying meat surrounding my jawline that makes me look like an alien. This photo I found, kind of resembles it. It looks like this only when im not talking and looking straight. But when I make facial expressions and talk, and move my head around, u cant notice it.

Probably my favourite quote of all time because it has a deep meaning but sounds light hearted. My worry is the font it would be in wouldnt look very femenine. Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality - my imagination that i will have a better future and imagining all the things in life i enjoy helped me through a lot of my dark days. It would be a very femenine tattoo due ti the style it would be done in but my worry is it may sound too cliche. Question: Is it possible to find a poodle that is not much bigger than a chihuahua?

My husband took him outside immediately and he peed a river. I m not sure what could cause this. It was a massive amount of pee for his size. Question: Why do guys say girls look better without makeup, but won t like you when you re all natural cause you are not \"hot\" or \"pretty\" enough?

They can t even tell the difference between a shimmer and a glitter. Question: how to you make a mind blowing silk screen for a t-shirt? Question: Is Westbrook and Harden a smaller version of LeBron? I say this because all 3 are triple double machines.RW plays with aggression and force and athleticism. He will get points by driving to the rim without any remorse. His teamates do help with the rebounds. His assists sometimes I see are forced because he is not a great passer in my opinion.JH plays with pace. The Rockets are a 3 point shooting team so Harden has it easy on him with a bunch of shooters. He draws up many defenders and gets the open man. He scores the ball by getting to the free throw line, or being a deadly jump shooter. His rebounding numbers are also because of the amount of 3's his team takes. It is easier to position/predict where the ball is going if a lot of your shots are 3's. He is also good on the pick and roll.LJ is a locomotive, and when he gets to the rim no one can really stop him. He isn't much of a shooter, but he is strong and can post you up. He plays the Forward position, so he is in the paint fighting for rebounds. His high assist numbers are because of 3 point shooting. Similar to Harden. Also because he has Kyrie. Question: Found maggots on kitchen floor this morning. Don't know the source? For the past couple weeks there have been more flies than usual in my house. I try to kill as many as I can but that's only so efficient. I didn't put much thought into why there were flies inside. It's summer and I live in a very hot humid area so it's normal to see the occasional fly. Other than the occasional nuisance I brushed it off. Until this morning I come out into the kitchen to find the floor covered in them. I swept them up took out the trash and recycling bins and checked the fridge and cupords for rotting food. I keep my house clean and don't leave old food out so I'm baffled as to what has cuased this. Can flies lay eggs on surface? I had assumed it needed organic material to lay eggs? Can they lay eggs in the bodies of other dead flies? I can't find the source of the maggots problem and I had assumed the flies we're coming in from the outside. Has anyone else dealt with this problem? Question: Scottish football... Can you please forgive me if I start being nasty wi a few of you? I'm mainly referring to all you soap dodgers.

This was my FIRST year in track and I m 13 years old so my times might not be too good. For 200m my best was 27.4sec and for 100m my best is 12.9sec. I personally think I have all the speed necessary to get better but I need to perfect my form for both 100 and 200. I qualified for the meet of champions for both 100 and 200 and I was the anchor for the relay team. So what do you think about my times? How should I improve?

The same with Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. They aren't young or cute secretly but older women who steal people's youth including mine. Those Americans, Asians, and Africans are ugly as hell. I've seen their face without all make up, Photoshop, and plastic surgery. The same thing with Maame Efua, Britney Spears, Jaleesa, Kelly Rowland, Bao Minh Dang, Mao Inoue, Kiara, Ciara Harris, Emily, Selena Gomez, Laurie Martinez, Yareli Albavera, Smith, and Katy Perry. They don't like themselves the way God made them. They aren't attractive. All plastic dolls. Question: What job could possibly better than modeling?

My boyfriend decided to buy a husky against my advice. I have NEVER had this much trouble training a dog in my life! She is 7 months old and stubborn. She terrorizes cats (based on my research, this is normal lol), she chews on anything she can get a hold of, even the coffee table, and she can t catch on to potty training. Considering she is 7 months old and the breeder said she is potty trained and has never had this problem, I am very disappointed. I was already angry that he bought the dog, but was happy to accept the challenge of training her because my boyfriend works all of the time and doesn t have the time for her. I need advice on what to do. I know they are very intelligent and I feel like this dog has potential, but I need something to get her going I guess. I have tried everything. I researched huskies, I tried positive rewards for positive behavior, but she is a little terror running around the house! She won t listen AT ALL. I have 2 other dogs and they do just fine. I have trained many other dogs for people. This dog, however, has me stumped with her stubborn and sassy personality.

Celtic's position on this issue has been consistent - that this has always been a matter for the courts of law and also the Scottish football authorities, whose rules are intended to uphold sporting integrity.\"In 2013, we expressed surprise - shared by many observers and supporters of the game - over the findings of the SPL Commission that no competitive or sporting advantage had resulted. Today\u00e2\u20acs decision only re-affirms that view.\"We are sure now that the footballing authorities in Scotland will wish to review this matter. Celtic awaits the outcome of their review.\"if using 50million of taxpayers money to fund the purchase of players isnt gaining an unfair advantage over other clubs i dont know what isthoughts sfs?

Manny is my favorite fighter of all time, I think he got robbed, and Horn was really dirty he used his head and elbows to hurt Manny. Manny was bleeding and he looked really tired and slow, do you think he should have a rematch and then retire ? or do you think in case he wins he should continue ?

Question: Is it ok to take out a cartilage piercing in the first week if you want it to close? I just got a cartilage piercing two days ago on my left ear and now I regret the decision. It is sore and I can t sleep well since I am used to generally sleeping on my left side most of the time. I want to take it out and close up the piercing, but I have a couple of questions.1.Will it get infected or anything if I take it out this early in the process?2. Will I still have to clean it regularly with sea salt soaks?3. Will it still be sore and how long after taking it out until I can sleep on my left side again? Question: GPS Soleus review? I tested my 2 mile time using the Runtastic app and lowered it by over 1 minute. I'm not sure how accurate the distance tracking on it is considering I ran under a lot of trees. I was considering getting the soleus GPS fly running watch and was wondering how accurate it is distance wise. I have to run under trees because it is Florida and it is too hot not too. Also I am not willing to spend 200 dollars on a watch so I figured this is the best choice. Question: Rose gold hair color?

Question: Do Gothic women only take compliments if they're coming from Gothic men? I notice there are lots of jocks who say they love Gothic women. Most of these men workout, wear simple white t-shirts, and probably play sports. Yet I've heard equally from Gothic women who ridicule and scorn these jocks in return. But then, if one of these jocks becomes a Goth himself, or if a guy who is already Goth talks about how he loves Gothic , then they love him back and rave about how sexy Gothic men are. Is this just a factor of like attracting like? Question: Did you watch either of the NJPW G1 Special in USA events, daddy? If so what did you thihnk, daddy?I got to watch night 1 and to me it just came across as an ROH show dressed up as NJPW from the liggting to the set to the crowd, daddy. And there wasn t a lot of NJPW s \"strong style\" on display, daddy. I did like the last three matches a lot, daddy, and liked a lot of the names on the card but this didn t really get to me like the usual NJPW show, daddy. I am a huge NJPW fan, daddy, and it s because of the presentation and NJPW crowds, daddy. Matches and crowd on that show just fell short of my NJPW expectation, daddy. Question: Where to start with a pet therapy program for kids reading to dogs.? I wanted to start a small group with therapy animals for kids to help with their reading, where they sit and read to dogs which makes them more comfortable than when they try to read to a class, friends or adults.

My agency haven't noticed but I'm nervous that when I go to castings for swimsuit/lingerie the casting directors will notice and will nit cast me. Does anyone know if stretch marks are cared about in the industry or whether they're ignored and unimportant. I know most photos get retouched anyway but maybe some casting directors will refrain from using girls with scars anyway.

I'm very lucky at that 24 I have no kids, a college degree, and currently work a job that pays me 50k a year.I've been trying to move out of my mother's house but my issue is finding a house to rent that will allow me to have a rottweiler as a pet. I want one mainly for protection because I'm looking to move into a house that has at least 3 bedrooms (I'm moving into a house not only for my dog to have room to run around but also so should something happen in the future, like unplanned pregnancy, I never have to worry about moving again)I can afford to pay $1200 a month for a house, but my issue is no place I've looked at will let me keep a Rottweiler. I wanted to get one as a puppy so he'll be trained early on not to bark or bite, but no place will even consider it in NC and I don't feel safe living alone without a dog. How do I work around people not accepting rottweilers? I would think being able to pay three months out would have been enough to let me have it. Question: What's wrong with my dogs eye? She can barely keep it open. It's been like this for 2 days. Question: How can I control my fire ant problem? I have an unusual situation concerning fire ants. So myself and my husband have walked every single inch of our property and outside the property and there's not a single fire ant mound or fire ants running around however, there's hundreds in my kitchen.

Question: Football ~ Who do you think threw the tightest spiral? I consider Aaron Rodgers the most talented Quarterback of all time as far as throwing ability and his skillset, I think it's unanimous that Dan Marino is the greatest dropback passer Sonny Jurgensen would be in that conversation as well. I wouldn't put Peyton Manning in this debate, there's no denying his productivity and football savvy but he threw ducks and even his mechanics were ugly. I've saw Warren Moon be mentioned for throwing the tightest spiral several times, you'll always see Jeff George brought up in these best throwers debates but who do you think throws the best spiral ? Honestly Tom Brady throws a pretty ball, he has textbook mechanics just watching him drive downfield is a beauty to watch Question: Are MLB tickets on stubhub legit?

I couldn't find a night gown that is longer than my knees in primark when I went a few weeks ago, when I looked at the shorts and top section, everything is short and doesn't go almost or pass the knees. I don't wanna wear something too long as it's hot here in UK now, too much heat indoors and I don't use the fan a lot as I'm trying to save money on electricity.

It's been like this for a while, but I never felt like asking about it since I don't wear the watch often. So, what is it? And how do I get rid of it?

I recently moved to Europe and had to leave my dog at home because I could not afford transportation fees for him. Now- a year later I realize that I am desperately sad with out my loving dog.I've heard of many things about Military families getting based in Europe and that they are able to ship their animals for as low as $110 as apposed to upwards of $1300 for regular citizens. (I absolutely understand that the pricing would be different and I think that it's wonderful that our service members don't have to part ways with their animals in the case of PCS)I guess my question is do you think it's morally wrong to ask a military family to say that they are the owners of my dog in order to get him here for a cheaper price (I would absolutely compensate the family for their trouble)? How would I get in contact with a family who I could potentially ask to do this for me? Question: What do I wear on my first date? This guy invited me for dinner at a nice bistro. Should I wear a dress or jeans and a top? Question: Will this make my hair any healthier? If I get a trim and then quit applying heat to my hair, will my hair be healthier?

I want to have to box for money, the Amateurs to proffessional. I got great potential in this sport as to what the coaches I've trained with. Thank you for your time Question: Why call \"AA. & Co.\" and not just call \"AA. Co\"? why need to add \"&\"? Question: How do I do these things quickly? Within a week I need my teeth to shine like fricking diamonds and I need to lose loads of weight and I need to figure out a new hairstyle oh and how do I remove the hair dye from my hair? It was supposed to be purple but it is red and I don't like it I need my natural colour back!! But yeah I need to know how to make my skin look really good too and get rid if spots and freckles and stuff. I'm doing something really important in a week and I need to look perfect. "}
