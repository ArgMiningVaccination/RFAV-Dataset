Little did I know how extensively we as individuals and as a collegiate community were going to have to re-think our teaching, learning and socialising during 2019-2020. A new lexicon has grown up around us, one that has changed the ways in which we describe and manage our lives. A word as previously light-hearted as \"bubble\", for example, has transmuted from something that is blown with children on a sunny afternoon in the garden to a powerful mechanism of social organisation and state control of a kind previously unknown in our times. Such has been the impact of the pandemic on English that the Oxford Languages team has, for the first time, chosen a list of \"Words of an Unprecedented Year\" rather than just one.1 Technical terms from medicine and public health have been rapidly accepted into common parlance, and the new, context-specific meanings of words such as \"mute\" and \"social distancing\" will be forever connected with 2020. As the Oxford Languages report observes, one of the strangest aspects to the pandemic has been the need to make explicit in words assumptions that were previously inherent, the most poignant example being \"in- person\". This is a change that has resonated strongly and painfully in educational settings such as ours that were designed around the principles of an emphatically \"in-person\" collegiate life, as explored in Renaissance College, one of the Corpus books published this year, which is edited by John Watts and reviewed here by his predecessor as Fellow in History, Thomas Charles- Edwards. 1 See https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2020/.This \"syncopated\" academic year, as our former MCR President aptly describes it (p.134), began straightforwardly enough. We welcomed new colleagues: Professor Marion Durand as Fellow in Ancient Philosophy, and as JRFs Dr. Yusen Yu (the first holder of the James Legge Memorial JRF in Comparative Aesthetics and Art History), Dr. Dr M\u00e9adbh Brosnan (Cullen JRF). Dr. Bernardo Ballesteros joined us as Research Fellow in Classics. It was a pleasure to have the company of our Visiting Fellows (the Hon. Justice Brian Preston and Professor Elzbieta Witkowska-Zaremba) along with that of our Visiting Scholars (Dr. Colin King, Dr. Amelia Worsley and Professor Sidney Shapiro). Katherine Baysan joined the College as Outreach and Admissions Officer in December 2019, and our outreach work was further enhanced by the arrival of Laura Jackson during the summer of 2020 in the new role of Assistant Outreach Officer. Other new members of staff were Mandi Sutton (Head Housekeeper), George Danescu (Kitchen Assistant), Fidelia DaConceiao and Azzizat Abolade (Scouts) and Chris Ede (Yardman). Significant Corpus anniversaries were also celebrated for two valued members of the College community: David Leake, College Gardener, completed 40 years at Corpus, and Rachel Clifford, Academic Registrar, passed the 25-year milestone. Amongst our departures and retirements were some longstanding members of the College community. The Development Office saw the near-simultaneous retirements of Nick Thorn and Sarah Salter, after nineteen and ten years of service respectively. Nick was the first ever Development Director at Corpus: he read history here (1988), and returned to the College in 2001; Sarah joined in 2010 as Head of Alumni Relations. Between them they have built up and sustained a warm and close-knit community of Corpus alumni and they will be much missed. We also bade farewell to Carole Rayner (Accounts Assistant), after 18 years at the College. Suzie Jackson (Outreach and Admissions Officer) also moved to pastures new this year; to all of them we extend our grateful thanks and best wishes for the future. Amongst the Fellows, we said goodbye to Professor Nikolaos Papazarkadas, Fellow in Ancient History, who returned to the US, to Dr. Nigel Bowles and to Dr. Anna Marmodoro. Nigel joined Corpus in 2011 as Director of the Rothermere Institute and from 2015 was a Senior Research Fellow. He was a generous and involved member of Governing Body, sitting on Investment Committee and latterly serving as Keeper of the Cellar. The wine-tastings he organised together with Anna Marmodoro, Master of Common Room, were much enjoyed and appreciated by all. Anna is another of our 2020 leavers who will be much missed in the SCR, where she was always an energetic and welcoming host as Master. Anna has been a familiar face in Corpus since 2007 as a JRF , Official Fellow and most recently Research Fellow; she holds the Chair in Metaphysics at Durham University and will we hope remain in close touch with the life of the Corpus SCR. Former President Sir Steven Cowley and Professor Jonathan Glover were elected to Honorary Fellowships, Mr. William Morris was elected to a Claymond Fellowship in recognition of his long service to the Corpus Association, and Professor Richard Cornall was elected to an Emeritus Fellowship. We were greatly saddened by news of the deaths of Honorary Fellows Eldred Jones and Arthur Scace, Emeritus Fellow Professor Jim Griffin and Foundation Fellow 6 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 7 Corpus Christi College Gordon Aldrick. We congratulate former President Sir Keith Thomas on being appointed Companion of Honour for services to the study of history in the New Year Honours List 2020, and Paul Ramsbottom (1994), who was awarded an OBE for services to charity. There was much rejoicing at the news that Professor Pete Nellist, Fellow in Materials, has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Michaelmas and Hilary terms saw Corpus host a number of memorable and highly topical events. In November, Professor Jonathan Prag (1994, now of Merton College) reflected on the digital humanities at the Scholars' Dinner, and Hassan Damluji (2001) of the Gates Foundation spoke on globalism and nationalism at the President's Seminar. Rowena Chiu (1993) made a welcome return to Corpus to meet members of the JCR and MCR, accompanied by Jodi Kantor and Megan T wohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein story, who were speaking at the Oxford Union about their book She Said. In January, we were delighted to host the premiere of a film by Johnny Lyons, Discovering Isaiah Berlin, which was followed by a roundtable discussion of Berlin's continuing legacy. The Bateson Lecture was given by Professor Mark Ford (UCL), under the title \"Woman Much Missed: Thomas Hardy, Emma Hardy and Poetry\". It was, as ever, a pleasure to host the triennial Lowe Lectures, given this year by Corpus Fellow Professor Judith Olszowy-Schlanger on the subject of \"The Hebrew- Latin Manuscripts of the Library of Corpus Christi College\". In what now seems the social calm before the pandemic storm, an alumni drinks event in Birmingham in October provided the opportunity to refresh or establish anew many welcome connections, and the London Christmas Drinks hosted by Andrew Thornhill at the Oxford and Cambridge Club as usual provided a very convivial evening. Our plans for T rinity Term were sadly truncated by the announcement of the national lockdown on 23 March 2020. Overnight, all aspects of College life changed significantly, and throughout T rinity the central site felt eerily deserted and unnaturally quiet - perhaps the quietest it has been for hundreds of years. At the same time, however, 23 March triggered a digital revolution for the whole University that has fundamentally changed the way we do things: lectures, tutorials, meetings and examinations - as well as all human contact - moved online. The Preliminary examinations that should have been sat in T rinity Term were cancelled and most second and third year (non-Finals) exams were postponed to Michaelmas Term. Finals were sat as \"open book\" exams, and despite the fact that students had only a very short time to practise and prepare for this new type of examination they performed very well; we maintained a strong performance in the Final Honour Schools with almost half of finalists achieving a First. Several students were top-ranked or within the top 10% of students in the University. Notable subject achievements were in Law, which again achieved two distinctions in Mods (including the highest-ranked candidate), English (four Firsts of six in Finals), PPE (four Firsts of seven), Materials (five Firsts of six in Part II) and Physics (four Firsts of six in Part II). University prizes were awarded to students in Classics, Experimental Psychology, Law, Medicine, Materials and English.Across the whole College, there was a tangible determination not to let the pandemic diminish our core purposes of teaching and research, and with the generous support of Old Members we put in place a Remote Working Fund to aid our students in the purchase of essentials for home- based online study, such as desks and noise-cancelling headphones. The first ever virtual Open Days were held, and the new pilot collaboration with the University of Derby (Derby Scholars) proceeded remotely, as did the North West Science Network Summer School. Our recent trend of admitting a higher than University average of state school students continued, and we still have the second highest share amongst Oxford colleges of students from postcodes indicating areas of low progression to university. The first ever Opportunity Oxford offers (for candidates from disadvantaged or under-represented backgrounds who might not otherwise have received an offer) were made across the University; at Corpus we look forward to welcoming four Opportunity Oxford students in October. Although the pandemic and its associated financial tribulations restricted our on-site renovation activities to the refurbishment of student accommodation at Kybald T wychen, digitally the public face of the College received a complete overhaul with the launch of our new website. This year-long project, the fruit of collaboration between the JCR, MCR, Governing Body and College staff, was ready just in time for our pivot into an online existence. The next stage of our digital strategy is the creation of a College intranet, of which phase one has been completed and phase two (which will move a number of our internal processes online) is under way. Corpus's traditional emphasis on practising collaboration and nurturing community was evident in the response to the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020. A joint anti-racism statement on behalf of the JCR, MCR and Governing Body was published, and \"A Corpus Conversation on Racism\" was launched for members of the College as a means of practising concerted and collective listening and thinking on a whole range of issues from academic curricula, to career progression, to health inequalities. During a year characterised by fractious political debate in the UK and US in particular, the empathy, thoughtfulness and positivity of all the Corpus colleagues and students who participated in these conversations stood out; they have truly exemplified the values of equality and collegiality to which we aspire. Several articles in this Pelican Record make reference to what many generations of students and Fellows have remarked as the intimacy and quiet modesty of Corpus and its role in the development of their personality; the philosopher Isaiah Berlin observed that \"Corpus shaped me in the sense that my total happiness as a member of it gave me a sense of security which I might not otherwise have possessed\" (p.16). The surgeon Dudley William Carmalt Jones similarly described his time at Corpus as \"in friendship, in affairs and in human contacts ... the opening up of a new world\" (p.29). It is right in this strangest of years to acknowledge and indeed to mourn the closing down of so much that we love, and the losses that many have experienced. Nevertheless, the fundamental character of student life as an opening up of the self to a new world thankfully persists. The busy undergraduate life of Carmalt Jones in the 1890s, as described by Harriet Patrick (pp.23-29), is echoed still in our clubs and societies reports for 2019-2020. This is 8 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College despite the presence of what previous ages might have remarked with awe, while practising their own version of \"doom-scrolling\" (another word of the year), as the quasi-Biblical conjunction of floods and contagion. Although record numbers of freshers signed up, rowing was a notable casualty of the weather, as you will see from what must be the shortest CCCBC report in many years, and rugby was not far behind. But we can be hopeful that both these sports will resume undaunted with their customary good spirits at some point later in 2021, and at least it means that I can repeat the claim first uttered a year ago, that the Men's First VIII is still sitting in the highest position in Torpids and Eights since the 1980s. The golfers managed to make the best of things by honing their skill at skimming balls over water at the Oxford Golf Centre, and Sasha Webb (inaugural winner of the Russell Crockford T rophy) valiantly kept the JCR moving with her Zoom circuits during T rinity Term. And the undaunted JCR spirit allied with a heroic coach driver rescued the Corpus Challenge from being blown completely off course by the gales that pummelled the Fens in February. The Corpus Choir was the breakout success of lockdown, uniting the scattered Corpus community far and wide, and our thanks go to all those who pioneered the Chapel's podcast services. It is appropriate, therefore, to close this report by paying tribute to the buoyancy, resilience and optimism of our collegiate body. In amongst the Fellows' notes on books published, conferences deferred and half-finished papers dug out from drawers to complete during the spring closures, you will find numerous references to the commitment and calm resourcefulness of Corpus undergraduates during the pandemic. Our graduate students, many of them in Oxford for only one year, contended with rapidly changed circumstances and in many cases the sudden cessation of their laboratory work - but throughout it all they have demonstrated levels of adaptability and imagination that will doubtless serve them in very good stead throughout their future lives. The finalists of 2020, in particular, have been much in our thoughts: they provided an outstanding example of how to make the best of things and practise generosity of spirit whilst coping with profound disappointment and disruption. Challenging times like these shine a light on leaders and their qualities, and we have been very fortunate in our student representatives this year: it has been a pleasure to work with Rhiannon Ogden-Jones, Ed Hart and Matt Carlton in the JCR, and Chris Dowson and Faseeha Ayaz in the MCR, along with all those who have contributed to the life of the College as committee members, officers, club captains, telethon callers and subject ambassadors, amongst many other roles. As Peter McCullough noted in his sermon for the Commemoration of Benefactors back in February 2020, living \"accountably\" alongside others, paying attention to them, is the essence of collegiate life: it has been a very different, and unexpected, kind of living alongside others this year, but we are mindful nonetheless of all the many opportunities for humanity and attentiveness that it has provided to Corpus and its community. Helen MooreAs an undergraduate, the celebrated thinker Isaiah Berlin found Corpus \"a place of tolerance and intellectual soundness\". Fellow Corpuscle Henry Hardy, principal editor of Berlin's works and one of his literary trustees, recounts episodes from his Corpus career, finding connections with his vision of life. I Famous Corpus alumni are a rare species. This is not only because Corpus is the smallest Oxford college, but also because of a certain quiet privacy in its culture. Oxonian graduates who glitter in public life tend to emerge from other stables. At the time of writing, Wikipedia, admittedly overlooking other obvious candidates, lists only six former undergraduates as \"notable\": General James Oglethorpe (founder of the State of Georgia), the palaeontologist and theologian William Buckland, the poet and divine John Keble (in whose memory the eponymous Oxford college was founded), both Miliband brothers - and Isaiah Berlin. Berlin was a Russian Jew, the son of a timber merchant. He was born in Riga in 1909, and spent his early years there and in Petrograd, emigrating to England with his parents in 1921 at the age of eleven. After St Paul's School in London, he came up to Corpus in 1928 on a scholarship to read \"Modern Subjects\" - classical Mods and modern history. He had previously been turned down by Balliol twice, once as a scholar and once as a commoner. The world owes Balliol a debt of gratitude: as Berlin said, \"If I'd gone to Balliol, I have no doubt that I might have emerged quite different.\" Berlin photographed in the last year of his life by Mats Lund The Pelican Record 2020 11 Corpus Christi College Isaiah Berlin, Corpuscle Henry Hardy His Latin and Greek were not too good, and after an intervention from the ancient historian G.B. Grundy, editor of the (to me) invaluable Murray's Classical Atlas, and according to Berlin \"a rather militarised figure of rather severe mien\", he took Pass Mods (Latin, Greek, Greek Literature, Logic) and \"Scripture\" (which for Jews in 1928 meant Plato's Apology and Meno) in one term rather than Honour Mods in five. He then abandoned modern history and embarked on Greats in January 1929, a term before the 1927 cohort. It may have been in his first term that he wrote his only known poem, a spoof modernist squib which survives among his papers, and which he annotated in 1951 in these terms: \"Written in 1928 by the author aged 19. Intended for 'transition' to see if they were as bogus as they seemed to be.\" The magazine Transition, which began life in Paris in 1927, styled itself without an initial capital. In the summer of 1928 a subtitle was added, in capitals: \" an international quarterly for creative experiment \". The contents included poems in the style Berlin parodies. History does not relate whether he actually submitted the poem, but it does not appear in the magazine. One piece of background information helps to understand Berlin's subtitle. \"Mr Un rien\", Heine tells us in his memoirs, was one of the distortions of his name employed by his French contemporaries - because \"the French change everything in the world to suit themselves\". Here is Berlin's interesting juvenile work, which opens with a sentence in prose, and has stimulated no fewer than five pages of straight-faced analysis in Arie M. Dubnov's biography of its author: M. Henri Heine (Un rien, vous \u00eates Monsieur un rien!) When the enemy wynds and the big lewis guns will have blasted the last snigger off the face of the last spengling, declining, tarred mannikin, then only aristotles will be left alive on the face of our planet. Eons on eons climb sliming into pain I nature's natural with midriff salted hugely (Will the Plumber's plumber never down and rain?) my bowels tear in aquinatic strife (they strove, with none, midwived by jealous life) White cressed with black; the prickly pear hangs dead dead and dumb unpregnant acataractic, agony pillars are deepstuck desertislanded in mine own Flux, my little crumb what struck thee then Space smacked me, sir, time cracked me then So we lie in sliming flux, warm slime your soft mother flux that's dead before and after I groaning hotly groaning grating in sour untransfigurating ferment to no end groaning unskinned with Herakleit and rend and rend ... Dubnov understandably misses what may well be a reference to the \"Plummer\", as the basement facilities in the Emily Thomas Building used to be called (possibly if obscurely after the Revd Charles Plummer, Fellow 1873-1927, or perhaps after all the plumbing there). Berlin spent his first year in Room 5 in the Annexe (now called the Jackson Building), his second and third years on Staircase 12, in Room 1R (now part of the SCR dining room): we have a photograph of him at work in his study there (the room opposite was occupied by Kenneth Robinson, a future headmaster of Bradford Grammar School, and had two bedrooms, one of which was Berlin's). For his last year he was in private digs at 46 Wellington Square. Despite Grundy, and thanks to his \"gentle\" but \"firm\" philosophy tutor (later President of Corpus) Frank Hardie, Berlin developed into a philosopher rather than an ancient historian. He always said that it was Hardie who had instilled in him one of his central values, that of absolute clarity: \"everything one wrote or said turned out to be superficial, vague, false, crude\". I myself bumped into Hardie in Corpus Library after his retirement and had a brief exchange during which I delivered myself of the careless opinion that the mind and the brain were the same. \"The same what?\" asked Hardie. Collapse of self. Telegram from Berlin's parents congratulating him on his Corpus scholarship 12 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 13 Corpus Christi College Berlin took a First in Greats (a \"bad First\", he called it), then switched to PPE (which the conservative College regarded with horror and tried to block) for his fourth and final year, taking a First in that too - a good First, with a merely formal viva - as well as winning, jointly with Sidney Budden of Merton, the University's John Locke Prize in philosophy. He had a bad arm (a birth defect) and so didn't row or play other sports. The captain of hockey, Eric T ucker, records trying to recruit him, \"but he refused my invitation in a most charming manner, promising riparian support\". In lieu of sport Berlin (co-)edited the Oxford Outlook, a highbrow University periodical, for two years, contributing music reviews as \"Albert Alfred Apricott\", and other items under his own name. He boldly sent a copy of the journal to T.S. Eliot in 1930; Eliot read it and replied amicably, offering \"an exchange of the Criterion\". In College in the same year he was President of the Pelican Essay Club and of another alleged essay-reading society, the short- lived Emily Thomas Club (named after a fabulously munificent College benefactor, heiress of a sewing-machine magnate). The only recorded meeting of the latter entity heard a paper on \"Morphology\" from the Canadian Rhodes Scholar M. St A. Woodside, \"with unexpected results\". Perhaps it was all just an elaborate joke. In the then entirely masculine, somewhat hermetic society of a men's college, these now vanished after-dinner discussion groups were an important filler of undergraduates' leisure hours. Berlin also performed for a third essay club, the Sundial Society, reading a dialogue on \"Life\" with his contemporary T.F . Lindsay, later a journalist on the T elegraph, in 1929. What one would give for a sight of that text! Robert (\"Robin\") Band, a historian who had come up a year later, remembers another meeting of the same club: \"My deepest impression of Corpus was at a meeting of the Sundial Society. The speaker seemed good enough, and I could see little fault. Isaiah Berlin was asked to reply, and was so brilliant that by the end my impression of the lecture was completely demolished. Nothing was left.\" This event is not identifiable in The Pelican Record. Berlin spoke engagingly of his time at Corpus in his contribution to Brian Harrison's Corpuscles, reprinted in the third edition of Berlin's Personal Impressions, and drawn on here: readers of The Pelican Record, which Berlin co-edited for three years, are strongly recommended to look up that characteristically unboastful account, not least for its diverting anecdotes, more of which are to be found in Flourishing, the first volume of his letters. They might also look up Berlin's own contributions to the Record, especially \"Oglethorpe University, Ga\", a wickedly tongue-in-cheek 1931 piece on what he saw as an \"entirely bogus\" university named after the aforementioned eighteenth-century gentleman commoner Corpuscle, James Oglethorpe. Berlin, wishing to spice up the Record, wrote to the University and used the President's reply mercilessly, later recalling: \"The Professor of Italian was also the Professor of Fencing; the Professor of French was the Professor of Forecasting\"; it was \"the 14 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 15 Corpus Christi College The first floor of Staircase 12 in Berlin's time there (1929-1931) Berlin in his study on Staircase 12lowest grade of university I ever came across. He was certainly an old crook, the President, that was obvious.\" A portrait of Oglethorpe was sent, and still hangs in the SCR. The architecture of the Lowry Hall on the Oglethorpe campus is visibly modelled on Corpus. In Corpuscles Berlin writes about the inward-looking quietness of Corpus at which I hinted at the outset: \"Corpus was a college where quest for prominence outside the College was slightly mal vu. For example, speaking at the Union was not well received. Getting a blue was not too good. If you wished to shine, you should do so in College, not outside.\" He also pays tribute to Corpus as a formative influence on his personality: \"I feel a deep loyalty to Corpus. Corpus shaped me in the sense that my total happiness as a member of it gave me a sense of security which I might not otherwise have possessed.\" Perhaps this security is evidenced by an episode that occurred when Louis MacNeice (who read Classics at Merton) brought some tourists to Oxford. He knew the Corpuscle John Hilton, two years senior to Berlin, and Berlin reports that MacNeice told him [Hilton] that he was going to bring them, and they really rather liked ceremonies, and if he could bring them at some time when there was some ceremony going, that would impress them. Some of them were quite rich - might even give some money to Oxford or London. And Hilton and I and one or two others then invented a ceremony. We wore gowns and mortar-boards, and we stood round the Pelican, and we threw a silver jug at each other and bowed every time we received one, and then threw it to the next man, and we did it forty-four times round the Pelican; then we bowed, and we shook hands very formally, and left as a procession. It was an invented ceremony for the benefit of the tourists, who goggled very satisfactorily. The President, P .S. Allen, observed in a reference that Berlin's \"rooms were a place of resort\". In that regard he was set for life. In the wider University, Berlin encountered the \"hearties\" and the \"aesthetes\" who occupied opposite extremes of Oxford undergraduate society at the time. He remembered his first meeting with an aesthete: \"He said his name was Fran\u00e7ois Capel. His name was Frank Curtis, and his father was a colonel in the Guards. I said to him, 'What college are you at?' He said, 'My dear, I simply can't remember.' \" Berlin remembered, too, a clash between the two groups in Corpus: One of my neighbours was the late Bernard Spencer, a gifted poet whose verse can still be found in more than one anthology. He was certainly an uncompromising aesthete, a friend and disciple of Louis MacNeice. One morning a neighbour woke me in my bedroom in the Corpus Annexe and said that something unusual was happening which might be worth seeing. I saw about six or seven Corpus undergraduates howling in Magpie Lane; led by a very tough man [C.E. Welby-Everard], later a Major General, they burst into Spencer's Lowry Hall, Oglethorpe University, Atlanta, Georgia (right), is visibly modelled on Corpus 16 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 17 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Essay Club in 1931: W.F .R. Hardie extreme right, back row; K.D. Robinson 3rd from right, middle row; G.B. Grundy front left, with spats; Berlin two to the right of Grundy bedroom - he was asleep - and fell upon him and cut off one of his long whiskers (a typical mark of an aesthete in those days), beat him up and threw his books out of the window. It was a horrible sight, like a lynching bee. Spencer uttered not a sound, and bravely did not cut off the other whisker, but let the original one grow again. No disciplinary steps were taken. He no doubt recalled another lynching bee, the one he saw in the February Revolution in Petrograd in 1917, dragging off a tsarist policeman to his grisly fate. This was the sight that inoculated him against violence, especially politically inspired violence, for life. After Corpus, Berlin embarked on the stellar career as an Oxford academic and (during the war) British public servant that explains his inclusion in the Wikipedia hall of fame. In 1932 he was appointed by Richard Crossman to teach philosophy at New College, and soon afterwards became the first Jew to be elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls, where he wrote his only real book, his 1939 biography of Karl Marx, still in print today. In the war he drafted weekly political despatches from Washington for the British Ambassador to send to London, keeping their recipients, including Winston Churchill, abreast of the mood in America, which of course changed radically after Pearl Harbor in December 1941. After the war he continued to teach at New College, and in 1950 rejoined All Souls as a research fellow. There he wrote prolifically, including many of his celebrated essays on Russian thinkers. He became Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory in 1957, founding President of Wolfson in 1966, and President of the British Academy in 1974. He was knighted in 1957 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1971, the coping stone of his Establishment success. He died in 1997. When I was at Corpus myself, in the late 1960s (Hardie was still President for my first two years), I knew nothing of Berlin, but I discovered him in 1972 when I applied to Wolfson to do graduate work in philosophy. At Corpus in 1965 I had been interviewed by the largely silent Hardie and the voluble senior tutor Michael Brock; at Wolfson I was interviewed by Berlin and - Michael Brock, Vice-President and Bursar, who had left Corpus to manage Berlin's new enterprise before I came up in 1967, after a gap year in Lesotho. To start with I didn't know that Berlin too was a Corpuscle, but I soon found out, and took pleasure in our (and Brock's) shared heritage. In another place I have told the story of how I undertook to collect and edit Berlin's voluminous writings, many of which were little known, having been published obscurely, if at all. This turned out to be a lifetime's task, but no editor could ask for a richer or more satisfying seam to work, and getting to know Berlin personally was a superb bonus. In the course of my editorial activities I have naturally also got to know something about Berlin's ideas. They are impossible to summarise, for reasons that will quickly become apparent to anyone who reads them. But I have been asked to attempt the impossible.II Berlin's professional field was first philosophy, then the history of ideas, though the two phases should be seen as continuous parts of a single intellectual journey. He was also a public intellectual and moralist, well known for his appearances on radio and television. Most of his academic work took the form of essays and lectures, now collected in a series of sixteen volumes, afforced by four volumes of scintillating letters. He also wrote brilliantly about his contemporaries, about politics, about music, about literature and more besides. He enjoyed an exceptional reputation both as a talker and as a connoisseur of human beings and their idiosyncrasies. His rich sense of comedy and his lightness of touch, which infused his conversation and sent him off, irrepressibly, on great digressive, often hilarious, flights of fancy, are belied by the seriousness and depth of much of his published work. Humanity was his constant theme. He was a wise and eloquent interpreter of human nature, and an exemplar of humanity in one of its best forms. He was excited by ideas, and made them exciting for others, defining an intellectual as someone who wants ideas to be as interesting as possible. He wrote in lucid, untechnical English. His accessible and revealing way of discussing the deepest, most general human issues, which are (or should be) of concern to us all, makes him a powerfully attractive figure in the intellectual landscape. He insisted, above all, on the central role in human life of individual freedom of choice, and of the political freedom that depends upon it. This is the wellspring of his kind of liberalism, now alas on the defensive. He also celebrated the inescapable, but glorious, multiplicity of persons, goals, values and cultures. In every sphere he was an enthusiast for openness, variety and complexity, and an opponent of oppression and oversimplification, especially in its managerial, authoritarian guises. In particular, he maintained that the attempt to reduce all our goals to one common denominator, all values to one super-value such as happiness or usefulness, and the related claim that everyone should participate, even be forced to participate, in a single worldwide form of life that answers all moral questions uniquely, with coherent certainty, are radically mistaken, and lead to vice and disaster. This tendency he called \"monism\", and set against it \"pluralism\", in many disciplines and walks of life. These are dull labels for a vitally important distinction. Monism is far from a spent force, and never will be spent. It is a built-in tendency in human beings, and lends support to the political totalitarianism still flourishing in large parts of the globe, as well as the theocratic despotism also only too familiar to us today. It needs to be continuously challenged, intellectually and otherwise, and Berlin's work is an armoury for challengers to draw on. His ideas are increasingly relevant and urgent in our own time, with its growing globalisation and migration. Far from being homogenising forces, these phenomena uncover and exacerbate the ethical differences 18 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 19 Corpus Christi College that divide humanity, bringing to centre stage just those issues of multiculturalism and mutual cultural tolerance (or intolerance) that Berlin illuminated. But Berlin also argued that the differences between us should not be exaggerated, lest we end up with nothing to bind us together, no shared values against which to measure and reject extremism and fanaticism, especially the mindless cruelty and terror that flow from them. There is indeed such a thing as human nature, and one of its deepest properties is fear of pain. \"The first public obligation\", he wrote, \"is to avoid extremes of suffering.\" Positive goals, crucial as they are, can come later. This is the route to the defence of basic human rights, which belong to humankind as a whole, not just to particular cultures that happen to espouse them. If China, say, defends breaches of human rights by saying that in their culture they do things differently, their defence fails. Culture is not an alibi for evil. Human behaviour, individual and collective, is to be judged at the bar of our common humanity. 20 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 21 Corpus Christi College The fissure between monists and pluralists is deep at all levels of life. Monist individuals can be self-righteous and bigoted. They know the truth and look down on those who don't. Monist groups can succumb to demagoguery and groupthink, especially when aided and abetted by the malign tendency of social media to reinforce prejudice. Coercive conformism stifles freedom of thought and expression. Single-issue fanaticism bedevils politics. Monistically minded nations become aggressively nationalistic. In Berlin's words: Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups (or tribes or states or nations or Churches) that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth: especially about how to live, what to be and do - and that those who differ from them are not merely mistaken, but wicked or mad: and need restraining or suppressing. This is the briefest snapshot of a small corner of Berlin's oeuvre, but it is at the core of his vision of life. III Berlin had an after-dinner turn, used at the dinner held in Corpus Hall for his eightieth birthday, in which he compared the Oxford colleges to the countries of the world. Christ Church was France (especially Paris); New College - England; Balliol - the USA; and so on. Corpus was Denmark, a small, modest, respectable, decent, unflashy college of high quality which respected scholarship rather than success, the best of the \"minor colleges\", a place of tolerance and intellectual soundness where Berlin was happy among serious, agreeable fellow undergraduates. \"I became a solid, pro status quo non-revolutionary.\" Again he recorded the College's private disposition: \"If you wished to shine, you could shine within the confines of this small Scandinavian country,\" whose passport is sound. It is also the setting for Shakespeare's Danish play, where we find in the mouth of Polonius a motto as good as any both for Corpuscles and for Berlinians: This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Henry Hardy, CCC 1967-1971 (Classical Mods and PPP), became a publisher after his time at Wolfson, and has spent most of his life as Isaiah Berlin's editor. In 2018 he published a memoir of his work with Berlin, In Search of Isaiah Berlin: A Literary Adventure (I.B.T auris). \u00a9 Henry Hardy 2021 \"M.

Assistant Archivist Harriet Patrick reconstructs his time at Corpus, with academic choices - and leisure-time distractions - that will seem familiar to many generations of undergraduates. Dudley William Carmalt Jones (1874-1957), surgeon, practised in London, and in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) in France, Egypt and Palestine during the First World War. He later served as Professor of Systematic Medicine at Otago University, Dunedin from 1920 to 1940. He published three medical texts and in 1945 a book, Diversions of a Professor in New Zealand. A typescript of memoirs describing Carmalt Jones's years as an undergraduate at Corpus is held in the College Archives, CCC MS 519. It appears as Chapter 3, \"Oxford\", in his A Physician in Spite of Himself, published posthumously in 2009. Dudley William Carmalt Jones (CCC 1893-1900) was the eldest son of Thomas William Carmalt Jones, FRCS, surgeon and barrister, and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Danvers). He came to Corpus in 1893 as a Commoner from Uppingham School in order to read Classics. Of his original choice of degree, he later explained that he had gone up with the idea of being a schoolmaster and thought that a first class in Honour Moderations would be required \"to get a post at a suitable school\". To this end, he duly sat Greek and Latin Literature Prelims after five terms of study. However, perhaps owing to a somewhat \"habitual approach\" to work, the results of the The Pelican Record 2020 23 Corpus Christi College Boat Club VIII, 1897. Carmalt Jones is on the far right of the front row examinations did not go to plan. Carmalt Jones confessed that he \"was not precisely up to date\" at the end of his first term, and during his second term he found that his likelihood of getting a First was on a par with his \"getting into the Cabinet\". He realised that \"the whole position would have to be reconsidered\". He mulled over his options with his friend (Thomas) James Garstang (CCC 1893-1897), a science scholar reading Medicine. Garstang's suggestion, apparently, was, \"Look here, you have a more scientific mind than many of the medical students, and your father's a doctor, why don't you go for medicine?\" Carmalt Jones remembered this advice as being \"a chance suggestion falling into a quite empty mind\", but one which determined his career.1 Accordingly, during his sixth term at Corpus Carmalt Jones brought his case before President Thomas Fowler (CCC President 1881-1904). Revd Fowler treated the young undergraduate \"very generously\" and allowed him a pass degree but stipulated that he must take Pass Mods at the end of term. Of the three \"groups\" required for the final examination, he was required to take two in science to serve for the medical preliminary (the other \"group\" being Greek philosophy and history from his Classics studies).2 Thus it was that Carmalt Jones switched to Natural Sciences and duly sat two science examinations - firstly in Mechanics and Physics, and secondly in Chemistry - in 1896.3 The transition to Natural Sciences was, unsurprisingly, not an easy one; Carmalt Jones was initially somewhat unprepared for the demands of his new course of study. He was dismayed to discover that his classical training provided him with \"a very poor preparation for the approach to a new subject\". This, he stated later, was because he had learned Classics \"almost unconsciously\" from the school classroom onwards in a way that was \"ample for a pass degree\"; it created the impression with other subjects that \"one entered for an examination and then found one's name in the list of those who had passed\". He tried this approach with Chemistry in his seventh term at Corpus, \"with the necessary result\". His poor marks made him realise that unless there was to be complete disaster he \"must set about things in a very different manner\". He pursued a method familiar to generations of students everywhere: fervent cramming. Later recalling that he had \"rarely worked harder\" than in his eighth and ninth terms at Corpus, he successfully passed his Chemistry and Physics examinations and took his BA degree.4 After another two terms at Oxford, he sat the required examinations in Morphology (Zoology) and Botany:5 that he passed these exams in 1897 was due to his having \"kept up a similar pressure\" of study.6 For his first three years at Corpus, Carmalt Jones's rooms were on the ground floor of the southwest corner of the Front Quad, overlooking both the Pelican Sundial and the President's drive (at this time the College President lived on site in President T urner's Lodgings). Carmalt Jones's \"sitter\" was roughly 18 feet by 15 feet, with two window seats. Meanwhile his bedroom was \"a mere strip alongside the sitting room with just room for the width of the bed\". He later recalled the bed as being the hardest he had ever slept in, except on military service. His bedroom also accommodated a dressing table, wash stand and a space for the bath which was \"hung on the wall\". Lighting was provided by kerosene lamps: \"why there were no conflagrations I cannot understand\".7 Carmalt Jones credited his involvement in college sporting and extracurricular activities as an important part of his happiness and success, with experience showing him that \"it is the man who ran things, who captained the teams and organised clubs, who has gone furthest in later life\".8 At Corpus, he served as Secretary for College Athletics, Secretary and later President of the Owlets, Secretary of the Debating Society and - most significant of all - Captain of the Boat Club.9 He rowed at number seven in the Torpid crew of 1895. More accurately, that is the position that he would have rowed, had the Torpid not been cancelled, \"a thing unprecedented in the annals of Oxford rowing\", owing to terrible flooding and frosts throughout the season.10 He subsequently rowed in the same position during that year's Eights: while these races did go ahead, the results \"proved a sad disappointment\" for Corpus.11 But Carmalt Jones evidently enjoyed rowing for his college, irrespective of the race's outcome. He later recalled that this rowing, unsuccessful as it may have been, was a tremendous thing for me and did wonders for my self-respect. Hitherto I had only been in the tail of a team, and if unable to play I could easily be replaced: now, for the first time, I was really wanted, the boat could not do without me, and the VIII had the greatest prestige of any team in college.12 Carmalt Jones appreciated the discipline and teamwork needed for rowing, and the focus that it provided. He found rowing \"'a most excellent thing, both morally and physically. One had to be down at the river punctually every day, and there was no getting a day off, it was good discipline.\"13 The Corpus VIII, with Carmalt Jones at bow, subsequently had a successful Eights in 1896, gaining five bumps, which was considered a great achievement \"even at the bottom of the river\". Corpus celebrated this success with a Bump Supper at which \"almost the whole 24 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 25 Corpus Christi College 7 Ibid., p.42. 8 Ibid., p.54. 9 Hunt and Flanagan (ed.), CCC Biographical Register 1880-1974, p.133. 10 The Pelican Record, Vol. II, No. 6, March 1895. 11 The Pelican Record, Vol. III, No. 1, June 1895. 12 Carmalt Jones and Barraclough, A Physician in Spite of Himself, p.51. 13 Ibid., p.52 .1 D.W.

Lectures and tutorial work were undertaken from 10am until lunch, which was at 1pm. After lunch the majority of junior members participated in rowing or games until 4 o'clock tea. This was followed by reading or other work until Hall, which was at 7pm. In the evening \"people had coffee, yearned in each others rooms, played cards, or had music\". Music was required to stop at 9pm, after which time \"men who were reading got down to it from 9 to 11\". T utors might also take pupils in the late afternoon or evening.15After his first three years living in College, Carmalt Jones subsequently lived in lodgings outside Corpus walls. Undergraduates were only permitted to live in licensed lodgings, but this apparently presented little difficulty \"as everyone with lodgings to let was only too glad to be on the university list\". In his fourth, fifth and sixth years at Oxford he lived at Sedan Hall in Merton Street, a house which was often taken by Corpuscles, overlooking the Merton garden. He and his housemates took residence of the whole house, with three sitting rooms and four bedrooms, \"kept by an ex-college servant and run exceedingly well\". He recalled being able to \"do a good deal of entertainment\", rather expected of undergraduates in their final year, \"without any ruinous expense\".16 26 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College Pelican Essay Club, 1898.

In his memoirs, he was philosophical about his loosening ties with Corpus towards the end of his studies, acknowledging that \"seven years is too long to stay in residence\", and that he had by this time survived all of his contemporaries. Oxford colleges were \"run by the second and third years\", with fourth years eligible for college and varsity teams and providing a number of captains. Fifth years, he felt, were \"tolerated\"; sixth years were \"perhaps an interesting survival\"; but junior members tended to view any seventh years as \"frankly antediluvian as an ichthyosaurus or a pterodactyl\".17 Being required at Corpus for neither study, accommodation nor extra-curricular purposes, Carmalt Jones became more closely attached to the Medical School. At this time the Oxford Medical School was very small, with only about thirty students. Most people took the honour school of Physiology and in their second and third years attended the course in Anatomy, and took the first MB (Bachelor of Medicine) examination in both subjects at the end of their third year. If students omitted Anatomy at this time they could take it later; while if they had obtained a first or second class in Physiology they were excused this subject for the MB, otherwise both Physiology and Anatomy had to be taken.18 During Carmalt Jones's time in Oxford, Morphology (Zoology) was taught in \"a galvanized iron temporary structure, which was said to have been guaranteed for two years, and had then stood for ten\". The first course of the honour school of Physiology - of which Carmalt Jones only had to take the preliminary part - was, he thought, \"very good\". It was taught by \"a Professor Francis Gotch FRS (1853-1913). Gotch teaching by Haldane FRS (1860-1936), \"a great authority on Respiration\". Carmalt Jones recalled that most of Haldane's experimental work was \"done with the simplest apparatus - an empty tobacco tin is a quite satisfactory air-tight cylinder\".19 Carmalt Jones lost his father before he had finished his studies in Oxford, aged just 23. This personal blow was in part softened upon inheriting an independent income of \u00a3400 a year under his deceased mother's marriage settlement. He recalled the effect of this income being \"a curiously steadying one\" as he found himself independent, and far more responsible than he had been before. He considered this private income to be the \"determining factor\" in his career: rather than having to earn his living from day to day he could afford to wait and take up \"unremunerative appointments\" when they were offered.20Not all of his medical training was received within Oxford. Carmalt Jones, along with many of his Oxford medical contemporaries, went to Surgeons' Hall in Edinburgh during the summer vacation to \"get a subject for dissection\". Additionally, during one of the Long Vacation terms, he went up to Cambridge with a friend to take a course in Pathology under German Sims Woodhead (1855-1921) KBE MB, Professor of Pathology at Cambridge University from 1895 to 1921. There he received lectures in the morning and four hours of practical work in the afternoons.21 These educational visits aside, however, Carmalt Jones stayed up at Oxford until he had completed the \"First MB\", a test of knowledge in the sciences basic to medicine (chemistry, physics, zoology and botany), taking seven years altogether. He always remembered his years in Oxford and at Corpus with great affection.22 In his memoirs, he said of his university career: Academically, nothing at all, one pass degree and half of another; athletically, up to college form in one sport, and with considerable luck in it, and a great advance on any prospect I had when I had left school. But in friendship, in affairs and in human contacts it was the opening up of a new world, and Corpus Christi College in the University of Oxford will retain my love and my loyalty as long as I retain consciousness.23 17 Ibid., p.60. 4 Figure 1: Map of Britain under King Alfred the Great (c. 880) Although not directly a product of the \"West Saxon court machine \",15 Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was also translated into Old English around the same time , anonymously , at either the end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century .

While the translators were extremely competent with their styles and rendering of Latin into Old English, t he Old English translation is not a word- for-word representation of the Latin Historia Ecclesiastica . Instead, it might be considered more of an abridgement of Bede 's original work, as several chapters are omitted or condensed. As Sharon Rowley notes, the Old English translator \"abridges its source by about a third\" and omitted the papal letters, documents, epitaphs and poems present in the Latin original .17 Whether or not these omissions and abridgements were direct actions undertaken by the translators themselves or were representative of a pre -existing abridged Latin version of the Historia Ecclesiastica that was already circulating remains uncertain.

According to Sharon Rowley, the translators preferred to translate \"gens Anglorum\" as Ongel\u00feeod , although the Alfredian term Angelcynn does appear throughout the translation.18 Rowley also notes that when Angelcynn (or Ongolcynn ) does appear, it is used as part of a 15 Foot, \"Angelcynn \", p.28. 16 Sharon Rowley, The Old English Version of Bede' s Historia Ecclesiastica (Cambridge: D.S.

Anglorum\": Old English Copy of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Colleen Curran A gem of the Corpus manuscript collection is MS 279B, an eleventh- century translation of Bede's history of the English Church. Dr. Colleen Curran explores how this seemingly humble document has borne witness to a constant process of a reshaping of historical narratives over the centuries. Upon first glance, Oxford, Corpus Christi College MS 279B might appear to be an underwhelming medieval manuscript. It is an economical size, measuring only 259 x 168 mm. There are no illuminated capitals, no illustrations, and no gold or silver ink. The manuscript contains limited chapter headings, so it is difficult to realise what the text is without any prior knowledge. Written in Old English, the script itself is compressed and difficult to read, containing now defunct letterforms: \u00e6sc (\u00e6), eth (\u00f0), wynn ( ) and thorn (\u00fe). Very little of the manuscript's origin and provenance is known, as there are no recognisable claims of ownership scribbled in the margins and no notes of donation. Its physical appearance is very deceiving, however, as MS 279B is one of five surviving copies of the Old English translation of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, which documents the history of Christianity in England and of early medieval England in general. In particular, MS 279B contains annotations by the group of antiquarians associated with Archbishop Matthew Parker (1504-1575), the Archbishop of Canterbury under Queen Elizabeth I. Although not immediately visible, the transmission of MS 279B bears direct witness to an evolving construction and reconstruction, acceptance and rejection of national, regional and even personal identity over the course Figure 1: Map of Britain under King Alfred the Great (c. 880) The Pelican Record 2020 31 Corpus Christi College of nearly 1,300 years. Beginning with an eighth-century Northumbrian historical record, exploring alterations in both Alfred's ninth-century Wessex and eleventh-century Canterbury and examining its continued use through the Reformation in the sixteenth century, this article discusses the transformations, continuities, innovations and permutations as present within this particular manuscript Bede (673-735), a monk of Wearmouth-Jarrow, Northumbria, cannot be overstated. Bede entered monastic life at the age of seven and dedicated himself to learning, teaching and writing.2 To that end, he wrote at least sixteen Biblical commentaries, one geographical treatise, four hagiographical texts, two historical treatises, homilies, letters, poems, two grammatical treatises (including one on the art of metrical poetry) and two scientific treatises.3 His Historia Ecclesiastica, which is undoubtedly his most circulated and celebrated work, provides a historical account of the settlement and Christian conversion of early medieval England from the late sixth through the eighth centuries. Dorothy Whitelock summarised the appeal of Bede's major historical work and his contributions to historical writing when she stated that his \"historical work has been read continuously ever since it was written, and it has formed a model for later writers\".4 Bede finished the Historia in 731 and presented it to King Ceolwulf (of Northumbria) for his approval. After Ceolwulf advised some changes, the revised text began to be voraciously copied in manuscript format three years after its completion. Since then, the Historia Ecclesiastica has survived in over 150 manuscripts, with copies ranging in date from as early as 734 through the sixteenth century from both England and throughout Europe.5 32 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College In the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede declares himself to be a verax historicus.6 However, his primary objective as a historicus was not necessarily to record facts in a manner that reflected his reality accurately, but to make sense of those facts - however true they might be - with regards to England's place within the wider context of salvation history, which was similar to the approach that Eusebius (c. 260/265-339/340) took in his Historia Ecclesiastica. Bede read Eusebius's historical work through a version produced by Rufinus of Aquileia, and he was particularly influenced by his Ecclesiastical History, both in terms of theme and structure: the broadly chronological arrangement, the tracing of episcopal succession in the English kingdoms and a particular concern with heresy.7 But whereas Eusebius was concerned with the universal Church, Bede was concerned with Britain: through his Historia Ecclesiastica, he focused on how the English became part of the universal Church with a desire and intent to establish their particular role in providential history. Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica is divided into five books, which span the period from the invasion of Julius Caesar (incorrectly dated to 60 BC) up to 731. It treats the English as a single group (or gens, people), albeit divided into separate kingdoms. Bede stresses in the preface that he gathered historical information from all regions and kingdoms to \"gain general approval in England\".8 He focuses his Historia on the conversion of these kingdoms and the establishment of the Church within them. Book I begins with a geographical description of Britain and Ireland that is reminiscent of descriptions of the Promised Land. The providential tone anticipates the \"gens Anglorum\" as God's new \"chosen people\". Book II describes Pope Gregory's plan for dividing the English Church into two geographical provinces: one based in the south, in London, and the other in the north, in York. Book III begins with a lamentation regarding the apostasy of Edwin's successors in Northumbria and focuses on the establishment of a new mission to the kingdom, not from Rome or even Canterbury, but from the Irish and, in particular, the community that they established on the island of Lindisfarne. Bede highlights the Synod of Whitby in 664, in which the English Church decided to adopt the practices of the Roman Church and sent a bishop-elect of Canterbury to Rome to confirm the links between the blossoming English Church and Rome. Book IV encompasses the appointment of Theodore of Canterbury in 669 and presents his tenure as a golden age with brave Christian 1 I use the following abbreviations throughout this article: Catalogue: Neil Ripley Ker, Manuscripts: A Bibliographical Handlist of Manuscripts Written or Owned in England up to 1100 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2014).

Book V chronicles Bede's contemporaries and the English missions to the Continent. Bede reflects upon the unfolding process of salvation history as present throughout his work, and declares that the English are \"believers [and] are fully instructed in the rules of the catholic faith\".9 The Historia Ecclesiastica thus has a strong intent of establishing the \"English\" people firmly within the wider narrative of providential history. Bede's skill as a historian in constructing this account is all the more impressive, since he himself admits he drew upon a variety of sources: oral sources, written documents and \"common report\", or the common perception of men of his own background and learning.10 Through the Historia Ecclesiastica, he demonstrates his ability as a craftsman to transform all of this information from a variety of sources into a coherent, chronological narrative with an exegetical aim. 2. Continuities: the ninth-century Wessex vernacular translation programme By the time of his death in 899, King Alfred the Great (r. 871-899) was heralded as the \"king over the whole English people except for that part which was under Danish rule\" (Figure 1).11 This statement, as reported in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, is remarkable for two different reasons: firstly, Alfred had inherited only the kingdom of Wessex during a period of intense Viking activity; secondly, the term Angelcynn (English people) was hardly ever used in such a manner prior to Alfred's reign. The term Angelcynn originally referred to the Angles as a specific group, but was redefined to refer to an envisioned united people, inclusive of the Saxon and Jutish kingdoms.12 The increased frequency of the term Angelcynn coincides with texts produced in Alfred's reign - as part of a reform that sought to translate all texts which \"are the most necessary for all men to know\" from Latin into Old English.13 This remarkable historical moment demonstrates \"an astonishing confidence in the potential of the vernacular to be developed as a medium for scholarly and religious discourse on a par with Latin\".14 Although not directly a product of the \"West Saxon court machine\",15 Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was also translated into Old English around the same time, anonymously, at either the end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century. The translation that survives is the work of one main translator, but two others translated part of Book III and the lists of chapter headings.16 The original translation was written in the Mercian dialect of Old English, and traces of Mercian dialectal features survive in varying degrees in the five surviving manuscripts. While the translators were extremely competent with their styles and rendering of Latin into Old English, the Old English translation is not a word-for-word representation of the Latin Historia Ecclesiastica. Instead, it might be considered more of an abridgement of Bede's original work, as several chapters are omitted or condensed. As Sharon Rowley notes, the Old English translator \"abridges its source by about a third\" and omitted the papal letters, documents, epitaphs and poems present in the Latin original.17 Whether or not these omissions and abridgements were direct actions undertaken by the translators themselves or were representative of a pre-existing abridged Latin version of the Historia Ecclesiastica that was already circulating remains uncertain. What is certain, however, is that the Old English translation presents interesting insights into how the later inhabitants of early medieval England actively encountered and interacted with their historical past, and how they translated that past into their present political and cultural realities, which were far removed from Bede's eighth-century Northumbria. While the translations and texts made under Alfred were associated with promoting the idea of a unified Angelcynn, the Old English translation of the Historia Ecclesiastica differs slightly. According to Sharon Rowley, the translators preferred to translate gens Anglorum as Ongel\u00feeod, although the Alfredian term Angelcynn does appear throughout the translation.18 Rowley also notes that when Angelcynn (or Ongolcynn) does appear, it is used as part of a phrase rather than a standalone term. For example, Angelcynn/Ongolcynn appears as \u00feeod Ongolcynnes, the repetitive Ongolcynnes cynn.19 This difference is subtle, but distinctive nonetheless. In an Alfredian setting, Angelcynn is used as a standalone noun, but in the Old English Historia, Angelcynn/Ongolcynn requires more context. Rowley observes that the Old English Historia favours specific regional groups, as the following terms demonstrate: East/ West Seax- appears 84 times, Scott 75 times, Bryttas 58 times, Merc - 56 times, Nor\u00f0anhymbra 50 times, Eastengl- 30 times, Peohtas also 30 times and Middelengl- seven In contrast,9 HE, Preface, pp.6-7: \"I have obtained my material from here and there, chiefly from the writings of earlier writers...

Additionally, the Old English Historia refers to the physical land as Englalond only twice, but as Breotone 95 times. The translators of the Old English Historia thus appear to be more sensitive to regional identities than other Old English translations associated with Alfred. Despite being translated around the same time as Alfred's reign, the Old English Historia does not conform to the idea of a singular \"English people\" that Alfredian texts try to promote. Although the modern concept of \"nations\" cannot be applied directly to our medieval sources, it is nevertheless interesting as to how Bede, Alfred and the now anonymous translators employed rhetorical terms to establish groupings of people for ideological political and religious interests. In the Old English Historia, we can see how the translators tested various collective identifiers for different peoples and kingdoms who were not yet perceived of as a homogenous group, and who would remain so at least until King \u00c6thelstan's reign in the tenth century. 3. Innovations: eleventh-century scribal alterations Only five manuscripts of the Old English Historia survive, including MS 279B, which dates to the early eleventh century.20 We know very little about the manuscript's origin and provenance. When and how it arrived at Corpus Christi College remains uncertain, as it was not a part of the original collection of Richard Foxe (d. 1528), nor does it appear in the library's earliest record of 1589. The manuscript was bound with a fourteenth-century Latin copy of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, until they were separated and rebound in 1992. John T wyne (d. 1581) owned and annotated the Latin copy (MS 279A), but the Old English copy does not appear in his records, nor does his writing appear in it.21 T wyne's grandson, Brian, donated 279A to the College; in his personal records, Brian does not mention the Old English copy.22 MS 279B contains 161 folios distributed amongst 21 quires, with probably three quires lost from the beginning and one lost from the end; thus, the text of the Historia Ecclesiastica is incomplete. The manuscript was written by three main scribes, with at least three others making later additions, annotations and corrections to the main text.23 All three hands of the main text (H1-H3) write in a script similar to one that is typically associated with productions from late tenth- to early eleventh-century Christ Church, Canterbury.24 The main hand, H1, copied the bulk of the manuscript, while H2 copied smaller portions scattered throughout f. 11v-149v, and H3 copied only f. 47r. H1 wrote in a script now known as Square minuscule, which was the predominant script written by scribes in southern English scribal centres throughout the tenth century and into the early eleventh century.25 H1's particular script is indicative of early eleventh-century Canterbury scribal developments: round a, flat-topped g with a tail that remains barely open, f and r that descend below the baseline, p with an open bow, use of both the round and low s, x with a straight limb in the lower left quadrant, bilinear round y that can either be dotted or not, and wedged serifs on ascenders of b, d, h and l. H2 writes a script that is more indicative of early eleventh-century characteristics: round a, bilinear d with a short ascender, tall e, flat-topped g with a narrow, open tail, f and r that descend below the baseline, y with a straight limb with at least one f-shaped y (on fol. 69v) and an overall angular appearance. 20 Catalogue, no. 354, Handlist, no. 673.

The number is determined by the first appearance and subsequent noticeable changes of hand. Therefore, \"H1\" means the first scribe, \"H2\" means the second scribe and \"H3\" means the third scribe to appear in the manuscript. 24 Peter Stokes, English Vernacular Minuscule from \u00c6thelred to Cnut, circa 990 - circa 1035 pp.129-130. 25 David Ganz, \"Square Minuscule\" in The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Vol. 1: c. 400-1100, ed.

Note in particular the change in the y letterform and the Tironian et (\"7\") { {38 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 39 Corpus Christi College Figure 3: Oxford, Corpus Christi College, 279B, f. 109r H3 writes a script that is also indicative of early eleventh-century scribal developments, but also maintains some mid- to late tenth-century characteristics: a flat-topped, \"square\" a, bilinear d with a short headstroke, g with a flat top and a closed tail, f and r that descend below the baseline, tall e and \u00e6 ligature, a visible juncture on his tall s, and long and thin ascenders and descenders. H3 also occasionally mixes a capital r with lower-case letters. The changes between the scribal hands occur in odd locations throughout the manuscript. There is no clear pattern as to how and when H2 takes over from H1. Sometimes, the change occurs mid-line. Given the shape of some of his letterforms, H2 appears to have been trained later than H1. It is possible, therefore, that H2 could be a more novice scribe and was using this production to gain experience. Additionally, note the correction in line 5 (on) written by H1 over H2's writing in Figure 2. This overlap indicates that H1 and H2 were working together. H1 also corrected a small portion of H3's stint, which indicates that they were working in close proximity. H1's performance demonstrates that he was a conscientious - although not perfect - scribe, as his performance is riddled with omissions, deletions and self-corrections. H1 seemingly proofread his manuscript, since he returned to it to include any omitted information. On his work, H1 realised that he had omitted a significant clause (\u00fee he gehadad...) indicating the absence of Tatfrith's ordination before his death. He returned to the text and inserted a sign of omission (:.) and then continued the text as a marginal addition, thus allowing the full importance of the historical event to be pronounced.27 This commitment to an accurate text is also apparent through a series of deletions. Some of these deletions correspond to dialectal differences. Compared with other contemporary languages, Old English is remarkably preserved through over 1,000 manuscript books and fragments written or owned in England between the late seventh and the late eleventh centuries. Thus, we are able to trace the morphology of the language. There were four main dialects of Old English: Northumbrian, Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon. Northumbrian and Mercian share the most similarities, and are often referred to as a cohesive dialect, Anglian.The West Saxon dialect became the most prominent dialect following the political domination of Alfred's Wessex. Thus, a majority of surviving Old English texts are written in the West Saxon dialect.28 However, Old English was a living language and was spoken all over England for more than six centuries. Therefore, dialectal shifts are not necessarily static linguistic boundaries. H1's scribal performance is indicative of such variations between these dialects. His longest self-correction in Book III occurs on fol. 56v: 26 \"...Taatfrith. But before he could be ordained, he was suddenly carried off by death. Now the aforesaid servant of Christ, the abbess Hild...\". My translation. For those readers unfamiliar with conventions of textual criticism, superscript additions are typically represented between slashes (\\ /), and abbreviations are expanded in round brackets ( ). Thus, \u00fe has been represented as \u00fe(\u00e6t). The \"7\" symbol here represents the so-called \"Tironian et\", which was an abbreviation used by Insular scribes to indicate \"ond\" (\"and\"). 27 See The Old English Version of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English people, ed. and trans.

His repetition was not erased; instead, someone merely crossed out the first line. In the first line, H1 has written ycle, swycle and ealand. In the second he icle, swicle and ealonde. ealand are Anglian spellings.30 Thus, both lines contain dialectal mixtures. Such combinations are fairly common for H1. As Christine Wallis observes, of the 45 instances of ycle/icle, H1 writes icle on three occasions. Of the 49 instances of swylce/swilce, he writes swilce twelve times. He also varies his spelling of ealonde/ealand. Throughout the entire manuscript, the word ealand/ealond appears fifteen times; three instances are spelled with an o (indicative of a West Saxon dialect).31 There are several explanations for this dialectal inconsistency. The scribe could be reconciling his own dialect, which was probably West Saxon, with that of the exemplar in front of him, which was probably in an Anglian dialect. Or, these variations could be indicative of a wider dialectal variety that is not as well represented in the surviving written sources. As is fairly typical of medieval manuscripts, H1 wrote his text first and left space for the enlarged capitals to be added later. However, H1 and the individual who supplied the capital letters later seemingly had different exemplars. The individual who supplied the capital letters supplies the wrong initials five times in the twenty-four capitals in Book III. Four of the five cases involve the same word, ono (but, therefore, moreover). This is visible on fols. 26v, 27v, 40v and 43r. In all of these instances, the red capital letter O is clearly written over an erased red capital letter A. Additionally, in all these cases, the next two words have also clearly been altered, with fols. 26v and 27v leaving traces behind of the original last letter - a d. The next letters on fols. 40v and 43r have been completely erased and written again, with the n on f. 43r being elongated to fill more space than was originally covered by the capital A. This series of erasures is seemingly due to the main scribe's copying of and rather than ono. H1, therefore, wrote nd with the expectation that a capital A would be supplied. However, a corrector realised the mistake, and insisted upon the correction. It remains unclear as to why this correction was carried out, as the mistake does not alter the meaning of the text. Nevertheless, the correction was executed, which provides the modern reader with a glimpse into not only linguistic change and variation, but also the process of making and correcting a medieval manuscript. 42 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 43 Corpus Christi College 32 Hugh Magennis, \"Not Angles but Anglicans?

Thomson, A descriptive catalogue of the medieval manuscripts of Corpus Christi College Oxford (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2011), p.141.4. Permutations: Archbishop Parker and the origin of the English Church Old English studies blossomed in the sixteenth century. This was due to a general interest in antiquarian studies (led in particular by John Leland and John Bale), but also in support of the newly reformed English Church's claims to doctrinal accuracy and independence from Rome. The latter group was primarily associated with Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury 1559-1575, and included scholars like John Joscelyn, Laurence Nowell and William Lambarde. As the first Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Parker had a particular interest in using Anglo-Saxon sources to lend authority to his opposition to the Catholic Church. Including a translation of \u00c6lfric's homilies to demonstrate \"ancient evidence against the doctrine of transubstantiation\", the earliest publication from this scholarship was A T estimonie of Antiqvitie, shewing the Auncient Fayth in the Church of England Touching the Sacrament of the Body and Bloude of the Lord Here Publickly Preached, and Also Receaued in the Saxons Tyme, aboue 600. Yeares Agoe, compiled by Parker and John Joscelyn, and printed in London in 1566 with a specially cut type to replicate the Insular minuscule of the Anglo-Saxon sources.32 One particular source was, unsurprisingly, Bede and especially his Historia Ecclesiastica. Bede occupied a strange position in the early Reformation period, as he was used by both Catholics and Protestants to assert their various positions. Because of his monastic background and commitment to the Roman Church, early Reformation authors were suspicious of Bede.33 In fact, the first printed edition of the Historia Ecclesiastica was only published in England in 1643, by Abraham Wheelocke. Nevertheless, Bede was still seen as an important source of historical information on the early English Church. Additionally, even his fiercest early modern critics, like John Bale, still used the Historia Ecclesiastica to defend their views. In a letter to Parker, Bale paralleled a slaughter of British monks by Anglo-Saxons as recorded by Bede in Book II, Chapter 2, to the persecutions of Protestants under Queen Mary's reign.34 Bale omitted some vital details from Bede's account, including that the Anglo-Saxons who carried out the attack were pagan, not Christian. However, the core analogy was successful enough. To further facilitate this investigation into Anglo-Saxon historical sources, Parker built a considerable collection of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 575 contains a list of manuscripts owned by Matthew Parker.35 It is not surprising to see that Parker owned at least two copies of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica, one in Old English (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 41) and one in Latin (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 359). One other copy that Parker and his circle at least handled, if not owned, is 279B, which bears an annotation \"caput 26\" (Chapter 26) by Parker himself on fol. 2r.36 Other annotations are limited throughout 279B, so it remains difficult to ascertain exactly what Parker and his group used the manuscript for, and what questions they were trying to answer through their examinations of it. But what remains certain is that this particular manuscript was of interest and use to Parker and his associates. 5. Conclusion As Stephen Harris advises, the last two words in Bede's title (Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum) are ambiguous.37 Gens translates to \"people\" rather than a nation, tribe or race, but how do we make distinctions between those terms? Anglorum could refer to the continental Angles, a group of people that Bede names as settlers during the Germanic migration to Britain; to Bede's own immediate surroundings in Northumbria or, more specifically, even to the Mercian region where the exemplar of the Old English translation was likely composed; to those kingdoms that eventually became \"the English\", which was much later than Bede; or to those who simply spoke English. The ambiguity within the title facilitated the later reception and popularity of Bede's work. In many ways, the material reality of MS 279B rejects those wider ideological narratives that Bede, Alfred and Parker crafted. Nevertheless, as an eleventh- century copy of a ninth-century vernacular translation of an eighth-century text compiled mostly via fragmented histories from a variety of sources, and which was then used for the advancement of a sixteenth-century political ideology, MS 279B stands as a particularly unique historical witness of a constant process of reshaping historical narratives, particularly that of the \"Anglorum\". This article is dedicated to Professor R.A.B. Mynors, who was the Professor of Latin at Corpus from 1953 to 1970. In addition to his critical editions of Vergil, Catullus and Pliny the Younger, Professor Mynors was also an accomplished medieval Latinist, with his edition and translation of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Brittaniarum et maxime gentis Anglorum (co-edited and translated with Bertram Colgrave) remaining the standard in the field to this day. 37 Stephen Harris, Race and Ethnicity in Anglo-Saxon Literature (London: Routledge, 2003), p.86. A Commemoration Sermon Professor Peter McCullough Professor Peter McCullough, Sohmer Fellow in English Renaissance Literature at Lincoln College, gave the Commemoration of Benefactors sermon in the College Chapel on 23 February 2020. On any good terrestrial map, Corpus and Lincoln are separated by that great equator that is The High. But since we know that Oxford is in fact celestial, I like to think of us as the Gemini, the T wins in the Oxford firmament. We both are small and perfectly formed. We both sit graciously between larger neighbours, and smile serenely in the knowledge that we don't want to be them. And we have for centuries cultivated modesty, at times perhaps out of necessity, but always turning that necessity to a virtue. Even our buildings epitomise a healthy approach to change over centuries, with loving stewardship of the old, and the new discreetly and deferentially inserted - and so too with the social changes that have been welcomed within those buildings, where change has been a function of timely evolution, rather than disruptive revolution. So I bring from Lincoln to Corpus a sincere love and respect that I'm sure is mutual. But I also, as a kind of herald, bring you some glad tidings from the T url, where the Governing Body of the College of the Blessed Virgin Mary and All Saints, Lincoln, has this very week approved a joint JCR-MCR proposal to acquire - wait for it - a College tortoise. The success of that proposal was down to our students' four key arguments in favour. T wo of those were predictable mainstays of student requests: \"demand\" (I quote) and \"welfare benefits\". The third, though, The Pelican Record 2020 45 Corpus Christi College was related directly to the present company, and I quote again: \"Corpus Christi Tortoise Fair: It is about time that Lincoln College has a stake in the famous tortoise race that occurs at Corpus Christi College.... Our tortoise could lead Lincoln to victory!\" You have been warned. But it was our students' fourth argument that really got me not just thinking, but thinking about this sermon. It was this: \"The addition of a college pet reflects the quirkiness and unique character that Oxford University celebrates.\" You might be disappointed that I am not going to preach about tortoises. But silly things - like tortoises - often best epitomise very serious things, like \"the unique character that Oxford University celebrates\". And that unique character is, radically and fundamentally, its colleges. And the commemoration of our founders and benefactors is an opportunity to think very seriously not just about what institutions like ours offer that is \"unique\", but why and how they do. When your founder Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Winchester, bought a little bee garden in this pleasant corner of Oxford, his original plan was for a community of Benedictine monks. Foxe was not himself a Benedictine, but he had a longstanding respect for the order. His cathedral of Winchester had an attached priory for Benedictine men. And he had translated the Rule of St Benedict into English for use by the communities of Benedictine women in his diocese. By deciding in the end to found a community of scholars instead, though, he turned the dial of purpose and ethos only very slightly away from things Benedictine. For by the time Foxe turned this plot of land from a hive of bees to a hive of students and scholars, all intentional communities in Western Europe, especially colleges, were deeply indebted to the structures of communal living for a higher good first set down by Benedict a thousand years before. The most recent book by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, meditates on how the Benedictine legacy still proves itself \"adaptable to many situations\" and institutions. Hallmarks of this Benedictine legacy for Williams include \"living accountably alongside others\"; \"learning how to pay \"identifying and rectifying [our] own unthinking self-centredness\"; and how a \"committed life together matters more than any individual search for fulfilment\". A deep fidelity to these things, he says, results in communities that are at once both stable and adaptable over long periods of time. Sound familiar? Such stability and adaptability, though, cannot be achieved through mere assertion or imposition of those things as abstractions. Rather, the Benedictine Rule, like College Statutes, attends almost exclusively to the actual ways of living that build community. Our founders, like St Benedict, did not bequeath us a theory or a set of ideals, but patterns for living together that make those ideals of stability and adaptability a reality. On the face of it, rules of college life, like monastic life, can be incredibly mundane, not least in their attention to basics like rooms and food, and also the deep habituation of work - and work that is sometimes repetitive and dull, but work which isn't as much about production, as a constant putting of what we do as individuals into contact with others who can shape us and take us out of ourselves. That kind of work isn't easy. Taking us out of ourselves requires a radical kind of humility because it is a submission of self to others. And to put ourselves in the hands of others requires trust of the other. Living this way runs counter to the ways of the world: ours are places where hierarchies of seniority and expertise are not to be used as tools of control or suppression, but to \"secure an ethos in which open conflict over position or influence\" (a sin of pride) is less likely to occur; where those in positions of trust (a far better way to think than \"positions of authority\") do not assert their own \"rights\", but use the trust that they have been given to discern and then nurture every other member's distinctive gifts; and where these more subtle structures of membership, at once hierarchical and democratic, are predicated on the fierce conviction that no one member is any more important than another. The implications should be obvious, even if the doing is difficult: do I notice the gardener? How do I speak to my scout? Do I make admissions decisions based on their implications for me and my subject in something as grossly abstract as the Norrington Table, or as an act of discernment for the growth and happiness of the candidate? Can I tell when a bad essay should prompt encouragement rather than criticism? Or, when there is something, or someone, I can't stand, or when I feel stung by an injustice, do I respond in the way the world tells me to - with what Williams acutely diagnoses in me as the \"premature panic\" to cancel the view or the person that isn't to my taste just so I can have what I want. Stable communities like ours are designed to control that response with the simplest of facts: the person or people who upset me aren't going to go away. They are just as much a fact of communal life as I am, and actually living and working together is \"the most drastic way imaginable of recognizing the otherness of others\". And with that, paradoxically, comes the realisation of how much we are the same. And if all of us put nothing but selfish grievance into circulation in our communities we will get nothing but grievance back. So we might then take the challenge of our reading from the Sermon on the Mount and ask whether when asked for bread, we give stones, or if for fish we give serpents. Which takes me to the fact that Benedict, of course, didn't invent any of this himself. Rather, in conceiving a form of monastic community devoted to becoming Christ-like, he was wisely and pragmatically applying the lessons for living taught by Christ. There isn't a great deal of theology in the abstract, doctrinal sense in either the Sermon on the Mount or the Benedictine Rule - just a lot about how to live with each other, which is one reason why both the Sermon and the Rule are so adaptable to communities of any faith or none. But for those who do call themselves Christians, this striving for a life of stable adaptability to the needs and improvement 46 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 47 Corpus Christi College - not of ourselves, but of others - is very fundamentally doing God's work, because doing so is \"a demonstration of our accountability to God to put aside private and partial agendas for the honour and wellbeing of all who are made in the divine image\". That is true religion; that is true wisdom; that is to build a house on a sure foundation; that is to build and become part of the body of Christ. That is, in short, for us all to be members of Corpus Christi. 48 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College Motivated by Mindfulness Gediminas Para The Pelican Record 2019 51 Corpus Christi College \"What is the single most important thing you have learned as a graduate student?\" was the question addressed by this year's winner of the Graduate Sidgwick Essay Prize. Every graduate student's day is different, but I can tell you what a day as a student of theoretical chemistry - that exotic area of science that is quite vague to most - looks like. In the first half of my daily routine, I attend to the need for knowledge production. Specifically, I work to explain how birds can sense the magnetic field of the earth; a yet uncoded natural wonder that I endeavour to unravel from a theoretical perspective. As one piece in a wider network of researchers interested in this topic, I make modelled simulations of our reality through \"pen and paper\" derivations. This means that I write predictive equations using physics and mathematics which can be translated into computer code and run on big \"clusters\" of computing machines in the pursuit of theoretically inspired clarity. I have always been fascinated by the possibility of simulating reality with relative accuracy in order to predict new phenomena - on the scale of nanometres! 52 The Pelican Record 2019 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 53 Corpus Christi College After I indulge myself with these computations, I spend the second half of my day either dining in College, catching up with friends or, my latest hobby, salsa dancing. But not every day can be decompressed, and not every day treats me to greater clarity in the natural world. No graduate student is foreign to those days consumed by a deadline. On occasion, the prospect of running a set of simulations that I do not fully understand, but the results of which appear so imperative, overwhelms me. I sit and stare at my screen for hours without motivation, afraid that I cannot create accurate results in time. Not only can this be demoralising, but my peers and I now also find ourselves unable to support each other over a cup of much needed coffee. I have been spending my quarantine stuck, reluctantly, at my parents' home in Lithuania. It is precisely from the place where I stand now that places like Oxford once seemed so mysterious, distant and unattainable. Return here provokes in me an anxiety about my ability to be part of knowledge production at Oxford. Time spent unproductively leads me to doubt my own work ethic, sparking a negative feedback loop of thoughts that makes it harder to start work the next day. Although such struggles are exacerbated by the pandemic, in truth, I am speaking of the difficulties of taking charge of independent research. I am sure it will be hardest to stave off the symptoms of burn-out in the months ahead of turning in my doctoral thesis, and I applaud those who are completing their research in this bizarre global moment. After various run-ins of my own with mini burn-outs, days lost to self-questioning and demotivation, I decided that there must be a better way to deal with the responsibilities of graduate studies. Before having my own \"Aha!\" moment, I tried almost everything the typical graduate student tries: scheduling my time differently, improving my sleep, adjusting my nutrition, exercising more, etc. But no matter what I did, I would still encounter days when I felt out of rhythm and frustrated. The solution that finally helped me untangle every overwhelming day still feels too simple to be true - I accept the fact that at the moment I am struggling and that my feelings are normal. Such acceptance helps me to shift my mindset and to look for ways that I can enrich my life, instead of letting self-doubt control me. Sometimes this peacefulness comes about when I take a walk and let myself observe things that I had previously overlooked mindlessly, and at other times when I call friends to see how they are holding up. I take those unproductive moments and welcome them as an opportunity to engage my mind differently, making it easier to return to my equations later. Focusing on the pleasant effervescence of the present is something that I learned through mindfulness meditation practices that I started as a graduate student at Oxford. I am grateful to the amazing instructors at the Oxford Mindfulness Centre for what they have taught me. Their support aside, mindfulness demands a lot of patience and effort from the student. In short, it involves drawing your attention to different parts of the body and discovering what the mind is doing, allowing for a more thorough understanding of how the mind works. One simple exercise, which anyone can learn to do, is simply to focus on your breathing - eyes closed for bonus points. Deceptively straightforward, but in my first week of practice I could not hold such a focus for more than five seconds! This is common, and the best response is to acknowledge that your mind has wandered and to return your attention to the breathing: meditation is not a zero-sum game, so being sympathetic to yourself is key. Meditation has not only helped me to learn about myself, it has also carried over into my work as a student by allowing me to stay in tune with the uneven cycles of knowledge production without cracking under the pressure of difficult days. Mindfulness has helped me to understand how the external world influences me and how I can be more happy and grateful with the scientific research I am currently doing - even when my simulations turn out not to work. Many graduate students will also occasionally experience frustration and feel that they are not able to perform. So next time you doubt your abilities, I invite you to be more mindful about your day, your body, your emotions, the air you breathe and the feeling of the ground under your feet. I hope that other Oxford graduates will join me in learning to accept bad days and to be more mindful about life, stopping for a minute to embrace what it presents us with. We are only as free to imagine new ideas, equations and solutions as we are free from mindsets that inhibit our potential. Never has it been more important to unlock this freedom as it is now against the predicament of quarantine. Book Reviews Feeling and Classical Philology: Knowing Antiquity in German Scholarship, 1770-1920 by Constanze G\u00fcthenke (Cambridge University Press, 2020) \"Where things can be ascertained and proved, and the instances counted, I go to the German; where it is a question of feeling, no.\" So, in 1915 (during the Great War) wrote Gilbert Murray, Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford from 1908 to 1936. This opinion about feeling in the conduct of scholarship, from a great authority, could not be more wrong. It is Constanze G\u00fcthenke's project in this book not only to show how fundamentally misconceived that view is, but also to illustrate the profound importance of the German Romantic investment in, and identification with, the Greeks. By the time one has read through her book, it is clear that this was key to the construction of the entire German philological enterprise and, founded on this, to the humanistic projects of philosophy, literary criticism and historical understanding (not only in classical scholarship) in the years up to the aftermath of World War I. That investment turns out to be dependent on assumptions of love and empathy, developed especially from the latter part of the eighteenth century, that are founded above all on readings of the Platonic corpus (in particular, the Symposium) and on a pattern of mimetic emulation of ideal figures, human models, like Plato himself or Socrates, created by means of a biographical lens applied through the practice of philology. This monograph is immensely important in helping us understand the roots not only of Classics but of all the humanistic disciplines in very deep structures of thinking especially developed in Germany in the long nineteenth century. What G\u00fcthenke calls \"a discourse of love\" (p.3) and elsewhere of pedagogy'\" - a yearning for wholeness intimated from the fragments of a privileged past, \"a longed for and yet sublimated proximity and related language of empathy and experience\" (p.2) - is equally evident in the approaches of archaeologists like Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768), theologian-philosophers like Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf (1848-1931), to cite some of the heroes of her book. As Wilamowitz wrote in 1889, the Hellenes were a subject \"with whom and for whom I live\" (cited p.188). The great German Classical project was one of identification and idealisation, conducted perhaps through the driest forms of technical scholarly command, but imbued with a repressed passion all the more intense for its masking within the constraints of scholarly practice. Yet it was often far more explicit - in its avowed erotic charge, its contemporaneity The Pelican Record 2020 55 Corpus Christi College and its overt placement of feeling centre-stage - than Gilbert Murray allowed or imagined. Take, for instance, these comments by the philosopher and critic Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803): \"does it not also require a small amount of love-struck enthusiasm to imprint one's subject sufficiently into one's imagination as to sketch his image afterwards, as though out of one's head?\" (quoted on p.30). Or the ambition of Schleiermacher's translations of Plato to encourage the reader to \"be a living participant in the Platonic undertaking\" (p.81). Although the book is a history of the development of feeling, and a discourse of feeling, as the drive underpinning the study of antiquity, it is also a close-focused account of a series of engagements with the Platonic corpus and above all the Symposium and its key figures, Socrates and Alcibiades. These resonate as the volume's major leitmotif, grounding scholarship's approach of imitative love and ideal models in a dialogue whose speeches deal explicitly with these topics. The volume's trajectory moves from the establishment of Platonic erotics as the foundation of Bildung, the formation of self through a discourse of love and feeling (pp.33- 43), to scholarly identification with the lives of its subjects (Wissenschaft or learning as a form of exploring the personification of its scholarly object). The development of Bildung is shown to culminate in a tradition of biographical criticism that focuses not just on the great ancient writers (such as Wilamowitz's accounts of Plutarch, Plato, Sappho and Simonides) but on the great scholars who worked on these writers (for example, Carl Justi's life of Winckelmann, 1866-1872, or Wilhelm Dilthey's biography of Schleiermacher, 1870). The immense relevance of all this to what we do today should not be underestimated, even if so many of our approaches are reactions after the mid-twentieth century against such axioms as the centrality of biography to literary criticism. Let us take an example, relevant to the history of this College, which G\u00fcthenke does not discuss but certainly might have. In 1934, the Jewish refugee Eduard Fraenkel was elected to the Corpus Chair of Latin in Oxford. He was one of the greatest products of Wilamowitz's Berlin school, sacked from his Chair in Freiburg following the anti-Semitic legislation of 1933. His effect in Oxford, indeed in British Classical academia generally, was electrifying. He brought in the German professional model of the academic seminar, inspiring a host of students (the teachers of many generations of Hellenists and Latinists but also historians and philosophers who had taken Mods, the youngest of whom have only recently retired). He showed exceptional mastery not only of all aspects of Latin (including Roman Law) but also - in his most famous work, the 1950 commentary on Aeschylus' Agamemnon - of Greek philology, history and culture. Fraenkel's commitment to the biographical method perfected by Wilamowitz is witnessed by his last great work, Horace (1957). His passion, underpinning but masked by the most rigorous of hard-core philology and exceptional learning, is evidenced in the inspiration expressed by so many scholars' personal accounts and eulogies. It was also, controversially and very topically in the #MeToo moment, witnessed by a number of female students to whom his attentions extended beyond the impersonal passion of scholarship to the inappropriate. Sexual harassment, justified in the 54 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College apologetics of its perpetrators by the cloak of Platonism, is one downside of the \"erotics of pedagogy\", and one reason why we need to assert some distance from the ancestral models we have inherited from an extraordinary and exceptional tradition of learning. G\u00fcthenke's book demonstrates the depths and origins of that tradition more powerfully than any other I know, and in doing so helps us map a path to a less fraught future. Ja Elsner Orphans of the Tide by Struan Murray (Puffin/Penguin, 2020) Please note: this review contains plot spoilers. I have recently been enjoying reading a book called Orphans of the Tide, written by Struan Murray. The plot of the book is that when a whale washes onto a rooftop with a half-wild boy inside it, the people of the City accuse him of being the Enemy, who was the god who drowned the whole world. So they try to kill him. But an inventor named Ellie refuses to believe he is a Vessel of the Enemy, and tries to help him before it's too late, even though the merciless Inquisition (people employed to kill the Enemy before it can leave its Vessel) are determined to destroy her new friend, who is named Seth. It is a thrilling adventure and you are glued to the book until you finish. I love the story and that it shows you how you have to overcome your fears, and not to blame yourself for the inevitable. It is inspiring and would be perfect for nine- to fifteen-year-olds who love fiction and reading about fantasy worlds alike and unalike our own. An amazing page-turner! My favourite part was when Ellie (spoiler alert) gets rid of the Enemy by remembering her real brother, instead of the fake Finn it appeared to her in.

But the Enemy can take possession of any human body, and the ruthless Inquisition are determined to destroy it forever. T o save the boy, Ellie must prove who he really is - even if that means revealing her own dangerous secret . . .The City was built on a sharp mountain that jutted improbably from the sea, and the sea kept trying to claim it back.

His reputation, though, is a contested one. His many fans delight in his capacity to illuminate the history of ideas, his extraordinary range of reference and the distinctive, polished prose in which his thinking is conveyed. His critics, a smaller group, divide into two main camps. Philosophers complain about his lack of precision when it comes to spelling out the practical implications of his thought. Historical scholars accuse him of enlisting the thinkers they cherish in the service of an overarching narrative of Berlin's own devising, and without proper attention to the original texts (as Hardy has discovered, Berlin's citations are often somewhat inaccurate, or in a few cases unsourceable). While I have been drafting this review, mortar shells have been flying back and forth between the two sides in the letters column of the TLS. Into this controversy steps Johnny Lyons, who reviewed Hardy's memoir of Berlin in the last edition of The Pelican Record, and helped to set up the well attended event in Corpus in January in which it featured. Lyons' aim is to recapture Berlin for philosophy. The conventional story is that after a period in which he engaged in the highly analytic style of philosophy practised in Oxford and elsewhere in the 1940s and 1950s, Berlin broke away and turned to the history of ideas, hoping as he put it himself \"to know more at the end of one's life than when one had begun\". Not so, according to Lyons: what happened instead was that Berlin began to do philosophy in a different, more fruitful, more humane form. Repeatedly in the book, aspersions are cast on the way that philosophy is now done in the academic journals: self-referential, pedantic and boring, Lyons thinks. Berlin, in contrast, writes about the human condition, what it means to be a human being. And his central idea is the inescapability of choice. Each person, and each society, has to choose which among the many different possible human values to pursue. And these values unavoidably conflict, so to embrace one means foregoing many others. One cannot embark on a life of religious contemplation while hoping to enjoy worldly success. Nor can a society that values order and tradition also expect to foster individual creativity. When Berlin writes about past figures, his aim is always to understand the opposition between those who accept this truth and those who deny it, by holding to the Enlightenment ideal of a perfect society in which all human values are harmoniously realised. The big puzzle about Berlin has always been how to reconcile this deep commitment to value pluralism with his liberalism. Why is it better for human beings to live in a liberal society, which promotes some values but necessarily excludes others? Lyons addresses this question by putting Berlin into imagined conversation with a number of leading twentieth-century liberals: Richard Rorty, Michael Sandel, Ronald Dworkin, Hilary Putnam and others. Berlin never engaged directly with these thinkers. His philosophical contacts seem mainly to have been with those of his own Oxford generation, such as Stuart Hampshire and Herbert Hart. So what Lyons does, very helpfully, is to show us where he would have disagreed with them, and to suggest why Berlin's own position, even if not watertight, is eminently defensible. One figure barely mentioned, however, is John Rawls (though Lyons does at one point acknowledge the \"sheer brilliance\" of his masterwork, A Theory of Justice). Rawls is now widely regarded as the most influential liberal philosopher of the twentieth century, certainly in the English-speaking world, and it is more than a little curious that Berlin was never inclined to discuss his work in print. For Rawls, too, was committed to value pluralism, at least as concerns personal ideals of the good life. But he believed he could show that people who disagreed profoundly about such questions nevertheless had reason to accept the basic principles of a liberal order - and he was able to lay those principles out. Why was Berlin unwilling to join the many others who hitched a ride on Rawls' wagon? The little evidence that we have (a letter written to Rawls in 1988) suggests that Berlin was more pessimistic than Rawls about finding a general solution to the problem of moral conflict. Rawls' own proposals, he thought, relied on a political culture of toleration found only in a small number of contemporary democracies. One result is that, apart from his very influential lecture-cum-essay of the late 1950s, \"T wo Concepts of Liberty\", Berlin did not leave behind a political philosophy in the sense in which Plato, or Hobbes, or Hegel did. He did not address the questions that political philosophers usually ask: how is political authority to be justified? What is justice? Should the law enforce morality? And so forth. As Lyons shows us, Berlin's contribution is made at the meta-level. For example, he would be quick to point out that the answers given to those same questions will vary from one epoch to the next. Although not a full-blown relativist, he argued repeatedly that the concepts and categories through which human beings made sense of their social world were not invariant, but shifted over time. Lyons claims that one of Berlin's main achievements as a philosopher was to show why studying the history of philosophy was not merely an optional, spare-time activity, but essential to philosophy itself. Although Lyons makes a powerful case that Berlin continued to work as a philosopher even after his post-war break with analytic philosophy, I think he underestimates the strength of political conviction that underlies all of his writing. Lyons says that he is \"the least political political philosopher one can imagine\", but this is the opposite of the truth. His defence of liberalism was always aimed at its twentieth-century totalitarian enemies. As a child he had witnessed at first hand the violence of the Communist revolution in Petrograd, and as a Jew he could hardly fail to respond to the horrors inflicted by the Nazis, who murdered much of his immediate family. So when he castigates philosophers who believe in utopias in which all conflicts of values are overcome, he is also warning us against political movements whose attempts to reach such utopias inevitably culminate in violence and repression. Failure to give due weight to this underlying political agenda can result in misunderstanding Berlin's purpose. For example, Lyons spends some time discussing Berlin's not very successful attempts to get to grips with the famous philosophical problem of free will and determinism. But Berlin's engagement with this problem was really derivative from something else, namely his critique of historical determinism, or as Berlin termed it in the title of one of his essays, \"historical inevitability\" - the idea that history is governed by scientific laws that operate independently of the will of particular human beings. The danger posed by such a form of determinism is that it can be used to justify coercing and oppressing people on the grounds that this is necessary in order to get more quickly to the destination that history is unavoidably leading towards - the classless society, or the rule of the master race. So when Berlin asserts and defends people's freedom to make choices by appeal to common experience, at one level he is indeed challenging determinism in general, but at another he is warning us against ideologies that try to sap our political will by telling us that we have no real choices to make. To quote one of Berlin's particular favourites, Alexander Herzen, \"Do you truly wish to condemn the human brings alive today to the sad role of caryatids supporting a floor for others some day to dance on?\". Lyons makes the best possible case that Berlin never really abandoned philosophy, but instead switched to a different way of doing it. He concedes that Berlin is better at raising fundamental questions than at providing clear answers to them. But he seems not to regret that he turned his back on philosophy as practised in university departments, contributing to academic journals in later years only in the form of brief responses to criticism of his own work. I am more inclined to agree with Hardy that it would have been better had Berlin been \"'challenged earlier and more rigorously\" before he \"gained a celebrity status that protected him from the need fully to engage his critics on their own terms\". Of course, there would have been a cost. We might have had fewer of those effervescent essays in the history of ideas if Berlin had taken more time to reply to the \"logic-choppers\", as Lyons labels them. Values always conflict.

Guest Editor John Watts, Series Editor Mordechai Feingeld (Oxford, 2019) A centenary of a college is an opportunity to show gratitude to the founder, as well as to the first benefactors. Gratitude, especially to someone living half a millennium ago, carries more conviction if accompanied by inquiry into who he was, the world in which he lived and what difference his endowment made. This collection of papers derives from a conference held in Corpus in September 2017, organised by the editor, John Watts; but it is much more than a formal act of quincentenary pietas, for it exemplifies the scholarship that Fox hoped would flourish within his college and outside its walls. The papers presented look outwards to the university, to England, to European scholarship and to a Latin Christendom still, in 1517, undivided, but soon to be split apart by the Reformation. This wider perspective is entirely appropriate: Fox's concern for the university as well as the college is evident in his Statutes, for his Readers in Humanity (Latin), in Greek and in Theology were to lecture to the university, not just the college. John Watts, the editor, and his team are to be congratulated on a major contribution to the early history of the College and the intellectual history of England in the period 1450-1600. Of the eighteen papers, three - those by the late Jeremy Catto on what he calls the Wykehamical tradition in the University, Clive Burgess on secular colleges and David Rundle on the humanist tradition in England and in particular the study of Greek running up to the early sixteenth century - examine how what went before Fox's time illuminates what he was hoping to achieve. Those by Paul Cavill on \"Church, State and Corpus\" in the time of Fox, Joanna Weinberg on the trilingual library, Magnus Williamson on music and William Whyte on \"Building Corpus Christi\" focus on Fox's lifetime. A third and more numerous group comprises papers that are interested in Fox but also look further into the sixteenth century after the Founder's death and, with Antony Grafton, even into the seventeenth. Pamela King discusses Fox's building work at Winchester (more innovative than the college itself) and the theatrical performances connected with the college over a longer period. Susan Brigden examines connections between the college and the City of London and the Court up to the end of Henry VIII's reign; Richard Rex covers Corpus and the early Reformation, namely before the Elizabethan Settlement. Some papers embrace the whole T udor period: Julian Reid discusses the day-to-day life of Corpus in the sixteenth century, a paper complemented by Miri Rubin on Corpus as an emotional community. Lucy Kaufman examines Corpus as a charitable organisation, both charity to its members and, beyond the walls of the college, to the community in and around Oxford. The Elizabethan period is covered by Alexandra Gajda on those members of the college who remained Catholics after the accession of Elizabeth. Antony Grafton on Brian T wyne follows his intellectual history, that of an undergraduate at the end of Elizabeth's reign and the son of a father who had studied at the college at the beginning of the reign. His historical interests owed much to his grandfather, John T wyne, who remembered seeing Fox, already blind, and to Robert Hay, a pioneer researcher in archives, but he was also indebted to one of the principal Corpus Catholics in Gajda's chapter, Myles Windsor. The volume is rounded off by three \"closing remarks\": by Felicity Heal, who gives a bird's-eye view of the contributions, by Diarmaid MacCulloch, who asks what would most have worried the first two presidents, Claymond and Morwent, and, finally, Mordechai Feingold, who links two phases of the sixteenth-century college, those of Vives and John Rainolds. Professor Feingold is the editor of History of Universities, in which Renaissance College is Volume XXXII, and any consideration of the volume as a whole on the part of a member of the College must begin by thanking him for extending the hospitality of his journal. History of Universities has had a special interest in the Renaissance period and adopts an approach to the subject that is the reverse of inward-looking. Placing Corpus in context makes a huge difference to our understanding of what the Founder's Corpus aimed to be and why, as well as helping to keep Corpuscular pride under control, as in Joanna Weinberg's wholly just appreciation of the trilingual library of Erasmus's letter as exhortation thinly disguised as praise. Fox's Statutes for the college show that he was very conscious that he was not the first Bishop of Winchester to found a college in Oxford. Disputes between the President and fellows of the college, if they could not speedily be settled internally, were to go to a triumvirate consisting of the Chancellor, the Warden of New College and the President of Magdalen. Jeremy Catto's paper reveals just how important that Wykehamical lineage was for Corpus and how the tradition bequeathed by the Winchester connection evolved from the late fourteenth century (New College), via the mid-fifteenth century (Magdalen) to the early sixteenth (Corpus). My appreciation of Catto's paper and of the others was shaped by having collaborated with Julian Reid, himself one of the contributors to this volume, in writing a history of the College for the quincentenary. Again and again I found myself saying, \"How I wish I had known that when working on the history\". Much is gained by juxtaposing different essays in the volume. William Whyte on \"Building Corpus Christi\" shows how Fox's original plan for a monastic college has shaped Corpus from that day to this. His three traditions of building - \"the conventional collegiate tradition\", \"the Winchester type\" and \"the monastic college\" - admirably clarifies Fox's original plan and the modest adaptation that was possible after he changed his mind. Clive Burgess's paper on \"Founding a Secular College in Oxford\" does the same for the revised plan for a secular college, noting also that, in modern terms, the secular college, a highly flexible model widely adopted for several functions outside the universities, was anything but secular (Corpus was now principally for the secular clergy rather than, as originally conceived, for an equal mixture 60 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 61 Corpus Christi College of Winchester monks and Winchester clergy). The paper gave me an answer to one question that had long worried me: what careers did Fox think Corpus alumni would enter? Although he and his friend Oldham had studied law and had found it an excellent preparation for the service of the Crown, law as an academic discipline was excluded from Corpus. Burgess's final section on the challenges of being a parish incumbent, especially the elaboration of parish worship, showed just how demanding a career it often was. This, in turn, can be juxtaposed with Magnus Williamson's paper on the musical life of Corpus. He notes the modest scale of the chapel staff, but also the extensive participation of ordinary members of the college on feast days, including Sundays. \"This amounted to 102 days on which the full college attended first and second Vespers, Compline, Matins, Lauds, Prime, the Aspersion and High Mass\" (p.155). One can see why, among the necessary qualifications defined by the Statutes for discipuli (the later scholars), it was laid down that \"they should have some training in plainchant\". Having spent years under this regime would have prepared those who went on to parochial work to manage the extensive musical demands that many parishes, as Burgess shows, placed upon incumbents. Paul Cavill's paper, \"Church, State, and Corpus: The by Diarmaid MacCulloch's \"Closing Remarks II\", with its thoughts on what might well have kept Claymond and Morwent awake at night. Cavill's discussion also focuses on the threats to the College, taking as a start the worries expressed by Christopher Urswick, Fox's friend who, like Fox, had landed with Henry T udor in Milford Haven in 1485. Cavill's threats came from the Crown, from common lawyers and from disgruntled laity, such as the John Huddleston who lost Temple Guiting to the College after his father (possibly) and mother (certainly) had combined with Christopher Urswick, the executor, to make sure it came to Corpus. John Huddleston made repeated efforts to regain the manor, but in vain. Miri Rubin on Corpus as an emotional community can be juxtaposed with Alexandra Gajda on the Corpus Catholics who were extruded from the college and yet continued to have a strong loyalty to it. This juxtaposition is all the more striking when it is remembered that the thirty- year presidency of William Cole, 1568-1598, who was imposed by the same external power that expelled several Catholics among the fellows, saw such bitter disputes within the college that John Rainolds was compelled in 1588 to go into exile in Queen's, commenting six years later that the \"dissensions and factions there [Corpus] did make me so weery of the place\". Close emotional ties make any rift all the more wounding. Susan Brigden's paper on the connections of the college with the City and the Court shows how much many former members of the college needed the services provided by the City, but also the closeness of many of them to Queen Katherine, whose emblem adorns the Hall in Corpus, even during and after the divorce, and to Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, mother of Reginald Pole and of Lord Montague, who was executed in Henry VIII's revenge on the family for Reginald's For the Defence of the Unity of the Church, written against the break with Rome. In 1541 she herself was beheaded. All this should be read alongside Richard Rex's paper on Corpus and the Early Reformation. As he shows, the welcome for Luther in Corpus was confined to a few individuals: the college officers and \"the seven seniors\" (the counterpart to the modern Governing Body) were overwhelmingly Catholic in sympathy. On the other hand, unlike St John's College, Cambridge, with which Corpus had much in common, the Catholic fellows of Corpus kept their heads well below the parapet and, as a result, survived much better. Rex gives special attention to a dossier of complaint sent to Archbishop Cranmer by a group within the college headed by Richard Marshall, the son of a client of Thomas Cromwell and, at that date, very much in sympathy with \"the New Learning\". Rex re-dates the dossier from 1535, the date given by Milne, to 1538 and clarifies the nature of the episode as \"the failed attempt of a small and embattled minority to challenge the prevalent culture of the college\". Most disappeared from the college not long afterwards. Lucy Kaufman's paper on the charitable concerns of the college revealed the efforts of Corpus, along with other colleges, to fill the gap left by the dissolution of monasteries and other religious communities. When working on the history of the college, I was aware of the scale of President Claymond's charitable giving but never conceived the ordinary charity of the college as a continuation of monastic support for the needy. Kaufman juxtaposes this activity with the college's charity to its own members, remembering that, according to the Statutes, no one could be a discipulus if he were well off. I have left David Rundle's paper till last, since it is at the heart of a book entitled Renaissance College. It succeeds in encapsulating a wealth of knowledge about the connections of the college with Erasmus, even down to P .S. Allen's edition of Erasmus's letters, about the study of Greek before and during the foundation of the college, and about many of the early books in its library and elsewhere. When discussing Fox's gift to Corpus of the Latin humanist books of John Shirwood, Fox's predecessor as Bishop of Durham, Rundle repeats the question asked by Allen, \"Why did not Fox secure the Greek books for Corpus as well as the Latin?\" His answer is that, when Fox was Bishop of Durham, he \"was not overly concerned about receiving them\" (the Greek books). This must be right and is confirmed by Fox's statutes for Balliol College, written, like the Corpus statutes, with the advice of Claymond. They too show no concern to promote the study of Greek in the university. To the question of what changed Fox's mind on Greek by the time he composed the statutes for Corpus no definite answer has been given. My suggestion is that it had everything to do with Erasmus's translation of the New Testament into Latin. This we know from a letter of Thomas More to have been read and publicly defended by Fox. Yet what it demonstrated by the differences between its Latin version and that of Jerome's Vulgate was that it was impossible for theology to continue as a serious discipline if theologians did not have the ability to study the New Testament in the original language. For centuries almost all theologians in the Latin West had been content to take the Vulgate as itself the Word of God; now it was evident that, like all translations, it was only an interpretation of the original. The chronology is consistent with this suggestion: the first edition of Erasmus's New Testament was published early in 1516 and the earliest manuscript of the Corpus statutes 62 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 63 Corpus Christi College Bront\u00eb's Mistress by Finola Austin (Atria Books, Simon & Schuster, 2020) What do we ask of historical fiction? With what responsibilities do we invest it to get the past \"right\", and what would it even mean for a work of fiction to do so? Since Walter Scott, Tolstoy and George Eliot, novelists have woven their intrigues through backdrops of real-world events: the better to immerse their readers in a setting distant from their own time and place and to develop a dramatic contrast between the interior and the world-historical. This artistic conceit has survived in the twenty- first century's version of the serialised novel, undergirding (with various degrees of success) television programmes such as Poldark, Gentleman Jack, Downton Abbey and The Crown. Viewers expect such programmes to offer an illusion of \"historical accuracy\", seizing triumphantly upon small lapses in the details of fashion or table manners, or a plastic water bottle left in shot. But in understanding \"history\" in terms of trivia, we miss an opportunity to develop a more expansive, and imaginative, vision of what the past can offer us. Engaging with the past is so often an experience of stretching our brains and our souls, imagining what it might be like to live, think and feel in a manner entirely alien to our own experience. In this light, it matters less whether the period details are perfect but whether the general feel of a work of historical fiction rings true. What does this work say to us about the lives of people who lived in the past? What choices, what forms of feeling, were possible for them? Finola Austin's novel Bront\u00eb's Mistress (Atria Books, 2020) has much to say on these questions. (Full disclosure: Finola is a friend, and I assisted her in some small ways with the research and writing process for this book.) Based on the story of Bront\u00eb brother Branwell's scandalous affair with his older, married employer, Lydia Robinson, the novel is meticulously researched. As the eight-page historical note informs us, Austin has imagined nothing that contradicts the historical record. The only character she has invented from whole cloth is a horse. The period texture of the story is grounded in archival research and in Austin's deeply felt knowledge of Victorian literature, which she studied as a master's student at Corpus. Yet a rehearsal of facts would hardly be enough to draw a reader in. The well-paced narrative arc that Austin crafts, filled with knowing nods to Jane Eyre and Agnes Grey, does offer something to readers looking for Bront\u00eb fan-fiction. But Bront\u00eb's Mistress insistently refuses any risk of being seen as mere \"romance\" or \"chick lit\". Instead, it offers an engrossing and at times painful examination of the inner life of an average early-Victorian upper-middle-class woman, whose opportunities for personal fulfilment have been desperately constrained by the limited choices available to her. Lydia Robinson's fantasies of a more thrilling and meaningful life founder as her daughters and nearly all of the men in her life disappoint her, as her female relations hector her, as she finds herself unable to channel her own artistic and literary ambitions into anything approaching the talent of Branwell Bront\u00eb's sisters, as she loses her faith, as her fears of social ostracisation constrain her ability to imagine truly living unconventionally, and as all these challenges bring out her most grasping, petty and jealous attributes. Lydia is not an easy character to like. At the same time, the story Austin tells through Lydia's voice is a sympathetic one, and one that challenges the reader to imagine how she herself would really cope if faced with Lydia's options. Contemporary historical fiction has often centred on iconoclastic and at times anachronistic figures, who see their way towards a feminism, or another form of progressive, \"modern\" identity politics, that those around them cannot. But for every Charlotte Bront\u00eb or Anne Lister in nineteenth-century West Yorkshire, there were dozens of Lydia Robinsons - and, after all, Lister was a Tory landowner and Bront\u00eb a clergyman's daughter, neither a figure outside of their time. We, too, if we were living in West Yorkshire before the coming of the railway, might long to be loved without knowing how to make ourselves lovable, might fervently hope that our daughters might not make the same mistakes we felt that we ourselves had made, might find that our imaginative horizons extended only as far as the exotic resort of Scarborough. It is an indication of Austin's capabilities as a novelist that this Brooklyn-dwelling millennial who works in digital advertising by day has inhabited so wholly the persona of a middle-aged mother from the provincial landed gentry. Emily Rutherford Finola Austin received a Distinction in her MSt in English Literature from Corpus Christi in 2013, having read Classics & English at Merton from 2009 to 2012. She is an advertising professional, currently living in New York City, where she works for Facebook's Creative Shop. Bront\u00eb's Mistress is her first novel. Emily Rutherford pursued an MPhil in Modern British & European History at Corpus in 2012- 2014. She is a Junior Research Fellow at Merton College, Oxford, where she researches the history of gender and sexuality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Britain. 64 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 65 Corpus Christi College shows that the position of Greek in the college was continuing to be reinforced after the initial foundation. As P .S. Allen wrote, \"after 1516 no competent scholar could be content with anything but the Greek\". If that were true for scholars in general, how much more true was it for a college devoted to advancing a humanist theology and presided over by John Claymond, a humanist theologian. Thomas Charles-EdwardsMagpie Lane by Lucy Atkins (Quercus, 2020) Magpie Lane is a wonderfully adroit swinger between the lowish- brow Oxford tec novel it knowingly masters (or, in this case, mistresses) and a much more high-minded novel, even anti-novel, that its admirably well-managed proceedings gradually uncover. Apt to a fiction all about the unearthing of the covered-up. I say gradually in tribute to Atkins' artful slow-drip of revealing truths about the past of people and place. Suspense is the narrative trick she's very good at - greatly reliant on her canny practice of concealments in plain sight, Jamesian \"Purloined Letter\" style. (Henry James does keep coming to mind here.) On the face of it, the Oxford Detective Novel's familiar tropes are here in full unabashed swagger: one more case of unexpected mayhem, violence even, disrupting the ingrown privileged cosiness of a college stuffed with solipsistic, bitching, gloriously eccentric, even mad, dons. The well-rehearsed scene of many a loving-satirical production by Oxford's alumni and alumnae, of writers like Lucy Atkins in fact. In this one, an ancient college at the foot of Magpie Lane has appointed Nick, thrusting media boss, as its new Master, in hopes he'll bring in the spondulicks from well-heeled benefactors he's assumed to know, assisted by his glam second wife Mariah, a thin-brained cosmopolitan London-based interior designer. High hopes soon smashed up by the shock-horror disappearance of Nick's daughter Felicity, a selectively mute and plainly disturbed eight-year-old. Nick is crazed by memories of the unsolved McCann case. The cops and the media suspect Felicity's new nanny, Dee, jobbed-in by Nick on the spur of a moment's encounter to replace an annoying late let-down. Dee's chance meeting with Nike- wearing nanny-needful Nick is the first thing we're told about. As reported to Dee's police interrogators. Dee is our source of everything - a set of stories eked out in and around the police interrogation that is the book's main stage. An altogether marvellously delayed seepage of dire info. Everybody's squeezed-out back-story is horrific. Nick and Mariah are somehow complicit in that. The Master's lodgings, indeed all of Oxford, are ghosted by very dark doings. Dee's only friend in town, ageing doctoral student Linklater, who's researching the history of the lodgings and making a poor living by timber-shivering Haunted Oxford tours, is the well-schooled guide to past awfulness. He knows what happened in the lodgings' attic priest-hole, so scarily fascinating to a ghosted Felicity. He finds Bodley papers telling of old murder in the lodgings. He likes conducting fearful and fascinated Dee and Felicity round Oxford's many graveyards; walks them down Dead Man's Walk to the remains of the medieval Jewish graveyard. Felicity finds her voice on such occasions. Walking them - and us - in dead men's unhappy footsteps is what this novel does a lot of, bringing polemically home the very unpleasant underground of surface civilisation, not least of civilisation at this novel's overtly shiniest and cleverest. Modernity as a manicured graveyard with the bones of the good, the bad and the morally ugly - especially those - not too far below the surface and insisting on poking though. Or, to take up another of this novel's pushy metaphors, modernity as a scribble in history's margins. Pointedly, the subject of Linklater's never-ending thesis is literary marginalia. And this novel's Oxford is, like Linklater's, a highly literatured place - a reality dug up, raised from the literary dead, to be rewritten, as it were, in the margins of previous writings. Which is a classic feature of the detective genre as such; writing perennially as rewriting, like this one - yet one more visiting of Death at the President's Lodging, as the title of the 1937 Oxford detective story of \"Michael Innes\", i.e. J.I.M. Stewart, Christ Church's English Student (Fellow), put it. Literary redoing; and always of previous macabre stuff, stories of wickedness and crime, which are detective fiction's home ground. Felicity crouches in the priest-hole eating dead bees, like the madman in Dracula who eats flies. The boy that Linklater discovers was murdered in the lodgings was named Duncan, after the royal murderee in Macbeth. Dee's alibi for not kidnapping Felicity is that on the night she disappeared this nanny was in London at a performance of Richard III, canonical fiction about the king whose body is disinterred in a Leicester car-park in one of Linklater's favourite stories. This may be a half-truth, but then she is a nanny replaying the narrative part of the story-telling nanny in Henry James's ghost-story The Turn of the Screw, who is a famously unreliable narrator. The cops think Dee's stories can't be relied on. Dee's hungover totter down St Giles when she mistakenly recalls Hardy writing Jude in the Lamb and Flag and, inspired by sight of a Dracula performance poster at Balliol, crazily imagines Oscar Wilde there when he was engaged to Bram Stoker's future wife, rather proves them right. As does our novel's super surprise ending - which reviewer protocol prevents me from detailing. But, albeit in her comically shaky way, Dee was feeling the force of her reality as literatured (or, as she drunkenly puts it, of \"the whole of English literature\" as \"one big Oxford cocktail party\"). What she is about, drunk or sober, is trying to figure out the inward meaning, the manifestly covert truths, of things (what Henry James - him again - figured in his 1896 nouvelle as \"The Figure in the Carpet\"). It is, for Dee, literally a matter of figures, of numbers. She's conceived, with utter brilliance, as a mathematician (who else would have thought of that? one admiringly thinks): the narrator whose meeting with Nick at the beginning becomes clear, as the novel progresses, as prime indication of Dee's mathematically drilled quest to perceive the truth of the world. She knows the truth of the mysterious \"mathematical bridge\", held together by extreme geometry, on which she bumps into Nick - unlike him, bossy retailer of the fable about Newton's involvement. Soon she's casually indicating she knows what the Fibonacci sequence portends. The family takes in a stray cat named Fibonacci by its dumping owner, a \"schizoid Russian cosmologist\". \"What the...?\" responds bimbo-ish Mariah, looking the name up on 66 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 67 Corpus Christi College 68 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 69 Corpus Christi College Blood Orange by Harriet Tyce (Wildfire, 2019) Please note: this review contains plot spoilers. Blood Orange, Harriet Tyce's debut fiction, a very sharp thriller, chiller even, certainly romps along, heaving its rank package of contemporary degradations with alluring zest. Commanding spiller of these rather mouldy beans is Alison, a London barrister on the rise, chuffed at being assigned the defence in a big murder case, a pleasing career landmark. (The novel comes with a lot of wonderful insider knowledge of the criminal justice system.) Juggling home and career - Alison has a small daughter Miriam and a self-employed porn-addiction counsellor husband Carl to look after - is a hard row to hoe (up-to-the-minute bourgeois angst). She fears the competitive school-gate claque of super-moms has nosed out a certain maternal remissness in her rarely meeting her daughter from school, and all that (carefully applied twitch of a current moral sense, so magnificently residual and tiny). She's utterly complicit in her domestic waywardness. She prefers work and her workplace: excellent for booze and transgressive sex. She's a binge drinker, to the extent of blacking out, falling over, puking all over the place; and much given to sex with influential solicitor Patrick, a long-time fling, who of course puts a lot of work her way. She much prefers the firm's group pub visit to going straight home after work. She keeps finding herself the last one or two in the bar. Preferably with sex after. She knows Patrick is a sexual marauder, a widespread putter-out, but she can't resist him. They keep at it - on her after-hours desk, in the loo on the train returning from a legal job, even in the hall at home when husband and daughter are away. It's never what might be called love- making; it's mere carnality, quick, rough, SM-inclined, degraded and degrading. No matter the piss awash in the train loo as she kneels for a quick pleasuring of his dick. She has to dump her urine-stained Mulberry handbag in the overhead rack, but so what? She looks forward to more gross nooky courtesy of British Rail. She's an altogether orgiastic piss-artist: just a posh version of Viz comic's ghastly boozing sexed-up proles, the Fat Slags. Or, more her kind of reading, she lives knowingly in the shade of E.L. James's Shades of Grey. As she puts it: \"You like it rough, was his mantra and I didn't disagree, a craven Anastasia to his cut-price Christian Grey.\" It's the acclaimed good of \"Mommy Porn\" - as hostile US criticism knows the Shades of Grey fictions. As ethicity goes: rough and ready, and actually pseudo. Heavy sex, of course: affirmed as day-to-day normality in Alison's world. During a heavy- drinking lunchtime consultation, she learns from the woman she's to defend on a charge of murdering her husband that she was the victim of a very practised, persistent wife-hurter. her phone, and amazed by Dee explaining the sequence's accounting for the numerical pattern of leaves and bodies and such: \"Oh my God. Even nannies are geniuses in Oxford.\" This one, certainly; in a town of mathematical geniuses. Dee gets Felicity to colour in a copy of the Penrose tiles outside Oxford's new Mathematical Institute, the ceramics she loves pondering, which pay tribute to Roger Penrose's \"mathematically extraordinary\" discovery of the two rhombus shapes that can fit together for ever. A pattern this child-deprived mother takes as symbol of the unbreakable link between mother and child. It's a mathematical figuring of the truth, which she's all the time trying to work out for herself in a Theorem she fills whole notebooks with. The cops thinks they're a criminal code. Her theorem search is clearly inspired by the entrancing historic search for the solution to Fermat's theorem. (Atkins knows, one assumes, and hopes that Dee does too - though, as James would put it, it's a suggestion only hovering in the air of the story - that, wonderfully pertinent to this novel, Fermat's theorem was a mere jotting in the margin of an arithmetic book and that its solution was a kind of bridgework.) It's important, I take it, that Dee never works her own theorem out. It's unfinished epistemic, hermeneutic business, perhaps unfinishable epistemic, hermeneutic business. And running in parallel to the ongoing unreliability of her narration. Which, of course, bears in on what we should read her talking and writing as mirroring, namely the endeavour of the novel she's in, and indeed of the Novel as such, as represented by the detective genre; the mirroring that criticism knows as self-reflexivity. The practice of so-called anti-novels; of which Henry James's nanny nouvelle is almost a founding member. A key aspect of the profundities, the depths we might say, sounding and resounding through all the lightness of this novel's superficies, the superficial lightness of the mode. Valentine Cunningham Lucy Atkins read English at Corpus, 1987-1990.

Magpie Lane is her fourth novel.70 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 71 Corpus Christi College News of Corpuscles Alison, chucked out by her holier-than-thou husband, who's seeking divorce and child custody on grounds of her drinking and domestic neglect (he's hacked her phone and has been plying her with anonymous u f'ing slag emails), goes unexpectedly back home to find him amusing himself watching the video of her home-sex with Patrick (he filmed it: the house was jammed with suspecting cameras) while enjoying a bout of auto-erotic asphyxiation (titular blood- orange at the ready, sucking which, we learn from the description in the novel's Prologue, brings you round just before death kicks in). Unforgiving, Alison pushes the orange out of reach, and he dies. Revenge is, as the man said, a kind of wild justice. Justice, but only of a sort. It defines the dire endings-up of the novel's two most offensive males. Carl is asphyxiated, hung, to be sure, by his own petard, but tipped over the edge by an understandably vengeful wife. Patrick kills himself, spectacularly, messily, after arrest on a career-ruining charge of rape - ratted on by a pair of his one-time go-for-it women it's hard to be hard-minded about. These deaths contrive a kind of good ending. \"When the bad bleed, then is the tragedy good,\" as Vindice in The Revenger's Tragedy, no less, not unhelpfully put it. As ethical closures go, these are wonky and slurred, alright, but in the novel's morally rotten time might be thought near enough to the real thing to do. Though, showing up their limitation, the real ethical thing briefly crops up. Alison thinks she can't go on mounting a defence of manslaughter for the confessed killer of her abusive husband, when she finds out that the woman is actually innocent and pleading guilty to protect her son, who did it to avenge his abused mother. Professional lawyer principles, the cause of real justice that Alison avows, dictate a resignation. But, on second thoughts, this barrister mother's sympathy for a mother's protection of her child, albeit illegal, untrue and corrupt, supervenes, and she goes into court to argue, successfully, for manslaughter. A considered practice of untruth, which we're invited to admire. So a career of ungood Mommy Porn is made good in the end by the practice of a pragmatic law-undoing Mommy Law? Maybe. If a kind of justice is being done, it's certainly a very wild one. And should unsettle more than the author seems to think.

Various pieces of paper from 1963 have survived the mice in my attic. For instance, here's a note from Mark Sainsbury (1961), our Secretary of Boats in '63 and a useful oar, who had to drop out with a septic hand. He has soldiered on, doing the admin. He writes that he has ordered the guns, has got a vehicle permit for Christ Church Meadow, has had invitation cards printed (sounds very civilised) and has ordered up the Calor gas. Those were the days - teas on the barge, girls in summer frocks, strawberries and cream, and guns along the towpath! My sister used to say she always remembered those wonderful teas on the barge. But she didn't remember seeing any rowing, which rather sums it up. Our guests then were always more important than the crew. \"Life was never better than in 1963.\" I think we can adopt Philip Larkin's sentiment as he had his tutorials at Corpus during the war; and as it was the renowned Freddie Bateson of Corpus, who urged people, \"Come buy!\", when Larkin's The Less Deceived came out. He's like me. Laudator temporis acti. Grumpy Old Men. I remember being anxious that there might be too many chiefs in the boat in 1963, all saying we're doing it wrong. There was rather a lot of talent, and all of it different. Then I, as captain, would have had to sort it out. Fortunately we were fast from day one, which was reassuring, and also very unusual in a Corpus boat. Also, our coaches were from colleges which were in the ascendant at the time - Keble and Oriel. And David Joyce (1957), the grand old man of Corpus rowing, who thought he'd already done his bit for the College after six years at it, had been lured down from Olympus by a risky promise from our stroke, Morcom Lunt (1960), that we were a four-bump crew, if only he would join us. I often think that our characteristic roughness that year, combined with speed, described by Nick Tinne (Keble), after a turn in the boat - \"I don't know how it goes so fast when it feels so bloody rough!\" (words recorded in the captain's log) - arose from all the old lags rowing their own styles regardless. Perhaps that's best. I have a very kind and helpful letter from my predecessor, George Filor (1959), giving me, among other things, contacts with Keble for coaches. He also assures me that any shortcomings in his Finals would not be due to boating, but to the many other distractions of Oxford. We should pin George's assurance up permanently in the boathouse. George was from Belfast. There's a signed Boat Club menu here where one of our guests, Brian Wall (Campion Hall), a Jesuit, has put \"SJ\" after his signature, a standard practice for him no The Bump Supper, 1963 The crew of 1963.

I'm glad we gave him the opportunity to do it. It was a great performance by him in emotionally heightened circumstances, with flying rolls and roast potatoes. I recall a few of his quips. First he apologised for the absence of the Founder, replaced by a framed poster of Mona Lisa, who, he explained, was Corpus's pin-up girl, \"virgo tintacta\", a blend of sauciness and Latin, appropriate to a Corpus Bump Supper. Then he turned to faint praise of the Eight. He told us that he admired what we had done, \"sitting down in our little boat\", but that he himself preferred \"a less sedentary sport\". (Golf, need I say). Thirdly, as we were very fast and caught all four of our opponents soon after the start, his take on that was to say how much he admired our speed and ruthlessness, \"hitting all your opponents below the Gut\". My poor memory of only three minor quips from the speech after 50 years must not be taken as a fair description of it. I certainly dined in the President's chair - the high point of my time at Corpus. I had intended to slip away when we reached High Table. But the President directed me to sit there, and sat down himself on my right. I was hardly in charge - stunned rather. I look stunned in the picture. Forty years on, Sandra Lunt said the trouble with the crew was that dining at High Table on that night spoiled them for life. Morcom would probably say, \"Set 'em up for life more like!\" But she was joking, I think. Brian Harrison in his introduction to Corpuscles said that single events like the 1963 Bump Supper produced an intense interest going far beyond the event itself. Or something like that. A friend asked me if there was anyone famous in the Bump Supper photo. Offhand I trotted out Brough Scott (1961), as I usually do. He's still on TV racing, and still writes columns in The Times. Not bad at our age. But I think people want celebs, and Corpus doesn't do celebs much, do we? I'd better sign off and send this. Not quite Zoom material, but I couldn't resist the chance to browse the old stuff and share it with you. doubt. George, a Protestant, has ringed the \"SJ\" and added \"Please!\". I think George's protest is right, in the circumstances. But how gently such things are done at Corpus! Wall was on the OUBC Committee, ran St Cats BC, trialled for Isis, coached us in 1962 and 1963 and was at our Bump Supper, and was last seen as a university chaplain in Manchester in 2003. He and his family joined Morcom and me and our families, all in our glad rags, in our rooms in Fellows' Building for a \"Charlie's Aunt\"-type bash during Summer VIIIs 1962. I have no fewer than five letters here from CCC Cambridge about us going there for a row that summer, but no result. Of course, I haven't got my letters to them, so I don't know whose fault it was. But I see here from the programme that we both rowed at the Reading Head that term, and they were faster. I also have a note, undated, that our cox was unaware that the Reading course had been shortened due to floods, and that we were seen, still rowing hard, a hundred yards beyond the finish line. It wasn't Richard Wilson (1961). At least, I think it wasn't Richard. Now Morcom tells me it happened the year before, so it definitely wasn't Richard. I also have a note here from the College Vice-President, Michael Brock. He asks about seating at the Bump Supper; he gives me a list of senior members who'd like to attend, and hopes there won't seem too many of them. Five came. But I wonder whose party it was. Why shouldn't they all come? Bump Suppers were pretty rare at Corpus. And surely I wasn't the host, though I did invite our coaches. In fact there's a \"thank you\" letter here from one of our coaches, Rodney Nicholson from Oriel. He says our Bump Supper was much livelier than Oriel's, and puts it down to the rolls and roast potatoes we used as missiles. And my mother writes. She wonders if I should be thanking \"the President, the Dean, or the Bursar\" for the supper, in case I had omitted to do so. Should I have done? Did I? There were only 72 hours from the fourth bump to the Bump Supper. No one cared about schoolsmen needing sleep in those days. It didn't bother Morcom, our stroke. It got him a solid second and an MBE. I myself was working for a tutorial on the T uesday down that quiet far end of the library when I heard a disembodied voice. I realised it was the President running through his speech for the Bump Supper that evening. I grabbed my things and left. All those years and I never knew his office was just through that door. The geography had escaped me. Yet, that was where those dreaded interviews took place when you came up for the entrance exams; entry via Staircase 6, wasn't it? They've knocked it all out now. That quiet end and the mysterious door are gone. A shame, I think. Such places are good for the soul. No wonder people at Corpus nowadays are all stressed and anxious. 76 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 77 Corpus Christi College After lunch, spin doctor Ryan Mamun came on to bowl some crafty turners. Beado said he would drive home immediately if he got out to Mamun, so it came as no surprise to anyone when he was promptly trapped LBW by Corpus's answer to Graeme Swann. Beado departed for a well-made 28. At the other end, standout alum Stuart Jameson (Biochemistry, 1992) was launching the ball to all parts. One memorable blow cleared the sightscreen and brought down some tree. He was well aided by Alex Mason (Ancient and Modern History, 2011), and the pair put on 80. Helped by further cameos from Olly Nicholls and his dad Simon (Law, 1991), the Alumni pushed on past 200 and were waiting for the Jameson century to declare. Brown had other ideas, however, and he ran out Stuart at the non-striker's end for 95. The Alumni had put on 220-6 in 51 overs. It had been a stern test for the bowlers, but freshers Harry Livingstone and Rufus Longsdon had shown that the future was bright for Corpus cricket. Having assured ourselves that it was a batsman's wicket and we were still in with a strong shout, CCCCC got off to a dismal start: Ed Nicolle trapped LBW second ball; Ivor Chipman out soon after. Syren Singh and Oscar Barnes put up a brief resistance, but Syren fell unluckily when a straight drive brushed the bowler and castled the non-striker's end. He had scored a brisk 19 but this was a turning point in the chase. The Nicholls brothers, along with Joe Ball (History and Politics, 2014) and Jonny Mainwaring (Materials Science, 2012), were targeting the stumps mercilessly and batsmen fell like dominos. CCCCC found themselves at 70-6 and staring into the jaws of defeat. David Brown decided to buck this trend of missing the ball. He came in and battered a quick- fire 42, including a sumptuous six over deep square leg. When he fell, Corpus were 121-8 and needed 100 runs to win, with 17 overs and two wickets remaining. Matt Carlton joined skipper Bhardwaj at the crease without much hope. He was yet to reach double figures for Corpus, despite playing over 15 matches for the side. What followed had to be one of the most surprising passages of play in Corpus cricket history since the famous detonation of James Dempsey (52 off 19 against Hughes in 2018 Cuppers). For 15 glorious overs, Bhardwaj played calmly and assuredly at one end while Carlton proceeded to confound all expectations at the other, hitting his first ever six and some strokes he had never even dreamed of executing. Carlton eventually skied one to cover as the universe righted itself, but Corpus were now 211- 9. It had been a 90-run tenth-wicket stand, and CCCCC needed ten to win off eight balls. After Arjun struck a four to end the over, the score stood at 215-9. Corpus needed six off six. Cometh the hour cometh the eleventh man, as none other than Ryan Mamun took guard. He glanced down at paceman Hugo Nicholls and ripped off his helmet to face his first ball. This was matador-esque stuff. Hugo charged in and bowled a well-aimed in-swinger at leg stump. Mamun swung so hard that, had he connected, the ball would have disappeared into the Oxfordshire countryside forever. Yet, this was Ryan's first ball on a tricky pitch and while we all admire the good doctor's ambition, he did not connect on this occasion. As the ball crashed into leg stump, Hugo wheeled away in celebration and Bhardwaj sank to his knees in despair, stranded on 38. It had been a great day out for all and showed that it will take more than a pandemic to stop Corpus cricket. Thanks again to all the CCCCC players and alumni who made the trek to Abingdon. While the match was extraordinary in many ways, one constant in Corpus cricket remained, as Extras top-scored for CCCCC with 43 runs. CCCCC: Ivor Chipman, Ed Nicolle, Oscar Barnes, Syren Singh, Rufus Longsdon, Harry Livingstone, David Brown, Tom Ritter, Arjun Bhardwaj (c), Matt Carlton, Ryan Mamun. Alumni: Jack Beadsworth (c), Kavi Amin, Stuart Maxi Brook-Gandy. 78 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 79 Corpus Christi College The Clock Match 2020 Matt Carlton Venue: Abingdon Vale CC Format: Declaration game with 20 overs after 5:30 Man of the Match: Stuart Jameson CCCCC and the Alumni arrived at Abingdon for the 122nd(ish) Annual Clock Match - organised unofficially at the last minute after the pandemic threw plans into disarray. We were greeted by a pitch that was so green we struggled to find any brown in it. In true Clock Match style, the first ball was bowled at midday, merely an hour after the initial start time. CCCCC had won the toss and had chosen to bowl at a scratch Alumni side. David Brown opened with his right-arm rockets and debutant left-armer Harry Livingstone sent down some vicious in- swingers from the other end. Their testing spell was bravely weathered by Jack Beadsworth (Law, 2015) and Hugo Nicholls, until Livingstone trapped Nicholls LBW to open up his Corpus account. An early lunch was taken after keeper Syren Singh's hands started hurting. Syren (who shall now be known as \"Soft Hands\") was playing his first match as keeper and had not been warned of this side-effect.Deaths ADAMS, Gilbert (Social Studies, 1973). 7 April 2020, aged 92 ALDRICK, Gordon (Foundation Fellow). 28 January 2020 BAMFORD, Pat (Medicine, 1943). 12 July 2020, aged 94 BENNELL, Anthony (Modern History, 1943). 2 February 2020, aged 93 BOULTER, Hugh (Modern History, 1959). 28 June 2020, aged 80 BRAITHWAITE, Anthony (Classics, 1955). 9 December 2018, aged 84 BREDIN, Terence (Classics, 1948). 26 May 2020, aged 90 COX, William (Law, 1951). 30 June 2020, aged 91 DAVIES, David (Theology, 1962). 6 September 2019, aged 80 DORAN, Joseph (Classics, 1949). 4 July 2019, aged 91 DIVERS, Thomas (Classics, 1973). 24 December 2019, aged 68 DYSON, Michael (Classics, 1948). 1 March 2019, aged 90 GILBERT, Dick (Modern History, 1958). 14 May 2020, aged 82 GUY, Robert (Humfry Payne SRF in Classical Archaeology and Art, 1992-1999). 5 July 2020, aged 70 GRIFFIN, James (White's Professor of Moral Philosophy, 1996-2000). 21 November 2019, aged 86 HELLIWELL, Geoffrey (English, 1949). 24 February 2020, aged 90 HOOD, Geoffrey (Chemistry, 1951). 23 January 2020, aged 87 HUGHES, Gerald (Classics, 1952). 14 March 2020, aged 85 JONES, Eldred (English, 1950). 21 March 2020, aged 95 KAY, Samuel (Chemistry, 2004). 4 January 2020, aged 33 KEMP , Roger (Botany, 1953). 9 April 2020, aged 86 MACLENNAN, Keith (Classics, 1959). 24 March 2020, aged 79MANCEY-JONES, Malcolm (Classics and Modern Languages, 1954). 1 June 2020, aged 87 MINERS, Norman (Classics, 1952). 1 May 2020, aged 88 PACKER, James (Classics, 1944). 17 July 2020, aged 94 PARKER, John (Modern Languages, 1949).

His father had various jobs but was latterly an insurance clerk and his mother was a school teacher; they were both Methodists. My grandparents were engaged when my grandfather came back from fighting on the Western Front during the First World War (I have the ring with the date on it) and married in 1919, but they saved up money before starting a family. My father grew up in Chingford. I am told that the house there was named Gorenflos by my grandfather, after a village in the Somme area of France where he found peace before Passchendaele. My grandmother's sister Emma was widowed with two young boys, and to some extent my father grew up not just with his sister Lucy but with his cousins, Ted and John Bastin. An early memory of his, which would date to late 1936, was of watching the Crystal Palace fire, which could be seen for miles around from a local high point. John's son Richard says that, according to his father, the four cousins cycled from Chingford to North Weald airfield to watch the fighter planes during the Battle of Britain. With a school teacher as a mother, Dad could already read when he started at primary school. He got a County Scholarship and attended Bancroft's School in Woodford Green as a day pupil. We don't know much about his time at school but know he avoided sports wherever possible. My brother Paul remembers Dad telling him about a cross-country trial which involved running twice around the school. On the first lap Dad hid in the bushes, and then joined the second lap and managed to come in third, and was picked for the school team. He then either had to run for the school or admit that he had cheated. He chose the second! Outside school he reached Grade 8 on the piano and was a Scout, but never learned to swim. He won a scholarship to read History at Corpus, and went up in 1943 when he wasn't even seventeen. He was unexpectedly called up for military service with the Air Force and did not return to college in autumn 1944. He was still in the UK on training when the war ended in 1945, but then spent his two years of military service in India, where he worked as a meteorologist. It was not surprising that he was assigned to something using his brain, as he was never very practical. He returned to Corpus in 1947 and took Finals in 1949 and a BLitt in 1950, which was about the role of Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) in India - an area he continued to research into over the years. Corpus remained important to my father and he was a conscientious Gaudy attender. In fact, his last overnight trip was when I arranged to take him to a Corpus Gaudy in June 2016.After university, he made some efforts to embark on an academic career, but this came to nothing. He said he joined the Civil Service in 1952, the same year as the Queen ascended to the throne. He joined the Air Ministry, was involved at the start of what was called the \"Small Ministry of Defence\" and then spent the rest of his career in the merged Ministry of Defence, apart from a secondment to the Institute of Strategic Studies in the 1970s - which I found memorable, as it was difficult to say. He didn't talk much about his work. I know he was at one point a resident/duty clerk, which involved staying overnight in the flat on the Air Ministry roof, where one of his Corpus friends remembers visiting him. He was involved in the Cyprus settlement around 1960, was Head of T raining at the MOD in the 1970s and was involved in the Tornado programme, which involved trips to Munich. Before he got married to Joan, he lived in a flat in Battersea. He wrote articles for History Today. He went on holidays with his sister and with university friends and was a volunteer walk leader with the Holiday Fellowship. My parents met through the 1957 Society, which was a graduate society in London which organised cultural outings. They made many friends through this group, some of whom were to become a major part of their circle of friends for the next forty years. My father invited my mother to the opera, and opera remained a shared passion for them; after decades on the waiting list, they became members of Glyndebourne after they moved to Chichester. My parents were married in December 1964 at St Mary's, Cadogan Street and bought a family home in Weybridge. My father's father, I'm told, was around to hear of the engagement (he was reported to be surprised but pleased - my father being 37), but died before the wedding. My parents' first child was stillborn, and then I came along in 1966 and Paul in 1969. They moved to Walton-on-Thames in 1970. Outside work, when we were growing up, my father was an active member of the Royal Asiatic Society and he wrote articles and book reviews for its journal from 1952 to 2010; he was very proud when they published his book The Making of Arthur Wellesley in 1997. The Army Records Society published his The Maratha War Papers of Arthur Wellesley: January to December 1803 in 1999. He retired from full-time work in 1987 but spent the next five years working part-time for the historical branch in the Ministry of Defence, when he wrote the official history (sadly not published) of Dennis Healey's time as Defence Secretary between 1964 and 1970. After he retired completely, my parents moved to Chichester, buying their home in March Square in 1994 and becoming friends of the Art Gallery at Pallant House and of Chichester theatre. After about 2010 they were not able to go as far - though they were still regular visitors to the local West Dean Gardens until my mother's death in 2017; and we continued to take Dad there, with the last photos of him being from my visit with him there in September last year and Paul's in October. O'Donelan Bredin, our father, died peacefully in May 2020 at his long-term care home in Toronto. Predeceased by his father Edward Robert Bredin and his mother, Lucy Marion Bredin (Ross Lewin), Terence was born in the village of Ulcombe in Kent. He was a triplet but, of the three, only he and his dear brother, Robin Hugh Noble Bredin, survived the birth. He was also predeceased by Robin and his older brother Rodney. He was a keen student from a young age and attended Harrow School and then later Corpus Christi College, Oxford, graduating in 1951 with a degree in Classics. After that he spent his National Service as a Second Lieutenant in the Essex Regiment, training with the Royal Fusiliers, which at the time - to his great excitement - was based in the Tower of London. He was then shipped out to Korea with his regiment, but by the time they had arrived by boat the war had ended. He went on to teach briefly in pre-apartheid South Africa and while he loved his time there, he could not condone the political situation and returned to England. The Canadian chapter of Terence's life began in 1959 when he took up a teaching post at Upper Canada College in Toronto - or \"Avenue Road Collegiate\" as he sometimes liked to call it. This was to be the making of him professionally and the beginning of 36 happy years of teaching in the senior school. He loved teaching Latin and Ancient Greek to his students. He also loved coaching: rugby and cricket and downhill skiing, despite not being able to ski himself. He was a great proponent of the value of learning Latin at any age and believed that having a background in Classics was the way to a richer and more laterally connected life. It was a dark day for him when Latin was superseded by computer science as a mandatory subject for Grade Nine students but Latin did not die and, by then anyway, his reputation as a fine and inspiring - if somewhat eccentric - teacher was cemented and he remained happily as the \"Head of the Classics Department of One\", and latterly Senior Master, until his retirement in 1995. He was to make many life-long friends of students - Old Boys - faculty and staff over the years he spent at U.C.C., and not long after he had arrived he was also to meet our mother, Elizabeth (Ben) James, of Port Hope, Ontario, who was working as a helper to the school nurse at the time, Miss Bee. He knew our mother was his perfect match when they discovered that each of their fathers was missing an arm - a farming accident in one case and a fall from a crowded railway platform during WWI (our father's father) the other. He remembered that our mother's parents were not as certain about the match and rather regarded him as \"something the cat might have dragged in\", this Englishman with a terrible case of five o'clock shadow come to whisk away one of Port Hope's beauties. My father's life was filled to the brim with a rewarding job and then a lovely wife and three children, Mary, Robin and Helen. As different as our parents were in personality, they shared a love of the arts, especially theatre, opera and Tafelmusik, helping in the community, going to church, time at the Schoolhouse in Orton and travelling - especially a year-long sabbatical in Ireland in 1975 (all of the family travelling far and wide in Europe in a VW bus). His favourite hobby was reading, but he enjoyed cross-country skiing, picnics, the radio and going to the movies on Friday nights. All of which they found more time for when he had retired. My father's deep dedication to our mother was demonstrated in his care of her over the course of ten years as she succumbed to dementia. This was at a great personal cost and there was a time when we thought we might also have lost him but, with great fortitude and the help of family and old friends, many from U.C.C. and Christ Church Deer Park, he returned to the crease, almost as good as new. The balm of his favourite poetry, books and his faith, which had seen him through the early loss of his dear brothers and mother, helped him again. Although adjusting to life in a retirement home without our mother - his wife of 48 years - who died in 2008, his zest for life returned and he became busy reconnecting with friends, holding Latin appreciation classes, teaching bridge, lunching with the Oxford and Cambridge Society (and making new friends at these occasions), making trips to New York for Oxford reunions, taking up numerous kind invitations from U.C.C to say a Latin grace at a special event (and occasional translation work), swimming on the weekends with Rory, one of his grandsons, and travelling to England to see his youngest daughter and English son-in-law Jim Drury and his granddaughter Lucy. In England he always visited his favourite old haunts and met with his English cousins on both sides of the family. He indulged his passion for ancient churches, historic buildings, interesting ruins and visits to the pub with his son-in-law, where they mutually appreciated English beer. He will be remembered as a walking dictionary, with a photographic memory, wry sense of humour and brio. Five years ago, Terence suffered a series of strokes. He was no longer the raconteur of old but was brave and dignified until the end. There were still happy times, his youngest grandchildren Vivian and Julian now on the scene. Visits with them were a highlight of this part of his life. Even in decline he made new friends, with a crew of very caring professional therapists who came to massage, exercise with him, read to him and show him videos of Winston Churchill and Harrow- on-the-Hill. Even then they said that they enjoyed his company, could tell he had been a teacher and had learned something from him. Old friends - often dedicated former students - visited and felt that his character still shone through in a look, smile or brief wry comment. He made his last trip to Upper Canada College in November 2019 for the former teachers and staff lunch. Four weeks before he died, ill with pneumonia, as his nurse adjusted his oxygen supply, he told her, \"Don't worry, I'm not ill\". He recovered from pneumonia but was now very frail with a bad heart and finally, peacefully, on the evening of 26 May he was bowled out. He had enjoyed a very good innings and leaves many dedicated supporters. T erentius, rara avis ave atque vale! Mary Bredin 84 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 85 Corpus Christi College Hugh Boulter 1940-2020 My husband, Hugh Boulter, who has died aged 80 of a heart attack, dedicated his life to understanding and promoting his belief that God unites people by speaking through his spirit. His early teaching and administrative career gave him practical experience of how to achieve multicultural integration. His work within the charity sector took him to North Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, where he built upon his interest in Islam. Hugh was born in the village of St Bees, Cumbria, in the schoolhouse at St Bees school, where his father, the Revd John Boulter, was headteacher and his mother, Joy Thorn, a matron. Hugh attended the school himself and went on to study history at Corpus in 1959. His lifelong interest and work on multicultural understanding, and especially the relationship between Christianity and Islam, was initiated by early discussions with his uncle Arnold Toynbee, the historian. Hugh's taste for travel and exploring other cultures had begun, and he taught for three years in eastern Nigeria, becoming a headteacher at the age of 25. It was at Easter in 1966 when we met in his father's church, St Peter's, Sawrey, while I was staying on Windermere. T wo years later we got married; by that time Hugh was teaching the children of immigrants, mainly from the Pakistani and Sikh communities, in Huddersfield. In 1969 we moved to Slough and Hugh became an education officer in charge of primary schools and then finance. Our two boys were born there: Jonathan in 1969 and Adam in 1971. We ran two large holiday projects in 1970-1971 to help immigrant children integrate into the community, and Hugh chaired the National Association for Multiracial Education from 1977 until 1980. That year he moved into the charity sector and became director of the Parents' National Education Union (PNEU, now known as the World-wide Education Service), travelling to more than 40 countries helping to support educational projects. As a trustee of Embrace the Middle East (formerly BibleLands) and Wells for India, he also visited Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and Rajasthan. After leaving the PNEU in 1988 he underwent a period of reflection to consider what he wanted to do next. One day in 1996 he announced that he had decided to do a PhD in theology. His thesis, \"The Spirit in Islam\", which he completed at Bristol University in 2003, reflected on the Muslim understanding of the Christian concept of the Holy Spirit. Hugh went up to Corpus following a \"gap year\" at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, USA, which had been arranged by his uncle Arnold. He just missed being called up for National Service, being born on 1 January 1940, but many of his friends at Corpus had served, including Ben Kerwood, who remained a lifelong friend of us both. We spent nearly every Christmas together and also many holidays. We all enjoyed natural history and spent many happy hours birdwatching, identifying wildflowers and watercolour painting. They both studied History at Oxford and a story Hugh was fond of telling was of an early seminar when he had the audacity to ask Michael Brock what he thought of the matter under discussion. The rapier reply came back, \"I'm not interested in what I think, I am interested in what you think, Mr. Boulter.\" Oxford was very different from school, and he never forgot, integrating this attitude into his own teaching with its attention to student thinking. Another profound influence was the Chaplain, John Baker, who went on to publish The Foolishness of God in 1970. For Hugh, John Baker's sermons opened his mind theologically to the immense possibilities of Christian dialogue with issues of crucial importance, a theme that was to run through his life and culminate with his work on Muslim/Christian dialogue. Some years into his career and marriage he started to attend Gaudies and meet old friends: Steven and Jenny Maslen, John Collins, Francis and Rosemary Cazalet, Nick Richter, David Dominy and John Sale. Corpus became an even more important part of his life when he started his PhD at Bristol. He used the Bodleian Libray for reference, as some of the texts for his interfaith study were in French and only housed there. We started to attend seminars for Corpus alumni together. We attended the wonderful Quincentenary Ball in 2017, and sat at a table with a few contemporaries, including John and Diana Kinder and Nighat Afzal, with whom Hugh had played cricket for the College. Nighat was accompanied by his daughter, Naheda, who also went to Corpus. In 2018 Sarah Salter, a good friend and Head of Alumni Relations, helped us arrange a lunch at Corpus with the Clothworkers' Company Court, when I was the first lady Master for a year. Subsequently we gave a small gift to the Library to repair a fifteenth-century bible and conserve three early botanical texts containing pressed flowers. Hugh is survived by me, Adam and five grandchildren. Jonathan died in 2008.

He was 91. Mr. Cox was among a group of MPs who won seats in the 1968 election and were to make their mark on the Bermudian political landscape in the following decades. The 1968 election is widely considered the beginning of the modern political system in Bermuda. Mr. Cox, widely known as Bill, served as a United Bermuda Party MP in Devonshire South from 1968 to 1976, and again from 1980 until his retirement in 1993. He also served as Minister of Education. Writing in the book Seeking Truth, he said of his time as an MP: \"I put the National T rust Act 1971 through the House of Assembly and sponsored a few Private Bills including daylight saving time, decriminalisation of homosexuality and the abolition of capital punishment. The latter two were defeated, but subsequently have been passed.\" He also tabled a motion in 1974 for leaner penalties for minor drug offences. Mr. Cox was educated at Saltus Grammar School and from 1943 onwards at T rinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario. In Seeking Truth, he wrote: \"By 1943, the threat of Nazi U-boats had abated ... I was one of 16 boys and girls who in September boarded a small freighter, Fort Amherst, that plied Bermuda-New York. We were given life jackets and there were other precautions in case we were torpedoed. Those of us destined for TCS went by train to Port Hope. We stayed in Canada during Christmas and Easter school vacations until the war was over.\" Mr. Cox earned a bachelor of arts degree, with a major in history, at T rinity College, University of Toronto, in 1951. A keen sportsman, he played on the T rinity College soccer team, serving as its captain during his last year at the school. While in Canada, he volunteered for the Canadian army. He wrote: \"One had to be fit, join for at least two years, attend parades during term time and spend at least 16 weeks each summer in army camp. I have a Commission as Lieutenant in the Canadian Army signed by Alexander of T unis who was Governor General at the time.\" Mr. Cox was Bermuda's Rhodes Scholar in 1951. He attended Corpus Christi College at Oxford University, graduating in 1953 with a degree in jurisprudence. He was later called to the English Bar. He wrote that he occasionally played on the Corpus soccer team, but his primary athletic interest was rowing, and he was in the Corpus first eight during his two years there.Returning to the island, Mr. Cox was called to the Bermuda Bar in 1956. He worked at the Bank of Bermuda and later at law firm Appleby Spurling & Kempe before going into partnership with his second cousin, David Wilkinson, to establish the firm Cox & Wilkinson, now Cox Hallett Wilkinson. In 1970, Mr. Cox became honorary consul for the Netherlands in Bermuda, serving in the position for more than 20 years. Upon his retirement, he was made a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. He is survived by his wife Rosanna, children Diana, David, Sarah and Amanda, and stepchildren Tara, Rufus and Henry. \u00a9 The Royal Gazette, Bermuda, 4 September 2020 Joseph Doran 1928-2020 Joseph Doran, who died on 4 July 2019, was a good, gentle man whose family and faith were the most important things to him. He was born on 14 March 1928 in Preston, where his parents owned a small corner shop, and went to Preston Catholic College, showing particular ability in classical languages. In time he gained a scholarship to read Classics at Manchester University in 1946-1949, and while at Manchester he met his future wife, Maureen Smith, who says that she first noticed him due to his Latin marks, which were just as good as hers. After his degree at Manchester, Joseph went up to read Greats at Corpus, a place for which he maintained a great affection all his life. During his time at Corpus he developed his lifelong passion for bridge, playing on the University team and beating Cambridge, and in later life he liked to try to scandalise his grandchildren by recounting the story of how he was caught in his college rooms with four women, before revealing they were in fact a ladies' bridge team. After university, Joseph did National Service in the RAF , based at Lyneham in Wiltshire. During this time he married Maureen, on 6 August 1953, and they had a son in May the next year. Joseph enjoyed his service in the RAF but, as they were not recruiting, he had to find work elsewhere when his time there came to an end, and he found a job at the National Coal Board in Bolsover in Derbyshire. He and his family therefore moved to Chesterfield in 1957 and over the next eight years he and Maureen had three more children - all daughters. They then all relocated to Middlesbrough when, due to cuts in the coal industry, Joseph moved to work for an engineering firm called Head Wrightson on Teesside. He remained there until he was headhunted to be personnel director of a company called Tioxide International, where he worked until he retired on his 62nd birthday in 1990, moving with Maureen to a bigger house in Barton in North Yorkshire so that family could come to visit easily. They remained in Barton until 2015 when they moved to Knutsford to live in a more suitable flat.90 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 91 Corpus Christi College In retirement, Joseph kept up his bridge and worked as a volunteer ambulance driver for several years. He was a fearless driver and delighted in the fact that he had never taken a driving test - how this happened is unclear, but he always maintained that this was the truth. When he took his family to Rome in 1975, he drove the whole way there from England - not an easy task and, indeed, driving in Rome through the Italian traffic was the only time he was ever heard to swear. He and Maureen also took up cruising in retirement, travelling around the Mediterranean, to the Canaries and up the west coast of Canada, to name but a few of their adventures. In 2000 he organised an en masse family trip to Rome for the Holy Year, with 20 family members going in total (including 11 grandchildren) - an event which all of us remember very fondly indeed and which gave Joseph great satisfaction. Joseph was a highly intelligent man, once commended by the publishers of The Listener crossword for consistently sending in correct answers, despite never having the good luck to win the weekly prize. He retained a deep love for his classical studies and always enjoyed reminiscing about them, proud that two of his children and four of his grandchildren carried on in his footsteps to read Classics at university. He was also an accomplished musician - in particular on the organ - and wherever he lived, he put in sterling work as a church organist. He was a traditional man in terms of faith, attending Mass with Maureen daily and supporting the Old Rite Mass whenever possible. He was a devoted husband for nearly 66 years and loved his family in a quiet, understated way, showing his love in what he did for us and always doing whatever he could do. He is very much missed. Caitlin Spencer Dick Gilbert 1937-2020 Dick Gilbert, who has died aged 82 after a 12-year decline into vascular dementia, was a long-time BBC journalist, lifetime jazz fan and lover of pubs and a flutter on horse racing. His friends all recognised a mischievous streak in him, the quality Sir Hugh Greene, director- general of the BBC in the 1960s, insisted every true journalist should have, evident in a mean impersonation of Groucho Marx on the prowl whenever a cigar was to hand. Gilbert joined the BBC in 1963 as a radio producer in what was then known as Overseas Regional Services. He moved from there to Radio 4, where he showed unusual versatility by producing a range of totally different broadcasters, from Marghanita Laski to Kenny Everett, and documentary programmes, notably Start the Week and the arts programme Kaleidoscope. Later he moved to The Listener, where he was deputy editor in its final years of publication. He then switched to BBC Information Services as head of corporate publicity up until his retirement. A BBC colleague noted of Dick as a journalist that he had \"a mole's ear for the quirky revelation, the compelling oddities, the tantalising tangents of life\". The compelling oddities were in evidence in the contrasts he found in Los Angeles when he spent a year before joining the BBC as a teaching assistant filling the gaps in a basic course in Western Civilisation at UCLA, California. This experience he distilled in a book, City of Angels, much of it still relevant today, 60 years later. Gilbert was born in 1937, the son of Bertram Gilbert, a dentist, and Olga Davidson, homemaker. His grandfather, Simon Gelberg (1869-1946), was a native East Ender and journalist who became deputy editor of The Jewish Chronicle and was famously the last newspaperman to interview Gladstone. It was from his grandfather, who was active in Liberal Party politics, that Gilbert inherited his abiding interest in the political world of campaigning and protest. One of the last of his generation to do National Service, he took part, taking time out from the Russian course he was on and wearing his RAF uniform, in the November 1956 anti-Suez demonstration in T rafalgar Square. Other demonstrations were to follow. His year at UCLA was one of ferment, sandwiched between the Soviet Union's resumption of atmospheric nuclear tests and the revelation that Russian missiles were sited in Cuba. He would later, at Oxford University, take his keen interest in politics into the anti-nuclear CND demonstrations and Aldermaston marches, at their height at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s. Gilbert was educated as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School in Sussex and came to Corpus in 1958, leaving in 1961 with a first in Modern History. At Midhurst, John Gittings (1958), a fellow Midhurstian who joined him at Corpus, recalled \"the fastest talker I knew who, impressively, read The New Statesman\". He also remembered that in the sixth form Gilbert had enjoyed an opportunity to act at Shepperton Studios as the understudy to the boy star in a Carol Reed film, A Kid for Two Farthings, and had spotted from a distance both Laurence Olivier and Margaret Rutherford. Gilbert's main and abiding passion, however, was jazz in all its forms, but mainly the jazz he heard from the marching bands in New Orleans and in Preservation Hall, which had been set up to keep alive the pure New Orleans style in the city only a year before his arrival at UCLA. He rode the UK trad jazz boom of the late 1950s and 1960s at the Carfax Assembly Rooms in Oxford and in the 100 Club on Oxford Street and the Marquee in Soho, discovering and getting to know groups such as the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, billed as \"Britain's zaniest trad band\", before they became generally popular. He wrote about these bands as a freelance journalist and doubled as a travel writer as a marginally profitable sideline. \"Not a day went by without listening to jazz with a glass of Scotch in his hand,\" his wife Nikki testifies. Dick Gilbert married Nicholette, nee Hicks, in 1974. She danced on the stage and ran ballet and creative music classes for young children from their home in North London and at schools in Hampstead, St John's Wood and Stanmore, Middlesex. She survives him, as do their two sons, Ben and Sam, and a younger brother, Chris. John Aeberhard 92 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 93 Corpus Christi College James Griffin 1933-2019 James Griffin, Emeritus White's Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Oxford, was one of the outstanding moral philosophers of his generation. His writings, which are influential not only in philosophy but also among economists, political theorists and jurisprudents, explore with clarity, rigour and wisdom some of the deepest questions of human value and morality. James Patrick Griffin was born on 8 July 1933 in Wallingford, Connecticut, the son of a successful businessman. At Yale he began as a student of literature before changing direction after attending an introductory course in philosophy. The Yale philosophical curriculum was relentlessly historical, with many of the philosophical \"isms\" being represented by individual members of the department. As Gilbert Ryle - Griffin's first Oxford supervisor - was to put it, Yale subscribed to \"the zoo-theory of teaching philosophy - one of each species\". In 1955 Griffin came to Corpus on a Rhodes Scholarship. His contribution to Brian Harrison's Corpuscles humorously describes the culture shock that, as an affluent American, he encountered at Corpus, a place where play seemed far better organised than work, and which was still in the grip of post-war economic austerity characterised by an occlusion of light (and the lack of other amenities): I seem to have spent a lot of time complaining about this and that and always coming off worse. My room was too dimly lit (I am not sure I had ever encountered such low wattage light bulbs before). \"You Americans use too much light - bad for the eyes,\" the Manciple replied, peering at me through lenses as thick as the bottom of Coca-Cola bottles. By contrast with Yale, Griffin's graduate studies at Oxford were in the analytical vein characteristic of that illustrious period. Taught by an array of stars, including Iris Murdoch, he learned most from David Pears and his thesis supervisor Brian McGuinness. His thesis on Wittgenstein's logical atomism, which was published by OUP in 1964, is a canonical work of Wittgenstein scholarship. In the mid-1960s Griffin's interests gradually shifted away from metaphysics and philosophical logic towards ethics and, specifically, to the rehabilitation of utilitarianism. He never believed that utilitarianism was entirely correct as a moral theory, but he was convinced that its subtlety and power had been grossly underestimated even by its most powerful contemporary critics. Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance (OUP , 1986), arguably his richest and most influential work, was the fruit of that original conviction. This book powerfully revived the ancient idea that ethical thought must have at its core a conception of human well-being, of what it is for humans to flourish. It decisively rejected purely experiential accounts of well-being, such as hedonism which identified the good with pleasurable experiences. At the core of a good life are not just experiences, however pleasurable, but valuable forms of engagement with the world and its inhabitants. Neither could the good be straightforwardly equated with the satisfaction of desires, since these may be ill-informed. Correcting them for errors of logic and empirical fact will not suffice, since very perverse desires could survive such correction, e.g. the desire to count blades of grass in college quadrangles. Instead, the relevant desires must be those formed in the light of a correct appreciation of their objects. But such an appreciation is one that appraises its objects in terms of certain values. Desire, then, is not the foundation of human good, as many philosophers and economists believe, but is at most co-ordinate with it. Griffin thought that the substance of a sound theory of well-being consisted in a list of values that make life go well, all of them distinct and irreducible: accomplishment, autonomy, liberty, understanding, enjoyment and deep personal relations. It was a central task for philosophy to elucidate the nature of these values. Moreover, like Aristotle, he believed that any adequate elucidation would falsify the idea that there is a vast chasm between what makes a person's life go well and the moral requirements that bear on them. Practical reasoning does not confront, as Henry Sidgwick thought, a debilitating dualism of self-interest and morality. In Well-Being Griffin drew out the moral implications of this account of well-being in a direction that was friendly to the utilitarian idea that the maximisation of the good is the fundamental principle of morality. By the time he wrote Value Judgement: Improving our Ethical Beliefs, a slim and elegant volume published in 1996, he had abandoned his former utilitarian sympathies. Utilitarianism, and consequentialism generally, was charged with insensitivity to both the inherent partiality of a good human life and the unfeasibility of large-scale calculations of overall welfare. It required excessive sacrifices of our personal well-being and made unrealistic demands on our cognitive powers. In short, it failed to respect the maxim that \"ought\" implies \"can\". Similar difficulties beset deontology and virtue ethics, the two other main \"schools\" in contemporary ethics. Instead, Griffin called for a more modest and piecemeal approach to morality, one that rooted moral norms in the human good, the nature of agents and the constraints on what social arrangements can realistically deliver. Morality, on this view, is essentially a set of standards enabling creatures like us to live a worthwhile life in a stable social environment while respecting the interests of others engaged in the same endeavour. This contrasted with what he saw as the unrealistic \"Newtonian\" ambitions of modern moral philosophy, especially the desire to impose total order on ethical thought by imitating the reductive and systematising tendencies of natural science. Many of these ideas about the illusory ambitions of theory in ethics were pursued again in a subsequent volume entitled What Can Philosophy Contribute to Ethics? (OUP , 2015), which is notable, among other things, for its insightful engagement with Griffin's predecessor in the White's Chair, Bernard 94 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 95 Corpus Christi College Williams. While agreeing with Williams' scepticism about systematisation, Griffin believed that his anti-objectivism about values yielded an impoverished view of our capacities for critical reflection. Scepticism about ethical theory, for Griffin, did not extend to scepticism about objective ethical truth. Griffin pursued this bottom-up, piecemeal approach to ethics through an in-depth investigation of human rights in On Human Rights (OUP , 2008), a book with a strong claim to be the leading philosophical discussion of human rights in the last seventy years. What mainly concerned him, in a political climate in which conflicting claims about human rights proliferate without end, was the elaboration of a criterion for determining whether or not something is a genuine human right. Key to understanding the book is the following diagnosis of our contemporary rights discourse: \"It is a great, but now common mistake, to think that, because we see rights as especially important in morality, we must make everything especially important in morality into a right.\" Griffin's answer to the question of what it is for something to be a human right, which he developed with analytical rigour and historical sensitivity, sought a via media between two broadly opposed philosophical camps. He believed that human rights were grounded in our status as persons and the dignity inherent in this status. But, unlike deontological theorists who share this idea, he held that personhood had to be understood in terms of basic human interests. Yet he also departed from standard interest-based accounts of human rights by restricting the personhood interests capable of generating rights to only two. These were our interests in autonomy (the capacity to choose a valued way of life from a range of options) and in liberty (the capacity to pursue those choices unimpeded). This conciliatory, dialectical approach was a pronounced feature of his work more generally, and one of the many ways in which he resembled John Stuart Mill. The resulting theory of human rights is a powerful antidote to the intellectual laxity with which even philosophers, but especially lawyers and political activists (two substantially overlapping groups), often deploy that notion. A tall and distinguished-looking figure (the movie star, Gregory Peck, was a cousin), supremely reasonable, tolerant and kind, Griffin commanded affection and respect well beyond philosophical circles for his wisdom and taste. He was revered by his graduate students, who found in him a generous and supportive mentor, one who felt no urge to foist his personality on them or press them into discipleship. He had the gift of being able to convey the importance of philosophical inquiry, but also the exhilarating sense that progress was possible and that anyone, whatever their status or experience in the discipline, might contribute to it. He brought this spirit of open inquiry to the graduate seminars he conducted with Joseph Raz in the early 1990s, a highlight of Oxford moral philosophy at that period.He had a keen interest in architecture and the visual arts, and played an important role in raising funds and commissioning architects for several buildings in Oxford, including the MBI Al Jaber Building at Corpus. His last philosophical project, on which he was still at work until near the very end of his life, was a book on the philosophy of painting that explored the ways in which various approaches to that art rested on often flawed philosophical ideas about value, reality and perception. For Griffin a key element of human flourishing was \"deep personal relations\", and his own life was marked by great success as a friend, teacher, colleague, husband and father. Above all, for 27 years he enjoyed a wonderfully happy marriage to Catherine Maude Halban, daughter of the nuclear physicist Hans von Halban. Soon after her death in 1993, at the tragically young age of 53, he stood unsuccessfully for the Wardenship of Keble College, Oxford, where he had been a tutorial fellow since 1966. He was in retrospect glad of that outcome, attributing his interest in the post to a longing for \"the human\" in the wake of Catherine's death. Griffin was elected in 1996 to the White's Chair of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, taking up a fellowship at Corpus Christi, the college where he began his Oxford career. After retirement, he held permanent visiting posts in the philosophy departments at the Australian National University and Rutgers University. He also received numerous honours that paid tribute to an illustrious philosophical career, including a Festschrift, Well-Being and Morality: Essays in Honour of James Griffin (OUP , 2000), edited by his former students Roger Crisp and Brad Hooker. There are moral philosophers who rise to fame without writing anything that suggests exceptional practical wisdom. Griffin's work was not like that. In an age in which academic fashion celebrates technique over judgement, his writing stood out as imbued with the deep, and deeply humane, moral sense that he exhibited in everyday life. David Hume famously enjoined: \"Be a philosopher, but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.\" This Griffin certainly achieved. But even more remarkably, he erased the contrast implicit in Hume's injunction, for he was also a man in and through his philosophy. James Griffin died on 21 November 2019. He is survived by his two children, Nicholas, a QC, and Jessica, a consultant psychiatrist, and by his grandchildren Isabel, George and Kate. John T asioulasThe Pelican Record 2020 97 Corpus Christi College 96 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College Robert Guy 1949-2020 The study of Greek vase-painting has taken, in the wake of Sir John Beazley's oeuvre, a series of new directions resulting in a considerable expansion of its relevance. Since the bequest of his archive to Oxford University, and its accessibility online through the Beazley Archive, scholars and students have now a unique instrument with which to explore and understand Greek vase- painting much better. Robert Guy was one of the most competent and accurate followers of Beazley, in terms of his knowledge of vase-painting. Attributions today are not so much \u00e0 la mode, perhaps due to the difficulty of the exercise and the extended effort it requires. Guy made such an effort, in a brilliant and exceptional way. He had an excellent eye, a real sense for the style of drawing and an immense visual memory, all of which allowed him not only to be at home in Beazley's lists, but also to improve them by integrating new material. Born in Cobourg, Ontario, in 1949, John Robert Guy studied at Queen's University, Kingston in 1968-1972. He then went to Cincinnati for his Master in Classics, completing a thesis on the T riptolemos Painter under the direction of Cedric Boulter, who awakened his passion for Greek vase-painting (1972-1974). After a year in Greece as a regular member at the American School of Classical Studies, with Alan Shapiro among others (1974-1975), he went to Lincoln College, Oxford to work with Martin Robertson. He completed his dissertation in 1982, on \"The Late Manner and Early Classical Followers of Douris\". In 1983 he travelled for six months in southern Italy as an assistant of A.D. T rendall, to complete work on the new edition of The Red-Figured Vases of Paestum. T rendall acknowledged his help: \"I owe a special tribute to two people ... [Nigel Spivey] and, in particular, to Robert Guy ... who accompanied me for several weeks in 1983, in Naples, Paestum and at other Sicilian and South Italian sites, as well as in Madrid; not only did he photograph extensively on my behalf but also gave me the benefit of his acute observations on numerous vases, from which I greatly profited. This work owes a great deal to him and words are hardly enough to express my thanks\"(p.vii). From 1984 to 1991 Guy was associate curator at the Art Museum in Princeton. In 1992 he was elected to the newly created Humfry Payne Senior Research Fellowship in Classical Archaeology and Art at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he also acted as a tutor, until 1999, when he resigned to become an independent scholar and art consultant. From 2005 to 2015, he was curator of the collection of H.A. Cahn in Basel, as well as consultant for J.-D. Cahn, AG. This unusual and very fragmented career reflects the difficulties of the life of an expert who was very independently minded and extremely private.Most of Guy's published work is short, precise and dedicated to the problems of description and attribution of Greek vases from museums and private collections (the Virginia Museum, Borowski collection, Fleischman collection, among many others). He travelled widely, visiting many museums and collections, building a vast photographic archive, which supported his immense knowledge of rather inaccessible material, the hidden part of the iceberg, so to speak. He worked extensively in the Louvre, in the Campana r\u00e9serve, thanks to the liberality of Fran\u00e7ois Villard, and made a huge number of joins between fragments in the Louvre itself as well as in other collections, public and private. He reflected deeply on areas in Beazley's lists that were not completely clear. He showed how the T riptolemos Painter moved from the Dourian ambit to the Brygan workshop; he later reframed Douris's workshop, redefining the Oedipus Painter, and freshly characterising what in Beazley is a minor figure (the Painter of London E66) as the late work of the T riptolemos Painter. He explored in detail the relation between the Syriskos and Copenhagen Painters, maintaining the distinction between the two, as Beazley did. Most recently, he produced a completely revised list of the Berlin Painter's oeuvre (with Michael Padgett), a task that no one else could have done so precisely. His essay in the Berlin Painter catalogue (Princeton, 2017) clarifies a complex area in Beazley, expanding the painter of Goluchow 37 by incorporating new vases unknown to Beazley. Guy was a perfectionist, always aiming at completeness and total accuracy, which often prevented him from publishing talks he had given at many conferences. He leaves several manuscripts, almost complete, that deserve to be published as they stand. He also worked on the Campana Fragments in the Villa Giulia, and was part of the team - with Fran\u00e7ois Villard and Fran\u00e7ois Lissarrague - which should publish the Attic red-figured vases in the Vatican. Guy's impact can be found in many footnotes, where colleagues thanked him for advice and information. His generosity in sharing and giving access to unpublished information was remarkable. Many scholars, mainly younger ones, benefited from his knowledge and his openness to newcomers in the field. He was a witty fellow, full of humour and irony, with an amazing eye, and a great friend. His archive will be deposited at the Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie in Paris, where he spent much time in the Campana r\u00e9serve, in the Louvre and in the Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. His ashes will be buried in the family plot, in Cobourg. Fran\u00e7ois Lissarrague I wish to thank for their help Jasper Gaunt, Adrienne Lezzi-Hafter, Michael Padgett, Alan Shapiro and Dyfri Williams. 98 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 99 Corpus Christi College Eldred Durosimi Jones 1925-2020 Eldred Jones was an extremely popular character among those Corpuscles who matriculated in 1950, and to many who overlapped him from other years. A number of us managed subsequently to keep in touch with him as his career unfolded and he became a major figure in the academic and social life of Sierra Leone. He was born in Freetown when Sierra Leone was a colony of the British Empire. His father was a civil servant; his mother was a descendant of the Maroon slaves in Jamaica who had fled from British rule to become Founding Constituents of Freetown. Eldred's parents sent him to the Christian Mission Grammar School in Freetown, where he excelled, especially in English. At eighteen he moved up from there to Fourah Bay College. At that time the College offered general degree courses, certificated by Durham University. Eldred graduated at Fourah Bay in 1947 and returned to teach at his old school. After three years as a teacher, however, he had saved enough money to pay for a master's degree course at an elite English university, so he applied to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and was accepted by Sir Richard Livingstone to start in October 1950. Black students were extremely rare at UK universities in those days and Eldred was no exception at Corpus. But he settled in happily and made lots of friends. In his autobiography, The Freetown Bond: A Life Under Two Flags (2012), he devotes a whole chapter to his three years at Corpus. He fondly looks back on playing bowls in the Fellows' Garden on summer evenings; he enjoys cycle rides to Blenheim and Burford; he attends gatherings on the Corpus barge during Eights Week and goes punting on the Cherwell; and he remembers buying a sixpenny toasting fork in Woolworths for making toast with for tea in his room in Pelican Quad. He even mentions the tradition of \"sconcing\" during dinners in Hall, when the head of the table might choose to sconce a student for \"contumacious behaviour\", and how one of his friends appealed against the penalty in Latin to the Fellows on High Table and had his appeal upheld, amid huge mirth. But Eldred's real focus was on his English studies, particularly his tutorials, whose subjects ranged from Chaucer to E.M. Forster, with inspiring Corpus tutors. He relates how one of Freddie Bateson's comments at the end of his essay on Othello had led to his later research into the treatment of black characters in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, and how they had especially influenced two of his books, Othello's Countrymen: The African in English Renaissance Drama and The Elizabethan Image of Africa. He joined the Oxford Union, spoke in its debates and eventually became a life member. He made journeys to Cambridge to debate with contemporaries there. He enjoyed play-readings in his room, and at lectures sat, figuratively, at the feet of J.R.R Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Helen Gardner and Lord David Cecil. He even attended a gladiatorial history debate between A.J.P Taylor and Hugh T revor-Roper. He joined OUDS and met some of the leading theatrical lights of the day. He toured France with Tony Richardson's production of The Duchess of Malfi. He vividly remembers Alistair MacIntosh's two great productions: Twelfth Night at the Oxford Playhouse, with the young student Maggie Smith in her first big play at Oxford and, secondly, in 1951 the outstanding Corpus in-house production of T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral. In 1953, during his final year at Corpus, Eldred applied for a position at his old university in Freetown, Fourah Bay College. He went for interview at Church House, Westminster, leaving his wife, Marjorie, to mingle with the thronging crowds who were watching a full dress rehearsal at the Abbey of Queen Elizabeth's coronation. He was offered the appointment on condition that he got a good degree. As the years passed, Eldred steadily gained promotion, and wrote a series of books, mostly on English, American and African literature. He was in demand as a speaker internationally, especially in the USA and Canada. Over the years he held visiting professorships at Leeds, Sheffield, Kent and Toronto universities and at colleges in Massachusetts and Washington; he held four honorary doctorates and five awards (medals) and in 2002 was elected an honorary fellow of Corpus. His own university of Fourah Bay grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s and moved to impressive new buildings on Mount Aureol. By 1974 Professor Jones had become the Principal of Fourah Bay, and a few years later Vice-Chancellor. He decided to retire in 1985 after eleven years of successful high public office, but which had not been without their anxieties for him. These included a period of student protests and unrest, an attempted but abortive armed military coup, and the onset of almost total blindness. After he retired, he continued writing books with Marjorie as his amanuensis, and he went on extended working visits to the USA. But a storm was brewing, and in 1997 a vicious rebel war was launched on Sierra Leone by military and political dissidents from Liberia. Although many of the rebel soldiers were little more than boys, they proved to be a brutal force and for a while they overcame the legitimate government, which fled into exile. Having always been non-political, Eldred escaped the worst atrocities, and when in 1999 the rebels were defeated he, who was trusted and admired by the population of Freetown, was invited to chair the newly constituted National Policy Advisory Committee. When the war ended, Sierra Leone was in a parlous state. Already listed by the UN as the third poorest country in the world, the devastation caused by the conflict had left it even poorer. In consequence, a small gathering of Eldred's Corpus friends from 1950 asked him what they might practically do to assist the recovery of the country's destitute schools. The schools still had buildings and sparsely paid teachers but totally lacked books and teaching resources, so Eldred suggested that the group might raise funds to provide computers and advice on setting up IT teaching centres. No computers existed in schools at that time. To this end, therefore, a charity committee of elderly Corpuscles was set up, called Knowledge Aid for Sierra Leone 100 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 101 Corpus Christi College (KASL), whose task was to raise funds for IT resources. KASL 's first move was to stage a golden jubilee revival in 2001 of Murder in the Cathedral in the College Cloister and Chapel, using the same cast and the same director - Alistair MacIntosh - as in 1951. Guinness World Records proclaimed it the longest time between productions of the same play and same cast. The eight sold-out performances raised \u00a37,000, enough to purchase the first set of five expensive computers for KASL. They were placed in five different schools and used to download teaching resources; in the first six years, paper resources for most GCSE subjects were printed off and were used in as many as 88 Sierra Leonean schools. By 2007 and after further fundraising, the scheme shifted its focus and set up three Fixed Internet Learning Centres (FILCs) in Freetown, where teachers and students could learn basic IT skills. What is more, KASL 's efforts inspired local authors to write books and hold poetry readings to raise funds for the project, and Eldred joined in too by donating the income from his autobiography to the KASL cause. After 13 years of busy fundraising, the Corpus KASL committee felt that the project's aims had been achieved; the Sierra Leone government was now backing the scheme with regular grants, so the Freetown KASL had become self-supporting. We therefore wound ourselves up with a lunch in the Founder's Room, chaired by the then President of Corpus. Just four of the original nine Corpuscles are still alive (April 2020), and now Eldred himself has passed on, after a life well lived. He came across as a gentle, courageous, humane and highly cultured man, and was a fine educationalist, a significant African author and a national icon. Geoff Goodall While he was at Corpus, Eldred Jones made friendships which lasted fifty years and more. Some of these friends were fellow cast members in a production of Murder in the Cathedral , of which more later. After graduating and returning to Sierra Leone, Eldred took up a teaching post at Fourah Bay College, then a constituent college of Durham University. For his thesis, on African figures in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, he was awarded a doctorate by Durham. From then on, his work was all on African literature in English. In 1968 he started the pioneering journal African Literature Today (ALT); it is still the leader in its field. He published the first book on Wole Soyinka (who was later awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature). He was, a Freetown obituarist writes, at one time or another an external examiner at all the English-speaking universities in Africa. Fourah Bay was the first institution of higher education in West Africa. In recent years it has been a college of the University of Sierra Leone, and Eldred was appointed Principal, while continuing to work as Professor of English Literature. He told me that once, during a student riot, he was forced to walk the five miles from Fourah Bay to the centre of Freetown, dragging his feet all the way but nudged forward by a machete touching his back. I feel sure that his assailants had too much affection for their Principal to hurt him. He told the tale with a chuckle, and harboured no bitterness for their treatment of him. Some of his Corpus friends kept in touch, and some travelled to Freetown to visit him. In 2001 the surviving members of the Murder in the Cathedral production staged a revival - with the same cast as far as possible. They dedicated the performance to Eldred and sent the proceeds to the KASL charity he had set up and managed. He was deeply moved by this tribute. Has any other African graduate from Oxford been honoured in such a way? I came to know Eldred, and to join the multitude of those who considered him to be a valued friend, when I was the Director of the British Council in Sierra Leone in 1992-1996. He was by that time completely blind - but still editing the ALT. In this he was given invaluable help by his beloved wife Marjorie; she described herself, cheerfully, as his \"blind dog\". My wife and I were always made to feel most welcome when we called on them. After I left Sierra Leone and retired from the Council, he and Marjorie came to spend a couple of days with us at our home in Cambridge. We enjoyed taking him round the city, and describing its sights to him. My next meeting with him was in January this year, when I was once again in Freetown, my first return visit in 23 years. I was taken to call on Eldred. He was sitting at his desk, with a large Braille Bible open on it. \"I was spending time with my friend, St Luke,\" he told me. His mind was still perfectly clear, and he remembered more of the details of his visit to Cambridge than I did. Marjorie passed away some years ago. Eldred was a truly original scholar and a great figure in African education. He was also one of the most lovable and inspiring people I have ever met. Peter Hilken102 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 103 Corpus Christi College Sam Kay 1986-2020 Sam Kay, who has died at the appalling age of 33, will be familiar to most Corpuscles as the stage-right member of the winning University Challenge team of 2008-2009 - and as the ostensible reason for its notorious disqualification after the fact. To those who knew him best, however, it was the equanimity with which Sam bore a deluge of unwarranted attention that epitomised the man behind the headlines. Sadly, that stoicism would have to serve him well during the final third of his all too short life. Born and raised in Frimley, Surrey, Sam came up to Corpus in 2004 with a place to read Chemistry, a girlfriend of three years' standing (his fellow Oxford chemist, Beth Heaviside) and an insatiable curiosity that drove him beyond the course syllabus and into the intercollegiate quiz, where he and I met. While the performance of CCC B that year has long been lost to the mists of mediocrity, our collaboration left its true legacy once Sam introduced me to his already close-knit circle of friends. Based on students of STEM subjects, namely Nick Hawker, Paddy Finch Noyes, Nick Bamford, Paul Taylor (now Clarke-Taylor) and Robbie Stephen, the gang nonetheless spared a place at its Walton Street table for such interlopers from the humanities as Justine Cooke (now Stephen), Sara Gordon and me. Sixteen years of collective friendship present a happy blur of summer days on Cornish yachts, and winter nights by Scottish hearths; of drained tumblers of Islay whisky, and foaming goblets of T rappist beer; of magnanimous victories at Risk, and often graceful defeats at Power Grid. What stands out from all the parties, holidays and weddings that we have shared is how often, and uncomplainingly, it was Sam who undertook the more tedious arrangements. Always a familiar face within the JCR, with his penchant for Hawaiian shirts and copious quantities of hair gel, Sam played bass guitar in no fewer than three Corpus bands. But he achieved a measure of fame, not to say infamy, as one quarter of a University Challenge team whose record-breaking performance had been presaged by its triumph in the 2008 intercollegiate quiz. Like many of the show's contestants, Sam had actually completed his degree, in which he took a first, between the middle and final rounds of filming, which Granada Studios used to spread over the end of one academic year and the start of the next. He duly saw no reason to hide from a reporter the fact that, by the time Granada had filmed the final rounds, he had just started training as an auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Unfortunately, this non-revelation came to the attention of a BBC reeling from widespread criticism of various misrepresentations on its shows. Fearing another scandal - and, ironically, creating one - the corporation disqualified Corpus with retrospective effect, just days after broadcasting the final. Veterans of University Challenge nodded wearily as journalists uncovered a string of former champions with at least one player in Sam's position, but Corpus Christi Kay himself just enjoyed the team's dinner with Bamber Gascoigne, the show's original host, who decried the BBC's \"pathetic fiasco\". Refusing to let the experience mar his love of quizzes, Sam would captain the \"Corpuscles\" on another televised contest, Only Connect, in 2013.After qualifying at PwC, Sam moved to British Airways, which indulged his taste for travel by sending him to far-flung locations - alongside Beth, whenever annual leave allowed them. He later transferred to BA's parent company, International Airlines Group, where he worked as an investment analyst. Based at Heathrow, he felt a twinge of pride whenever he spotted an aircraft whose purchase he had approved. In 2013, with Nick Hawker as his best man, Sam married Beth on a late September day of oranges and purples. Nick would reciprocate the honour at his own wedding, to Helen Sweeney. In 2015, Sam and Beth settled in Bagshot, close to both their families, where they should have got a lifetime's use from the back-garden pizza oven that Sam built on the strength of two photographs he had found online. But his final year at Corpus had witnessed the emergence of ultimately unfathomable health problems, ameliorated yet unresolved by a major operation in 2012. Devoid of self-pity, Sam threw himself into ever more voluntary work, becoming an organiser for Marie Curie's London Brain Game (a fundraising quiz), a governor of his former school, Collingwood College, and a Liberal Democrat councillor for Surrey Heath. Charity came naturally to a man whose tone could only even verge on the irate when others started protesting that he was doing too much to help them. Tellingly, Sam did not reduce his commitments when in 2019 his mother, Sandra, and grandmother, Connie, died just weeks apart. Following Sam's own death, his brother, Josh, and father, Mick, have been in our thoughts as much as is Beth. My last meeting with Sam was, like my first, at a quiz: the Sunday competition at the Gardeners Arms, Jericho. It had once been our gang's weekly haunt, and Sam and Beth often returned even after leaving Oxford. As always, we drank, though less than we used to, and laughed as much as we ever had. We even sang, for the Gardeners quiz demands no less. We honed our plans to visit the Australasian chapter of our group, the Bamfords and Stephens, and finalised our arrangements for New Year's Eve with its local stalwarts, the Hawkers and Finch Noyeses. But neither meeting ever happened. Just before New Year 2020, Sam had to return to hospital, where he died with a suddenness none had foreseen. And so our last words to each other remained \"Merry Christmas\", exchanged over the threshold of our favourite pub. Although I would have done anything to change the time of my parting from Sam, I take solace in its setting. Seb Page104 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 105 Corpus Christi College Norman Miners 1931-2020 Norman John Miners went up to Corpus in 1952. He was slightly older than the rest of the intake, having left school two-and-a-half years earlier. He had been one of 22 British schoolboys who were selected for a \"School Boys' Tour of Africa\", paid for with money remaining in the wartime South African Aid to Britain Fund. They met Clement Atlee, flew to Nairobi and then travelled by bus to Cape Town. It was normal to do National Service after Oxford but Norman decided to do it first, and he spent two years commanding a logistics platoon in Shrewsbury. His father, a London police constable, died from an incurable wasting disease while Norman was in the army and only a few months before he went up to Oxford. Norman went to Corpus as a Classics scholar. He was a member of the Zodiac Society and Secretary of the Sundial Society, and rowed in the Second Eight. The College gave him a bursary to travel to Greece during the Long Vacation of 1954. Grief over his father's death overshadowed much of his time at college and contributed to a strong interest in religion. He qualified as a Methodist lay preacher and preached at villages around Oxford. He achieved First Class Honours in Classical Moderations in 1954 and in Literae Humaniores in 1956. The chief examiner told him that his were the best papers of 1956. Many years later Norman recorded his memories of college life in Corpuscles, a history of the College published in 1994. During the Long Vacation in 1955, Frank Lepper invited classicists to a join a reading party in the French Alps, where they read, walked and played golf. They were joined by Sir Christopher Cox, an educational adviser to the Colonial Office. Conversations with Sir Christopher led Norman to decide to join the Colonial Education Service. He had formed an ambition to return to Africa while on the School Boys' Tour when he was eighteen. The decision, however, meant leaving his recently widowed mother, who was very attached to her only child. In 1957 he sailed for Nigeria to take up a position at King's College, Lagos, where he taught Latin and ran the cadet force. He retained his interest in Ancient History, publishing an article about the Lex Sempronia Agraria in Classical Quarterly in 1958. One of his pupils at King's College wrote a poem about him as their housemaster: Smart and soldierly he is Everything he would do to the best That duty requires \"Correct\" he would roar Always the usual hurry. The pupils called him \"Colo\" - short for \"Colonial Remnant\".Norman stayed in Nigeria after independence in 1960. He married Wilma Roberts, also a school teacher, in 1965. A military coup in 1966 and the death of Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa led to a change in the government education budget, specifically the end of a plan to open new schools which Tafawa Balewa had supported. The coup also thwarted Norman's ambition to be a headmaster of a new government school, and so he and Wilma left and returned to the UK. The Nigerian civil war, or the Biafran war, began the following year. His years in Nigeria were, he said, the happiest of his life. Norman was awarded a Social Sciences Research Fellowship, which he used to write a PhD at the University of Exeter between 1966 and 1968. The subject was the Nigerian Army 1956-1966, and he was able to draw on the knowledge of former King's College cadets for information. Some died in the 1966 coups and others fought on opposing sides in the civil war. The PhD was adapted and published as a book in 1970. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria, claimed that the book was defamatory, threatened legal action and demanded damages far greater than Norman could afford. The threat was dropped after the General Officer Commanding of the Nigerian Army (coincidentally another Corpuscle, Sir Christopher Welby-Everard, who graduated in 1931) corroborated Norman's account of the 1966 coups. In 1969 Norman took up a post as lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. He left Wilma, pregnant, in the UK. She and their first son joined him the following year. They had a second son two years later. In 1975 he published another book, The Government and Politics of Hong Kong; he updated it four times over the next twenty years and the fifth edition was published in 1995, shortly before his retirement. It became the definitive text on its subject. Norman was a frequent commentator on politics and the negotiations about the post-1997 status of Hong Kong. The book was translated into Chinese and published in Shanghai, and the leader of the Chinese side in the negotiations leading to the 1984 Joint Declaration told him how useful it had been. In 1987 he published Hong Kong Under Imperial Rule, 1912-1941, and over the course of his career in Hong Kong and in retirement wrote many articles about Hong Kong's history, politics and government. His colleagues and former students remember his absolute integrity, intellectual rigour, formidable knowledge and total fair-mindedness. He was a reserved, self-effacing and generous man who put himself last in everything he did. When his work was plagiarised, he kept the knowledge to himself, saying later that he had no wish to ruin the plagiariser's academic career. Norman retired in 1995 and returned to London where he was able to spend a year with his mother, whom he had left in 1957, before she died. Norman and Wilma spent retirement travelling, reading, swimming and going to the theatre. Norman made several return visits to Hong Kong after retirement, the last in 2011. He retained a keen interest in Nigeria and Hong Kong; he added a newspaper cutting to his Hong Kong file the day before he died.Norman died in his sleep at home in Fulham on 30 April 2020, in the same room where he had sat at his dying father's bedside 68 years before. His father, who had had to leave school at 14, said that he could die happy in the knowledge that his son was going to Oxford. Robert Miners David Ramsay 1939-2020 David Ramsay, a former University of California San Francisco (UCSF) senior vice chancellor and President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), who since 2010 had served as associate director of the UCSF Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (IND), died on 18 June 2020, after a short illness. He was 81. \"During David's 12-year tenure as Senior Vice Chancellor, UCSF rose to national eminence, particularly in the areas of strengthened academic programs and increased community involvement,\" said Talmadge E. King, Jr., MD, dean of the School of Medicine. \"David was always modest but played critical roles in advancing the missions of both UCSF and the IND. He will be dearly missed by his many friends and colleagues at UCSF and throughout the world.\" \"David's contributions to the development of the IND were extraordinary,\" said Stanley Prusiner, MD, the IND's founding director and a professor of neurology in the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. Prusiner recruited Ramsay to join the institute as associate director on his return from UMB, where Ramsay was President from 1994 to 2010. \"He skillfully nurtured the Institute from an aspiration into an internationally recognized program focused on neurodegeneration and drug discovery.\" Born in England, Ramsay earned baccalaureate, masters, doctoral and advanced medical degrees at Oxford University, before joining the faculty of Corpus Christi College as University Lecturer in the Laboratory of Physiology. He was a medical Fellow at Corpus between 1966 and 1975. Ramsay first went to UCSF on a sabbatical in 1973, then moved to the university permanently in 1975 as a faculty member of the Department of Physiology, where he conducted influential research on the neurobiology of thirst. In 1982, UCSF Chancellor Julius Krevans, MD, appointed him to serve as senior vice chancellor for academic affairs, a position he held until he left to accept the presidency of UMB. Ramsay's tenure as senior vice chancellor coincided with a period of increasing national prominence for UCSF's academic programmes, as well as an increased focus on community involvement. For instance, Ramsay was co-founder, with Bruce Alberts, of the UCSF Science and Health Education Partnership, which connects science teachers from the San Francisco Unified School District with UCSF scientists and with resources to support students' education in science. He was also known for spotting and advocating for the careers of promising young researchers, according to Dennis Hartzell, who worked closely with him as UCSF's director of corporate relations in the late 1980s and early 1990s to establish valuable connections between the university and Japan's pharmaceutical industry. As President of UMB for fifteen years, Ramsay was known for expanding and developing the university's campus as well as boosting its reputation as a leading research institution. He also worked with Hartzell, whom he recruited to UMB to serve as his executive advisor, to continue building relationships with the Japanese life science industry. Ramsay was \"simply the best organizational leader I have ever met,\" Hartzell said. \"He was adept at recognizing talent and nurturing individuals; he understood his obligation as chief executive to identify opportunities that would move the organization forward, even when there were risks involved; and he was true to his top priorities by how he allocated his time. Everyone also knew that just because David was nice didn't mean he was soft - David was an extremely kind man, but never weak.\" Ramsay \"brought UMB to national prominence as a research institution,\" said the university's interim president Bruce E. Jarrell, MD. \"During his presidency, Dr. Ramsay was the driving force behind the vast expansion of UMB. His vision included the creation of our BioPark [and] bringing new therapeutics and diagnostics to the market by bringing together academic and industry biomedical researchers. Under his leadership, he also completely changed the physical landscape of our campus.\" After retiring from UMB in 2010, Ramsay returned to UCSF as an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Neurology. Prusiner, who by this time had won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of infectious prion proteins, had just founded the IND and was looking for someone to help oversee the fledgling institute, and leapt at the opportunity to recruit Ramsay to help make his vision for it a reality. \"I thought, two weeks is too soon. He'll still be getting moved in. But four weeks is too long - someone else will snap him up,\" Prusiner recalled. \"So I gave him a call after three weeks exactly.\" Ramsay was deeply interested in the problems posed by neurodegenerative diseases and quickly agreed to become Prusiner's associate director at the IND, which flourished under their joint leadership. \"Over nearly a half century of knowing David there was never an angry word between us,\" Prusiner said. \"He was incredible with the IND's faculty and staff and nurtured many people's careers. He always had thoughtful and clever insights about how to help people in whatever troubles they were having. He had one agenda, which was the success of the IND.\" 106 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 107 Corpus Christi College 108 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 109 Corpus Christi College Ramsay had a hand in nearly all aspects of the IND's operations, including building key partnerships with Japanese pharmaceutical giant Daiichi Sankyo and the U.S. Department of Defense but, as was his preference, he tended to operate in the background. Those whose work and lives he touched, however, remember him as an ever-present, steady hand and a valued source of wisdom and practical advice on nearly any topic - including deep expertise in world travel, food and wine. \"David was instrumental in creating the IND. He was deeply involved in every faculty recruitment and served as a sounding board for scientific, administrative and financial decisions,\" said Jason Gestwicki, a professor with the IND and UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. \"David was also truly one of the warmest, kindest and most thoughtful people I have ever met.\" \"His support and guidance were crucial at making the unit that I direct into a more powerful research arm of the IND,\" said Julian Castaneda, director of the IND's research animal facility. \"David was cut from a very different cloth. On the one hand he was a major presence in world- class academic science, with important international connections to major pharmaceutical companies and governments, but on the other hand he was always completely humble. He was known as a diplomat due to the attentiveness, elegance and effectiveness with which he would handle challenges requiring the utmost attention and care. I will always be grateful for the lessons and friendship he shared with me.\" Nicholas Weiler \u00a9 Regents of the University of California (abridged) Arthur Scace 1938-2020 David Arthur Scace was halfway through his interview to join the board of directors at Lallemand Inc., a Montreal-based producer of yeast, when it dawned on him that he had nearly bankrupted the company - and that was one of the reasons they wanted him. As a young tax lawyer in the early 1970s, Scace went to Canada's Tariff Board and successfully argued that yeast that Bowes Company was importing loose in bags from Anheuser-Busch in the United States should be duty-free, avoiding an 18.5 per cent tariff applied to much the same yeast when it was processed into blocks. Jean Chagnon, who later took over Lallemand from his father, was an observer at that hearing in Ottawa and remembers Scace - low-key and soft-spoken, still in his early thirties - outmanoeuvring the opposing lawyers, who thought their case was a slam dunk. \"He won the unwinnable argument. And as a result, we basically started losing a lot of money,\" Chagnon said, and the company was forced to sell off parts of its business to save itself.Decades later, after Lallemand had regrouped and expanded, Scace joined the board in 1996 and became \"a fantastic and wise adviser\" to the company for more than twenty years, according to Chagnon. He would tell colleagues, \"this guy was so good, and almost killed our company, so we decided he was better on our side\". Scace died on 3 May 2020 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, after suffering cardiac arrest. He was 81. A brilliant tax lawyer, he became a quietly towering figure in Canadian business over a distinguished career at McCarthy T\u00e9trault LLP . As managing partner of McCarthy & McCarthy, one of the firm's forebears, he spearheaded a series of mergers that helped build it into a national powerhouse. Yet he was revered as much for his intellectual range and gentlemanly manner as for his intricate understanding of Canada's tax laws. Scace also served as the first non-executive chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia, as Canadian secretary for the Rhodes Scholarship T rust for 33 years and as chair of the Canadian Opera Company, juggling an array of corporate board seats and philanthropic endeavours. \"He was the gold standard,\" said Robert Prichard, a lawyer and former president of the University of Toronto. \"There are these rare individuals who are so superior at everything they do, they come to be defined by being the best of the best.\" Arthur Richard Andrew Scace was born 22 July 1938 in Toronto, where he grew up with his younger brother Andrew, now a retired banker. Their father, Arthur L. Scace, was a real estate lawyer, and their mother, Jean C. Scace, was a buyer for Eaton's who travelled by boat to France to source wares for the store. As a child, Scace attended Brown School on Avenue Road, then University of Toronto Schools (UTS), where he would later be a board member as an adult. His family wasn't wealthy, but in almost every childhood photo he can be seen wearing a tie. At T rinity College in the University of Toronto, he had one of the rare false starts in a stellar academic career. In February of his first year he received a warning that if he didn't get down to work, he would fail. By the end of that school year, he was at the top of his class. In his third year, he took a formative trip, backpacking solo for three months from Morocco to Afghanistan, and wrote a prize-winning essay about it for Saturday Night magazine. He lost so much weight while travelling that after he returned he was cut at try-outs for U of T's varsity football team. He met his future wife, Susan Kernohan, while at T rinity, where she also studied, inviting her to the college's Conversat ball in January 1959. For their next date, they went skating at The Jolly Miller tavern, and \"he in his hockey boots and me in my figure skates danced on the ice,\" Mrs. Scace said. They were together 61 years, married for 57. After graduating, he earned a Master of Arts at Harvard University, then won a Rhodes Scholarship and went to Corpus Christi College, at Oxford University, for a Bachelor of Laws. He added a Canadian law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University.110 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 111 Corpus Christi College In 1967 Scace started at McCarthy & McCarthy, specialising in tax law, and became a partner five years later. He rose to be the firm's managing partner from 1989 to 1996, then its national chairman. He could explain the intention and technical nuance of a tax statute with precision, but stood apart from other lawyers with his ability to listen, give sage advice and talk others around to his point of view. Where some lawyers viewed speaking to opposing counsel as a sign of weakness, Scace made it a strength, according to Jim Farley, a lawyer and former judge for the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. \"Arthur had the ability to go and talk with people. They knew he was a fair guy.\" Scace was Queen's Counsel, head of the income tax section of the Bar Admission Course, treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada and in 2004 was named a member of the Order of Canada. His gravitas and authority came partly from his ability to synthesise complex information and zero in on the heart of the matter. He was decisive, his friends say, and ran meetings tightly, with no spare time to veer off course. \"I thought Art Scace was such a wise man,\" said Tony Arrell, chairman of Burgundy Asset Management Ltd., who had him \"on every speed dial I ever had\". He added: \"Some people are smart, but they're not wise. Art was smart and wise.\" He was an insatiable reader of history, politics and biographies, kept a large stamp collection and played the piano. His competitive streak came out in sports - especially tennis and squash - and there was no question of letting his children or grandchildren win. Yet much of the time, Scace was quiet, even shy. \"He was exceptional in front of people, and you always felt the warmth and friendliness from him,\" said Patrick Scace, his son. \"But some of it, I think, was practised and he was very happy sitting in his chair, reading a book for hours, or in a boat with a fishing rod, where he could just relax and not have to talk.\" Scace had little time for small talk - to the uninitiated, he could even seem gruff - but he relished quick-witted repartee and good-natured teasing. That same demeanour helped him mentor younger people, including hundreds of Rhodes Scholars sent to Oxford on his watch as Canadian secretary. \"He was a man who didn't waste a lot of words, and what he said was always either extraordinarily pithy and worthwhile, or just great fun because of his phenomenal, wry sense of humour and the constant twinkle in his eye,\" said David Naylor, a former U of T president and Rhodes Scholar. Scace's philanthropy was wide-ranging, spanning arts, education and medicine. He and his wife, who has served on boards including Sunnybrook Hospital and the Loran Scholars Foundation, forged a dynamic partnership and were generous with their own money, as well as highly adept at helping raise it from others. But they were \"completely indifferent to recognition\", according to David Naylor. \"It never seemed to matter to either of them.\"Toronto's Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, home to the country's national opera and ballet companies, is a brick-and-mortar testament to Arthur Scace's abilities. He chaired the Canadian Opera Company's board, was CEO of the Canadian Opera House Corporation and co-chaired the capital campaign that raised more than $180 million in funding. His three- pronged role made him a lynchpin in the project, which was finished in 2006, and he remained devoted to opera - Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana was his favourite. In later life he still travelled often, and had planned to spend the coming Christmas with Susan in Marrakesh, Morocco, six decades after he first saw its snake charmers and fakirs at dusk as a student. In addition to his wife and brother, he leaves his children, Jennifer Racine and Patrick; and grandchildren, Adam Racine and Mathew and Jonathan Scace. James Bradshaw \u00a9 Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail Inc., 13 May 2020 John Scott 1935-2020 As both a campaigner and a collector John Scott displayed formidable passion and a seldom- defeated determination. While proclaiming his love for Europe and Europeans, from the 1975 referendum that took Britain into the European Economic Community to that of 2016, Scott was a consistent opponent of the European Union and became an early supporter of UKIP . He might be found atop a stepladder addressing crowds at Speakers' Corner or handing out leaflets having dismounted from an aged bicycle in Kensington Church Street, haranguing everyone and anyone on the state of the world, a Union Jack in his buttonhole. In local matters he had a marked impact on the west London area around his home, where he founded the Notting Hill Gate Improvement T rust to coordinate conservation efforts. A satisfying triumph in 1993 was the public lavatory in Westbourne Grove, which is now Grade II listed. He funded its award-winning T urquoise Island design from the architect Piers Gough and found the florist Nikki Tibbles Wild at Heart to occupy the booth attached to it. Scott insisted on good design and the enhancement of public amenities for all, and among other visible signs of his work are the forest of newly planted trees and flowers and the public seating in the Westbourne Grove piazza. He campaigned tirelessly against invading chain stores among Portobello Road antique shops, and commissioned artworks for other North Kensington public spaces. These include The Climber by Peter Logan and Carnival Figures by Nadim Karam.112 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 113 Corpus Christi College He was equally formidable in his collecting, with an accumulation of nineteenth-century furniture and art that was unrivalled in its range and depth. Those who dealt with him remember a man who showed great kindness and generosity, but who also had a quick temper and legendary brusqueness, which had to be taken on the chin. He was a regular lender to exhibitions and a benefactor to museums, maintaining anonymity by having loans credited to \"the Birkenhead Collection\", named after his birthplace. He contributed to and helped to organise funding for the Hereford Screen and the Salisbury Cross by the architect George Gilbert Scott, which are now both on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A significant gift was his collection of more than 2,000 tiles to the Jackfield Tile Museum at Ironbridge, Shropshire. When visiting the town he stayed at the unmodernised Tontine Hotel because of its unrivalled view of Abraham Darby's eponymous cast-iron bridge. John Stanley Marshall Scott was born in 1935 at Birkenhead on the Wirral, the son of Donald V.S. Scott and Ada (n\u00e9e Marshall), the daughter of a building contractor in T ranmere. In the year of his birth his father and Arthur Stansfeld founded Stansfeld Scott in Barbados, initially to blend and bottle their own rum, Cockade, and the rum-based liqueur Falernum. At one time they supplied all the Navy's rum ration. Donald Scott also had interests in supermarkets and hotels on the island. Scott was educated at Radley, where he captained the rugby 1st XV to such effect that neither exam nor interview was required for him to gain a place at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. However, on leaving school in 1953 he postponed university to do his National Service and was awarded an immediate commission with the Gurkha Regiment, seeing active service during the Malayan Emergency. On demobilisation he went to Oxford to read Law, and resumed his rugby career. As a full- back he gained three Blues and was celebrated for the crash tackle that concussed David Mills, a Cambridge flanker, during the 1958 Varsity Match. This prevented a try, turned the match around, and prompted the Path\u00e9 News commentator to describe Scott as \"physically a very fine specimen indeed\". Afterwards he was called up to play for England against France. Although the match was won, he was dropped thereafter because it had emerged that he was expected to take the place kicks and conversions, having never previously done so. Many years later Scott's love for his college was reflected in a gift of three remarkable mid-nineteenth century bindings in honour of \"the friendship and kindness of Professor Richard Carwadine\", president from 2010 to 2016. He continued to play rugby for Harlequins, represented Cheshire for three seasons and organised Oxford and Cambridge tours to France and the Far East, the latter drawing on old Gurkha contacts. For many years his hospitality in the West Car Park at T wickenham, where his car boot was customarily furnished with smoked salmon sandwiches, Black Velvet and Vacherin, ensured a merry group of friends by kick-off. In 1964, \"in order to keep fit\", he joined the America's Cup challenging team aboard Anthony Boyden's Sovereign. He was also a formidable squash player, on one occasion overwhelming a considerably younger friend who had recently won a Blue. Although he worked briefly as a solicitor in an uncle's practice, Scott soon turned to property development, working first with McKay Securities in Knightsbridge and then setting up his own Marshall Securities in the late 1960s. A notable development was the much-praised eleven-storey block of flats at 125 Park Road, Hanover Gate, Regent's Park, designed by the Farrell-Grimshaw partnership. Like the architects, he took an apartment in it. Although the property market collapse of 1974 took his company with it, Scott retained his confidence. He formed Brathew, which bought property in Westbourne Grove, and moved into an extensive apartment there. This he filled with a treasury of nineteenth-century decorative art. For forty years before they married in 2013, he shared his life there with Takako Shimizu, a mosaicist and garden designer, who survives him. Propinquity to the antiques market fired Scott's collecting instinct. At first he collected English eighteenth-century glass, then developed a love of French art nouveau glass, but soon his life was taken over by the Arts and Crafts movement. He explained his enthusiasm for nineteenth- century English tiles with one word, \"money\". His interest had been caught by a Harlequin friend's collection of Dutch delft examples, but in 1974 these were beyond him, while fine English examples, even by Pugin or De Morgan, could be had at \u00a31 each. As his finances recovered he looked further, and within the chosen field his tastes were catholic. He worked closely with the leading dealers in the Victorian market. Deteriorating health encouraged him to seek new homes for his treasures, and in 2014 he held eight selling exhibitions at the Fine Art Society, then still in New Bond Street. He was justly proud of the catalogues he produced with them, which stand as a memorial to his collecting. Important objects went to museums, notably Pugin's dresser for his Ramsgate home, now in the V&A, and magnificent Jeckyll sunflower firedogs, now in Glasgow. Funding is still being sought to secure an inordinately quirky Martin Brothers pottery crab for a British museum. Scott died after a short period in a Kensington care home. Appropriately, his ashes were scattered on 31 January 2020, Brexit day. \u00a9 The Times, 18 March 2020 114 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 115 Corpus Christi College Peter Sinclair 1946-2020 Peter Sinclair, who has died aged 73 after contracting Covid-19, was an economist who inspired a generation of students at Brasenose College, Oxford, Birmingham University and the Bank of England's Centre for Central Banking Studies. As Fellow in Economics at Brasenose from 1970 until 1994, Sinclair focused his own academic work on monetary and international economics, closely tied to questions of practical policy in matters of public debt, regulation and tax. But it was as a convivial and constructive teacher that he excelled: fascinated by debate, he held tutorials in cafes and after-dinner revision classes that ended in pubs, and took a charitable attitude to undergraduates who underperformed - one of whom recalled learning to interpret comments such as: \"That's very, very - very - interesting\" as \"signalling a terrible error\". He was also brilliant at explaining complex concepts in simple language, illuminating the inefficiencies of European common agricultural policy by pointing out that the \"butter mountain\" accumulated by Brussels weighed more than the population of Austria. Together with colleagues such as the political historian Vernon Bogdanor, Sinclair helped to build Brasenose's reputation as a leading college for the PPE course which forms so many of Britain's politicians, public servants and commentators. Among his pupils was the future prime minister David Cameron (for whom Sinclair was \"one of the kindest as well as the cleverest people I ever met\"), the Bank of England deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden, the BBC T rust chair Diane Coyle and the economist Tim Harford. Harford remembered a difficult interview for college entrance: \"While I was being grilled by the formidable philosophy tutor ... Peter was the one beaming and nodding and encouraging, as though everything was going brilliantly.\" Peter James Niven Sinclair was born in Hertfordshire on 18 September 1946, the son of Walter Sinclair, an Australian-born engineer, and his wife Marian; he was educated at Gresham's School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he initially read Classics. After graduate studies at Nuffield College he took a job in the export department of Linde, a German industrial gas maker, then came second nationally in the Civil Service fast-track entry exam - but chose the academic life instead. He moved from Brasenose to take up a professorship at Birmingham in 1994 and was director of the Bank of England's Centre for Central Banking Studies from 2000 to 2008, teaching central bank officials from all over the world. At various times he also held visiting professorships at the University of British Columbia, Queen's University in Canada, the LSE and the University of Warwick, and lectured all over the world. He was Chairman of the Royal Economic Society Easter School and the International Economics Study Group, and was one of a panel of expert advisers to the Office for National Statistics.Having served for some years as Brasenose's junior dean, Sinclair loved every aspect of college life and retained a close connection to it throughout his wider career. He became an Emeritus Fellow in 2008 and regularly returned from his home in Norfolk to chair the College's remuneration committee until the onset of his final illness. Among his other gifts was a remarkable command of languages. He could converse in French and Japanese, had a smattering of Hungarian and Swahili - and on encountering a blank response from a waiter in a trattoria whom he had addressed in Italian, switched to fluent Polish instead. Peter Sinclair's first wife was the Canadian-born economist Shelagh Heffernan, whom he met when she went to Oxford as a graduate student in 1978 and who was later a professor at Cass Business School in London. Shelagh died in 2010 after a long illness and he married, secondly, the artist Jayne Ivimey, who survives him. \u00a9 T elegraph Media Group Limited, 24 April 2020 Irving Steggles 1945-2020 Irving Steggles was educated at Southend High School for Boys where he became engaged in his first charitable work, organising a team of younger boys to help at a holiday home for the disabled on the local seafront. At Corpus he studied Maths but spent much of his time engaged in the activities of the Christian Union, while also rowing for the college second eight. Irving's time at Corpus was a springboard for a remarkable career. For the next 27 years he was a housemaster and maths master at Monkton Combe School near Bath, organising house rowing, a concert club and many Christian activities. From 1990 to 1996 he was also Chair of the Board of T rustees of Mathematics in Education and Industry (MEI), an independent charity committed to improving maths education and also an independent curriculum development body which has introduced many innovations into the teaching of mathematics in the UK. Having often been a lay preacher, Irving then decided to train formally for the ministry at the London Theological Seminary (later becoming chairman of the Seminary's Board). After some years at Ladyfield Church in Chippenham, he moved to South Africa in 2004, and in 2005 became pastor of Birchleigh Baptist Church in Kempton Park (located midway between Pretoria and Johannesburg). He engaged in training a new generation of black leaders and preachers in post-apartheid South Africa. He involved himself in a charity organising training for Christian pastors across Africa, travelling widely across the continent and the world to elicit support for it. He had a special gift for encouraging and motivating others, and made a significant impact on the development of the Christian church, especially in the southern 116 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 117 Corpus Christi College half of the African continent. He bravely withstood various disabilities in later years before succumbing to a (non-Covid) infection. Irving was much loved by all who knew him, and both as teacher and preacher he had a huge influence on many lives. Many warm tributes have been paid to him, notably by past pupils and colleagues at Monkton Combe School, and by leaders of the African church. Here are just a few of them. From the Old Monktonians Club website: \"Irving gave so much to Monkton over many years. His Maths teaching was for many inspirational; he devoted hours to the Boat Club and the CCF . However, it is probably as the housemaster of Farm that he will be best remembered. So many of his former pupils remember the warmth, interest and genuine Christian care which he showed towards the boys in his House. He took many to the theatre, the opera, or simply out to restaurants, and these young men so valued the window of life outside Monkton which these trips provided. And as a strong Christian himself, Irving helped many on their faith journey with patient discussion and Christian concern.\" \"One of the great teachers - loved big cars as well as music, food, Maths and Jesus.\" \"[...] remembers being one of a group taken to Oxford where he bought each of them a book of their choice at Blackwells, stopped for tea on the way home, consulted the menu and informed the waitress, 'We'll have everything'. T ruly one of a kind.\" \"I would not be the person I am now without his encouragement and guidance.\" From Peter Bossom, MEI Trustee: \"There are many stories of his time with MEI, but some of them involve the verb 'to be Steggled'. This was coined at Monkton Combe, where his ability to smile sweetly and ask a favour of someone at the very last minute was legendary. The verb reached the whole of MEI when, at a conference at St Catherine's, Oxford, one of the eminent speakers arrived expecting to speak alongside Irving in an important plenary but instead found himself giving the whole lecture. He opened with the line 'I have been Steggled'. Irving was an amazing man, and MEI benefited from his time in charge. Without him, MEI would not be what it is now.\" From Jeremy Marshall, the London Seminary: \"Irving - the archetypal English gentleman, in the best sense of the word. Yes, wonderfully eccentric and also fascinating, learned, engaging, lovingly argumentative (that's an under-appreciated quality), funny, and always Christ-like, gentle and kind.... Here was a true 'Mr. Great Heart'.\"From Pastor Ronald Kalifungwa, of the Lusaka Baptist Church in Zambia: \"He was friendly, loyal to his friends, an encourager of men, consistent and a true man of integrity. He had a burden for black communities and in various ways tried to support efforts at reaching those communities with the gospel with a view to planting solid biblical churches there. He helped inspire many black young men and women to understand and love the doctrines of grace. He also inspired and supported a number of promising black young men to seek reformed theological training (mainly at London Seminary) with a view to preparing them for future ministry in South Africa.\" From Conrad Mbewe, on behalf of the African Pastors Conferences (APC): \"His sphere of influence grew as he settled more and more in South Africa and this took him all over the world. The Christians in Zambia will particularly remember him for the many times he came to attend the Zambian Reformed Conferences and preach in our churches. Irving made the APC a personal project in which he poured heart and soul to his dying day. Each year he kept adding more conferences until the APC grew to about sixty conferences a year. Irving visited Europe and the USA, and spoke in churches and at conferences, appealing passionately for support for the APC. The conferences are now being held in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal. All you need to do is to read the tributes coming in from all over Africa to appreciate the impact that Irving Steggles has had on the continent through the APC.\" Trevitt Steggles and George Smith Ian Wood 1946-2019 Ian Wood was from Cape Town. I met him on a train bound for Lech in 1968; we had signed up to an Oxford, Cambridge and T rinity College Dublin ski trip. On reaching Lech, a voice sounded from a loudspeaker: \"Welcome, Oxford, Cambridge and T rinity College Dublin, welcome to Lech. Unfortunately, as you can see, there is no snow.\" Ian passed his \"matric examinations\" in South Africa with six distinctions out of six, second highest in the whole country, and won the Yale Scholarship, awarded annually to two South Africans. In his senior year at Yale, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford - along with Bill Clinton - and first read Jurisprudence (Law), then Medicine there. Everyone who knew Ian admired his athletic ability. He excelled at tennis, rugby and cricket. Although not a criterion, in perhaps sixty sets of tennis with him I failed to win even one game. He trained as a psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital and worked with many of the eminent and creative psychiatrists of the time, eventually becoming a psychiatry consultant at St John's Hospital, Buckinghamshire. \"Despite his obvious intellectual gifts, Ian chose a clinical rather than 118 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College academic career, which enabled him to directly help innumerable people over the course of his life,\" wrote his Yale classmate Dan Begel. In 1981 he married Maja Skolimowska, an English lady of aristocratic Polish forebears, who gave him two intelligent and talented children, Keira, now a doctor treating infectious diseases, and Stuart, now an intellectual property lawyer. Sadly, Ian and Maja's marriage eventually came apart. He later met Abigail Armstrong. Abigail gave him two adorable little girls, Claudia and Romilly - who, sadly, would come to understand that their father was changing as dementia steadily took over, and alleviated the unhappiness of their parents these last sad years, as did two of Ian's medical colleagues, who visited him regularly. Yale classmates visited him when they learned of his illness. Dan Begel described these visits: \"In his last years and months we were not surprised to see that, throughout the progression of his illness, his disposition remained gracious and kind and his sense of humour intact. There persisted also intimations of his former intellectual and athletic prowess - still in full display on the tennis court.\" Claudia and Romilly cuddled him in bed the day before he died and said goodbye. Ian died on 4 February 2019, aged 72, in Willen Hospice near Milton Keynes, surrounded by Maja, Keira, Stuart, Abigail and Alastair Wood, his brother, who had very recently visited from South Africa and flown back shortly before Ian died. Bill Clinton was one of the first to write a condolence letter to Abigail, and here is what my wife, Carole, wrote: \"So many times does one go to a funeral for a pause to remember. As I listened to Mark Charnock's brilliant eulogy, I looked at the packed church and there were so many people who must have been filled with the same grief that I felt, preserving our private memories. What I most remember Ian for is always being there. Being there with his good common sense and at just the right time. I never went to the hospital that he did not come in the night before after a busy day and give real, common sense support sparkling with anecdotes. He was always the instigator of happy gatherings, starting in the days when we all met at Dudley's. It was those many good times that helped cement the cracks in life which we all have experienced. I have now lost enough people that I loved to realise that they don't just vanish; they continue to form the fabric of what one is. All of Ian's friends and family are indebted to you for your loving and intelligent care and understanding that made his last years so much better.\" Shelby Tucker The Chaplain's Report The past academic year began for the Chapel in a way familiar, musical and social - with no sense at all, of course, as to how the year would conclude. Even in lockdown, however, the Chapel continued to offer worship and reflection for its community and beyond through a series of innovative podcasts - more of that below. In Michaelmas and Hilary Terms, in addition to the Chaplain and Chapel Homilists (Avril Baigent and the Revd Stephen McCarthy), the Chapel welcomed a number of visiting preachers, including the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity, Canon Carol Harrison; the Revd Mary Gurr, Chaplain to the Homeless and chair of local charity the Oxford Winter Night Shelter (OWNS); the Revd Marcus Green, Rector of Steeple Aston and author of The Possibility of Difference: a Biblical Affirmation of Inclusivity (2018); and the Revd Nicholas Cheeseman, Area Director of Ordinands for Oxford Diocese. Professor Peter McCullough, Fellow and T utor in English at Lincoln College, preached for the Commemoration of Benefactors. As we have done for a few years, a joint service for Ash Wednesday followed by supper was conducted with the student choir from Christ Church and their Chaplain, the Revd Clare Hayns. However, with the College community dispersed all over the globe, T rinity Term demanded a new way of working. Led by our Organ Scholars and Chapelwardens, whose technical and creative skills are way beyond the Chaplain's, we produced a series of Chapel Podcasts that were enjoyed not only by members of the current College but had a truly international reach to friends, family and alumni. For preaching, we mainly drew on our Home Team, but were pleased that the Revd Barney Barron, a Baptist and Pioneer Minister in Looe, and parent of one of our students, was able to join us remotely and deliver an excellent sermon on T rinity Sunday - always a challenge for any preacher. In other areas of the Chapel's life and ministry, a few weddings planned for the summer had to be postponed in the hope that we will be able to report the happy event in next year's Pelican Record. Because of the necessity of podcasting in T rinity, we were only able to raise money for OWNS in Michaelmas and Hilary, but we did raise a total of \u00a31,695 for this important local charity. Covid has also delayed - but not defeated - the completion of the new altar frontal, and a service to mark its dedication; it is a gift of the Revds Elizabeth and Howard Nichols and featured in The Sundial (July 2020). We look forward to welcoming \"Blossom\", the stunning pelican depicted on the frontal, to her new home and celebrating a service dedicating the frontal in thankfulness to God.The Record Covid proved more than ever that nothing would get done in the Chapel without an incredible team of Organ Scholars and Chapelwardens. Matthew Murphy, Graduate Organ Scholar, completed four wonderful years, as well as his MSt in History; Brandon Qi joined us as Junior Organ Scholar and is our first organ scholar to be reading Music for some years. The Chapelwarden team - Augy Allain-Labon, Constance Everett-Pite, Putra - all ensured that the Chapel's liturgical life flourished. Poppy Miller took the role of \"Chapel Almoner\" to new heights and, with her colleagues, helped ensure that such a significant sum for OWNS was raised, as well as expertly managing the accounts for the termly Pizza Outing. We hope you've been able to join us online and we look forward to welcoming Old Members back to their College Chapel when it is safe, which we hope won't be too far in the future. Judith Maltby 120 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 121 Corpus Christi College Blossom, the new altar frontal, commissioned by Elizabeth and Howard Nichols (Physics, 1961) in thanksgiving for the College's 500th anniversary and their 50th wedding anniversary The Library The Pelican Record 2020 123Corpus Christi College In times of plague, scholars have historically fled Oxford, seeking sanctuary and fresh air, and ending up at distant college estates, or other upstart institutions. However, a national lockdown on the scale seen in 2020 was something unprecedented. In this terrible time of a global pandemic, it has been rewarding to see how this Library, part of one of the most traditional of institutions, has proved itself flexible and adaptable. The warning signs in March of the growing pandemic meant that the University could advise students to go home, if they could, at the end of Hilary Term. The College made contingency plans to reduce the risks to staff and students alike before the government enforced further restrictions. As the College marshalled its financial resources, the Library ended up with only two members of staff being kept from furlough. The Senior Library Assistant, Hannah Morgan, and I ended up working from home, although I also alternated site visits with the Archivist so that we could maintain the environmental conditions and the security of the College's historic and special collections. So what work could we do from home? With universities, colleges and libraries closed to physical access, collective efforts went into making resources accessible to a dispersed readership. A large part of our time was devoted to advising students and Fellows on the availability of electronic alternatives to resources normally accessed in paper form. All readers needed extra help to identify, locate and use the wide range of additional resources, via their various platforms. The Bodleian Libraries had diverted their print purchasing budget to fund electronic items (and were already obtaining more online content to support maths and physical and life sciences in the wake of the temporary relocation of the Radcliffe Science Library). There was also a varied and changing range of material made freely, albeit temporarily, available by publishers and organisations to support scholarship during university lockdowns both in the UK and abroad. Corpus Library, along with a number of other colleges, was able to fund new electronic book titles or more generous licences to existing online material. This enabled us to target relatively small sums in direct support of our members. Staff from the Bodleian Libraries placed the actual orders, meaning that these extra electronic resources were then available to the collegiate university. Over 300 electronic titles were funded by the college libraries in this way, often supporting material that the Bodleian Libraries would have struggled to offer on their own. However, demand for physical copies remained high, as so many scholarly works are only available in print form. At Corpus, like a number of other college libraries, we were able to order new copies of material to be delivered direct to readers' homes. I was also able, in my days on-site, to fetch and post out books sitting on our shelves, a service described as vital by 124 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 125 Corpus Christi College many of the students and Fellows using it. It should be remembered that not all students had left Oxford. There were those from overseas who had been unable to travel, as well as many graduate students, for whom Oxford is their home. They suffered the additional frustration of being physically near to the libraries and yet unable to access the books in these closed buildings. These students also benefited from my collection service, and in one or two cases I was even able to deliver them in person, in a socially distanced fashion, on my way home. While the Bodleian Libraries closed their doors to staff as well as readers, more attention was focused on the expansion of ORLO, Oxford Reading Lists Online. This software enables reading lists to connect with SOLO, Oxford's library catalogue, and thus to any electronic copies available there. As well as facilitating this access to existing resources, the software also supports the mounting of additional material online. New scans or born-digital copies of journal articles or book chapters can then be shared legitimately under the auspices of the Copyright Licensing Agency. With the Bodleian's book stock out of reach, college library staff on-site were sometimes called upon to provide scans. Of course, no single college library can have every book required, but collaborative efforts between colleges often saw us all pooling the resources within reach and the time available to share scans to the benefit of readers more generally. The College Librarians' network continues to prove an incredible support, with generous individuals sharing expertise, knowledge and help. There have been a wide range of approaches across Oxford to the Covid-19 lockdown and later restrictions, with varied uses of furlough, limited staff presence on-site and changing arrangements for working from home. It has been such a great help that material and time have been pooled informally during lockdown, with librarians on-site scanning material for finalists in colleges where staff or the stock are not present. It has been a pleasure to join such a strong and cheerful collaborative effort in these unexpected and challenging times. We have enjoyed sharing in these joint endeavours. There is professional satisfaction in locating and supplying material in a timely way. Social distance has not hindered personal communication, and it has been pleasing to get feedback, from finalists and taught postgraduates in particular, as to the importance of the material we were able to share, and the difference our contribution made to their studies. The role of information professionals, in providing material in one form or another, has proved key in supporting scholarly endeavour. The demand from returning students for access to the Library in the autumn has demonstrated the value and popularity of the Library as a place to read, study, write and think. This is rewarding and encouraging as the College takes its first practical steps towards building an extension to the Library, which will serve the future readers of the modern collection just as much as those consulting the College's special collections.

Between August 2019 and early 2020 business was much as normal; at which point, however, life in the archives, like much of the rest of our lives, came to be experienced largely remotely. Until the national lockdown in late March the archives continued to welcome research visitors, with research in the College manuscripts including fifteenth-century books of hours, the history of education, medieval philosophy, the medieval theory of music, the history of art, the Church and theatre in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Greek and fifteenth-century Humanism and the poetry of early seventeenth-century writer William Strode. Meanwhile, the archives have continued to attract researchers in subjects as diverse as French in England in the fifteenth century and early churchwardens' accounts, as well as research into College estates in Kent (Harefield) and Surrey (Milton). Inevitably, the closure of the archives to visitors at the end of March, preventing access during the normally peak seasons of the Easter and Long Vacations, meant a drop in overall visitor numbers. We still hosted 66 research visits, however, during the period August 2019 to March 2020, in comparison with the 77 visits during the same eight-month period in the previous year. In common with past years, well over half of research visits (46) were made by researchers from within the UK, of which ten were made by current members of Corpus Christi, with a further 31 made by researchers in Oxford beyond Corpus, drawn from ten different colleges and departments. British institutions beyond Oxford represented by visitors included the universities of Birmingham, Exeter, Glasgow, Keele, London (University College and the Courtauld Institute of Art) and St Andrews. Before the collections closed to researchers, we also hosted visits from scholars from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Switzerland and the USA. Regular readers of the archives report will be aware that, in addition to archives and manuscripts, the College's special collections house a small number of objects that, in their turn, require preservation care. At the grand end of the scale is the Founder's textile, a piece of silk cloth of gold commissioned by Bishop Fox for the Chapel (and the subject of an article in The Pelican Record XLVIII, 2012). Much more modest is a leather fire bucket, possibly dating from the eighteenth century but, in its own way, just as rare as the Founder's textile. Waterproofed with pitch inside and out, and painted with \"CCC\" in white letters, it is a sole survivor of a series of buckets that the College, like its fellow colleges and the city's churches, would have kept in readiness against the constant threat of fire.In an age before the existence of a publicly funded fire brigade, members of the College would have been expected to turn to and form a human chain to help fight a fire wherever it might occur in the city. And occur fires most certainly did. While colleges, with their stout stone walls, might look solid and fireproof, they are largely built round a timber frame, with internal walls in-filled with wattle and daub. The domestic, commercial and industrial buildings of Oxford were frequently of similar materials, often with the addition of thatched roofs. In 1671 the city's magistrates renewed orders banning the use of thatch on buildings within the city - orders originally issued almost a century earlier, but often ignored. The Liber Magnus (the annual domestic account) for 1625 records the payment of \u00a32 10s for \"quenching the fire\" in an unspecified location, with a further sum for timber to hang the buckets up on their return. T wo fires occurred in the summer of 1639, when the College spent \u00a31 \"for mending the buckets in the hall after the fire at the George\" (presumably the public house of that name in George Street) in May, followed by another fire in July, after which \u00a31 8s 10d was spent on \"making and mending buckets\". The buckets may have been hung above head height along the screen at the entrance to the hall, where they would have been ready for an emergency. They were subsequently relocated to just inside the chapel, where they would have hung from the wooden pegs still present along the west wall. Major catastrophe was to hit the city, however, in October 1644 when, on the afternoon of Sunday 6 October, a fire broke out once again on George Street. Fanned by a strong northerly wind, it raged for ten hours or more, burning a corridor in the properties between Cornmarket and New Inn Hall Street, before jumping what is now Queen Street and continuing down the west side of St Aldate's before eventually expiring when it reached the Thames. By midnight, properties in five parishes had been destroyed, estimated at between 200 and 300 houses, and countless other properties, such as bakehouses, brewhouses, stables, barns and pigsties. On 16 October the Bursars of Corpus Christi accounted for \u00a31 spent \"gathering up and mending the buckets used about quenching the great fire\". Colleges were not exempt from the risk of fire. A fire in Christ Church's Tom Quad in January 1688 was blamed on two students leaving a fire burning in their chamber when they went to dinner. A fire damaged several chambers in Magdalen in October 1690, while a fire in Exeter in 1709 destroyed the library almost completely. The handle on the Corpus fire bucket has become detached but, otherwise, the stitching is in sound condition. Centuries of standing idle have rendered the waterproofing rock solid and susceptible to impact damage. After decades of being stored in a reused cardboard box that gave little protection, the fire bucket has now been provided with its own made-to-measure lidded box supplied by the Bodleian's packaging unit. We can only guess at the events it witnessed during its working life, but it is now enjoying a long and safe retirement. Julian Reid, Archivist 130 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 131 Corpus Christi College The Junior Common Room 132 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 133 Corpus Christi College pandemic but, in true Corpus fashion, we did not moan about what we could not do and instead came up with alternative events. There have been bake-offs, pub quizzes, yoga, Netflix party film nights and more. Indeed, JCR hustings improved massively when done through Zoom as they lasted less than an hour instead of the usual four-hour extravaganza. Much of the JCR's work over T rinity Term centred around the fight against racism, following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. We affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, donated to several anti-racism charities and held two extraordinary JCR meetings to table a variety of motions to tackle racism and racial inequality at Oxford. The JCR, the MCR and the College all issued strong statements condemning racism and advocating an actively anti-racist stance. Going forward, the JCR, MCR and College will work together to ensure that Corpus backs up its anti-racist statements with action. Overall, it has been another successful year in which the JCR has fulfilled its roles as a family for Corpus members, a negotiator and partner with College, and a student voice within the University. We will face next year in the same spirit as in T rinity and will welcome our new set of freshers with (at least metaphorically) open arms. Matt Carlton, JCR PresidentThis has been an extraordinary year for the JCR in several ways. There has of course been the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but we have also created our own drama, as this was \"The Year of Three Presidents\". Rhiannon Ogden-Jones ran a tight ship in Michaelmas. Freshers' Week was a massive success and, for the first time, a night out to Plush (Oxford's only gay club) was included as one of the main freshers' club nights. After the mayhem of Freshers' Week, everyone quickly settled down into the rhythms of Oxford life. A new addition to Corpus this year has been the Pelican Fund. This has gone towards large-scale projects that improve the student experience, including buzzers for the University Challenge team (they have made it into the filmed rounds this year!), a new pool table for the Beer Cellar and new rugby kit for the men's and women's teams. Thank you to all the alumni who made the fund possible. There has also been another step forward in Corpus JCR's work for the environment. Our Environment and Ethics Representative, Freya Chambers, substantially contributed to and guided an environmental policy document through College committees. This has led to partial divestment, more recycling, zero to landfill and a drive for cleaner energy. These policy changes have been supported by smaller JCR-wide initiatives, such as a visit from the organiser of the Hogacre Common allotment (Corpus's old sports ground) and a Vegetarian Formal. The more conscientious members of the JCR have even made sure that we do not buy tea bags that contain plastic. Hilary Term brought Rhiannon's presidency to a close and ushered in Ed Hart. He was seen as a bit of a dark horse in the election as a fourth-year maths student with Finals in the summer, but his charisma won over the JCR and he proved an excellent President until he stepped down for Finals. The JCR created a third Welfare Officer post to provide additional support for students and a Class Representative to make sure that it is an inclusive place for every kind of socioeconomic background. Other projects over the term and the Easter vacation included a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful defence of the Corpus Cup at Corpus Challenge, as well as the election of next year's Ball Committee. Up until this point, the JCR had enjoyed its usual quota of sweaty bops, lush teas and pizza- filled JCR meetings. T rinity was rather different, but the JCR adapted admirably. A Zoom Pro account was purchased and the virtual JCR was born. After overseeing this transition to an online JCR, Ed bade us a fond farewell to focus on Finals and I was elected for the remaining half-year. I felt some trepidation about whether the JCR would become dormant during the The Middle Common Room This year we welcomed over forty new graduates into the MCR, hailing from locations from Iceland to South Africa. Many became actively involved in the social life of the Common Room, each adding their own contributions over the syncopated academic year. T rinity Term fell victim to the global coronavirus pandemic, unfortunately reducing the time spent together as a cohort. In spite of this crisis, the MCR - under the new leadership of Faseeha Ayaz and the Committee - was active in maintaining contact with graduates and keeping them involved with events such as online Welfare Tea meet-ups, enabling graduates to check in with their fellow MCR members now scattered across the country and abroad. Prior to the crisis, the MCR continued its function as an active and social community, always a place of relaxation, support and cohesiveness with students at various stages of their degrees. Coming into the MCR during the day, it wasn't unusual to find a DPhil student in English literature discussing EU politics with an MSt in Classics, a German extolling Brahms to an Australian or a debate about quantum computers between a statistician and a physicist. Each member brings with them their own life experiences, academic talents and distinctive personalities, converging in the MCR from all walks of life for a single, shared, common love - free coffee. One of my proudest achievements as MCR President was multiplying the role of Food Officer three-fold, equipping the Committee with unprecedented executive powers to order food and drink, organise Friday night formal hall sign-ups and arrange special dinners for graduates throughout the year. Like the mythical Cerberus diligently maintaining guard of the Underworld, this troika of Food Officers ensured that MCR members would never again go a whole week without coffee or biscuits. My thanks go to Jonathan Shapiro, Max Jenkins and Tyson Jones. After the capable and steadfast tenure of my predecessor Ian O'Grady, it was my job to continue to ensure that the well-being of graduates remained priority number one. This was made easier by the noble last feat of Ian and his Committee in the ordering of a new coffee machine for the MCR kitchen. In addition to expanding the MCR Committee, our supremely capable Entertainment Officers, Robert Laurella and Kate Farrow, continued to organise a host of social events throughout the year, including a great Freshers' Week and MCR exchange dinner events (with Jesus, Christ Church, Exeter and Merton). Apart from the array of socialising opportunities, the MCR also became proactive in organising academic presentations under the leadership of our Academic Officer, Faseeha Ayaz. Some of these events included MCR-SCR Seminars, where graduates would present their research to members of both common rooms, in addition to the well-attended Lightning Talks, in which groups of graduates gave individual ten-minute presentations on a diverse range of topics ranging from the conflict in Kashmir to the poetry of William Blake. Weekly \"SCRunches\" were also a feature of MCR life, with graduates (often DPhils) regularly attending lunch in the SCR to discuss a broad array of topics with Fellows. One in particular stands out in my memory: a lunch at which Dr. Anna Marmadoro initiated a lively discussion about free will versus determinism with input from scientists, legal theorists, classicists and historians. In conjunction with the JCR, the MCR also organised a charity formal night in Week Seven of Hilary Term, with a proportion of dinner admission fees going to the British Red Cross's \"It Starts with Her\" fundraising appeal, helping to build sustainable livelihoods and safer communities in Bangladesh. In addition to wearing her Academic Officer hat, Faseeha also superbly organised events under her Diversity Officer responsibilities. The MCR hosted a food extravaganza in Michaelmas as part of Black History Month, providing Ethiopian cuisine, drinks and dessert and, in conjunction with our talented IT Officer, Tom Fay, it also hosted a Black History Month Film Night, all of which was a great success. Film nights in general were a regular feature of this year's MCR, and Tom was always generous in giving his time to organising these. Our Welfare Officers, Alma Chapet-Batlle and Nik Kandolf, continued the success of the Welfare Teas throughout Michaelmas and Hilary Terms, which were consistently well attended. The smooth running of MCR administrative matters was largely thanks to the efforts of our Secretary, Patrick Inns, who would diligently compile minutes to General Meetings and make sure that important constitutional amendments were clearly and transparently publicised for discussion and feedback. One particular amendment was the redrafting of the MCR Constitution to reflect gender neutrality, in line with the JCR's Constitution. This required legal expertise from former MCR members, as well as liaising with members of the SCR for final approval by Governing Body. Thanks must also be given to our T reasurers, beginning with Martin Madej, who handed over to Sinan Shi; both were extremely organised and judicious (but not to the point of frugality) with the MCR budget. My year as MCR President can be best described by paraphrasing Heraclitus' analogy of change: one never steps into the same river twice. Though the MCR space seems largely obdurate to the flux of time, it is, nevertheless, a site of intense change. The comings and goings of the people who give it life, from fresher MSts to final year DPhils, the interactions, the bonds and the friendships that form within it, the memories that shape one's time there all wax and wane. It is no secret that Corpus MCR is smaller compared with other colleges, but I viewed this as a boon for graduates, helping each get to know the other quicker, in a less imposing environment, and it provided a space of closer solidarity and companionship. For me personally, I began my presidency in early 2019 frequently preoccupied with the dreaded \"loss of control\", whether it was upcoming Committee issues or the prized music playlist at an MCR bop. Yet as the months passed, there was a realisation that control was not at all a sine qua non in such an environment, and while it was at times comical to other members, that kind of approach to leadership was unnecessary to the ethos of the Corpus MCR. As I progressed through my presidency, I came 134 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 135 Corpus Christi College 136 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 137 Corpus Christi College to understand the MCR not as something to be \"managed\", but rather a space of potentiality, where things emerge in the light of just being oneself. At root, the MCR provides a space for students to build connections that may last a lifetime. It creates moments, a place in which the concatenation of daily experiences - sometimes banal, sometimes vivacious and special - emerges as a sincere reminiscence, to be valued more so later in one's life. Though home may be far away for many of us, the MCR provides a site of homeliness and the familiar, where everything from chatting about an upcoming exam to falling in love can coalesce into a single contiguous experience. For some, such experiences will probably never be forgotten: formed in the ebb and flow of interactions within the MCR's four walls, they form the hidden nodes of one's Oxford life. For others, their time in the MCR may simply be just another experience, neither formative nor particularly life-changing, but memorable and rewarding nonetheless. In either case, the act of stepping into the MCR space each day was simultaneously both an excitement and a simple comfort from the daily hustle and bustle. To end, I recall a memory a few months ago, before I had left Oxford to head back to Australia, as Covid-19 immured the world. Most graduates were, by now, fleeing back to their home countries, as I was about to do, or to self-isolation in their student accommodation - there was a strange air of unreality to everything. The MCR was to be locked up indefinitely, so I made a final visit before leaving College. After a last cup of coffee, I turned to look at the Common Room, seeing it, at first, as austere and empty with the afternoon sun dripping through the windows, then, not so much as a room but a carousel of memories. There I could recall faces and voices from when I first stepped inside it only two years earlier. The room evoked pockets of raucous laughter at some timely moment, extended conversations with people that would come to deeply change how I thought about certain ideas, an embarrassing moment or three, and remembrances of interactions from which deep and lasting friendships had been forged - all of which I now had to leave behind. The Common Room, in that light and at that moment of separation, provided one of those instants Nabokov saw as epiphanies of timelessness. Moments created and shared, for only a very brief duration since I had first arrived in Oxford in 2018, which had swelled into this permanent collection of vivid memories that I hope to never forget. I left the MCR with Ferris Bueller's famous lines coming to mind: \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" It was a pleasure to serve as MCR President for 2019-2020, and I hope that my fellow MCR members were able to create fond memories for themselves, and continue to cherish them later in life. Christopher Dowson, MCR PresidentThe Chapel Choir Following a thrilling choir tour and a few summer months of replenishment, Corpus Choir settled back into its comfortable rhythm of rehearsals and services, welcoming several new members and a new Junior Organ Scholar, Brandon Qi, all the way from Connecticut. The first Evensong of term featured some traditional favourites, Bruckner's Locus Iste and Stanford in C - much to everyone's delight. Other canticle settings for the term included Stanford in B flat, Walmisley in D minor and Dyson in F . The mid-term All Souls Eucharist was, as always, a special and touching occasion, not least because it marked the culmination of weeks of hard work on the Faur\u00e9 Requiem - a piece of music hitherto unknown to many of our new members, and sung so sensitively and richly by a choir only recently assembled (and yes, with some screws that still needed tightening!). The Pie Jesu was performed by Anna Blomley, and the Libera me baritone solo by choral bursary holder Augy Allain-Labon. We were delighted to welcome instrumentalists Helen Leung (violin) and Zaman Keineth-Esmail (cello) to the ensemble, who, together with Brandon on organ, professionally brought the score to life. The choir enjoyed a well-earned buffet in the Rainolds Room afterwards. Later in Michaelmas the choir joined forces with the Christ Church College Choir in an Evensong at the Cathedral. Before we knew it, the Christmas rush was in motion. Among some of our \"fringe\" Christmas engagements was the now well-established \"Carols in the Quad\", which never fails to gather an audience, most of whom come trickling out of the Library and the JCR to see what all the fuss was about, braving the biting cold. It was no doubt an added incentive that this year, for the first time, freshly baked mince pies were on offer. Later in the week a small contingent of singers also made the usual trip to New Hinksey Primary School to sing carols at their Christmas Bazaar. The pinnacle of the season, however, was our traditional pairing of carol services in Eighth Week, delivered to a College Chapel packed to the rafters, in a way that is scarcely imaginable in our present times. The choir's programme was varied, uplifting and musically challenging - a witness to how far it had progressed in barely two months. As ever, the aim was to seamlessly bridge the gap between Advent and Christmas, and so we took our listeners on a journey from Ravenscroft's Remember O thou man and Malcolm Archer's The Linden Tree Carol to Howells's majestical A Yim), Rutter's Nativity Carol and finally a rousing arrangement of Ding Dong! Merrily on High by David Willcocks. All this was buttressed by the usual congregational favourites. Carol services at Corpus are much like Christmas Day itself - a chance to welcome back old faces to boost our numbers and to liven our spirits. With the traditional mince pies, Christmas dinner, post-food singalong and choir Nativity play, we finished the term in a suitably festive mood. Following 138 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 139 Corpus Christi College the final carol service, I heard an elderly alumnus remark, \"That was the most beautiful service I've ever been to\" - and the choir deserves all the credit for making the notes on the score into a thing of beauty. The following term started with a service to mark the feast of the Epiphany, with the choir singing Peter Warlock's Bethlehem Down and Cornelius's The Three Kings. We later sang Evensong in Christ Church Cathedral, with music by Purcell and Stanford. Then, for Ash Wednesday, we once again joined forces with Christ Church College Choir, this time on home soil. This service of Holy Communion featured Greene's Lord let me know mine end, which, against all the odds, became something of a choir favourite. In true Lenten spirit, we feasted upon another lavish buffet following the service and enjoyed mingling with our Christ Church friends. With term drawing to a close, we made our usual Sunday morning pilgrimage to St Nicholas's Church in the village of Islip. The Eucharist included a repeat of Greene's Lord, let me know mine end, along with Charles Wood's Communion Service in the Phrygian Mode. We were also thrilled to collaborate with the Islip Brass Ensemble in performing a rousing arrangement of All people that on earth do dwell - the sort of thing typically reserved for coronations and the like. As ever, we were extended the warmest welcome by our hosts, Canon Brian Mountford, the Reverend Lucy Thirtle and of course Annette Mountford, who had prepared a vast spread of food and drink for us. Another success which deserves highlighting is that of the five-strong Corpus Choir football team which, while lacking strength in numbers, compensated with a degree of skill and sportsmanship which saw them knock out much larger teams as they sailed their way to the quarter-finals of the inter-choir football tournament. We concluded the term with the \"Passion Service\" - a series of readings and pieces of choral music inspiring reflection upon the suffering and death of Christ. The choir's offering included Bairstow's The Lamentation, Victoria's O vos omnes, Farrant's Hide not thy O Lord and Severac's T antum Ergo. Our termly pizza outing ensued, followed by our glamorous annual choir dinner later in Eighth Week. I closed a short address at the end of said dinner with a remark about how much I was looking forward to T rinity Term with the choir, and even the possibility of a continental choir tour thereafter. Little did we know that these aspirations would never be realised. Looking back at the last week of Hilary Term, I can't help but be struck by how much of what we did - the travelling (albeit a ten-minute train journey), the sharing of food and drink and the music- making - is almost beyond contemplation in our current circumstances. In that regard, I think the choir is all the more thankful that we made the most of these opportunities while we could. And so T rinity Term began to take shape in a way that seemed to make the choir's job just about impossible. Nevertheless there was a feeling that, at the very least, our sense of group cohesion and togetherness could not be abandoned. But in the end we did more than simply host a weekly Zoom call for the sake of our own sanity: in resolving to produce a series of podcasts, the choir was able to keep making music in a way that engaged widely with the rest of the College and its alumni, scattered across the world. As soon as I had made sense of the basic technology, \"virtual choir\" performances became a regular feature of our weekly digital offering. For just about everyone concerned, this was a step outside their own comfort zone in different ways: for some, grappling with unfamiliar software posed a challenge; for others, The Carol Service 2019 The Virtual Choir, T rinity 2020140 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 141 Corpus Christi College singing alone and recording oneself was daunting. There were bumps along the road - perhaps most memorably when, on Ascension Day, a YouT ube copyright \"bot\" mistook a Corpus Choir recording of Stanford's Coelos Ascendit Hodie for the choir of Westminster Abbey! An easy mistake to make, of course. I, for one, enjoyed the technical operation and found it tremendously satisfying to receive everyone's individual contributions (each of which was like a Christmas present) and then to piece them together into something harmonious. Perhaps most satisfying was the fact that, with certainty, I noticed every singer improve over the course of the term, with some members singing more confidently than they ever did as part of the \"real life\" choir. This is so much more than a mere \"silver lining\" - it is laying the foundations for stronger vocal technique and confidence, which, when we are assembled physically and under more pressure, is often difficult to cultivate on an individual level. As a virtual choir, we undertook increasingly more challenging repertoire as the term progressed, as the technology became less troublesome and as I, as director, developed more effective methods for keeping everyone's voices in tune and in time. And so, having started the term with some basic hymns, we finished with some Renaissance anthems such as Batten's O sing joyfully and Tallis's Verily, verily, I say unto you on Corpus Christi Day. The term was poignantly brought to a close with a service of Compline, which I led in conjunction with alto choral bursary holder Poppy Miller. Along with Poppy, special thanks must go to all our choral bursary holders: Constance Everett- Pite (soprano), Bethanne Ben Wilson (tenor) and Augy Allain- Labon (bass). They have been true pillars of support for the choir, in more ways that just the musical. We are hugely indebted to our chaplain, Judith Maltby, for ensuring that the chapel is such a well-oiled machine, but also for giving organ scholars and choir the space to grow, take initiative and even to make mistakes. Thanks must also go to Dr. Katie Pardee for lending a professional musical hand and developing my talents at both the organ console and at the conductor's podium. I also owe thanks to Brandon for being so supportive, cooperative and diligent. On a personal note, this brings to an end four wonderful years for me as Organ Scholar. I have had the most joyful, enriching and fulfilling experiences with Corpus Choir and as part of the Chapel community, and the journey has brought me life-long friendships and unforgettable memories. Many thanks to everyone I've worked with over that time - it's been a tremendous pleasure.

Graduate Organ Scholar: Matthew Murphy Junior Organ Scholar: Brandon Qi Matthew Murphy, Graduate Organ ScholarClubs and Societies Charities Charities events this year have included the Corpus Christi College Christmas Charity Concert, a Charity Karaoke Night and a Charities Formal. Sadly, the Tortoise Fair was cancelled owing to Covid-19. The Charities Levy raises \u00a33,000 for charity each term, and the charities this goes to are voted on by JCR members. Charities to benefit this year have included M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, GiveDirectly and The Life You Can Save. And, rather bizarrely, Toilet T winning: by donating \u00a360 to twin your toilet, you fund a project in a poor community that will enable families to build a basic toilet, have access to clean water and learn about hygiene, a vital combination that saves lives. When you do this, the charity sends a certificate to hang in your loo - showing a photograph of your overseas toilet twin and GPS coordinates so you can look up its location on Google Maps. We now have these certificates on display in the JCR loos. Adam Winnifrith Foxe, the College Tortoise 142 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 143 Corpus Christi College The Cheese Society The Corpus Cheese Society (Communio Collegii Corporis Christi Caesei Consumendi Causa) had a strong two terms in Michaelmas and Hilary, with many new members joining the society, leading to some of the largest meetings we have ever held. We have had meetings with over 20 attendees across a range of academic years - including a welcome return by our previous President Oscar Beighton, when he was visiting Oxford for work. We have continued to work to make the Cheese Society accessible to all in College, as demonstrated by our mailing list now having nearly 150 subscribers, from which a varying group of between 10 and 20 attend each meeting, depending on their other personal and academic commitments. We have also worked to make the society more technologically advanced, with the continuation of the Presidential Archive, providing a rating out of 100 for each cheese we have tasted, as well as the use of a Google Form to more efficiently collect weekly sign-ups, integrated with a spreadsheet to keep track of the society's finances. These finances have been greatly helped by College Clubs and Societies funding, allowing us to regularly offer seven or more different cheeses at each meeting, while keeping the cost in the range of \u00a33-\u00a34 per head. The funding has also allowed us to purchase a set of cheeseboards and cheese knives for the society, as those that were used in previous years were owned by the president personally. These will be passed on to the next President of the society to be used over the coming years. I am extremely grateful to Oscar for allowing me to take over the running of the society, which I have become more and more passionate about the more I learn about cheese. We have been able to continue our close link with the Oxford Cheese Company, located in the Covered Market, from whom we have received invaluable advice and recommendations on the best cheeses available at the time. I would like to thank my amazing Vice-President Chloe for all her help with the researching and purchasing of cheese, as well as with the running of the meetings. I am also extremely grateful to all those who have attended a meeting of the Cheese Society this year, without whom we would not have been able to run such a successful and welcoming society. Ryan Salter The Classics Society Everything seemed normal for the Classics Society at the beginning of this year, with ex- President Rupert Casson organising a pub crawl and a (somewhat messy) crew date to welcome the new freshers into the community, and some squad trips to see some quality classical theatre both in Oxford and beyond. Michaelmas also saw some fascinating entries from Corpuscles in the Alexandria Classics journal. Hilary, too, started off full of hope for the future. The amazing Constance Everett-Pite was busy making plans for the Corpus Garden Play to take place in T rinity: having produced her own translation of Euripides' Helen, the Fellows' Garden was all set to be transformed into a Las Vegas casino to set the scene for the tragicomedy. But something was in the air in Hilary, something strangely reminiscent of the plague that struck fifth-century Athens back in the day. So it was with great sadness that Constance decided to postpone the play to another, more normal time - so watch this space! Undaunted by the virus, the brave cohort of second years faced the two-pronged pressures of Mods and coronavirus, bolstered by a Mods tea organised by Rupert and others. They got through it, and of course found ways to celebrate their new- found freedom despite the limitations imposed by the virus. It was in this new world that I took the reins of the society for T rinity. Other than providing some home-delivered care packages (copious amounts of Lindt truffles) for the long-suffering finalists, setting up a Facebook page for home recreations of classical artworks, and pledging the society's support for anti-racist reforms in the Classics Faculty, it has been rather quiet for the Classics Society this term. I hope we will have a chance to make up for it when we're all back together again. Augustine Allain-Labon Corpus Challenge At 7am on a cold February morning, eighty or so bleary-eyed Corpuscles boarded a coach from the High Street for Cambridge. They were answering the centuries-old call to arms for the Corpus Challenge. The 2020 edition of this hallowed event nearly did not happen at all, however, as our weaker- minded brethren at Cambridge had tried to cancel because it was windy. They had clearly forgotten that this was Corpus \"Challenge\" not Corpus \"Chill Day Out\" and we made it clear that they had better be ready to receive us. Far greater spirit was shown by our coach driver Zoltan. When we sent him a text to check if he was happy to drive us to Cambridge in 70mph gale-force winds, he sent this reply: \"Hi Matt! I really have no clue about the weather, have not even moved out of bed today, but Google says the roads are ok. Don't u worry about it and have no fear! Come rain or shine, I promise u we will get u there just fine and on time!!!\" 144 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 145 Corpus Christi College We arrived at Cambridge and went to their sports ground. Their football and rugby teams were there in force and ready to go but their netball, lacrosse, tennis and rounders teams had all decided to go AWOL. This was very disappointing, especially considering that we had brought three netball elevens and a tennis Blue and had sourced lacrosse sticks from far and wide. There were even whispers of foul play, that the Cambridge team had used the weather as an excuse to avoid an inevitable thrashing by Roman Kenny-Manning at tennis like the year before. They were also clearly terrified by the prospect of the Corpus Oxford netball and lacrosse powerhouse. In any case, the other sports took place, despite fierce winds that eventually brought down a large tree on the side of the football field. Corpus won the Men's 1sts football through a heroic penalty shoot-out, after George Taylor stroked home the winning penalty under intense pressure. It must be admitted that even his closest friends were of the firm opinion that he would choke and miss. The Women's 1sts and Men's 2nds football came up against strong sides and suffered defeats, but Corpus continued its dominance at rugby, winning the Men's contact and Mixed touch matches. The rest of the field matches were evenly balanced. Corpus men won the tug-of-war while the women lost, and we also suffered a defeat in the dreaded battle of the ergs. We then went back to Corpus Cambridge for quizzing, bar sports and formal. We obliterated Cambridge at quizzing (watch out University Challenge) and put in a strong performance at the pool table. We sadly came unstuck in table-tennis, table football and FIFA. Our dedicated team of analysts have come to the conclusion that these defeats came about through a combination of marginal gains theory and our lack of a table football table at Oxford. Formal was excellent, but some of the rowdier Cambridge students started chanting before their High Table had left. It was with some raised eyebrows that we saw a later email claiming Oxford was to blame for this behaviour. It was also announced after formal that Cambridge had won this year's Corpus Challenge. We were gracious in defeat, but our undeployed netball, lacrosse, rounders and tennis teams will be thirsting for revenge next year. All that remained was a little trip to check that Cambridge's clubbing scene was still far worse than ours. It was. We entered Sunday Life to find a half-empty club with a middle-aged DJ on the decks engaged in some weird form of club karaoke with people who really couldn't sing. Now that Corpus Oxford outnumbered everyone else in the club, we decided to leave our mark and spice things up. Corpus students have been loving their sea shanties this year, so of course we sent up Ben Wilson to lead a classic rendition of John Kanaka. It brought a tear to many an eye. At 12.30am, a ragtag posse of Corpuscles staggered out into the cold night air and somehow found its way to our pick-up point. Corpus Challenge remains a highlight of the year which brings together the whole Corpus community, be it finalists or freshers, and it reminds us that our counterparts in Cambridge are really lovely people, however fun it is to talk up the Corpus-Corpus rivalry. Matt CarltonCricket While the main cricket season was inevitably cancelled, the Corpus Christi College Cricket Club, also known by the tongue twister \"CCCCC\", had a very productive two terms of indoor training. We hosted weekly sessions at Magdalen College School, which very generously gave us access to a fleet of bowling machines. These sessions allowed us to integrate the freshers into the team and to introduce them to the whimsical world of college cricket. Many anecdotes were shared of Cuppers matches on the treacle pitches of St Hugh's, along with tales of our infamously poor standard of fielding. The overall quality of cricket was very high, as Corpus now has two Blues cricketers and two University development squad players, while the bowling machine allowed the more experienced players to give advice on technique to new players. It was great to see many freshers and beginners getting involved, as the Corpus team prides itself on its ability to compete at high levels while still encouraging and fielding players of all abilities. We had been training with particular enthusiasm given that we had an away day to Corpus Cambridge planned, but our chance to show the Tabs has unfortunately been delayed to next year. Admittedly, there were some low points: my foray into using a sidearm ended with disastrous consequences, notoriously dodgy tail-ender Matt Carlton's driving, to the venue and in the nets, was temperamental and our Blues bowler, David Brown, hasn't quite mastered the art of not getting nets tangled when stowing them away, much to the amusement of the badminton team who had booked the hall after us. The highlight of the cricket calendar is the famous \"Clock Match\", an all-day match against Corpus alumni. We were working to try and host this match later in the summer, allowing final year Corpus students to play from the home dressing room for one last time. Looking ahead, it seems as if next summer we will be able to have a full fixture list and, judging by the strength of our squad, we will be aiming for a top three finish in Division One. Arjun Bhardwaj Frederick Pollock Law Society The society has had a busy year, holding a number of events for both Law and non-Law students under Presidents Hannah Taylor and Heather Cowgill. Over the summer period, the society successfully secured the sponsorship of Norton Rose Fulbright, a Magic Circle law firm. With this support, we were able to invest further in the Book Loan scheme, which aims to provide a complete set of law textbooks for every student. The society takes great pride in maintaining the scheme, which works to ease the financial burden on students. Recently, we obtained additional sponsorship from international law firm Withers LLP , which we hope the next set of presidents can use to continue the scheme next year.146 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 147 Corpus Christi College Michaelmas 2019 began with an informal drinks event to welcome the new freshers and saw all year groups mix together after the long summer vacation. The society also held its first dinner of the year with Sullivan & Cromwell LLP , with whom we have a long and established relationship. We were joined by a group of solicitors from London, who met a number of Corpus students from a range of year groups and subjects. That same term, we held a dinner with the law firm Freshfields, jointly with students from Jesus College. Outside of traditional society events like law dinners, the Corpus Law Diary, published on the Corpus website, has grown this term, with entries being written every week by everyone involved with law at Corpus, including our tutors. The Corpus Law Diary aims to give prospective students a real insight into the daily life of a law student, which we hope will make studying law at Corpus feel more accessible. Our favourite Hilary Term event, Make Your Case Night, had a surprise twist this year. The event was (temporarily) renamed Advocate for Your Legislation Night and, instead of presenting a case, we had to choose a statute and argue why it deserved to be recognised as the most important piece of legislation. Statutes presented varied from ancient laws on swan ownership to legislation from different jurisdictions, Albania and Brazil being just two examples. The individual presentations often used props, such as an inflatable swan, and one memorable performance even included a song about the statute. The night also featured a remote appearance from our very own Dr. Matt Dyson, who was on sabbatical. The society has had a fantastic year, and despite the annual alumni dinner having to be cancelled due to the public health crisis, we are very proud to have organised so many events. We hope that everyone who attended enjoyed themselves and learned that law can be as interesting and as diverse as the people who study it. Heather Cowgill Golf This year will go down in Corpus history for the birth of Corpus Golf Soc. We held fortnightly trips to the floodlit driving range at Oxford Golf Centre on Binsey Lane, and many a happy evening was spent sending moon balls and stingers out into the night. A highlight of the year came in February, when the Isis burst its banks and flooded the range. This meant we could hit low skimming shots over the water. Golf Soc has welcomed players of all abilities. We have several experienced players who used the sessions not only to hone their own game but also to teach the beginners who came along. Of course, golf is a taxing endurance sport, so all range sessions were followed by a trip to The Perch to warm down. We had planned to take our work out onto Oxford Golf Club's course in the summer and enter a few teams for Cuppers, but sadly coronavirus has delayed this part of the Corpus golf masterplan. This is only the beginning, though, and Corpus Golf will come back stronger next year. Adam Winnifrith Men's Football The 2019/2020 season was approached with great anticipation by the players of CCCFC. The end of the previous season had seen us lose a large number of the \"old guard\", but promising whispers (and secondary school connections) meant that the new leadership of George Taylor and Will Andrews were confident about the incoming crop of players. The arrivals of Francesco Cipriani, Joe Layzell and Murray Whitaker (among many others) are sure to prove bargain transfers in the years to come. The league fixtures started in the most traditional Corpus fashion, with the team only managing to get ten players out for the first 45 minutes, and going 3-0 down to Lincoln. Yet early optimism about where the season might lead was shown to be well placed, as the arrival of the eleventh man saw us pile pressure on, dominating the second half and walking away with a 3-3 draw and a well-deserved point. Exits in the first round of both Cuppers and the Hassan's Cup were always on the cards, and the team did well not to be too disheartened by these results. Aside from two conclusive defeats to Magdalen, Corpus looked like one of the better sides in the league, and fixture problems (due to the weather and the amazing St Hilda's Cuppers run) were the main factors in preventing us from attaining a better league position than last year (still the third worst team in the top divisions!). For the Seconds things continued much as usual, with strong performances on the field not being rewarded with just results. Insider knowledge of the St Anne's third team confirmed that Anne's fielded at least two University-level players in their fixture against CCCFC, providing evidence of how unlucky the Seconds were at times to finish second bottom in the league. The highlight of the season for the Firsts was naturally our thrilling win on penalties over the much inferior Corpus Cambridge side, as part of Corpus Challenge. We kicked off the day's events, after early-morning travel to a very windy Cambridge, and fell behind to a fortunate, wind-assisted goal. Yet we were all over them, and courtesy of a wonder goal by Alex \"President of All Things Football\" Guzel, and some assured penalty finishes, we walked away with the 148 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 149 Corpus Christi College three points. The Seconds played out a thriller, succumbing to a narrow 9-5 loss - maybe if Choir football semi-final hat-trick hero Ben Wilson had been up front instead of in goal it might have been a narrower margin. When talking of the new Firsts' captains, I need only remind the team of Filippo's Goal of the Season wonder strike, a powerful trivella into the roof of the net, and the consistency and poise with which Richard Kirkham marshalled our defence. As they have done for the past few years, I will let their football speak for them, although I feel obliged to add that they're also damn good blokes. I wish them the best, and look forward to thrashing them at the Old Boys match next year. The Seconds will see a seamless transition from the calm, assured (and quite laissez-faire) approach of Tom Hopper and Adam Dalrymple to the tactical genius of Augy Allain-Labon and Wolff Lambert. I trust they will keep the atmosphere of the team as it should be - fun, friendly and accepting of all keen footballers. George T aylor The Music Society It has been an exciting year for the Corpus Music Society. The society has grown in member numbers and its presence in College life has been felt more than ever, with a variety of new events enjoyed by musicians and non-musicians alike. We started a bi-weekly lunchtime recital series, \"Choons in the Chapel\", at the start of the year to offer our musicians a relaxed performance opportunity and a chance to collaborate with one another. Listeners in the Chapel (and the Library above) enjoyed informal performances from singers, pianists and other instrumentalists, as well as ensembles including our own College string quartet and a flute quartet. Equally successful were the open mic jazz evenings, \"Jazz n 5th Week Blues\", in the Beer Cellar. It was wonderful to see the bar come to life after formal when filled with live music from singers and players of every year group. Alongside this we have had a weekly newsletter listing music events in College and in Oxford, and a weekly evening gathering in the auditorium for relaxed practice and playing together. We were also lucky enough to welcome a guest pianist, Julian T revelyan, to play a recital in our auditorium in Hilary Term. We have even managed to stay busy remotely, taking our termly jazz event online. Phoebe T ealby-WatsonNetball Corpus Netball had absolutely smashing Michaelmas and Hilary terms, coming in decent second and third places respectively in the Third Division. Although we didn't get to take part in Cuppers because of the cancelled T rinity Term, we're sure that our members would have turned up admirably. We also saw a lot of enthusiasm from the boys for mixed netball (especially for Corpus Challenge) and could depend on them each week to make the games, especially when other colleges stacked their teams with unfairly large men. We're saying goodbye to Lil (Lilya Tata) and Poppy (Miller), two of our most dedicated team members and beloved former captains. We're so grateful for all you've given to Corpus netball, for being our most enthusiastic cheerleaders and supporters. You will be sorely missed! Alethea Liau The Owlets After the roaring success of the Owlets' Redacted Arachnid at the Edinburgh Fringe in the summer of 2019, the society launched into another year packed full with new dramatic adventures. Michaelmas Term saw Alexander Grassam-Rowe take the helm in the annual intercollegiate Cuppers, bravely performing his one-man show in front of an audience of lively and enthusiastic Corpuscles. As well as funding a huge variety of exciting new productions throughout Michaelmas and Hilary terms, including The Pillowman, A Few Forms of Fury and Chicago, in Hilary the Owlets co-produced two shows - Nitwit Productions' All's Well That Ends Well and Maybe You Like It's newly written Pleading Stupidity. The planned Fringe run of the latter was blocked by the Covid-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020, but plans are currently under way to take this show to the Fringe in 2021. Covid-19 might have prevented an in-person T rinity; however, drama did not cease even in this strangest of terms, with several members of the Owlets committee taking to the virtual stage in productions such as Richard II and Press Cuttings. As we embark on a new year, the drama world is looking a little different in Oxford. Plans, however, are in place to start a new fortnightly Owlets improvisation club, as well as setting up an innovative inter-household virtual talent contest to provide some end-of-term entertainment. The coming year might prove to be a strange one, but it's looking exciting for the development of the Owlets. Eugenie Nevin150 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 151 Corpus Christi College Pool CCCPC has retained its popularity of recent years with a new pool table courtesy of the Pelican Fund. The new red cloth has seen a lot of action in its short lifetime thus far. Highlights include the final of the 32-person intra-college tournament, which was won on the final ball by the unorthodox style of Yanakan Logeswaran against the ambidextrous Russell Reid in a 6-5 thriller, as well as many college pool league fixtures resulting in our clinching fourth place in the ever-competitive Division 1. Hilary Term Cuppers saw many Corpuscles participate in the individual, doubles and team competitions, but with limited success. Our team Cuppers campaign ended when, after scraping out of the group stages, we were well beaten in the first round of the knock-outs. A humbling experience for us all, but there's always next year. On a serious note, termly Corpus pool tournaments are becoming habitual now, and CCCPC looks forward to seeing the continued facilitation of new friendships via this truly social \"sport\". All that's left to say is that the Beer Cellar floor is still uneven - but we prefer to call it \"home advantage\". Tom Flatters Rowing What really made this year stand out for rowing was quite how little rowing actually took place. We had great recruitment at the start of Michaelmas and, from a few initial outings, lots of hope that we would do very well in Christ Church Regatta. Unfortunately, Michaelmas Term's constant heavy rains meant that the regatta was eventually cancelled. We had a similar optimism that Torpids would go ahead in the spring, but that was cancelled too. And obviously Eights has not happened either, so we've joked that the biblical plagues of Egypt have hit rowing! We haven't let all the cancelled rowing dampen our spirits, though, and took part in the Christ Church \"Ergatta\" and Corpus's own \"Corpids\". We've also continued our social events, from our usual boat club dinners to our most recent Zoom pub quiz. Emma Donohue Emma Donohue of CCCBC doing her lockdown exercise challenge Rugby After last year's narrow defeat in the Cuppers final to St Edmund Hall, the Corpus/Somerville squad began the year hungry to lift the Cuppers trophy. The squad had seen few players graduate, and with a healthy intake of freshers we had another great chance to go all the way. Michaelmas was a difficult campaign. With many squad members regularly playing for the University, we struggled against the bigger colleges. The first game of the season saw us face off against the infamous St Edmund Hall. A cold and rainy Saturday afternoon left the game scoreless until the 76th minute when Teddy Hall broke the deadlock. Unfortunately, a difficult 7-0 loss would be the story of our season. With more losses of 25-0 away to St Anne's/St Johns and 36-0 away at New College, we had a long way to go if we were to avoid relegation. Unfortunately, a bitter 13-5 loss to Magdalen saw us go down. A heroic 48-27 victory away to St Catherine's rounded off a frustrating season for the team. With nearly every game played in torrential rain, the weather didn't do much to help Corpus's efforts. 152 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 153 Corpus Christi College Hilary was a fresh start. The return of our University players, combined with the competition of Division 2, was an exciting prospect. Our strength was displayed in an almost effortless 87-5 victory away to a strong Oriel side. The Cuppers dream was alive and strong. Other convincing victories against Keble (41-10) and University College (28-0) put us in a good position to win the division. Poor weather resulted in us voiding the game against Magdalen and prevented us taking some much-desired revenge. Jesus forfeited our final match and, just like that, we were the undefeated Division 2 winners. Thus began the Cuppers campaign. First we were drawn against Keble II, and unsurprisingly they ran for the hills. We moved onto our first actual match, against Univ, and wiped them away with relative ease, winning 51-5 at our joint home ground. The quarter-final would be the biggest test of our season, with the winner likely to be going all the way to the final. A familiar foe, St Anne's/St John's, faced a very strong Corpus/Somerville side. Despite a scoreless first ten minutes, the momentum was strongly in our favour, and this was to shift even more after a nasty trip by their openside flanker left them with 14 on the pitch. A solid performance saw us defeat them 27-5. The semis would see us face Jesus but unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this game was delayed. A likely victory against them would have seen us once again in the Cuppers final against either New College or Teddy Hall. This Cuppers campaign might eventually have a conclusion, but this is uncertain at the current time. It is a great shame that our campaign has potentially ended in the way that it has. The squad has worked so hard over the last few years and, at the very least, a conclusion would have been a nice reward. The club continues to be as inclusive as ever and is always growing. The great work of this year's captain, Robbie Oliver, and vice-captain James Standfield has continued the excellent development of the club. The year has seen the exciting development of the women's side of the club, with a women's team founded by Meryem Arik, Liberty Conlon and James Standfield. The squad started with just four players but over the course of the year has reached 25. They have seen massive success, winning all of their games by at least 30 points. This resulted in them winning their pool and going into the semi-finals of Cuppers - but which again were unfortunately disrupted by the pandemic. Maya Mellor will be taking over as captain as the women's side hunts for Cuppers glory. This is to be my last entry in The Pelican Record as Corpus captain. I have enjoyed every moment with Corpus/Somerville rugby and I hope the club continues to give wonderful memories to all of its future members. I now pass on to a good friend of mine, Arron Shaw. I hope that he will get one day to write about a Cuppers victory. Russell ReidRussell Crockford T rophy The trophy was donated to Corpus at the beginning of the year in memory of Russell Crockford, a former Corpus rower and double Boat Race champion, who sadly died in a car accident on the way to a regatta in 1980. After his former boat club folded a few years ago, the solid silver scull trophy was gifted to Corpus by his brother Duncan, to be awarded to the sports person or team of the year. First place: Sasha Webb If you've been involved with any sports at Corpus during your time here, you've probably already encountered Sasha. While she's known mainly for her extraordinary work captaining the women's rowing team this year (despite a year of less than ideal rowing conditions), she's also been an invaluable player in the Corpus women's football team as our fiercely unrelenting and impassable centre-back. Last year as a novice rower she was rapidly recognised as a rising star and after just two terms of rowing raced (and won Blades) with W1 in Torpids 2019. As well as being involved in the University development squad for rowing, she has also made her mark at Blues level with the Oxford ice hockey team, playing in this year's Varsity match in Cambridge in March. Lockdown has proved no barrier for Sasha either and, despite the strange saga that has been T rinity 2020, she's kept Corpus moving with weekly Zoom circuits. Sasha Webb, winner of this year's Russell Crockford T rophy154 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 155 Corpus Christi College Second place: Murray Whitaker Murray has impressed all of us this year with his almost superhuman ability to do just about anything you can think of. As well as having been involved in hockey, table tennis, football, rowing, surfing and Ultimate Frisbee, either in college or Uni-wide (in just two terms!), he has also made musical, thespian and poker-playing contributions to Corpus and to Oxford. Third place: George Taylor George lives, breathes and frequently gets injured for the beautiful game of football. In amongst the Achilles, calf, groin and pec strains, he has had a prolific year as player-manager for the Uni 4s and captain of the Corpus Firsts. The Uni 4s won their Varsity game against Brookes and the Corpus Firsts won their all-important match against Corpus Cambridge. George confounded all expectations by scoring the winning penalty while we were all expecting him to bottle it. Outside football, George is a handy Corpus pool player and a strong tennis player. Highly commended: James Baker James embodies everything we love about College sport. A man with a big heart and a cool head, known to some simply as \"The Sideburns\", he has captained the men's rowing team with gusto and good spirit through a difficult year when a flooded Isis and coronavirus limited actual rowing. His default answer of \"Yes\" when asked to do anything for the College has also seen him provide telling contributions to the rugby and football teams, and he has been an integral part of the Corpus Ultimate Frisbee team. Highly Commended: Sam Hazeldine Sam has had a busy year of sport. At University level, he's been a titan of the Oxford rugby league team, known for his bombastic bursts forward and questionable haircuts. He's also been part of the Corpus/Somerville rugby team, who have been consistently excellent over the last few seasons. Sam's unwavering commitment to College sport has also seen him at the pool table, representing Corpus in the intercollegiate tournament. He's even been known to \"do a job\" at centre-back for Corpus's 2nd XI football team. Sam's final sporting legacy lies in his role as the founder of Corpus Christi College Indoor Cricket Club, which became a Staircase 5 institution over the course of this year. We'd also like to give a big shout-out to our Blues players: Roman Kenny-Manning (tennis) A player with a crackling forehand, Roman is also a big part of the Corpus squash scene.Barney Vaughan (rugby) Getting tackled by Barney has been compared by some to being run over by a tank. He made a huge showing at T wickenham, placing South African giant Flip van der Merwe firmly on the ground. Barney's a big part of the Corpus/Somerville rugby team. Sampada Venkatesh (badminton) Sampada is the captain of Oxford W2 and won her Varsity match against Cambridge, contributing to a 43-32 Oxford victory. Alex Guzel (football) Poor old Guzel. The man was a stalwart in the Uni 1s for football this year but his Varsity match was scuppered by corona. I've been informed that you have to play in a Varsity match to officially be a Blue, but Guzel is a Blue in all our hearts. The Crockford Trophy Committee Matt Carlton, Augustine Allain-Lebon and Eugenie Nevin Ultimate Frisbee 2020 was another great year for our young CCC Ultimate Club, which confirmed our reputation as one of the leading teams in the Ultimate intercollegiate league. As we lost a number of key players in the summer of 2019, we had no choice but to dissolve our second team and concentrate on our first. Luckily, we were able to attract fresh new talent at Freshers' Fair in 2019, who bolstered our first team and promise to be a real asset in the future. A good thing about the sport is that anyone can pick it up fairly quickly. In fact, most of our players have not played Ultimate or even thrown a frisbee before they joined our team. This was true for the majority of our new members, who first had to learn the sport. Despite suffering narrow defeats in our first few league games, we improved continually throughout the season, which enabled us to come back and finish in the middle of the table. We also bolstered our reputation as a particularly fair and friendly club by continuing the tradition of bringing freshly baked cookies to our games. The enormous progress made by our newest members and our strong finish at the end of the season make me hopeful that this tradition will be continued and that the club has an even brighter future ahead of it. Max Frenzel156 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 157 Corpus Christi College Women's Football The Corpus women's football squad has expanded considerably this year. While this may not have shown in our matches, sadly none of which we won, it has definitely created one of the loveliest sporting atmospheres around. This year saw the inauguration of a series of football training sessions led by various members of the CCCFC men's side. All keen Corpuscles were welcome, both experienced players and those who had never set foot on a pitch before, and the skills honed here saw us put up a tremendous fight in the annual Corpus Challenge against a number of Cambridge Blues players. Our famous post-match teas, courtesy of vice-captain Emma Donohue, have caused a sensation in the squad, contributing immensely to the welcoming atmosphere that the Corpus women's team fosters and hopes to maintain throughout the year ahead. Eugenie Nevin How to volunteer at Oxford My mother always used to repeat this Chinese proverb: \"The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.\" I did not grasp the importance of consistency and effort until I began volunteering. During my years of secondary school, at the German Swiss International School in Hong Kong, I observed that my peers lacked awareness of local social issues, hence I founded an initiative aiming to enhance their social acceptance towards people who did not fit into established norms. By giving them the opportunity to teach students suffering from mental and visual disabilities, their perspectives towards mentally disabled people changed for the better over time. I mainly participate in voluntary work involving student welfare and special needs education. I am a volunteer at Nightline, an anonymous student listening service that aims to provide a safe space for students to share their emotional burdens and troubles. Admittedly, I have struggled to remain non-directional during calls; it is difficult to ignore the urge to give advice. However, one of the core principles that Nightline adheres to is maintaining a neutral stance, allowing the caller to reach their own decisions. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of being a good and empathetic listener; providing people with an outlet to express themselves is sufficient to alleviate some of their negative emotions. I am also the Volunteer Coordinator at Branch Up, a programme run by Oxford Hub. Branch Up provides fun activity days for young people who do not have access to extracurricular activities due to their financial background. Previous activity days have included ice skating and a Harry Potter workshop. The most rewarding part of Branch Up is seeing the gradual change in the young people's demeanour. Those who were closed off and shy initially opened up to us over time. I am also the first point of contact for all volunteers, allowing me to put my problem-solving skills to good use. However, I was reluctant to train new volunteers due to my fear of public speaking. However, by stepping out of my comfort zone, I have become more comfortable with presenting in front of my peers. On Thursdays, I volunteer at the Yellow Submarine Youth Club. Yellow Submarine is a charity which focuses on helping people with learning disabilities and autism. It runs an after-school youth club for young people aged 11-18, with the goal of easing teenagers' transition into adulthood. Term-time youth clubs provide a fun and relaxing environment for young people to make new friends and engage in fun activities. Social interactions are crucial in building their social skills, independence and confidence. Seeing the group becoming more comfortable with each other over time brings me a lot of joy. Through these experiences, I have finally understood the meaning of the proverb \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\". Although volunteering comes with no financial gain, the act of giving is much more fulfilling. My contributions may be minor, but being able to make an impact on someone's life is the best reward I can ask for. Karisa T an The Fellows Last year Colin Akerman, the College's Medical T utor, continued his programme of research into how neural circuits are formed in the brain and how these circuits are altered by neural activity. The pandemic resulted in the temporary closure of his lab, which disrupted ongoing experimental research, but was an excellent opportunity to catch up on some data analysis and writing. Professor Akerman's team published research articles in the following journals: Nature Communications, Nature Reviews Neuroscience and Stem Cell Reports. In one of these studies, the research group describe how they have been able to generate both cortical neurons and astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. The work shows that growing these cell types together encourages the functional maturation of the cortical neurons, consistent with the idea that astrocytes provide maturational signals to neurons. This opens up exciting opportunities to study intercellular signalling events in a human system, under normal conditions and in disease states such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Finally, some other good news was that a clinical research fellow has been awarded a Wellcome T rust Fellowship to study astrocyte signalling in Professor Akerman's group. Dave Armstrong writes: My research continues to develop new understanding in the performance of materials in extreme environments. While work continues in my traditional areas of nuclear power and aero engine materials, I have new projects in energy storage for electric cars and geological materials. Electric vehicles could be revolutionised by the availability of higher energy density batteries. I am working with the UK-based Faraday Institution to develop methods to measure the mechanical behaviour of new solid-state electrolytes. These materials, while very fragile, will allow both increased energy density and increased safety through the removal of flammable liquid electrolytes. However, without understanding their mechanical properties and failure mechanisms, real devices cannot be manufactured. I hope to have exciting results to share in the next year. In the nuclear area I have several active projects working on developing new high-entropy alloys. These are a new class of metallic alloys where, instead of alloys being based on a single element (often iron or nickel), multiple elements are used in equal parts. Our new alloys have been shown to have excellent mechanical properties as well as good resistance to radiation damage. With Rolls-Royce I have contributed to the design of new material interfaces for use in ceramic engine components. These materials will allow an increased engine efficiency and hence reduced environmental impacts.Alastair Buchan is returning to Oxford following his sabbatical in Berlin where he has been while on academic leave from Oxford. He was elected to the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (WIKO, the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin) where he held a 2019/2020 fellowship. While based at WIKO he had collaborations at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital and served as the Honorary Director of Oxford in Berlin, which he established at Berlin's Natural History Museum as Oxford's European base. Oxford in Berlin supports Oxford's collaboration with the Berlin University Alliance. The year 2019/2020 he had thought was going to be distinguished by the \"agreement\" for Britain to leave the European Union, which was scheduled for 31 October 2019, but of course that date came and went, as did the premiership of Theresa May. While Professor Buchan has worked intensively to help deliver what Oxford will need post-Brexit in terms of access to Europe for students, scholars and research collaborations in order to obtain funding from European agencies, access to collections and data and shared regulations, it was of course not Brexit that became the defining event of the year but the Covid-19 pandemic. Professor Buchan spent much of his academic time in 2019/2020 evaluating the data over the last four decades on the treatment of strokes and our difficulties in finding a neuroprotectant that slows the death of brain cells following a stroke and, hopefully, one that will help reduce the risk of dementia. Many of the difficulties in the field of neuroprotection have resulted in lessons which now have an instructive bearing on how medical data regarding Covid-19 can be fruitfully used (or abused) by those who are in a position to disseminate information or determine public policy that impacts the elaboration and development of treatments and vaccines. Giovanni Capoccia, Fellow in Politics, spent two terms of the past academic year on sabbatical, pursuing various writing projects while continuing to supervise his graduate students and serving in various offices in professional associations. He published an article on the historical study of transitional justice, focusing on the consequences of German denazification, and a couple of shorter pieces. Invited talks and professional conferences have mostly been put on hold by the pandemic. He gave interviews on various political issues to News 1 (South Korea), Aspen Review (Italy) and ANews (T urkey). He will be Research Network Convenor in Comparative Government in the Department of Politics and International Relations for the next three years. James Duffy was thrilled by the outstanding results achieved by this year's finalists in PPE: four Firsts, with Sam Wycherley notably receiving a phenomenal 85 for his thesis in economics. This was very welcome news after what had been a hectic T rinity Term, during which Professor Duffy convened a large undergraduate econometrics course (Quantitative Economics), all the 158 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 159 Corpus Christi College teaching of which had to move online at short notice. All the lectures had to be pre-recorded, and tutorials held over Zoom with the aid of a document visualiser. While the feedback from this enforced \"experiment\" in online teaching was that it was surprisingly effective, he hopes that it will not need to be repeated next year. Professor Duffy also continued his research on statistical inference in the presence of highly persistent time series, which frequently arise in the context of macroeconomics and finance, and which pose challenges that are quite distinct from those posed by cross-sectional data (such as household surveys). He had work published in Econometric Theory, and another paper accepted for publication in the Annals of Statistics. He also presented work (with his DPhil student, Jerome Simons) generalising models of cointegration at the quinquennial Econometric Society World Congress (which was also an entirely online affair). He has since begun a new project with Sophocles Mavroeidis, relating to the modelling of monetary policy near the zero lower bound. Marion Durand has had a wonderful first year at Corpus. She writes: I have enjoyed teaching Corpuscles across Classics, PPE, PPL and Maths & Philosophy, as well as giving lectures on Early Greek Philosophy for the Philosophy Faculty and supervising graduate students as part of the MSt in Ancient Philosophy. I have also relished immersing myself in the vibrant intellectual life of the College (in person while gatherings were still possible and online throughout T rinity). The Corpus Christi College Classics Centre seminars and lunches in particular have given rise to many thought-provoking meetings and fruitful discussions. Though my plans to participate in a number of conferences and seminars across Europe in the spring and summer were thwarted by the Covid-19 pandemic, I was glad to have had the chance to speak at the Philosophy Faculty's Philosophical Society and at a Classics Centre lunch on Stoic views on the grammar and logic of past and future tenses. This work is part of ongoing research towards a monograph aiming to reconstruct the Stoic semantics for propositions on which I have been making progress over the summer months. Matt Dyson writes: The year has been as disjointed and interrupted as any, but some interesting work has been possible. We had another outstanding year for our first years, the second year in a row that a Corpus student has come top of the year. We've seen the whole cohort of students develop wonderfully, even in the face of the delay to Moderations and the finalists sitting exams at home. It has been a strong reminder of how important they are to our academic community, as working to help them during the Covid-19 lockdown has shown how much helping others can reinvigorate one's own academic work and purpose. In my case, I had a sabbatical in Hilary Term, and started on the final push of a monograph exploring how and why law has changed, particularly in its relationship between criminal law and tort law, in a handful of countries since 1850. This has been work taking place over some years, and will be finished by the end of the calendar year. The inaccessibility of libraries since March and the inability to travel to resources abroad have slowed the work significantly and have forced some changes, but the project nears completion. In the meantime, the seminars and conferences that were cancelled or postponed gave way to a select group of online events, including on the nature and development of the law relating to fault, in Oxford, in Brazil and at Notre Dame in the USA. I have also been working on cases at appellate level, in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. One example is whether a person convicted of a crime, but not punished on the basis that she had no significant personal responsibility because of an underlying mental condition, should not be able to claim against the NHS team who admitted negligence in not treating her before her condition caused her to kill her mother. Another example is a man who lied that he was infertile in order to have unprotected sex with a woman who did not want to become pregnant, and the Court of Appeal's decision that this was not rape. We all know that this has been the strangest of years. Ja Elsner's strange year began with the move of his entire family to Florence for his two-year leave to take up his External Membership of the Max Planck Institute for Art History there. But the failure of his fifteen-year-old daughter's schooling led to a swift return to the UK by November. It looked like a disaster at the time, but when Italy hit corona crisis before the rest of us, it looked like a gift from the divine. By the time his daughter had begun to settle into a new school and he into the routine of research back in Oxford (with regular Florentine contact), all things were in flux again as the world went into lockdown: all schooling, all university teaching and all research at home. He conducted his usual Easter vac teaching trip to Chicago via Zoom (three-hour daily seminars are tough in this medium), surrounded by all the family (his wife and four children) conducting their work - including a Physics doctorate from the garden shed, Civil Service briefings for the Foreign Secretary from the kitchen table and University counselling from the spare room) - as we hot- desked our way around the house through Covid. He gave academic lectures in Florence and Oxford by the same digital means (anywhere in the world is the same in virtuality), completed a number of edited book projects and began work on his major new monograph on the ancient Amarvat sculptures (many of which are in the British Museum). As libraries have been closed since March, this has been a game of buying books on the Internet, downloading what can be found online and leaving gaps for what can only be researched in a different world once we emerge from library closure.... Despite all this, the major volume from his Leverhulme Project, Empires of Faith, was published by Cambridge University Press. As hoped for in her last Pelican Record report, Liz Fisher completed the book she has been writing with Professor Sidney Shapiro - Administrative Competence: Reimagining Administrative Law (Cambridge University Press, October 2020). While focusing on the US, the book makes an argument relevant to many common law jurisdictions - that administrative law needs to be 160 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 161 Corpus Christi College far more a law of public administration. With that now finished, Professor Fisher has been busy with a range of new writing and research projects, including on judicial review doctrine in the Administrative Court and another project concerning the NSW Land and Environment Court. While the law community at Corpus is always intellectually stimulating, it has been particularly so this year as Professor Shapiro (Wake Forest) and Justice Brian Preston, Chief of the NSW Land and Environment Court, have been a visiting scholar and visiting fellow respectively. Lockdown has had a big impact on the law community at Corpus, and Professor Fisher has been intensely impressed with how Corpus students and her law colleagues have adapted to the challenges of online teaching and examining. In June she greatly enjoyed co-organising a Faculty day-long webinar on Covid-19 and the Law, which explored the many different legal dimensions of the Covid crisis. This summer was meant to be spent in New Zealand as the NZ Law Foundation's Distinguished Visiting Fellow, lecturing on \"Environmental Futures and Legal Imagination\", but due to the lockdown that has been postponed. She will thus spend a summer writing at home, with hopefully a week walking in the remote North Yorks Moors. Since March, Andrew Fowler appears to have spent every waking second preparing online teaching materials, which essentially means writing two books on the fly, amongst other things. He also finally saw his edited Karthaus summer school lecture book through the press after correcting six versions of the proofs. He suggests avoiding Springer as a publisher, as they seem to have gone to the dogs. In January he spent a week in Banff at a glaciology workshop where the temperature was minus 25 degrees. At that temperature, the snow is so dry that walking on it makes a crunching noise like cybermen. In September he was awarded the Seligman Crystal of the International Glaciological Society, a fact so extraordinary that he has more or less been in shock ever since. At the end of 2020, Nicole Grobert was able to look back at four very exciting years of her Royal Society Industry Fellowship (RSIF). Through this she was able to engage closely with industry, enabling her to seek suitable routes for the efficient exploitation of novel functional materials (which she creates in her laboratories) and also expand on her science policy work. Following the success of the Scientific Opinion on Microplastics Pollution last year, which she co-led together with Pearl Dykstra, the European Commission invited the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors to prepare a Scientific Opinion on Biodegradable Plastics. Professor Grobert is leading this Scientific Opinion and it was due to be published by the end of 2020. In September, she was elected as Chair of the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors to the European Commission together with Sir Paul Nurse (Deputy Chair), succeeding Rolf Heuer (former Director of CERN) and Pearl Dykstra (former Vice President, Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences) from mid-November 2020.Sadly, she and her research team were not able to host any summer students this year due to Covid-19, breaking an annual tradition for the first time since 2003. Yet the team remained exceptionally positive throughout the lockdown; it was lovely to see how group members supported each other, and as a result the team was able to make the most of these unprecedented circumstances before restarting reduced work in the laboratories at Begbroke in July 2020. Several students defended their DPhil work successfully, despite challenging video links; a new Faraday project looking at the thermal management of batteries was funded; and during lockdown the team was lucky enough to be able to work on a backlog of manuscripts stuck in drawers and to publish them finally in leading journals. This year the team also broke all records with seven new research students starting. More recently, together with seven colleagues (seven seems to be the lucky number this year) from across the MPLS Departments (including Professor Johnston), she established the Oxford Network of Materials Design, aiming to bring together researchers in Oxford in this area of research and establishing synergistic collaborations across the MPLS Departments, existing research institutes and other divisions. The network seeks to create future materials by taking a systems approach to tackling societal challenges that we are facing and informing policy- makers. Constanze G\u00fcthenke writes: Like everyone else, I have had an unusual academic year. Feeling and Classical Philology: Knowing Antiquity in German Scholarship, 1770-1920 was published by CUP in spring 2020, and I was delighted that a Zoom book launch brought together friends and colleagues in ways that a regular face-to-face meeting would not have been able to do. I am now turning my attention back to a research project begun some years ago, on the history of classical scholarship in America, in a transnational frame. As Director of the Corpus Christi College Classics Centre, in Hilary I also hosted the Corpus seminar series on \"Ethical Reading\", with Tobias Reinhardt, the Corpus Professor of Latin, and Hindy Najman, the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture. This year's topic was \"Authenticity\", and we look forward to the continuation of the series next year on the topic of \"Fragmentation\". The summer was one of intense introspection for classicists within and outside College. Pandemic conditions affecting our sense of self, personally as much as disciplinarily, global protests for social justice and an urgent need to scrutinise the histories and structures of exclusion in our practices and knowledge manifested in many discussions, shared reading and talking and shared listening. This is unfinished business, but I have been immensely proud of the willingness of the strong Classics community in College to engage with those questions. 162 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 163 Corpus Christi College Stephen Harrison has completed the third and final year of his Leverhulme T rust Major Research Fellowship on the reception of Apuleius' second-century AD Latin Cupid and Psyche love story in European literature since Shakespeare; most of the relevant volume is now in draft. He has also completed his thirty-third and final year as Latin tutor at Corpus, having decided to take formal retirement at sixty, but will stay on as honorary Senior Research Fellow and continue with research and some graduate supervision. Before the unusual conditions of the second half of this academic year, in the autumn of 2019 he gave talks in Denmark (Aarhus and Copenhagen), Spain (Tarragona) and South Africa (Stellenbosch), and was a visiting fellow for two weeks in Tel Aviv (and also gave talks in Jerusalem and Haifa). In January-April 2020 he was a visiting fellow at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch and had first-hand experience of the first-class New Zealand response to Covid-19 (and of the fabulous South Island landscape, before the March lockdown); it took him three attempts to get home in time for Easter. He thinks back with warm memories of the more than 250 tutorial pupils he has taught at Corpus, and wishes them all the very best. He is most grateful to the College for allowing him to continue as an active part of the Corpus community. Peter Hore continues to investigate the biophysical mechanism that allows small migratory songbirds to sense the direction of the Earth's magnetic field as a navigational aid. This year's (pre-Covid) invited conference talks included Baltimore, Daegu, Hefei, Nara, Oldenburg, Saitama and St Petersburg. Marek Jankowiak continued to settle into his role of Associate Professor in Byzantine History: teaching and supervision dominated the year, but - largely thanks to the energy of his co-editors - he has also submitted for publication two edited volumes summarising his earlier project Dirhams for Slaves on the slave trade between Viking-Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world in the ninth and tenth centuries: Viking-Age Trade: Silver, Slaves and Gotland (Routledge) and The Invisible Commodity: The Archaeology of Slavery in Early Medieval Northern Europe (Springer). Work continues on several monographs: on dirham imitations from northern Europe, on the implications of the slave trade system and on the monothelete controversy in Byzantium in the seventh century. He also persevered in his attempts to learn Japanese (although he is still not able to read manga in the original), started T urkish and managed, despite everything, to continue his exploration of Byzantine sites in T urkey. Michael Johnston has had a productive year of research and teaching. The lockdown at the end of March led to a shutdown of his research laboratory for three months, a rapid implementation of remote teaching and the cancellation of research visits and conferences. While many graduate students and postdoctoral researchers remained in Oxford (all of Professor Johnston's group), the undergraduates were not able to return for T rinity Term. The Corpus Physics students were very resilient, however, and remote marking and tutorials seemed to work rather well in the end. At the start of May, as the lockdown continued, Professor Johnston published a paper, \"Three- dimensional cross-nanowire networks recover full terahertz state\", in the multidisciplinary international journal Science, which reported on a new semiconductor device for detecting very high frequency (terahertz) radiation. He is now working with Oxford University Innovation with the help of an EPSRC IAA award to look at opportunities to commercialise this new technology. In September he was awarded an EPSRC Established Career Fellowship, which is a personal award that enables holders to conduct a \"novel and outstanding piece of world- leading research\". He will use the \u00a31.8 million award to unveil electron motion at surfaces and interfaces on ultrashort length and ultrafast time scales, thus providing a deep understanding of semiconductors suitable for solar-to-electrical energy conversion. Over the next few years he will be developing instrumentation that will both open fundamental new discoveries in the field of semiconductors and make crucial contributions to the development of renewable energy technologies. Hans Kraus and his research group build and work with very large detectors to search for dark matter in our galaxy. For the past 20 years the group has participated in building several dark matter detectors, always increasing in size when data analysed from these detectors has shown no clear and confirmed evidence for the detection of dark matter particles. The next large detector is LZ, based on a target mass of seven tonnes of liquid xenon. The past year saw its installation in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota completed. The research group have changed focus from installing and integrating the instrumentation they have designed and manufactured to detector commissioning and the preparation for data-taking and the analysis of these future data. This is an exciting period in the field of dark matter search. Professor Kraus, apart from leading this research effort, is the Vice President of the College, Associate Head of the Physics Department and Head of Teaching, an editor of Astroparticle Physics and the UK principal investigator of a research and development programme towards a next-generation rare event observatory, based on liquid xenon technology. In 2019 Judith Maltby saw the publication by Bloomsbury of Anglican Women Novelists: from Charlotte Bront\u00eb to P .D. James, co-edited with Professor Alison Shell. The essays engage with a range of British novelists - some well-known like Bront\u00eb, Sayers and James and some ripe for rediscovery such as Rose Macaulay, Noel Streatfeild and Monica Furlong - and seeks to explore their fiction through their Anglicanism and their Anglicanism through their fiction. Before the pandemic, Dr. Maltby was interviewed on Radio 4 about the book and the editors addressed a lively gathering at the Greenbelt Festival. Dr. Maltby and Professor Shell did speak at the Bloxham Festival in February, but Covid-19 meant the cancellation of a number of other literary festivals, including Oxford and York. This past year, she returned to more familiar territory of the early modern period and completed a chapter entitled \"Sacrilege and 164 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 165 Corpus Christi College the Sacred in England's Second Reformation, 1640-1660\", which will appear in Forming, Breaking and Enduring Orthodoxies in the History of Christianity (Boydell and Brewer), edited by Professor Alec Ryrie. Her next research project is focused on the twentieth-century religious poet and disability activist, Vassar Miller. Dr. Maltby continues to serve the Church of England nationally, including the Crown Nominations Commission (the nominating body for diocesan bishops) and the General Synod, and chairs the Research Degrees Panel for the Church's Ministry Division. Mike Martin writes: The year started out with forest fires. As in every Michaelmas Term, I spent four months teaching in Northern California at UC Berkeley. November was a month of power cuts and the air was often thick with smoke. Back to Oxford for Hilary Term, and lockdown coincided with the start of a short sabbatical. Being confined to my study coincided with my original plans, although various conferences and research visits to the USA and China were inevitably postponed or cancelled. Over the year, I published \"The Diversity of Experiences\", in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research; \"Betwixt Feeling and Thinking\" in Acquaintance, Jonathan Knowles and Thomas Raleigh (eds), Clarendon Press; and \"Variation Vogt and Justin Vlasits (eds), Clarendon Press. The publication which most surprised Neil McLynn this year was a large-format, lavishly produced volume which arrived in the post, the cover swathed in languid nudes under the boldly proclaimed title: Decadence and Decay. Puzzled browsing of the opening chapters - \"sexual decadence\", \"decadence and dandyism\" and \"the naked dancer: Ador\u00e9e Villany\"-yielded much fascinating new knowledge but little understanding. Only when he discovered a heavily footnoted paper on \"Decline in Three Dimensions\" in his own name at the end of the book, a modestly upbeat re-reading of the late Roman chronicles of doom produced by Orientius, Hydatius and Eugippius, did he remember the strangely luxurious conference on \"Histories of Decline\" that he had attended in Rome in 2016. The somewhat louche flavour of the audience there, and their evident inability to share his excitement at his quietly seismic revisionism, now make much more sense. In other news, he has become the Chair of the Board of the Faculty of Classics, so his next few contributions to this Record are likely to consist largely of howls from the bunker. Over the last academic year Jeff McMahan was on leave with a Research Fellowship from the Leverhulme T rust. The project for which he had support is the writing of a book called The Ethics of Creating, Preserving, and Ending Lives, which is under contract with Oxford University Press. This book, which is still in progress, is concerned with a range of issues in \"population ethics\", such as whether a person can be harmed or benefited by being caused to exist, whether the expectation that a person would have a life worth living provides a moral reason to cause that person to exist, and whether it is wrong to cause a well-off person to exist if one could cause a different, better-off person to exist instead. These and related issues are, surprisingly, the source of some of the most intractable problems and paradoxes in moral theory. One of the aims of the book is to explain why understanding these issues is essential to understanding a range of practical ethical issues as diverse as abortion, prenatal injury, infanticide, meat eating, climate change and war. Professor MacMahan has also been editing a three-volume series of essays in memory of the philosopher Derek Parfit. In October, he presented work from the book-in-progress as the 2019 Rutgers Lectures in Philosophy. He also gave lectures in Lisbon and Stockholm and at the Law School at Sussex. He was scheduled to give lectures in Ume\u00e5, Stockholm, Oslo, Bergen, T roms\u00f8 and at the NATO School in Oberammergau, but all had to be postponed. Because what he has been wanting to do for years is simply to stay at home and work on his book, the lockdown has been considerably easier for him than for most people. While Brits on average felt compelled to watch six-and-a-half hours of TV a day during the lockdown, Professor McMahan watched an average of one episode of Danger Man per month on DVD (look it up on Google). Pete Nellist has spent the year juggling the responsibilities of teaching, leading his research group and acting as Joint Head of the Department of Materials. All three of these activities were made more \"interesting\" by the very rapid response needed to the emergence of the pandemic. Decisions that would usually need to work their way through a number of committees and consultations had to be made within a matter of days, or less. Remote teaching was an entirely new experience for many of us, and I am hugely grateful to our undergraduate and postgraduate students for the calm and understanding way that they adapted to our new processes. I think the memory of leading a tutorial from my spare room with students scattered across different continents will stick with me. The laboratories had to close in March and so experimental research came to a rapid halt. Nonetheless, my research group were generally well stocked with data and were able to keep working on data processing and writing up papers. Much of the focus of our work continues in the field of pushing the limits of atomic imaging using electron microscopes for materials that degrade rapidly under an electron beam. Particular areas of focus include catalysts, materials for lithium-ion batteries and new materials for solar cells. In this latter I am working with, among others, Michael Johnston (Corpus T utor in Physics), in a project hatched over an SCR lunch. Another first this year was the running of the first entirely online, week-long North West Science Network Summer School. The North West Science Network is a Corpus-led outreach activity aimed at widening participation in science at higher education level and working with partner schools and colleges in the northwest of England, and we were delighted at the level of 166 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 167 Corpus Christi College engagement, despite the remote nature of the interaction. Finally, I was deeply honoured to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society during the year. Judith Olszowy-Schlanger was involved in a range of research activities and academic responsibilities as the President of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. She participated in several colloquia, workshops and international conferences in Oxford, Paris, Jerusalem and Bologna. She continued her leadership role in the international project \"Books within Books: Hebrew Fragments in European Libraries\", a project dedicated to the study and online inventory of fragments of medieval Hebrew manuscripts reused in the binding of other books and notarial files. She supervised at the Master level at Oxford and taught a course on \"Medieval Hebrew Palaeography and the Cairo Genizah\" as Professor of Hebrew Manuscript Studies at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes, PSL, in Paris. She co-organised a workshop with the New Gallia-Germania Judaica project of the University of Heidelberg, \"England between 1066 and 1290: new perspectives for an Anglia Judaica\", held at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies in January 2020. She has also begun her new research project, \"The History of the Jewish Book in the Islamicate World\", carried out in collaboration with Professor Ronny Vollandt of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). The highlight of this year was the honour of delivering the triennial E.A. Lowe Lectures in Palaeography at Corpus. This series of three lectures was dedicated to the groups of bilingual Hebrew-Latin manuscripts in the remarkable Corpus collection (MSS 5-11) and their place in Christian Hebraism in thirteenth-century England. Pier Palamara continues to do research on statistical and machine learning algorithms for human genomic data, with the goal of improving our understanding of human evolutionary history and the genetic architecture of heritable traits. His research group will be supported by a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant for the next five years. Katherine Paugh has had an exciting third year at Corpus, and not only because a global pandemic provided the thrilling opportunity to carry on her work as a historian while simultaneously parenting a four-year-old. She introduced a new module in the History Faculty called \"Race, Sex, and Medicine in the Early Atlantic World\" which she hopes will provide Corpus history students, as well as history students across the University, with an opportunity to think about how ideas about health and disease helped to justify and sustain racial and sexual hierarchies in the slave societies of the Caribbean and North America from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries. She was thrilled that the module was heavily oversubscribed in its first year. This work will also facilitate progress on her second book, which examines the history of venereal disease during this period. Professor Paugh also had opportunities to present her ongoing work in speaking engagements at the Cambridge American History Seminar and a Black History Month event in the Oxford History Faculty organised by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Around Corpus, she very much enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about how the College organises its teaching during her first year serving on Academic Committee. In the Corpus history school, Professor Paugh has taken an increasingly active role in the teaching of Disciplines of History, the College's course on historical methodology, and has especially enjoyed pushing her students to think globally and transnationally. 2019/2020 was for Tobias Reinhardt the third year of his term as Chair of the Board of the Faculty of Classics. The second half of the year was dominated by the pandemic. Like everything else, the Faculty's outreach programme continued online, including remote open days and remotely conducted UNIQ summer schools. The Faculty's bridging course, which helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds transition to study at Oxford, was completely redesigned for 2020, so as to dovetail with the new University bridging scheme, Opportunity Oxford. This year bridging began with an online module starting in early July, which involved independent study and feedback to foster the ability to write essays, and was followed up by a two-week residential in early September which featured language classes, study skills sessions and lectures from academics on a wide range of subjects. The residential was in fact the first \"face-to-face\" activity since lockdown began. Professor Reinhardt has now handed over the chairmanship to his Corpus colleague Dr. Neil McLynn. This academic year David Russell has continued work on his book about facing reality. He wrote an essay about what it means to face reality, which is forthcoming in the journal Raritan. He has also been writing about John Ruskin's ideas about the power of images, in particular the way they can be sites of controversy and provoke destruction - a theme that became contemporary again over the course of 2020. Professor Russell has continued to convene a seminar with the writer and psychologist Adam Phillips, about psychoanalysis and ordinary life and language, which has brought together a wonderful community of academics, practising therapists and other interested parties in College. Like so many things, this has had to be put on hold since the beginning of the crisis, but we hope to resume meetings soon. In T rinity Term 2020, which had to move to online teaching, he was impressed by his students' commitment to their interests in literature despite the obstacles. It was a reminder to him that literature is not only a record of other crises that have come and gone (which is not in itself necessarily reassuring), but also a record of the creative forms of meaning that people have made from difficult experience - and still can. 168 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 169 Corpus Christi College Mark Sansom has continued his research in two broad areas of computational biochemistry, namely: (i) lipid/protein interactions and their importance in regulation of the function of membrane proteins, including receptors and channels; and (ii) the role of water in ion channel function, especially with respect to hydrophobic gating of ion channels. Both of these areas have resulted in a number of collaborations with experimental structural biologists, in Oxford, Germany and the USA. He has published twenty research papers, including major papers in PNAS, the Journal of the American Chemical Society and various Nature journals. In particular, he (finally) completed a couple of major reviews, of \"Water in Nanopores and Biological Channels\" and of \"Lipid-Dependent Regulation of Ion Channels and G Protein-Coupled Receptors\", which have been published in Chemical Reviews and in Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology respectively. He has continued to develop a partnership with IBM Research UK. This has resulted in a new doctoral training centre in Computational Discovery, jointly funded by IBM, Oxford University and EPSRC. We admitted our first cohort of graduate students in October 2020, into departments ranging from Physics and Materials Science through to Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pawel Swietach writes: In the 2019/2020 academic year, our research programme continued along three tracks. For cancer-related work, we have been testing new approaches to culturing cancer cells and innovative ways of obtaining new data relating to their metabolism. This is of fundamental importance because ultimately metabolism is critical for tumour growth, and its inhibition is an attractive therapeutic option. For the cardiac programme, we have now completed a study that identified a novel drug that could curb maladaptive hypertrophy, a complex process that typically precedes heart failure. We also developed a method to study oxygen transport in blood at single-cell resolution. This methodology was implemented in time for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and allowed us to work with ICU doctors to determine that the hypoxia observed in Covid-19 patients was not due to infection of red cells. John Watts has had an interesting year - just like everyone else. His intellectual mission to understand leadership from the inside (having studied it historically all his career) entered a new and deeper phase as he got to grips with chairing the History Faculty during the pandemic. There have been many memorable moments, but perhaps the one to pick out is his trip to the Bodleian in Ninth Week of Hilary: \"At last!\", he thought, \"all chores done, and now a chance to spend at least the afternoons doing some research for those lectures on the Wars of the Roses I'm due to give in Dublin in the autumn...\", but there was an oddly frenetic mood in the Radcliffe Camera, as large numbers of students gathered armfuls of books and headed to the issue desks; better-connected people revealed the Facebook gossip that the Library was about to shut down. So the research idyll came to an abrupt end, and the last six months have been dominated by Covid-related business of one kind or another. There have been upsides - students and colleagues alike have borne the crisis with amazing resourcefulness, kindness and imagination; teaching online has been quite enjoyable; even meetings online have their good points. And there has been some time for research - he has managed to do some reading on the fifteenth-century economy, and has really enjoyed it: the interaction of structural change in the economy with contingencies like civil war and bullion shortages is absolutely fascinating. His lectures have been postponed, so there is time to prepare for them properly, and with a bit of luck this coming academic year will end a bit more calmly than it is beginning. Roll on that vaccine, though! Mark Wrathall completed work last autumn on The Cambridge Heidegger Lexicon, a massive project that has intermittently occupied him for the past decade. Since then, he has turned his attention to finishing off a book manuscript on existential phenomenology. Toward that end, he spent much of the year researching and writing on phenomenological method and the phenomenology of time - themes on which he lectured in Copenhagen, Moscow and Brighton. 170 The Pelican Record 2020 Corpus Christi College The Pelican Record 2020 171 Corpus Christi College Scholarships and Prizes 2019-2020 College Prizes Andrew Hopley Memorial Prize - Bobby White Christopher Bushell Prize - Jennifer Donnellan Corpus Association Prize - Sampada Venkatesh (first-year undergraduate who has made the most outstanding contribution to the life of the College) Fox Prizes - Filippo (awarded to an undergraduate who is ranked in the top 5 per cent in the First Public Examination) Haigh Prize - Elektra Georgiakakis James F .
