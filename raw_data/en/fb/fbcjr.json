A natural treatment for your sports injury can help you get back to your sport quickly and safely. Herbal medicines can help reduce swelling and promote healing in the body without as many side effects as medications might. Read on to learn about how these herbal medicine treatments can benefit you. Why choose herbal medicine? Herbal medicines have many benefits over conventional treatments. Unlike conventional treatments, which simply help alleviate the pain, herbal medicines encourage the body to heal itself. There are several other benefits of herbal medicines for athletes as well: - Strengthen the immune system - More natural alternative - Often more affordable - Stabilize the metabolism and the body's hormones Common herbal medicines There are a few common herbal medicines that are especially beneficial for athletes. One of the most versatile treatments for sports injuries is Arnica montana. This herbal medication comes from a European plant that is related to sunflowers. It can help alleviate bruising, pain and inflammation. The Arnica montana can help promote healing in the body for injuries such as breaks or bruises. Generally, athletes should try to take several pellets of this herbal medicine as soon as an injury occurs. The athletes should continue to take Arnica montana every 15 to 30 minutes for the next several hours. An external gel or ointment of Arnica montana is also available. Athletes can use this gel or ointment for sore muscles after an intense workout or game. It can also be rubbed over a bruise to help healing in the body. However, it should not be used over an open wound or sore. For blisters, athletes can use calendula ointment, which comes from a medicinal flower. This ointment has antimicrobial properties that can help reduce the inflammation in the area. The ointment can also help the area heal quicker. More serious injuries For athletes with more serious injuries such as broken bones or fractured bones, herbal medicine can still be an option. Symphytum officinale, or comfrey, can be used with Calcarea phosphorica to help encourage bone growth. This combination can also help lessen pain in the area. Athletes should take five pellets of each in the morning and in the evening while the bone is healing. For joint injuries such as injured tendons or ligaments, Ruta graveolens and Rhus toxicodendron can be used. These herbs can help tendons and ligaments heal faster. This will help the athlete's joint heal better and return to normal function quickly.
