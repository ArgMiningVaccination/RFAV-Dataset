It's not meant to replace conventional medicine but acts to compliment it. Acupuncture has been successful in helping patients all around the world reduce their chronic health conditions. At Woodbury Family Chiropractic in Woodbury, our professionals are ready to provide the care you need to reduce pain or discomfort and achieve optimal wellness. How Does Acupuncture Work? Extremely thin, sterile needles are inserted into the body at specific points. The needles are then gently manipulated or stimulated with very small amounts of electricity if needed. The theory is that the body has major pathways called meridians through which the body's energy moves. Acupuncture helps keep the meridians working properly. When the pathways are blocked, pain or illness can occur. Another theory is that acupuncture helps release the body's endorphins to work as a natural painkiller. What Kind of Aliments Can Acupuncture Treat? According to the World Health Organization, acupuncture can help 28 kinds of ailments, from arthritis to hot flashes in menopausal women. It also helps people suffering from infertility, migraines, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, certain types of toothaches, and can reduce nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. It's also been used to decrease stress and can reduce insomnia. How Painful Are the Needles? The needles are so thin that the patient barely feels anything when they're inserted. Patients undergoing acupuncture treatment often fall asleep during sessions. However, others will experience a boost in energy after a session. There are little to no side effects from acupuncture, and our staff will ensure this therapy is safe for you. Who Shouldn't Ever Use Acupuncture? Acupuncture is not recommended for people with bleeding disorders. People on blood thinners take longer for their blood to clot, making them more at risk of bleeding profusely when needles are used. It's best to check with our doctors before booking your first treatment. Anyone with a pacemaker can still partake in acupuncture. However, those who use a pacemaker, should not involve the use of electrical stimulation on needles.
