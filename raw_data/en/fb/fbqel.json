Every year, many people choose to get the flu vaccine to protect themselves against the seasonal flu. There are several strains of the flu virus, multiple ways to fight against it, and various reasons people should be cautious before getting a vaccination. In general, everyone should get the flu vaccine to promote overall public health, but those concerned should check with a physician. Steps Finding a Flu Vaccine Location - 1Check with your insurance provider for approved locations. Call or go online to see if there's a list of approved locations that you can visit to get a flu shot and have the cost covered by your health insurance provider. Choose a location that's closest to you for the most convenient option. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - Some insurance companies may allow you to get the flu shot and then submit the invoice to them to be reimbursed. Tip: If you don't have health insurance, or you aren't sure if a location is covered, some locations offer the flu shot on a sliding scale fee to make it more affordable. - 2Use an online flu shot locator. In the US, the flu vaccine is offered in a variety of places. Visit a handy online search tool from the CDC to find a location near you where you can get the shot. [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - If you live outside of the US, search online for locations near you where you can get a flu shot. - 3Go to a health clinic to get a flu shot. Your family doctor's office is a great spot, but you can also go to urgent care clinics or health departments. Try to schedule your appointment ahead of time to minimize the wait and the likelihood of running into sick people. [[3]](#_note-3)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Most urgent care clinics don't require you to have an appointment. - 4Stop by a pharmacy to get a flu shot. Most pharmacies offer a quick flu vaccine, which works well when a doctor's appointment is difficult to schedule. Convenience is sometimes an issue, and the availability at pharmacies has shown a significant increase in people who get vaccinated. Visit a local pharmacy and request a flu shot from them. [[4]](#_note-4)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - If you're paying for the vaccine out of pocket, it may be more expensive to get the shot from a pharmacy. - 5See if your local public health department offers the flu vaccine. In many locations, the local Department of Public Health, or DPH, will offer free or reduced rates for a flu shot. Go online and search for your local health department's website. See if they offer the flu shot and make an appointment if it's necessary. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public [Go to source](#) - Sometimes a local DPH will offer a drive-through option for the flu shot. - Not all local health departments will have a working website. If yours doesn't, try calling them to ask about flu shots instead. - 6Ask your employer if they offer the flu vaccine. Employers lose countless man-days per year due to flu illnesses, so it's in their interest to provide flu shots to their employees. There are a variety of resources available to businesses wanting to offer the service. Ask your employer if they'll cover the costs of flu shots. [[6]](#_note-6)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - 7Check with your school or college to see if they offer flu shots. Many colleges and universities offer free or discounted flu shots for their students. Contact your school's administrative office and ask them if they offer flu shots and how you can get one. You could also visit your university health center to ask about getting a flu shot. [[7]](#_note-7)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Advertisement - You may be able to get a flu shot from a university health center even if you aren't a student there. Choosing a Vaccine and Delivery Method - 1Discuss which flu vaccine to get with your doctor. There are several flu vaccine options. Sifting through all the information can be daunting, but there are currently two kinds of flu vaccines: trivalent and quadrivalent, both of which are similarly effective. The vaccine that's best for you depends on factors such as your age, as well as any allergies or underlying medical conditions that you may have. Talk to your doctor about which flu shot is right for you. [[8]](#_note-8)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Note: Flu viruses are constantly changing and the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated as needed. - 2Get the trivalent vaccine as a cheaper and easier option. The trivalent vaccine protects against two types of A-strains of flu (the type that causes epidemics), and one type of B-strain, which is less severe. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support [Go to source](#)The trivalent shot is delivered via a needle or jet injector and is more readily available at pharmacies and doctor's offices, which makes it cheaper to get as well. - The A-strains covered are the H1N1 and H3N2, and the B-strain is either a derivative of Victoria or Yamagata lineage. - Typically, the first B-strain included in the trivalent vaccine is the one predicted to be most prevalent in the annual flu season. - Standard dosage shots use a virus grown in eggs. They are delivered via needle or jet injector. Under certain circumstances, the needle injection can be given to someone as young as six months old. The jet injector, however, is for ages 18 to 64 years old. - Because immune systems weaken with age, a higher dose shot is available for those over 65 years old. The higher dosage has four times the antibody creating substance antigen and helps older people with their immune response. [[10]](#_note-10)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - A cell-based shot is also available for anyone over 18 as an alternative to the typical shot. Instead of an egg, animal cells are used to create the vaccine. The vaccine itself isn't different, but the flexibility of this type of creation is beneficial because it doesn't rely on egg supply. [[11]](#_note-11)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#)This is a good option if you have an egg allergy. - One other method using Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV), also called Flublok, is produced quicker, without the influenza virus or eggs. The production is much faster, potentially better able to react to pandemics, but has a shorter shelf-life. This vaccination is also available for those 18 years and older. - 3Receive the quadrivalent vaccine as an alternative to a traditional shot. The quadrivalent vaccine includes both A-strains of the flu, the B-strain contained in the trivalent vaccine, and one more B-strain. They're more expensive than the trivalent shot, but there are more delivery methods to choose from than the standard shot. [[12]](#_note-12)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Advertisement - The standard quadrivalent shots are grown inside eggs and manufactured into multiple varieties. The age group for these shots may start from six months old in certain cases, and as young as three years old in others. - An intradermal vaccine is available as an alternative to the traditional shot. While the traditional shot is delivered into the muscle, the intradermal shot uses a smaller needle and is injected under the skin. This shot requires less antigen, and is specifically for people 18-64 years old. [[13]](#_note-13)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health [Go to source](#) - A nasal spray, also called the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), is approved for people two to 49 years old. [[14]](#_note-14)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Getting the Vaccine - 1Expose your arm for a shot from a needle. Aside from the nasal spray, flu shots are given intramuscularly in the deltoid, which is the upper arm and shoulder region. While the intradermal applied at 45 degrees just under the skin, the intramuscular injections are 90 degrees straight into the muscle, so your arm needs to be exposed in order for the needle to penetrate the skin.

[Go to source](#) - 2Keep an eye out for potential side effects. The viruses in the flu shot are dead (inactivated) or attenuated (weakened to ineffectiveness), so you will not get the flu from a flu shot. There are some minor side effects, however. If these problems occur, they begin soon after the shot and usually last about 1-2 days. These can include: [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given - Hoarseness or wheezing - Sore, red or itchy eyes - cough - Low-grade fever, chills - Muscle aches and headaches - Runny nose/nasal congestion - Abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea - Fatigue - 3Call a doctor if you observe a severe reaction. Look for any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat or dizziness. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. [[17]](#_note-17)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - 4Report any complications if you live in the US. If you're in the US and you have a negative reaction to the flu shot, ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. People who think that they have been injured by the flu shot can file a claim for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).

While it is recommended that nearly everyone receive the flu vaccine in some fashion, certain people are more susceptible to flu-related complications. If you or someone you know falls into one of the following conditions, it may be best if they consult with a physician should they have concerns about taking the flu vaccine. [[19]](#_note-19)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - Children younger than five years old \u2014 particularly those younger than two \u2014 are particularly vulnerable to complications. Approximately 20,000 children each year have difficulties with the flu vaccine, resulting in potential dehydration, pneumonia, or sometimes worse conditions. [[20]](#_note-20)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - People older than 65 should be cautious because their immune system gets weaker with age. It's estimated that over half the flu-related hospitalizations each year are people over the age of 65. Even worse, 80 - 90% of all seasonal flu deaths are from the same age group. [[21]](#_note-21)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Pregnant women, including two weeks postpartum, may not want to get the flu shot. During pregnancy, there are a myriad of changes in a woman's immune system, as well as her cardiovascular system. As such, pregnant women are more likely to face flu-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and potentially death. [[22]](#_note-22)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities are highly susceptible to outbreaks and illnesses.

Approximately 20,000 children each year have difficulties with the flu vaccine, resulting in potential dehydration, pneumonia, or sometimes worse conditions. - 2Check for medical conditions that could put you at risk for complications. There are a variety of conditions that may exacerbate the potential for flu-related problems. If you have a condition that increases your chances of complications from getting the flu, check with a healthcare professional about getting a vaccine. [[25]](#_note-25)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Asthma is a naturally vicious pairing with the flu. While those with asthma may not be more likely to actually contract the flu, they are more prone to complications. Swollen airways already affected by asthma can be further aggravated by the flu. What's more, asthma attacks may be caused, and worse conditions like pneumonia can be the result. [[26]](#_note-26)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)and cystic fibrosis are at greater risk to flu complications. Complications with asthma and flu can eventually lead to such a worsened condition. - Congestive heart failure symptoms can be exacerbated by flu. - Anything neurological or neurodevelopmental (e.g. epilepsy, stroke, muscular dystrophy) is at high risk. - Heart, blood, endocrine (such as diabetes), kidney, or liver conditions likely make a person more susceptible to flu complications. - Refrain if you have Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). In 1976 there was a connection between an influenza vaccine and GBS. People who have GBS naturally have flawed immune systems, are therefore susceptible to flu vaccine complications, and should check with a physician before getting treated. [[27]](#_note-27)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Asthma is a naturally vicious pairing with the flu.

If you are taking long-term medication for diseases like HIV, AIDS, or cancer, your immune system may be weakened. Also, if you've been on steroids for a long time, or if you are under 19 years old and have been on aspirin therapy, you could be at greater risk of complications caused by the flu shot. Talk to your doctor before you get one.

If you are morbidly obese, which is categorized by a Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than 40, you are more likely to have various heart ailments, metabolic issues, and even certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about how you can lose weight in a healthy way so you can safely receive the flu vaccine. As such, there is a greater risk with the flu vaccine.

Act when the vaccine is released. There is an annual window to receive the vaccine before peak flu season, and it's only a few months. Vaccines are typically produced earlier in the year, with shipments arriving in stores a few months later, usually around July or August. [[30]](#_note-30)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - 2Try to get the vaccine by October if possible. Influenza can occur at any time, but most activity ranges from October to May. The zenith of the problems in the United States is from December to February. To best protect yourself against contracting the flu, get the shot before the fall. [[31]](#_note-31)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - In addition, the body needs time to build immunity, so getting the vaccine before the flu season gives the body a chance to do this. Tip: The earlier people get vaccinated the better because that creates a large group of vaccinated people. If you miss the window, don't fret; it's never too late to receive the vaccination. - 3Go early for childhood vaccinations. There are two doses for children aged six months to eight years old, and ensuring an early delivery of the first dose allows plenty of time for the second dose. The second dose must be given at least four weeks after the first, and should be administered prior to flu season for maximum efficacy. [[32]](#_note-32)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Advertisement - Wait if you are moderately or severely ill. You should wait until you recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Expert Q&A [Add New Question] [Submit] Tips - It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the seasonal flu vaccination. [[33]](#_note-33)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Protection from the flu vaccine lasts approximately one year. - Getting the flu vaccine does not guarantee immunity to the flu. There are constant changes ongoing within the flu viruses, and there is always a chance of a different strain. [Show More Tips](#) Warnings - Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains a preservative called thimerosal.
