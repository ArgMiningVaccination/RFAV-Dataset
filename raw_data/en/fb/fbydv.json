As we continue to work with the campus leadership to strategize and prioritize our mission to enhance efficiencies, i am continually amazed at the creativity and productivity of our faculty, staff and students. these individuals have continually surpassed expectations, allowing the school to continue to move forward as one of the top-ranked pharmacy schools in the country.Message from the Dean With warm regards, Wayne K. Anderson, professor and deanou r M i S Si o n S T A T E M E nT the mission of the university at Buffalo school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences is to educate students in pharmacy practice and the pharmaceutical sciences, to create and disseminate knowledge in pharmacy practice and the pharmaceutical sciences, to provide patient care, and to provide services to the community-at-large based on this knowledge. this mission is to be achieved consistent with the highest ethical standards and with respect for diversity and cultural sensitivity. the mission recognizes pharmaceutical care as a mode of pharmacy practice within the health care team in which the patient is empowered \"to achieve the desired outcomes of drug and related therapy.\" the mission also recognizes that research in the broad area of the clinical sciences, the pharmaceutical sciences, and edu - cation is necessary to create and maintain a body of knowledge needed for professional education, health care delivery and the advancement of science. in this context, our goal is to enhance the school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences so that it will continue to be one of the strong components of the university at Buffalo and the state university of new York system. this will involve a focus on those areas of unique strength within the school and those areas that form unique, inter - disciplinary bridges within the university. in hochstetter hall, mager approaches his laboratory research with the unique perspective of a former practicing pharmacist. \"i actually earned my bachelor's degree in pharmacy, when you could get such a thing,\" he laughs. originally from Albion, n.Y., mager worked as a community pharmacist before returning to uB to earn both a pharm d degree (2000) and phd (2002) in pharmaceutical sciences. After completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the national institute on Aging, he joined the uB sopps faculty in 2004. the six years he spent as a staff and supervising pharmacist with the former fay's drugs was a special time in his life, he says. \"t o be able to explain difficult concepts to the layperson, to actually translate science that would be meaningful to indi-viduals, to me was really gratifying,\" he says. But he had gotten a good taste of research during an undergrad - uate rotation, investigating the relative efficiency of acetylcholin - esterase isoforms and conducting functional assays for tacrine, the first fdA-approved drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's. \" it was a glorious experience,\" he says of defining a hypothesis and working with faculty member harvey Berman and members of his lab to test that hypothesis. \" the career lifestyle of academic research was really quite appealing to me.\" After being accepted into the pharm d program, mager landed a coveted graduate research slot with William J. Jusko, sun Y distinguished professor and chair of the department of pharmaceutical sciences, looking at corticosteroids and inter - feron beta as model compounds that modulate the immune system. the effects of both drugs take time to develop because they cause changes in the expression of certain pro - teins and enzymes. \"the complexity between the exposure and the outcome of the drugs led to theoretical concepts that could be broadly applied to many compounds,\" mager explains. in 2001, he published his first two papers, describing the mathematics of time-dependent and target-mediated systems. \" the modeling sug - gested that the drug binding to the target receptor influenced the time the drug spends in the body and also the effects that it elicits. since then, there have been many drugs identified to elicit the same behavior. And the real expansion comes from monoclonal antibodies and proteins.\" Bench to Bedside, Bedside to Bench donald mager and Brian tsuji, uB sopps assistant professors of pharmaceutical sciences and pharmacy practice, respectively, agree: the time of the \"magic bullet\" is most likely over. that doesn't mean there isn't new knowledge at bedside and bench waiting to be discovered\u2014particularly as it relates to novel and individualized pharmacotherapy. \"We're beyond the days, i think, where we're going to develop the single drug for a single target that is going to knock out that target with a single dosing regimen for all individuals and achieve the outcome we wish to achieve,\" says mager, whose bench work has carved major pK/pd modeling inroads into the optimization of drug therapy for cancers and metabolic diseases. t the bedside, tsuji is on the front lines. \"We're losing the arms race in the fight against resistant 'superbugs' and are investigating novel ways where we can optimize the activity of antibiotics,\" he says of his clinical research in infectious disease, warning of the growing global threat from antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A 3one dose doesn't fit All: evaluating the magic Bullet By Jessica Thorpe, Outside the Box Communications for decades. one area of research by samira merali (pharmd postdoctoral fellow), dung ngo (pharmd student) and neang ly (phd student) looks at vancomycin and colistin in combination with a plethora of other antibiotics.\" tsuji earned his Bs in pharmaceutical sciences in 2001 and pharmd in 2003 from Wayne state university in detroit. After working as a clinical pharmacist at detroit Receiving hospital, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the detroit medical center and Wayne state university, after which he joined the uB sopps faculty in 2005.\"As a student, clinical pharmacist and fellow, i was so intrigued by antibiotics and infectious diseases because of the huge impact that pharmacists could make on a medical team to improve the outcomes of patients. my early passion for antibi- otics was driven by the fact that we could not clearly answer a number of clinical questions on medical rounds, which is why i chose to investigate some of them in a research setting,\" he says, adding that these include pharmacy-related questions about the right antibiotic, the right dosage and the right dura-tion. tsuji, like mager, relies on basic pK/pd principles and model- ing, in collaboration with faculty members Alan forrest and Jurgen Bulitta, to carry out his investigations. he and his research team of postdoctoral fellows, pharmd and phd students, technicians and undergraduates utilize new experi- mental techniques that mimic human pharmacokinetics in a test tube to study human conditions and severity of a bacterial infection. \"We use novel in vitro pharmacodynamic hollow fiber models to determine the most optimal way to administer antibiotics to prevent resistance,\" tsuji explains. \"one of our most recent papers was titled 'implications for dosing in pneumonia,' so we try to attack clinically relevant issues that can be brought back to the bedside.\" toward this scientific end, his research seeks to understand heterogeneous resistance for vancomycin and colsitin among \"flip-flopping\" phenotypes\u2014bacteria that actually adapt and mutate in the face of drug therapy. \"it's similar to the tip of an iceberg, where everything appears normal on the surface. however, after suboptimal drug therapy, the whole population of bacteria can mutate and become resistant, which presents a serious problem,\" tsuji says. \"these bacteria have been called 'Jekyll-and-hyde' organisms because they show different faces and change depending on their environment\u2014from the non-threatening staph in your nose to causing very severe infections, such as bacterial endocarditis or necrotizing pneumonia.\" Working both in cooke hall and at uB's new York state center of excellence in Bioinformatics and life sciences on the downtown campus, tsuji also looks at bacterial genetics to find ways to more effectively treat patients. the general theme for both bacterial pathogens he is working on is that they can adapt to drugs and to their environment by communicating with each other. consequently, tsuji is investi- gating the role of bacterial quorum sensing in the development of drug resistance and how it also may contribute to severity of infection. At least one of the quorum-sensing genes that relate to bacterial crosstalk causes resistance in vancomycin, the for-mer \"magic bullet\" drug for treating staph infections, he says. \"if we could potentially use drugs that target these genes, we can be very aggressive at individualizing therapy to use single or combinations of drugs differently.\" tsuji collaborates with six different hospitals\u2014from Albany to Rochester to Buffalo\u2014to determine the prevalence of vancomy- cin-resistant phenotypes and what can be done to treat these infections. like mager, he shares his research in national and international lectures to fellow scientists and scholars. the buzzword these days is individualized or personalized med- icine, both mager and tsuji say. \"if we have a model that we think explains how the system is functioning, then we can look for patient covariates, individual characteristics that explain why one individual is responding differently than another indi-vidual. And i think a model-based approach will really provide the best path for the individualization of therapy,\" mager says. tsuji smiles when hearing of mager's comments, agreeing, \"it is true: one dose doesn't fit all.\"Bench to Bedside, Bedside to Benchone dose doesn't fit All : evaluating the magic Bullet \"drugs always bind to a target to cause their response. But it's relatively new knowledge that that interaction influences how the body processes the drug,\" he says. \"f or select new drugs, binding to the target receptor influences the observed time course of the concentrations. this is what is unique.\" mager's current lab work, carried out with a team of four post-doctoral fellows, six phd students, four master's students and one technician, is focused on anti-cancer and immunomodula-tory drugs\u2014drugs that alter the immune system response\u2014with an eye still fixed on interferon beta, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. \"the thing we're really excited about right now in this field is the use of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic models,\" mager says. \"We want to understand how physiology and drug properties together influence the time course of exposure and response. how do diseases, patient genetics, the environment (like diet and smoking), concomitant medications and other factors influ-ence what we observe? the modeling allows us to bring all of these facts together into one cohesive unit to better understand what is influencing what we observe in terms of drug exposure-response and clinical outcomes,\" he says. \"We're trying to understand how to optimize therapy in the presence of complex systems. We hope to eventually be able to personalize pharma-cotherapy by appreciation for how the system is working.\" mager says modestly that his research\u2014which is funded through nih co-investigator grants, the uB-pfizer strategic Alliance, the uB center for protein therapeutics and company- based sponsors\u2014is in its \"early days.\" this is true in general for pK/pd research as it relates to combination drug therapy, acknowledged as the wave of the future. But one of mager's postdoctoral fellows, John harrold, has developed an innova- tive mechanism-based pharmacodynamic model that predicts synergy for the anti-cancer drug rituximab in combination with other therapies. \"it's hard enough to optimize one drug. how does one opti - mize treatment with multiple drugs, each with its own mecha -nism, and then interactions between mechanisms?\" mager asks. \"What was exciting in this very preliminary mouse study is that we were able to take information from single drugs and actually predict the observed synergistic response\u2014two drug combinations were actually more beneficial than just their additive sum effects.\" from the clinical research perspective, tsuji is looking at the potential of combination drug therapies that can be use - ful at the bedside and eradicate highly resistant pathogens, including staphylococcus areus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. \"some strains have mutated to develop resistance to nearly all commercially available antibiotics. our research on these two critically important pathogens focuses on using pK/pd, bacte - rial genetics and patient specific factors to optimize outcome,\" he says. tsuji says that his research, funded through nih co-investigator grants, upstate new York consortium for healthcare Research and Quality foundation grants, the uB-pfizer strategic Alliance and company-based sponsors, is just starting to take off. \"it is so exciting to work in a team of pharmd and phd students, undergraduates, research scientists and pharmd and phd post- doctoral fellows who are so truly motivated to research antibiot-ics in infectious diseases. it is because of all of their hard work, not mine, that we as a team have been able to do what we do. they deserve all of the credit for our research.\" part of his research team is looking at ways to preserve the usefulness of the drugs vancomycin and colistin. Both drugs have been in existence for more than 30 years and have been the last line of defense in the treatment of resistant gram-negative and gram-positive infections. these antibiotics recently have come under the gun because of potential issues of resis-tance and poor patient outcomes. \"At the bedside, we really don't have strong evidence, both clini-cally and experimentally, of how to optimally use these drugs, although they have been around 4 5 is research remains focused on this principle of target-mediated drug disposition, a concept brought to light in 1994 by gerhard levy, sunY distinguished professor emeritus in sopps. mager now travels the world giving lectures on novel interpretations of the concept. HDean's Ambassador Programs to help select and recruit the class of 2013, the office of Admissions and Advisement engaged our dean's Alumni Ambassadors and dean's student Ambassadors. these programs were created in 2007 to encourage the enrollment of talented and diverse students through the personal efforts of our esteemed alumni and current students. our 54 dean's Alumni Ambassadors make up a select advoca cy group that provides a meaningful way for our graduates to sup- port their alma mater. Alumni have an opportunity to interact with prospective students through a variety of activities, includ ing committee review of applications, on-site interviewing, letter writing, making congratulatory admission and scholarship con-tacts, and representing uB at college fairs and informational ses- sions. this volunteer corps also helps maintain and increase our exposure at local, national and international recruitment events while minimizing the school's travel-related recruitment costs. through the dean's student Ambassadors program, 50 current students interact with prospective students through such activi- ties as hosting visitors, welcoming and mingling with applicants, leading guided tours of the campus and school, and posting admissions blogs. upon graduation, it is expected that student ambassadors will become alumni ambassadors.Continuing Education Office of Postgraduate Professional Continuing Education Fiscal Year 2008-09 uB programs 14 uB certificate programs 1 home study programs 3 cosponsored 16 Total 34 the office of postgraduate professional continuing education, department of pharmacy practice, conducted and accredited 30 continuing pharmacy education programs over the past year. programming-delivery options have grown to include live, home study, Web-based, videoconferencing, teleconferences and Webex offerings. Webex allows students to participate in educational programming directly from a computer, featuring interactivity during live sessions. this modality offers the opportunity for alumni and preceptors to participate in sopps offerings from across the country. the postgraduate office has brought continuing education pro-grams to a number of our precepting hospital sites, allowing for educational sessions to be conducted at the convenience of the pharmacy staff. during the coming year, this initiative will contin- ue to be expanded to additional Western new York training sites. A number of our sopps faculty members have been certified as official trainers of the AphA immunization program. for the 2008-09 academic year, the postgraduate office has certified more than 92 pharmacists in the Western new York region as AphA immunizers. certification will continue for pharmacists who would like to become immunizers. precepting sopps students offers pharmacists the opportunity to gain credits and apply those credits toward continuing education opportunities. Additional information on becoming a preceptor can be found on the school's Web site (www.pharmacy.buffalo.edu) or by contacting the office of experiential education at (716) 645-4799. online registration is available for all programming via the school's Web site (www.pharmacy.buffalo.edu).Admissions the office of Admissions and Advisement strives to improve and enhance our processes from year to year. in 2008-09, we expanded our in-person interview sessions to include a longer interview, a detailed discussion on residencies and fellowships, and a patient-care-oriented group activity led by our dean's student Ambassadors. our dean's Alumni Ambassadors participated as volunteer recruiters by attending graduate school recruit - ment fairs across the country. these initiatives, with many others, continue to have a positive impact on the quality of our talented and diverse applicant pool, ultimately allowing us to enroll the best of the best in our p1 pharm d class. the sopps educates students in pharmacy and the pharmaceutical sciences, providing them with the critical thinking skills to allow them to achieve the desired outcomes of drug-related therapy and disease management through research and clinical intervention. for 2008, the university at Buffalo welcomed another highly talented freshman class, with 330 students indicat- ing pre-pharmacy as their intended major, representing nearly 10 percent of the incoming class. uB's early assurance program continues to offer outstanding pre-pharmacy students the opportunity to enter our pharmd professional program with a minimum gpA of 3.5. for the 2008-09 academic year, the median gpA for early assurance students accepted into the program was 3.8Degrees grante D (2008-09) pharmd 114 Bs in pharmaceutical sciences 16 Bs/ms in pharmaceutical sciences 5 ms in pharmaceutical sciences 5 phd in pharmaceutical sciences 2 Total 142 Degree Program enrollment (2008-09) p1 Year 116 p2 Year 122 p3 Year 127 p4 Year 125 PharmD Subtotal 490 Bs in pharmaceutical sciences 30 Bs/ms in pharmaceutical sciences 9 ms in pharmaceutical sciences 7 phd in pharmaceutical sciences 37 Pharmaceutical Sciences Subtotal 83 Total Enrollment 573PharmD bS bS/MS MS PhD Totalenrollment (Fall heaDcount) 2004-05 2005-062006-07 2007-08 2008-09 490 30 9 7 37 573 467 34 4 6 35 546 448 29 1 8 35 521 470 37 3 7 39 556 481 32 11 5 35 564 aPP licant overview number of applicationsPercent (numbers) holding a baccalaureate or higher degreeYear of admission (expected year of graduation)number admittedAverage GPAAverage PcAT score *During this year, SoPPS accepted scores (e.g., MCAT) and waived PCAT requirements for UB early assurance students. ** 2009 (2013) 1,472 125 3.60 397 42% (52)2004 (2008) 822 117 3.48 396 39% (46) 2005 (2009) 1,051 120 3.55 395 34% (41) 2006 (2010) 1,375 124 3.54 395 28% (35) 2007 (2011) 1,196 122 3.50 398 51% (62) 2008 (2012) 1,401 119 3.60 395 52% (62) 6 7 EducationResidency Training Program Summary 2008-09 the department of pharmacy practice maintained its commitment to providing postgraduate education through general (pg Y1) and specialty (pg Y2) residency training. during the 2008-09 academic year, our resi- dency program was composed of five pgY1 and five pgY2 programs. our mission: to educate pharmacy residents in pharmacy practice, clinical precepting, didactic teaching, clinical research and manuscript writing; to provide patient care; and to provide services to the community-at-large based upon this knowl-edge, with the goal of training pharmacy residents to practice autonomously in the clinical pharmacy and/or academic settings\u2014sets the framework for our pro-gram. the goals of our program are accomplished by involving our residents in clinical activities, research projects and teaching. specifically, our residents par- ticipate in a unique didactic research course, attend an established teaching certificate program, actively par-ticipate in small and large group didactic teaching and clinical precepting, present an Accreditation council for pharmacy education accredited ce program and conduct a research project. the university at Buffalo school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences sponsors an annual Residency presentation day, which continued to expand in 2009, and now includes mul-tiple residency programs from the Western new York, Rochester and syracuse areas.

Balthasar, with assis - tance from faculty members Robert straubinger and sathy Balu- iyer, and other members of the department. the center seeks to apply our capabilities in protein analysis, formulation, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to address major questions regarding the delivery, phar - macokinetics and in vivo effects of such protein drugs as monoclonal antibodies. Research labs are located in uB's new York state center of excellence in Bioinformatics and life sciences on the downtown campus, and in cooke and hochstetter halls on the north campus. financial sup - port\u2014$1.5 million\u2014for the center's second year of research and training was provided by pfizer, merck, hoffman- laRoche, eli lilly, genentech and Abbott, with additional funding provided by novartis and Amgen. the department's outstanding faculty covers a range of aca-demic levels and carry highly productive, largely nih-funded research programs, as well as some corporate support. more than $200,000 for graduate student training was provided by merck, eli lilly, daiichi sankyo, schering-plough and Amgen; and pfizer pharmaceuticals continued funding a $500,000 train- ing grant to support six students and four postdocs. the department sponsored an active seminar program that featured 42 presentations by local and visiting scientists. meindert danhof, professor of pharmacology at leiden university in the netherlands, was selected to deliver the 2008 gerhard levy distinguished lecture in pharmaceutical sciences. his presentation was titled, \" systems pharmacology in translational medicines Research.\" other notable speakers during the academic year included Jean- michel scherrmann from the university of paris, eric Xu from the van Andel Research institute in michigan, mary spilker from pfizer, Amy Rosenberg from the fdA, Jeffrey Wald from gsK, margarita dubocovich from the uB department of pharmacology and toxicology and Ravi iyengar from mount sinai. mario Rocci, executive vice president of prevelare life sciences, was selected by the graduate students to present the Annual pharmaceutics Alumnus lecture. his topic: \" innovations in Bioanalysis in the Biomedical Arena.\" Research and Training Special Honors for Faculty and Staff 14 15department faculty members disseminated their scientific accomplishments and knowledge, publishing 88 research arti - cles and book chapters and delivering 147 seminars, lectures and research presentations at various scientific meetings, and at academic and industrial venues. five faculty members serve as editors of journals, and many participate on journal editorial boards and nih study sections. the department in may continued its tradition of offering annu - al courses in \" pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic modeling,\" \"protein therapeutics\" and \" population pharmacokinetic modeling\" for visiting scientists from the pharmaceutical industry, academia and the fdA. the pK/pd modeling course was the 17th such session of that course. similarly, the depart - ment offers an annual summer workshop in \" molecular genetic methodologies for pharmaceutical sciences.\" some of these courses also are provided on site at various pharmaceutical companies and other universities. for example, faculty mem - bers William Jusko, Joseph Balthasar and donald mager taught the pK/pd modeling course to 52 scientists from various coun - tries at the university of paris descartes in January 2009. several faculty members received recognition from sun Y dur - ing the past year. Jusko was promoted to sun Y distinguished professor, the highest faculty rank in the sun Y system. in addition, straubinger received the chancellor's Award for excellence in scholarship and creative Activities, and gayle Brazeau received the chancellor's Award for excellence in faculty service. the department is poised for further growth in its research and training programs, with plans to add an additional faculty member, increase training of graduate students and postdoc - toral fellows, and expand its expertise in the areas of protein therapeutics and cancer therapeutics. Department of Pharmacy Practice the 2008-09 academic year was a robust and productive year for the department of pharmacy practice. the faculty base grew with the addition of four new faculty members: nicholas norgard, pharmd, and Richard Kraft, pharmd, cardiology. these faculty members have added much to the department's teaching and research programs, and we look forward to their continued contributions. our faculty members represented the school well at many national meetings. At the 2008 American Association of colleges of pharmacy meeting, five faculty members gave presentations on topics ranging from faculty development to Web-based certificate programs. in addition, five faculty members and fellows were key presenters on a variety of nationally relevant topics at the 2008 joint meeting of the interscience conference on Antimicrobial Agents and chemotherapy and the infectious diseases society of America. the department is proud of its continued collaboration with the new York state department of health. Joint activities have continued to grow and expand, with participation in a pilot medication therapy management program, statewide drug utilization review and a novel prescriber education program. these efforts, in collaboration with other sunY health sciences units, are expected to benefit new York state medicaid recipients. the office of experiential education has continued to meet the ever-increasing demands for rotational sites for our p1-p4 students. the experiential program has completed its transition to standardized, six-week p4 rotations and has launched p4 summer rotations. the number of out-of-region rotations continues to grow, and rotation scheduling has begun earlier , allowing for better student and site plan - ning. the introductory pharmacy practice experiences continue to progress and will be fully implemented in academic year 2009-10. faculty development programs continue to expand and grow.

James Buckley, class of 1953, addressed all alumni attendees, and our p4 class, the class of 2009, was welcomed into the association via special candlelight ceremony. the American society of health system pharmacists mid-year meeting is one the association's national outreach meetings. our 2008 A shp alumni reception was held in orlando and was attended by more than 110 alumni and guests. We remind all Ashp attendees to look for the uB reception at all A shp meet - ings. it is a great way to reconnect with your alumni colleagues, faculty and students from the sopps. the school's annual 2009 awards ceremony recognized the alum - ni association's premier award recipients: mario Rocci Jr . '76, '81, Willis g. gregory Award recipient, and tammie lee demler '92, '02, orville c. Baxter memorial Award recipient. Both recipients represent the highest caliber of research and practice, and the sopps is proud to recognize these outstanding professionals. one of the primary missions of the alumni association is support of students. in 2008-09, the association awarded six grants to pharm d students in financial need. congratulations to the fol - lowing six students who were awarded $500 grants: p4 students shetall desai, Jonathan dittmar, erica paul stoyell; p3 student christopher miller; and p2 student christina hall the alumni association values the important role it plays in the school and its ability to bring alumni colleagues together through various activities and programs. Alumni Affairs 2009 a war Ds ceremon Y 2008 c lass reunionQ Z The school recently broke ground on its future home, Kapoor Hall, named in honor of John N. Kapoor '72, whose total giving of $10.8 million inspired several major donations this year in support of the facility, including gifts from Ken Yee '75; Steve Giroux '81; and Robert Miller '59, all of which funded patient assessment and counseling rooms. Located on the South Campus, Kapoor Hall will unite the school with the other UB health sciences schools that comprise the Academic Health Center: Dental Medicine, Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health and Health Professions. Once the pharmacy school's move to the South Campus is completed in 2012, it will represent its return to the City of Buffalo, where the school\u2014the university's second-oldest entity after the medical school\u2014was founded more than 120 years ago. Other highlights for the school during 2008-09 included: n Surpassing its $2.3 million commitment goal by securing $2,520,852 in commitments. n Collecting a total of $2,353,700 from 677 donors. n Receiving gifts from 108 donors who increased the amount they had given the previous fiscal year. n Reaching an alumni-participation rate of 19.4 percent, matching last year's giving rate, which was the highest of the UB health sciences schools and second highest of all UB schools. n Welcoming eight new members to the Willis G. Gregory Society, bringing the total to 68 members. As the only pharmacy school in the State University of New York system, we will continue to offer the highest-quality education and opportunities to our students as we look forward to our future in Kapoor Hall. You are an integral part of that future and we thank you for your support. Development Q&ADean Anderson's n n diveRsitY n leAdeRship n technolog Y n fleXiBilit Y 28 29 Q Q Q Qwhy is alumni giving so important to the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences? Alumni support provides the critical dif- ference in our programs. the scholarship of discovery, integration, application and teaching requires an openness to change. new programs, new ideas, new applica-tions and new ways of integrating knowl-edge across disciplines present constant challenges defining the scope and breadth of our school. the critical difference pro- vided by alumni support opens opportuni-ties for change and growth. what areas does the Dean's Vision fund support? how are donors' gifts used specifically? the dean's vision fund provides support and flexibility in several areas: flexibility to support pioneering ideas in the form of research seed grants: n A testing ground for new ideas. n support allowing new faculty members to focus on scholarship. flexibility to seize upon opportunities for student/faculty/staff professional develop - ment: n student travel to professional meetings and leadership conferences. n staff development to utilize emerging technology. n Achievement awards. n faculty support for teaching innovations. flexibility to support and recognize distin- guished students: n expansion of cultural, economic and intellectual diversity. n competitiveness to attract distinguished students. n opportunities for unique student schol- arships.flexibility to support new technology: n leverage for additional funding from foundations, corporations and govern-ment agencies. n Build new resources to enhance faculty and student recruitment. can you talk about the hayes Society and what it represents? many alumni have made commitments in their estate planning, while others have made gifts at levels ranging from $5,000 to several million dollars. these commit- ments and gifts represent a continuing legacy and example for future donors. the support provides: n transformational impact on the school in support of key initiatives. n consistent support for student scholar - ships. n support for postgraduate fellowships (post-pharmd and post-phd). n support for lectureships, bringing leaders from around the world so that students, faculty and alumni can expe - rience new ideas and approaches to research, education, clinical care and other timely topics. n support for thematic areas of scholar - ship, including endowed chairs, named professorships and named research centers. n support for technology to ensure the availability of state-of-the-art technol - ogy. what is the willis G. Gregory Society? the Willis g. gregory society provides a level of annual support that has grown steadily over the years. the support, whether for the dean's vision fund or tar - geted for a specific objective, represents the largest source of annual support for the school. society members share the school's vision for scholarship in discov - ery, integration, application and teaching.how will Kapoor hall, the new home of the pharmacy school, change the student and alumni experience? Kapoor hall is the first building designed specifically for education and research programs in the school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences. the building, designed with open spaces and light, will create a sense of community for students, faculty, staff and alumni. But more than just a community, Kapoor hall will provide opportunities for clinical education focusing on patient care and clinical outcomes in an evolving interpro - fessional health care environment. it will offer a flexible research environment that promotes collaboration. donors, inspired by the potential offered by Kapoor hall, have committed support to name spaces within the building. the named spaces provide a donor legacy, but more impor - tantly, they will inspire students with the contributions that individuals have made to the profession\u2014contributions that have shaped our profession. kaPoor hall, s chool oF Pharmac Y anD Pharmaceutical sciences31Donor honor roll class oF 1937 Loyalty Club irwin e.

John Kapoor Graduate Fellowship in Pharmaceutical Sciences Suraj G. Bhansali, a PhD student, came from Kadoli, india, to attend uB, which he said \"was easy to select because the pharmaceutical sci-ences department here is top-ranked and glob - ally recognized for its pharmacokinetic/phar - macodynamic training.\" he said the fellow - ship he received has been \"tremendous\" and allows him to give undivided attention to his studies and research. in addition, \"it helped my parents and family back home breathe and sleep comfortably without worrying about me. After all, if i convert the expenses and fees in my native curren - cy, the total is in the millions!\" Bhansali, who has \"a great passion for research,\" wants to work as a research scientist for a pharmaceutical company to develop new medicines. \" i like to help patients and their families by dedicating my career to invent (or discover) novel therapies.\"Aversano-Strozzi Scholarship Fund Nicholas Falco, Class of 2010, earned a Bs in chemistry from uB in 2005 and, having enjoyed his undergraduate years, enrolled in the pharmacy school. Receiving a scholarship helped him travel to a mid-year meeting of the American society of health system pharmacists, a central gathering point for pharmacy residency programs from around the country. falco hopes to complete a one-year pharmacy practice residency post-gradu - ation, then practice in an ambulatory clinic setting, \"where i can meet one-on-one with patients to go over their medication regimens and tailor them to individual needs.\" Class of 2008 Scholarship Gauri Rao, Class of 2011, already has earned a bachelor's degree in engineer - ing and a master's degree in computer engineering. A mother of two who lives in east Amherst, she chose uB because leaving the area was not an option. she became familiar with the pharmacy school while volunteering for one of the professors, and found that \"what started out as the only choice for phar - macy school was the best choice for me.\" the class of 2008 scholarship has helped her achieve her academic goals, which include rotations as part of the introductory pharmacy practice experience and courses that have led her to become interested in clinical research in the area of oncology medica - tion. president of the uB chapter of the American pharmaceutical Association, Rao also is involved with the international pharmaceutical students federation, for which she organized a fundraiser to provide medications to Aids patients in Zimbabwe. Henry A. Panasci Scholarship Fund Nicholas Fusco, vice president of the Class of 2010, chose uB for its excellent pharmacy program, but also because, as a native of Buffalo, it pro - vided \"a fantastic opportunity to study at a first-class insti - tution while being close to my family and friends.\" his scholarship \"was a tremendous aid in deferring the rising costs of college tuition.\" After completing a residency, fusco would like to become a clinical pharmacist as part of an inpatient or outpatient clinical service. he also would like to teach at the university level. UB SoPPS Golf Scholarship Seon Jo Park, Class of 2010, from seoul, south Korea, chose uB because of the stel - lar reputation of its pharmacy program, which \"was the best of all the schools considered.\" the scholarship helped her travel to national pharmacy meetings, which \"helped me broaden my perspective on pharmacy practice and my knowledge of clinical prac - tice.\" she hopes to work as a resident post-graduation and is interested in several specialties, including oncol - ogy, infectious diseases, intensive care, and pediatric and emergency medicine.Student Scholarship Profiles Jessmer rao bhansali Falco Park Fusco Thank you to the many donors who gave to support academic and need- based scholarships and fellowships, which totaled $375,611 during 2008-09.ExPEnDiTurES bY funDinG Sourc E for rESEA rch AnD TrAinin Federal NIH Other State$2,639,779 $5,651,285 $2,267,787$180,310 $196,728 School-wide Committees our school-wide committees give governance and oversight to our school. the structure, composition, and charges of the school's standing committees are prescribed in the bylaws of the school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences.
