Other alternative medicine programs, like hypnotherapy or homeopathy, are typically geared toward those with an ND (or MD) and come in the form of diplomas or certificates. Many naturopathic doctors use homeopathy and hypnotherapy to complement their existing treatments.

Your field of expertise will determine your licensure requirements. Licensure is done through the state you plan to work in, while certifications are generally provided by industry organizations. Certification does not necessarily mean you are licensed to practice. Naturopathic Doctor Not all states distribute licenses for alternative medicine practitioners, but the following states do, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) is a proponent of licensure in all 50 states. - Washington - Vermont - Utah - North Dakota - Alaska - Oregon - Montana - Minnesota - New Hampshire - Maine - Connecticut - Arizona - Hawaii - Kansas - Idaho - California - Colorado - Maryland - Massachusetts - Pennsylvania - Rhode Island The [Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians (HANP)](https://hanp.net/) certifies NDs.

Naturopathic degree programs train students to become an expert in the [field of alternative medicine](/blog/alternative-medicine-careers/) as well as how to work with patients seeking a different form of medical treatment. ND programs are rigorous and prepare students to work as a primary care physician. In addition to a clinical practicum, courses will teach you about: - Naturopathic theory and philosophy - Homeopathy - Botanical medicine - Biochemistry - Anatomy and organ systems - Therapeutic manipulation - Nutrition How long will it take? Your level of education will determine how much schooling you'll need. An alternative medicine degree can take the following time to complete: - A bachelor's degree program takes four years - Master's degree programs typically take two years - Doctoral programs last between four and five years Are online programs available? Not unlike traditional medical schools, online naturopathic programs exist, but professional organizations often discourage students from distance learning because medicine is such a hands-on field. The [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)](https://cnme.org/), the accreditation body for ND schools, doesn't accredit online programs. If you earn a degree from a non-accredited school, you'll be unable to sit for the professional exam to become licensed as an ND. If you work in a state where NDs aren't licensed and you've earned a degree from a non-accredited school, you can still use the ND title, but cannot present yourself as a physician. Instead, you can use your expertise to counsel patients. However, if you're looking to earn a certificate in hypnotherapy online or [attend homeopathy courses virtually](/blog/online-homeopathy-courses/), various programs are available. How much will my education cost? If you attend a four-year naturopathic school full time, expect to pay [approximately $25,000* in tuition per year](/blog/naturopathic-schools/). While the cost can be steep, find out if your school offers financial aid, scholarships or grants. Making sure your school is accredited is particularly important if you'll be applying for financial aid. These schools qualify for federal and state financial aid, such as work-study programs and Stafford loans. Programs for homeopathy and hypnotherapy cost less because they're usually shorter in length and offered to practicing NDs and MDs as a way to complement their services. Homeopathic school tuition runs between $200 and $7,500. The reason for the wide range in cost is length of time. Programs in the $200 to $1,000 range are generally week-long or weekend seminars, while the more expensive courses last longer and are more in-depth. *Cost of tuition only. Prices do not reflect other fees. Are there prerequisites? ND program prerequisites While each school has their own requirements, most NDs will expect incoming students to have: - Completed bachelor's degree - Satisfactory GPA - Completed coursework in major sciences, psychology and humanities Homeopathy program prerequisites Pay attention to the prerequisites for homeopathic programs as some are geared strictly for medical professionals. These will require a medical license as a prerequisite. Programs offered for anyone interested in the practice generally don't have prerequisites. What accreditation is there for my program? Accreditation is an important part of your alternative medicine education. It's the seal of approval that a school's program provides a standard of education accepted in the industry. Be aware there are different bodies of accreditation based on the area of medicine you plan to practice. Naturopathic Doctor Attending a school which is not accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) will be a hindrance if you try to sit for a professional board exam. Only graduates of CNME-accredited schools are permitted to take these exams. Homeopathy Classical [homeopathy programs](/blog/homeopathy-training/) are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Homeopathic Education in North America.
