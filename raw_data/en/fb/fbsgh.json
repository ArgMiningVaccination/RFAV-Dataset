Rahanni, 'of one heart', is healing for the mind, body and soul. There is no separation, we are from one divine energy source. Rahanni helps balance our masculine and feminine aspects, helps us release our fears and negative energy that we accumulate from our experiences on this earth. It helps us with communication and to gain control over our lives. . Quantum Touch is an effective method for reducing back pain, realigning structure, balancing organs, glands and systems, releasing emotional blockages, reducing muscle aches, healing injuries, and so much more. It can address the root cause of disease rather than just working on symptoms, and creates the space for true healing to occur. Using Life Force Energy and the highest vibrational force of unconditional Love, an Energy Healing session can bring you to a new state of balance for your highest good. By offering and holding a high vibrational field in a coherent manner, an Energy Healer allows your body/mind/soul to entrain to that new normal.
