The medicine is both an art and a science, focusing on whole-person wellness. Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of a person's condition, rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic care is tailored to the individual and emphasizes prevention and self-care. The therapies available include dietary and lifestyle counseling, botanical or herbal medicine, homeopathic medicine, vitamin and nutrient supplementation and hydrotherapy. Naturopathic doctors work with all other branches of medical science, referring to medical doctors, specialists, and other practitioners when appropriate. Naturopathic medicine is founded on the following six philosophic principles: FIRST DO NO HARM Naturopathic Doctors use therapies that are minimally invasive and minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to help the body heal. IDENTIFY AND TREAT THE CAUSE Naturopathic Doctors seek to identify and remove all obstacles to healing, rather than palliate or suppress symptoms. DOCTOR AS TEACHER The primary goal of a Naturopathic Doctor is to practice, teach and inspire clients to take responsibility for their health and encourage healthy lifestyle choices that will become the foundation of life-long wellness. THE HEALING POWER OF NATURE Naturopathic Doctors recognize that the body has inherent wisdom. Given the right tools and facilitation of the healing process, the body can return to health. TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON Naturopathic Doctors believe in whole-person health, supporting the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of every client. PREVENTION Naturopathic Doctors emphasizes prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity, and susceptibility of disease, and encouraging appropriate interventions that support life-long health.
