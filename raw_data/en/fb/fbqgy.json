Robert Oppenheimer made the following observation after viewing exhibits at the Exploratorium: \"Art is included, not just to make things pretty, although it often does so, but primarily because artists make different kinds of discoveries about nature than do physicists or biologists. They also r ely on a differ ent basis for decision-making while creating their exhibits. But both artists and scientists help us notice and appreciate things in nature that we had learned toignore or had never been taught to see. Both art and science are needed to fully understandnature and its effects on people.\" New Horizons (n.d.) Retrieved July 25, 2005 from http://www.newhorizons.org EDUCATIONAL GOAL The goal of The Spirit of the Estuary: Using Art to Understand Ecology is to educate students, grades 5-8, about the Barataria-Terrebonne Estuary and the priority issues affecting thebasins. It is a multi-disciplinary curriculum, intended for use by teachers in such disciplines asscience, language arts, social studies, fine arts, special education, and gifted. It is not strictly ascience text. The Spirit of the Estuary: Using Ar t to Understand Ecology is a supplemental cur- riculum; it is an enrichment curriculum. It will allow educators to differentiate according tolearning styles preferences, interests, strengths, or talents. It offers a unique opportunity tobolster estuary/wetlands awareness across content areas. This curriculum guide provides easy access to information on environmental issues sur- rounding the estuary. In addition, it integrates art and science as a means to stimulate interestand to promote student achievement, engagement, and persistence in school. Instead of thetraditional approach that is so common in science curriculum guides, this book will use thevisual arts, music, dance, drama, creative writing, and technology to challenge the analytic,creative and practical skills of students while increasing public perception of significantenvironmental issues. The artistic endeavors will provide students with an understanding of the Barataria- Terrebonne Estuary and give them the skills to address environmental problems. Since research in learning indicates that students retain thinking skills processes and attitudes about subjects,studies, and self rather than facts, the educational guide will actively engage students in learningabout the estuary while emphasizing personal connections and commitment. The ultimate goal of The Spirit of the Estuary: Using Art to Understand Ecology is that in addition to learning about the estuary, students will also acquire a strong sense of steward-ship. Action requires knowledge, but it also requires passion. In the words of Charles Fowler , Former Director , National Cultural Resources Washington D.C., \"Science and technology do not tell us what it means to be human. The arts do.\" EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES 1. To develop and heighten a personal understanding of environmental issues connected to the Barataria-Terrebonne Estuary; 2. To create teaching activities and strategies that help students develop their analytic, creative, and practical capabilities as they learn about significant environmental concepts. VII3. To use the arts as ways to increase critical and creative thinking skills, develop problem-solving abilities, and promote engagement in learning about selected topics critical to the understanding and preservation of the Barataria-Terrebonne Estuary. EDUCATIONAL THEORY The Spirit of the Estuary: Using Art to Understand Ecology is based on the learning theory of Robert J. Sternberg (1985). Beyond IQ: A T riarchic Theory of Human Intelligence. New York: Cambridge University Press. According to Yale Professor Robert Sternber g, creative work requires a balance among the following three abilities: ANAL YTIC Analytic ability is typically considered to be a higher-order thinking skill, a critical thinking ability. A person with this skill possesses the ability to identify, comprehend, and analyze a problem, and to propose andevaluate solutions. CREATIVE Creative ability is a synthetic thinking skill. A person with this skill possesses the ability to make unique ororiginal connections, often resulting in insightful, intuitive responses or solutions. PRACTICAL Practical ability is a functional skill. A person with this skill possesses the ability to relate abstract ideas to everyday situations, to translate analytic and creative skills into practical ones, to implement solutions, and totransform ideas into accomplishments. The graphic organizer delineates a list of verbs that should assist educators in developing questions and designing activities that will promote the analytic, creative, and practical abilities of their students, thusenhancing their creative work.

The following chart illustrates this transformation and delineates the questions and descriptions used to assign lessons to a theme. COMPONENTS OF THE LESSONS Setting the Stage introduces the lesson. It provides background information for educators or an explanation of the topic to educators and students. Sometimes it actually becomes the \"hook,\" the motivator, or \"setting the stage\" for students. Objectives guide the teaching of each lesson. Materials list equipment, print materials, and items for teaching the lesson. Getting Ready gives suggestions to educators on teaching preparation. Process delineates step-by-step instructional procedures. Questions for Journaling serve as a catalyst for creative reflection, connecting students' thoughts and feelings with the study of the estuary. Assessment provides rubrics or checklists that evaluate content, product, MODEL: ROBERT STERNBERG'S TRIARCHIC MODELSECTION THEMESLESSONS How can art help me see, hear, touch, taste, and smell the estuary?Analytic Sensing the Spirit of the EstuaryUsing art to know, comprehend, apply, and analyze, and evaluate information about the estuary How can creating art help me understand the estuary?Creative Capturing the Spirit of the EstuaryCreating artistic products and developing and participating in artistic performances to express thoughts and feelings that capture the spirit of the estuary. How can I use art to protect the estuary?Practical Preserving the Spirit of the EstuaryCreating artistic products and developing and participating in artistic performances to promote and encourage stewardship of the estuary.Extensions offer ideas for follow-up activities. Resources list books, Internet sites, and materials for educators and students. Handouts for students are developed for almost all of the lessons. Each student handout is listed in the \"Materials\" section as well as in the \"Process\" section. ART & ECOLOGY Why do we need art to understand ecology? Charles Fowler answers this question in his essay \"Every Child Needs the Arts\" \"Science is not the sole conveyor of truth. While science can explain a sunrise, the arts convey its emotive impact and meaning. Both are important. If human beings are to survive, we need all the symbolic forms at our command because they permit us not only to preserve and pass along our accumulated wisdom but also to give voice to the invention of new visions. We need all these ways of viewing the world because no one way can say it all.\" New Horizons (n.d.). Retrieved July 25, 2005 from http://www.newhorizons.org By merging art and science we can better sense, capture, and preserve the spirit of the Barataria- T errebonne National Estuary. X "}
