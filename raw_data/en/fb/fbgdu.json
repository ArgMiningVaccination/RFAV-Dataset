We also have culinary accessories including salt mills, herbal tea accessories such as tea presses, reusable tea bags, bombillas and gourds. We simply have the best selection of bulk herbs in the upper valley. Capsules Empty capsules allow you to fill your own powders at desired potencies, and avoid tablet binders and fillers. Buying powdered vitamins and filling your own capsules can save up to 50% off most retail prices. Our empty Gelatin Caps \"00\", depending on the powder, can hold between 546 - 1092 mg. We have 5 different size of empty caps. Tinctures The use of tinctures to administer herbs has several benefits when compared to teas or capsules. First, tinctures are easy to use. They do not need to be prepared multiple times per day like a tea, and do not present difficulty in swallowing like a capsule. At Natures Nook we have well over 100 different single herb tinctures as well as combinations. Teas Our tea manufactures are committed to using pharmacopoeial grade herbs - that's a marker of very high quality. They also try to source teas from their native habitats because herbs that are \"at home\" tend to have the right balance of active compounds. Each herb has its own quality standard to ensure optimal activity. That can mean high essential oil content, the right amount of bitterness, or a minimum level of an active compound. But the result for each is the same: a tea that has power. This commitment to quality is one of the things that sets us apart. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
