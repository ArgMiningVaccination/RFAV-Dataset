What is coronavirus, or COVID-19? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel (new) coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease named [coronavirus disease 2019, which is abbreviated COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19.html). As SARS-CoV-2 spreads, the virus can change, which results in [new variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html). Some variants may spread more easily than others or be more resistant to vaccines or treatments. If I have cancer now or had it in the past, am I at higher risk of severe COVID-19? If you have cancer, you have a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Other factors that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 include having a weakened immune system (being [immunocompromised](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045723&version=Patient&language=en)), older age, and [other medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html). People with blood cancers may be at higher risk of prolonged infection and death from COVID-19 than people with [solid tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045301&version=Patient&language=en). That is because patients with blood cancers often have abnormal or depleted levels of immune cells that produce [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044918&version=Patient&language=en) against viruses. NCI is conducting a [large study of people with cancer who have COVID-19](/research/key-initiatives/covid-19/nccaps) to learn more about the risk factors for COVID-19 and to help doctors better manage treatment for people with cancer and COVID-19. If you had cancer in the past, you also may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19, and you may want to discuss your concerns about COVID-19 with your doctors. If I have cancer now or had it in the past, should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone age 6 months and older stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. That includes most [people with underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html), including cancer, as well as people who have already had COVID-19. CDC recommends that people ages 6 years and older get an updated (bivalent) Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, regardless of whether they previously completed a primary (monovalent) vaccine series. Most people ages 6 and older should get one dose of bivalent vaccine. Adults ages 65 years and older may get an additional dose of bivalent vaccine, and people who are immunocompromised may get additional doses of bivalent vaccine. For children younger than age 6, multiple doses continue to be recommended and will vary by age, vaccine, and which vaccines they previously received. The monovalent Novavax vaccine is available for people who cannot or will not get an mRNA vaccine. The monovalent Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine has expired and is no longer available for use in the United States. [CDC has information about the four COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html) available in the Unites States and the [recommended schedule for each](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). People with certain cancers and those who are receiving treatment that suppresses the immune system [may have a weaker response to COVID-19 vaccines](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/covid-vaccine-limited-protection-in-cancer-patients) than people whose immune systems are not compromised. If you recently received cancer treatment that suppresses the immune system\u2014such as chemotherapy, a [stem cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046695&version=Patient&language=en) or [bone marrow transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045263&version=Patient&language=en), or cell therapy\u2014your doctor may suggest that you wait until your immune system has recovered before you get vaccinated. Or your doctor may suggest that you wait a few weeks after vaccination to get immunosuppressive treatment. CDC also recommends that people who received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine before or during a stem cell transplant or [CAR T-cell therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000771302&version=Patient&language=en) be revaccinated with an mRNA vaccine for any dose(s) received before and during treatment. Revaccination should start at least 3 months after transplant or CAR T-cell therapy. Revaccination may also be considered for people who received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine while being treated with drugs that destroy [B cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045611&version=Patient&language=en), such as rituximab (Rituxan). Revaccination should start about 6 months after completing B cell-depleting therapy. Talk with your doctors if you think you may need to be revaccinated. To help protect people with cancer from COVID-19, it is important that their family members, loved ones, and caregivers get vaccinated and boosted. Learn more about [what people with cancer should know about COVID-19 vaccines](/about-cancer/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-people-with-cancer). To find a COVID-19 vaccine near you, visit [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/). If I'm at high risk for severe COVID-19, what are other ways that I can protect myself? Aside from vaccination, the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus that causes it. To protect yourself and prevent the spread of COVID-19, [take precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html): - Get vaccinated against COVID-19 and stay up to date on boosters. - Wear a well-fitting mask that covers your nose and mouth. - Stay 6 feet away from people who don't live with you. - Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces. - Some doctors advise that you make sure anyone you do have contact with has been vaccinated and/or tested negative for COVID-19. - Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. - Cover coughs and sneezes. - Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. - Monitor your health and be alert for symptoms of COVID-19. Your family members, loved ones, and caregivers can help protect you and other people at high risk of serious COVID-19 by following these precautions, too. What should I do if I have symptoms of an infection? What treatment should I get if I have COVID-19? If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 or have [symptoms of an infection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), you should [get a COVID-19 test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). If the test shows that you have COVID-19, isolate yourself from others and call your health care provider. [Treatments are available for people who test positive and are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html). These treatments must be given within a few days after symptoms begin, even if your symptoms are still mild. [If you are being treated for cancer and need treatment for COVID-19](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/special-populations/cancer/ ), your health care providers should consider potential drug interactions with your cancer therapies or overlapping side effects. In some cases, your cancer treatment may need to be paused or modified while you receive treatment for COVID-19. This is a stressful time. How do I cope? Coping with cancer in the face of the coronavirus can bring up a wide range of feelings you're not used to dealing with. Learn more about feelings you may have and [ways to cope with them](/about-cancer/coping). What if I have additional questions?
