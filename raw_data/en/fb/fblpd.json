Medical school does not cover the subject. Alternative to Meds Center does have this expertise and does have the trained medical staff to provide this help. Antipsychotics such as Saphris\u00ae (generic asenapine) are sometimes needed during a very real crisis \u2014 but need not automatically result in having to continue taking heavy drugs for a whole lifetime. There are other entirely workable Saphris alternative choices for the treatment of schizophrenia. Does Your Diagnosis Require Saphris? Alternative to Meds has been the expert on antipsychotic alternatives for over 15 years. We invite you to take a close look at our published evidence regarding our clients' successes. A fundamental of our programs is to take all possible measures to discover the underlying issues that lead to needing an antipsychotic drug in the first place. Addressing these in non-toxic ways opens the door to improved natural mental health. 15 Years Experience by Professionals Who Understand Your Journey. The Need for Alternatives to Saphris and Other Psychotropic Drugs Allopathic physicians generally first prescribe medication before much investigation is carried out. This is understandable in cases of a bonafide mental health crisis that needs to be brought under control without delay. Saphris is an antipsychotic medication prescribed for schizophrenia in adults. It comes in a sublingual tablet that dissolves under the tongue, and in a transdermal patch sold under the name Secuado\u00ae. Sometimes the medication is found not to produce the desired results. Lack of efficacy is not uncommon, and adverse effects are sadly very common, such as akathisia, oral hypoesthesia (total loss of sensation in the mouth), and extrapyramidal symptoms including tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsons-like symptoms, rashes, weight gain, dizziness, drowsiness, cardiac issues, and others.1,6 Even after some time has passed, the opportunity may not have been made available to explore Saphris alternative treatments where the medication was not easily tolerated or effective. Fortunately, every day we are seeing more and more physicians and researchers turning their attention to alternatives to Saphris. Holistic doctors prefer treating their patients in non-toxic ways before prescribing medications such as Saphris, allowing their patients to successfully reach their health goals with minimal or no meds. Though the trend is slowly changing, there are few physicians who are equipped with knowledge and familiarity enough to provide comprehensive help with Saphris alternatives. Alternative to Meds Center can help. Saphris Alternatives can Reduce Adverse Effects of Drugs Unfortunately, adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs can become ruinous and may negate any perceived benefits. Alternative to Meds Center specializes in providing a broad range of non-drug-based mental health treatment options and solutions. At our inpatient center, Saphris alternatives involve treatment plans that are carefully designed, taking into account the needs of each individual. Clinical staff design the client's program based on the labs and other vital information that is carefully gathered. In the majority of cases, treatment plans combine safe drug weaning or reduction, sometimes to zero, with many other treatments to support the process. In these ways, the program helps reduce and even eliminate lingering drug reactions. What are some Saphris alternatives used in treatment? Talk therapy is an effective way to help stabilize and calm a person from an agitated or tense state. Guided counseling can help identify and prevent triggers from knocking a person down over and over again. CBT is a specific genre of counseling that can help patients create new strategies and rethink past negative patterns for improved satisfaction in life. Such counseling therapies can give the client a pathway to gradually create a much more complete internal peace. Additional alternatives to Saphris with proven efficacy are shown in the list below. Saphris Alternatives Include: CBT (cognitive behavioral counseling) 7 DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) 8 Upgrade the diet to omit sugars, caffeine, refined carbs, saturated fats, and avoid gluten.21 Do consume omega-3 fatty acids, fresh fruits and vegetables, and take 4-6 smaller meals with adequate protein over the day. 9.22 Test for and resolve nutritional deficiencies 18 Mild exercise, aerobic exercise, Tai Chi, QiGong11,19 *Published research has shown toxic exposure (i.e. to lead, neurotoxic chemicals in pesticides, chemicals in food processing, cleaning products, etc.) can lead to psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis.14 Mold spores can also be neurotoxic according to a study published in \"Toxicology and Industrial Health\" that found water-damaged buildings were linked with neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms that mimic dementia, movement disorders, and other symptoms of neurologic damage.10 Nutrition and Other Stabilizing Therapies for Mental Wellness The world over, research shows that identifying and repairing nutritional deficiencies produce some quite astounding results. Studies have documented there is a direct link between certain deficits and unwanted symptoms including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and others. Identifying and fixing deficits can produce amazing results all on their own.2 Peer support and learning social skills in a community atmosphere have shown greater adherence to treatment and significant easing of symptoms in schizophrenic persons.20 The compassionate community atmosphere at Alternative to Meds is often remarked on by our clients, who gain confidence as symptoms drop away and quality of life increases. Combining a comprehensive set of therapies like the above examples, especially within a safe and compassionate inpatient setting can have a therapeutically synergistic effect, providing gentle yet effective, non-harmful and sustainable treatment outcomes. Purging Neurotoxins from the Body Saphris alternative treatments include purging toxic residues from environmental sources, food or air pollution, accumulations of heavy metals, and other sources. Everything from pesticides to food additives and mold exposures can have disastrous effects on mental health. Purging these from the body produces profound positive changes in mood, sleep, energy levels, and other benefits.15 Psychosis and Dopamine Much research has focused on the discussion about common denominators occurring in psychosis or psychotic episodes. One topic of study in particular, centers on excessive dopamine. Too much dopamine in the system can cause everything in the environment to overstimulate the person. As a result, the overstimulation produces a manic state, which is also called mania or psychosis.16 What Causes Overactivation of Dopamine? One example, the presence of neurotoxins stimulates the overactivation of dopamine, leading to psychoses and other symptoms.5 We also know this overstimulation can cause mania or psychosis. While more research is needed, we are also beginning to learn how a genetic problem may play a part and how precise supplementation can mitigate some of these conditions.3 Testing can determine when toxicity is present. Following lab testing, the focus can shift to cleansing out these toxic elements. Orthomolecular medicine, food-based nutritional therapy, supplementation, and physical therapies like massage, Reiki, and others, all work together to assist the process. A major goal is to stabilize or normalize the person's neurochemistry using these natural and food-based nutritional treatments. Many other forms of supporting therapies enhance recovery, including IV + NAD therapy, peer support programs, trainer-led exercise, educational classes on understanding healthy neurochemistry and self-care principles, Equine Therapy, and much more which can be viewed on our services overview pages.4 Find Out More Information Today Please, if you have been looking for a treatment plan that does not focus on toxic drugs, but on attaining natural mental health, give us a call for a detailed description of how the program works, as well as insurance or other questions you may have.
