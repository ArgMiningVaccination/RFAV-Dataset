There were astronomical levels of mold and fungus in your blood. You suffered from pneumonia and had so many x-rays taken that you almost glowed in the dark. The medications prescribed were barely treating the symptoms but were further depleting your already near-extinct immune system. Your doctors finally admit that they have no effective options for your condition; their final suggestion was to wait and see if your body began to win the fight on its own. This was my case just four years ago. So, what do you do when your traditional medical team delivers this type of optionless news? One thing working in my favor was my chiropractor, Dr. Siiri Krygowski. Witnessing firsthand my breathing episodes during an appointment, she recommended a visit with holistic practitioner, Juli Johnson, and shared the amazing results from her own personal experiences. At my first appointment with Johnson, she performed a non-invasive scan using ZYTO technology. This is a method of measuring energy along the meridians\u2014energy pathways in our body. According to the principles of Chinese medicine, we have 14 meridians, and each is associated with an organ in the body. The scan creates a profile of your body's out of balance conditions. From those results, she prescribed some lifestyle changes and supplements to correct the imbalance. To date, I haven't experienced another coughing episode. It's been four years and counting. At my follow up pulmonary appointment, my doctor was amazed at the cleared condition. He noted my variety of treatments to pass on to other patients. There were other things I did that also had a definite impact on my healing, but the impact of the services from Johnson were key to bringing all the pieces together for my recovery. The best health recovery occurs in the presence of quality advantages and multiple options for treatment tailored to an individual's condition. This is what practitioners like Juli Johnson offer\u2014options that coexist with traditional medicine, using basic, natural, and non-invasive methods to restore a body back to health. What better way to discover all the phenomenal, innovative, and effective treatment options and services Johnson offers, than to ask Johnson herself!

One of my favorite treats is when she willingly brings in her fur baby Frankie, a beautiful black and white Newfoundland, to sit in on my appointments. Since my pup passed away, he is part of my treatment and loves the hugs and petting. Johnson brings Frankie in only upon request. I sit down to interview Johnson and learn more about her and what the Back to Basics Health and Nutrition experience offers. When asked about her background, Johnson responds, \"I've been in the natural health field for 18 years and began my journey as a practical nurse in cardiology and internal medicine. After struggling with multiple health issues and getting nowhere fast, a series of serendipitous events led me away from the allopathic world and into a new career as a certified massage therapist. It was then I met a young man who was struggling to overcome the effects of chemotherapy. He was on a quest to learn more about healing with nutrition. I stayed with massage therapy for a short while, but my interest turned to other natural healing modalities rather quickly.\" Desiring further education, Johnson completed her ACNC (Advanced Certified Nutritional Counselor) and ND (Naturopathic Doctor) programs through Trinity School of Natural Health. Johnson worked hard and is proud of her full-time holistic health practice in South Lyon specializing in nutrition, detoxification, mineral balancing, and emotional healing. She enjoys teaching on multiple health topics and regularly speaks for local and national health systems. Johnson has also held screening and educational sessions using a basic ZYTO test for willing customers in local Better Health Stores. This gives the customer a very basic understanding of what they may benefit from regarding their needs for nutrients. With ever-increasing information and developments in the world of health, nutrition, and medical maladies, how does Johnson maintain her edge? She says that she has had lots of other training and keeps up with new modalities, or she refines the ones she currently uses by attending seminars and conferences on a regular basis. Johnson specializes in detoxification for mind, body, and spirit. Detoxification wasn't her first thought when she started in the natural health world, even though that's what she focused on for her own health recovery. Everyone is dealing with some type of toxic overload. Even if you feel good, there are toxins at work and they will eventually show up. After learning about the most effective ways of detoxification, Johnson started to incorporate them into her business. The ZYTO technology offers a method of measuring the body's energy flow. Energy changes before chemistry. ZYTO Biocommunication Testing (electro-dermal screening) creates a profile of your entire system, which includes your body's out of balance conditions or reactions in seven key areas. Foods for Wellness scans, EVOX (which is perception reframing), and Allergy testing are other popular scans that Johnson performs, but there is so much more offered. A complete list of services is on Johnson's website which includes links that give a brief description of all testing methods used, as well as her office hours. Johnson currently has three other practitioners working with her who provide a variety of services. Colon hydrotherapy, and the near infrared sauna, are popular services. Back to Basics holds classes on: making tinctures (concentrated herbal extracts), teas, crystals, weight loss, and general health principles, and they offer wellness days that feature make and take gifts, foot detoxes, foods for wellness scans, astrology and intuitive readings, crystal readings, chakra balancing, and more. When someone comes in to see Johnson, she/he receives one hour of her undivided attention and they go over all of that client's concerns. She scans to find out which organs are in need of support, and depending on what the situation is, the client will get a recommendation for one or more methods of detox, and recommendations for nutritional support. She also provides a gift of a Bach flower remedy combination specific to the person. Johnson says, \"Everyone is unique and has individual needs. Some respond well with herbs and tinctures, some with nutrients, some with homeopathy. I support the mind, body, and spirit of each of my clients. They get an education when they come to see me!\" For more information about services provided by Back to Basics, contact Juli Johnson at 248-921.0586 or visit her website, back2basicshealth.com.
