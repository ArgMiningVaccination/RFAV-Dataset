Why should pregnant women get the whooping cough vaccine? - It helps protect the mother - The whooping cough vaccine reduces the risk of the mother catching whooping cough and passing it on to her newborn baby. Parents are a common source of whooping cough infection for children under 12 months old so it's important they are vaccinated to protect themselves and their baby. - It helps protect the baby - Babies born to mothers who have had a whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy have higher levels of antibodies against the disease than babies whose mothers were not vaccinated. This is because the antibodies made by the mother in response to the vaccine are passed to her baby across the placenta soon after vaccination and until delivery. The mother's antibodies can help protect the newborn during the first months of life when they are most vulnerable to severe whooping cough infection but are too young to be vaccinated themselves. When is the best time for a pregnant woman to get the whooping cough vaccine? The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisations (ATAGI) recommends the whooping cough vaccine be given during the second or third trimester of every pregnancy, including pregnancies which are closely spaced, for example, under 2 years apart. The optimal time for whooping cough vaccination is between 20 and 32 weeks of every pregnancy. Is the whooping cough vaccine safe in pregnancy? The whooping cough vaccine has been used routinely in pregnant women in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) since 2012 and careful monitoring of this practice indicates that the vaccine is safe for pregnant women and their unborn babies. In addition, large studies from the US and the UK looking at birth outcomes following pertussis vaccination during pregnancy have found no evidence of increased risk for stillbirth, premature birth, death of the baby within 28 days of birth, foetal distress, caesarean delivery, or low birth weight. Can I have the whooping cough vaccine and influenza vaccine at the same time? Yes. You can get the whooping cough vaccine and [influenza vaccine](/Articles/F_I/Influenza-vaccine-in-pregnancy-What-expectant-mothers-need-to-know) at the same time during your pregnancy. You can also get them at different visits. This year, due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://healthywa.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/Coronavirus) it is advised to get the influenza vaccine as soon as it is available regardless of what trimester of pregnancy you are in. However, you should wait to get the whooping cough vaccine until you are in the second or third trimester, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks of every pregnancy. Can I get whooping cough from the vaccine? No. The whooping cough vaccine cannot give you or your baby whooping cough because they do not contain any live bacteria. The vaccines used contain purified, inactivated parts of the bacteria that cause the disease along with inactive toxoids from the bacteria that cause tetanus and diphtheria. These proteins stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria, but cannot cause the disease itself. Can there be side effects from whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy? With any medicine, including whooping cough vaccine, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually minor, but serious reactions are also possible. Most side effects do not affect daily activities and get better on their own in a few days. Common mild side effects from the vaccine include redness, swelling, pain, and tenderness where the injection is given, body-ache, fatigue, or fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach ache, and arm swelling have also been reported. More serious reactions like severe swelling, pain, and redness in the arm where the injection was given are rare. A life-threatening allergic reaction can happen after any vaccine but the estimated risk is less than 1 in a million vaccinations. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty in breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after vaccination. If you think you are having a severe allergic reaction or any other medical emergency that requires urgent attention, call 000 or go to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.

If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria (dTpa) containing vaccine, or if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. What is the WA Health Department doing to assure the safety of vaccines given to pregnant women? WA Health has a program to routinely monitor vaccinations provided to pregnant women. Talk to your provider if you would like to participate in this follow-up service.
