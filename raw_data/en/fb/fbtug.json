The luncheon meeting will be held at the Tarrytown Hilton Inn at 455 South Broadway and will begin with an 11:30 A.M. reception. The committee made contributions to the agreement in liberalizing Mexican trade policies. Mr. Rockefeller, an advocate of economic development for minorities, is also director of the United States-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange.

PAINTING EXHIBITION Renee Kahn is well-known in Connecticut, particularly in her hometown of Stamford, for saving worthwhile old buildings as head of the Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, which she founded almost two decades ago. In some instances she has been instrumental in providing low-cost housing through the restoration of old residential stock. In addition, she has taught preservation theory and technique at area colleges and universities and testified at local and state hearings on the historic significance of threatened buildings. In her spare time she paints, using her educational background in fine arts. A showing of her roguish pictures opens at the Schoolhouse Gallery on Owens Road in Croton Falls today with a reception from 2 to 5 P.M. She said that she has been influenced by Max Beckmann, George Grosz and Marc Chagall but that her work is not as ferocious as that of Beckmann or Grosz's or as whimsical as Chagall's. In a series on the Seven Deadly Sins, she depicts Envy as two portly matrons eyeing two younger and more lissome women in a dressing room at Loehmann's. The exhibition, which includes a collection of cartoons from the 20's through the 40's, will remain through Oct. 11. Viewing hours are Thursday through Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.
