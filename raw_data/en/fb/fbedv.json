Regular exercise improves the immune response, transmitting possible benefits against virus infections. The aim of this review is to study the effects of physical activity on vaccine injections, helping to develop new recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Methods: A comprehensive review of the existing literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The internal quality of the studies was assessed according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The outcomes analyzed were antibody titer, the level of lymphocytes CD4, CD8, InterLeukin 6 (IL6), leukocytes level, the visual analogue scale (VAS) for overall pain rating, arm and forearm circumferences and volume of oxygen (VO2) peak. Results: Fourteen articles were selected for the analysis. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) (n = 8) and controlled trials (CT) (n = 6). According to PEDro, the 'fair' category (n = 7) was the most represented, followed by 'good' (n = 6) and 'excellent' (n = 1). Physical training showed a positive effect on antibody titers of the vaccine; yet, different variables seem to influence antibody titers: higher new vs. old antigen in the vaccine, higher in younger vs. older individuals, and higher in females vs. males. After exercise, when analyzing variables of direct response to the vaccine, such as the amount of CD4, IL-6 and leukocytes, higher levels were observed in the patients who performed physical exercise compared to the control group. In the same way, better results were observed in physiological variables such as VO2 and limb circumferences, or subjective variables such as pain, which showed better results than the control group. Conclusions: The immune response (antibody titers) depends on age, gender and the intensity of physical activity: long-term protocols at moderate intensity are the most recommended. All of these aspects also have to be carefully considered for the COVID-19 vaccination.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-15", "cleaned_text": "Does Physical Exercise Enhance the Immune Response after Vaccination? A Systematic Review for Clinical Indications of COVID-19 Vaccine [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20065183](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20065183) [Sports Physiotherapy: Treatment for considering the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths [ [2](#B2-ijerph-20-05183)]. The main concern related to individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 is related to the so-called \"Long COVID\" or more appropriately \"Post COVID-19 Syndrome\", which describes the persistence of specific impairments occurring after COVID-19 disease. For instance, a third of the patients affected by COVID-19 experience persistent fatigue and more than a fifth of individuals show cognitive impairment, which persists for 12 or more weeks following their COVID-19 diagnosis [ [2](#B2-ijerph-20-05183)]. Other symptoms could be breathlessness, myalgia, weakness, headache, cognitive blunting, etc. [ [3](#B3-ijerph-20-05183)]. Finally, in patients with health issues before a SARS-CoV-2 infection, an aggravation of pre-existing symptoms has also been noticed [ [4](#B4-ijerph-20-05183)]. [5](#B5-ijerph-20-05183)]. Confinement was a strategy carried out in many countries that helped contain the spread of the virus. However, it also harmed levels of physical activity and caused an increase in sedentary behaviors [ [4](#B4-ijerph-20-05183), [6](#B6-ijerph-20-05183)]. [7](#B7-ijerph-20-05183)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-20-05183)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-20-05183)]. The attention to be paid to the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is still very high, as Omicron not only has many more variants of the S protein, but mainly affects the upper respiratory tract, while the current vaccines instead protect against symptoms related to the lower respiratory tract (lungs). [9](#B9-ijerph-20-05183), [10](#B10-ijerph-20-05183)]. [11](#B11-ijerph-20-05183)]. Current evidence from epidemiological studies shows that leading a physically active lifestyle with regular physical activity positively affects systemic inflammatory activity, reducing the incidence of communicable (e.g., bacterial and viral infections) and non-communicable (e.g., cancer) diseases, limiting or delaying immunological aging [ [12](#B12-ijerph-20-05183)]. There are several possibilities with some degree of evidence to improve the innate immune response and thus transmit possible benefits against viruses, such as healthy lifestyles including regular exercise and a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness. Considering that physical exercise contributes to generating a potentiation in the response of the immune system and considering that vaccination pursues a specific response of the immune system from the introduction of a weakened pathogen, it would be of interest to analyze what the effect of exercise could be in patients who have been vaccinated in order to identify those strategies that could be extrapolated to patients who receive the COVID-19 vaccine as a strategy to enhance their immune response. No systematic review has been identified that analyzes the effect of physical exercise in patients who have received a vaccine to analyze the immune response compared to subjects who do not perform physical exercise. 2. Material and Method 2.1. Study Design 2.2. Search Strategy 2.3. Inclusion-Exclusion Criteria 2.4. Document Selection Process 2.5. Outcomes 2.5.1. Primary Outcomes 2.5.2. Secondary Outcomes 2.6. Study Quality Assessment [7](#B7-ijerph-20-05183)]. The PEDro scale is used to evaluate the quality of the results obtained in a clinical trial. It has a score which ranges from 1 to 10 and the final score is determined by the presence/absence of specific features in the design of the evaluated study. The higher the score, the higher the validity of the evidence. Two independent reviewers evaluated the quality of the studies previously selected, according to the PEDro scale. If PEDro's final score did not match, a third reviewer was asked for a final evaluation. 3. Results [Figure 1](#ijerph-20-05183-f001). After performing the search in the different databases, 486 papers were identified, of which, after eliminating duplicate articles, a total of 331 articles were included to apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Among them, 50 articles match the inclusion criteria. The PEDro scale score was not sufficient (<4 points) in 28 articles and 8 studies did not report as main outcomes the ones considered in this review. Finally, 14 articles were selected for the analysis after a detailed reading and the evaluation of internal quality. [Table 1](#ijerph-20-05183-t001). The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) (n = 8), while the rest of the studies were trials with a controlled group, but with no randomization (CT) (n = 6). PEDro scores revealed a tendency towards the 'fair' category (PEDro of score 4-5) (n = 7), followed by the 'good' category (PEDro score from 6 to 8) (n = 6) and only one study wasclassified as 'excellent' (PEDro score of 9-10) (n = 1). The retained studies' general characteristics are reported in [Table 2](#ijerph-20-05183-t002). The sample size of the included articles ranged from 158 (Edwards et al., 2010) to 7 (Stelzer et al., 2014). The age of the participants ranged from 19.2 (Wang et al., 2011) to 79.5 (Yang et al., 2007) years with a median age of (median[1stIQR-3rdIQR]) 40 [30-45.5] years. Several interventions (from tai-chi to simple eccentric contraction of the biceps), at different levels of intensity, have been studied by the authors. In addition, the amount of training delivered in each protocol was different, with interventions that lasted from one single session to 10 months ( [Table 2](#ijerph-20-05183-t002)). 3.1. Primary Outcomes 3.1.1. level of exercise (60% vs. 85% vs. 100%) does not affect the amount an improvement in CD4 count in the female exercise group compared to the female control group, but no statistical changes were observed in CD8 count [ [23](#B23-ijerph-20-05183)]. An improvement in CD4 and CD8 count was found in healthy individuals after the adenovirus-specific T-cell expansions followed by one aerobic session [ [18](#B18-ijerph-20-05183)]. A pre-post significant difference of the CD4 levels was not found between a group practicing a long-term exercise protocol and a control group among patients with HIV [ [16](#B16-ijerph-20-05183)]; conversely, the CD4 and CD8 level was found to be significantly improved after 8 and 12 weeks of aerobic and non-linear resistance training (3 times/week) in patients with HIV compared to a [26](#B26-ijerph-20-05183)]. 3.1.3. IL6 [21](#B21-ijerph-20-05183)] ( by HIV, physical activity correlated with a reduction in the inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 [ [26](#B26-ijerph-20-05183)]. Finally, after an ultra-endurance race an improvement in the level of IL-6 and other inflammatory markers was observed [ [22](#B22-ijerph-20-05183)] ( Peak [15](#B15-ijerph-20-05183), [25](#B25-ijerph-20-05183)], even if in one case, no difference between groups was found [ [25](#B25-ijerph-20-05183)]. 4. Discussion [7](#B7-ijerph-20-05183)]. Concerning leukocytes levels, their role after exercise is still unclear [ [23](#B23-ijerph-20-05183)], as well as in this review, where the data collected were not sufficiently homogeneous to infer a clear indication. On the other hand, IL-6 typically increases with physical activity [ [27](#B27-ijerph-20-05183)], as reported also in this analysis. [5](#B5-ijerph-20-05183)]. Nonetheless, the amount of the immune response (higher or lower antibody titers) depends also on other factors such as age, gender and the intensity of physical activity. 4.1. Age and Immune Response [28](#B28-ijerph-20-05183)]; interestingly, the current analysis showed how physical activity practiced with regularity can reduce the decrement of the antibodies in older adults [ [17](#B17-ijerph-20-05183)]. 4.2. Gender and Immune Response [29](#B29-ijerph-20-05183)]. Sex differences in the responsivity to some vaccine strains are well documented: sex hormones (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone) may play a major role in differences between male and female immune responses [ [29](#B29-ijerph-20-05183)]. Interestingly, sex differences, probably mediated by immune response, have been highlighted also in COVID-19 infections. In particular, there is a biological sex difference in the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the main receptor used by COVID-19 to enter cells [ [12](#B12-ijerph-20-05183)]. Although females tend to experience less severe disease in response to viral infection, these infections are thought to contribute to higher rates of autoimmune disease observed in this population, as the \"X\" chromosome encodes several genes involved in innate and adaptive immune function [ [11](#B11-ijerph-20-05183)]. Finally, sex differences can be found in the response to physical activity, even if conclusions on the topic are yet to be confirmed [ [14](#B14-ijerph-20-05183)]. Nonetheless, some attempts show how muscle damage could occur similarly in men and women, but the inflammatory response (i.e., smaller increase in leukocytes) was reduced in women [ [30](#B30-ijerph-20-05183)]. 4.3. Physical Activity Intensity and Immune Response [13](#B13-ijerph-20-05183)], differences between long-term protocols have been raised by the analysis. In particular, regular exercise (i.e., moderate-intensity exercise, Taiji, etc.) practice for at least 12 weeks seems to stimulate the immune system and also the response after vaccination [ [7](#B7-ijerph-20-05183)]; in addition, in athletes, the response of the immune system appears to be higher [ [19](#B19-ijerph-20-05183), [31](#B31-ijerph-20-05183)]. 4.4. Secondary Outcomes [14](#B14-ijerph-20-05183)]. The gender difference could be due to sex hormones and their homeostasis, even if the literature is not clear about the mechanism underlying these phenomena [ [30](#B30-ijerph-20-05183)]. For longer physical activity protocols, authors also reported a reduction in the subcutaneous body fat and in neck, abdomen, and waist circumferences, demonstrating the beneficial effects of regular exercise. [25](#B25-ijerph-20-05183)], demonstrating how the index should be used probably to guide the physical activity intensity, but also to monitor the results of the protocol. 5. Study Limitations 6.
