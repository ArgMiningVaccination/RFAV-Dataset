Spiritual therapy is a form of therapy that is based on the belief that the mind and body are connected. It can help to address problems such as [anxiety](https://mantracare.org/counseling/anxiety/), stress, and depression. This type of therapy is non-invasive and uses a variety of techniques to heal the mind, body, and spirit. Spiritual therapy is typically used as either an alternative or complementary form of treatment for problems such as anxiety, depression, stress, [anger issues](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/anger-issues/), etc. This type of therapy can be approached from many different angles depending on each patient's own spiritual beliefs. The [therapist](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapist/) may use guided meditation sessions to help patients find their inner strength in order to face difficult situations that cause distress. Some [therapists](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapists/) also offer reiki healing services within their practice. Reiki involves energy work that helps release physical tension along with emotional pain stored in the body at certain points called chakras. Working of Spiritual Therapy The working of spiritual therapy is not clearly understood by the modern medical community. Spiritual therapists believe that people are born with a connection to God or universal energy. This belief system asserts that life events, including stress and [trauma](https://mantracare.org/therapy/ptsd-trauma/trauma/), can cause this connection to become blocked. The idea behind spiritual therapy is based on the concept of karma - meaning 'action'. For example: if someone has hurt you in some way then it's important to forgive them (for your own sake) so all negative karma can be resolved and balance restored once again. Spiritual therapies take many forms depending upon each patient's beliefs and cultural background. Some common practices include meditation, prayer sessions involving chanting or reading passages from sacred texts such as the Bible or Quran; Reiki, yoga, and [aromatherapy](https://mantracare.org/ayurveda/aromatherapy/). Spiritual Therapy Techniques These are some of the techniques of spiritual therapy: Guided Meditation This technique is used to help patients find their inner strength in order to face difficult situations that cause distress. Reiki Healing This is a Japanese technique of energy work that helps release physical tension along with emotional pain stored in the body at certain points called chakras. Prayer Sessions These sessions involve chanting or reading passages from sacred texts such as the Bible, Quran, etc. This is done in order to bring peace and clarity during times when there's confusion or distress within live events. Yoga Therapy [Yoga therapy](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapy-types/yoga-therapy/) involves performing yoga postures (asanas) combined with [breathing exercises](https://mantracare.org/therapy/meditation/breathing-exercises/) (pranayama). The purpose behind this type of spiritual practice is for healing by unifying all parts of one's being - body, mind and spirit. Aromatherapy This involves the use of essential oils extracted from plants to improve physical, psychological, and emotional well-being. Chanting This technique, based on the mantra is used to help find inner peace and clarity during times when there's confusion or distress within live events. Meditation Healing A meditation healing session involves a spiritual healer sitting beside the patient in order to channel universal energy (or God) into their own body; it then flows down from head towards feet and backs up again - clearing any blockages along the way. When To Use Spiritual therapy? Spiritual therapy can be used to address problems such as: Anxiety You can use spiritual therapy as an alternative treatment for anxiety that has failed to respond positively after trying different medications and therapies. To cure this problem, you would need to learn how to control your feelings of [fear](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/fear/) with the help of mental exercises. Depression This therapy can be used as an alternative treatment for depression that has failed to respond positively after trying different medications and therapies.

Stress Management Spiritual therapy can be useful if you want to better manage stress levels in order to improve overall health and wellness without having negative effects on emotional well-being. This type of practice is also beneficial if one wishes to develop mindfulness by becoming more aware of their own thoughts and emotions through meditation sessions, yoga postures (asanas), etc. Physical Ailments/Chronic Illnesses There is some evidence that suggests spiritual therapy may be helpful for patients with chronic illnesses.

These techniques help to provide a sense of calm and peace which can be beneficial for those who are struggling to cope with traumatic events.

In this case, the therapist would help you find ways to manage your feelings of anger in a positive way. Benefits of Spiritual Therapy These are some of the benefits of spiritual therapy: Helps To Connect With The Divine This type of practice can help people connect with the divine or higher power.

What do I want from my life? Why am I here? How should I live my life without causing harm to anyone else living on this planet? In addition, it also reduces stress levels through practices like yoga, meditation, etc. Improves Mood This therapy helps to improve mood by providing an outlet for emotions and helping patients to connect with their feelings. It can also help to develop a sense of self-awareness which is beneficial for those who are struggling with [mental health issues](https://mantracare.org/employee-wellness/mental-health-issues/). Promotes Inner Peace When people have access to spiritual therapy, it often brings about a feeling of inner peace. This type of peace comes from the understanding that everything in life happens for a reason and that we all have a purpose even if it's not always clear what that is. Reduces Anxiety Levels This therapy can help in reducing anxiety levels by teaching people how to control their thoughts and feelings in order to live more peaceful lives. Helps With Coping Skills Spiritual therapy can help people to develop coping skills.

Increases Self-Esteem This type of therapy helps to increase self-esteem by encouraging participants to take responsibility for their own thoughts, feelings, and actions. This often results in an improved sense of self which can have a positive impact on one's overall wellbeing. Side-Effects of Spiritual Therapy These are some side-effects of spiritual therapy: May Be Expensive This therapy may be expensive. However, most practitioners offer payment plans or accept insurance for those who qualify. Can Be Time-Consuming This type of therapy can be time-consuming. This is because it involves a lot of discussion and reflection on the part of patients. This is why some people may prefer to use spiritual therapies such as yoga at home instead. May Cause Misunderstanding Individuals with addiction issues may face problems. It is when consulting therapists about their substance abuse problems. This is because many counselors do not consider drugs and alcohol as addictive substances that need treatment too. In this case, they might suggest you try traditional options. These are like 12-step programs before considering alternative forms of therapies. These could cause more harm than good in the long run if you are struggling with addiction. Can Cause Conflict Spiritual therapy can cause conflict if one person in the relationship feels that the other party doesn't respect their beliefs. In this case, it is important to find a therapist who is respectful of all religious and spiritual beliefs. May Be Challenging Spiritual therapy can be challenging as it requires you to look within yourself and confront some of your deepest fears. It is not for people who do not wish to face their issues and work towards a better life.

It also helps people reconnect with their spirituality and find peace within themselves. This type of therapy provides people with the tools they need to live more meaningful and fulfilling lives. It can help you find your purpose, improve your mood, increase your sense of inner peace, deal with difficult emotions in a healthy way, overcome anxiety levels, resolve relationship issues without resorting to conflict or abuse.
