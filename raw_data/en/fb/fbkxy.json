Checkout Katrina Svoboda Johnson at the Ayurvedic Health Center to tackle deeper issues with Ayurveda. Established in 2012. I struggled with balanced eating my whole life. Living with eczema woke me up to how this imbalance affected other systems in my body. By learning about my Ayurvedic mind-body type, and how many of my digestive issues stemmed from my habits, a few specific foods, and my mindset, I've discovered solutions. It's a long road, but I have more energy, feel less heavy, and have a deeper, clearer understanding of how my choices affect my health. I loved it so much that I became a practitioner! Digestion is the foundation of health. When it's working optimally, all the organs and systems of the body are supported. When it's not, these imbalances build up and overflow to other parts of the body, causing secondary symptoms. It truly can be EASY and SIMPLE to balance these issues. That's why I focus on digestion. It's also the easiest system in the body to treat, giving the quickest turnaround for results.

From her ayuverdic tea blends, elixers, & sensational deoderat!!! Herbal detoxifying deoderant is one of my favorites!!! I struggled with deoderats almost all my life. I tried almost all natural deoderants & non were very effective. As an active woman dancing, practicing yoga, and being mom of two. I needed something more effective that would last longer!! My prayers came true after using Living Balance Herb/Detox/Deoderant. Not only did it last all day, but sometimes if i'd forget to apply the next day i noticed i didn't really need it...even after being active. Because the deoderant was working at a deep level in detoxifying my glands!! Truly magical/effective/safe/natural!!! Love it!!!! Business owner information Isabel C. 9/7/2017 We're so happy that we have been able to meet your many needs, from tea blends to deodorant!

After a thorough assessment of my doshas and health concerns, she made recommendations and taught me simple practices to implement in my daily life to improve my well-being by bringing my doshas into better balance. As a result, I was even able to discontinue some medications I had been taking. She is knowledgable, thoughtful, and kind. Her calm demeanor and professionalism make working with her a joy. I highly recommend Isabel! - 2/21/2016 I saw Isabel because I was having problems with digestion and bloating. After a couple weeks I noticed a big difference and am so glad I went to her. I have found everything I learn from her has been beneficial to me. She's very easy to talk to and very professional.
