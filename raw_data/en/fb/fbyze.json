Just like you crave certain types of food, your skin could be craving certain ingredients to keep it balanced and nourished. In my experience, my skin craves a blend of nourishing oils and plant extracts, like those found in a facial oil serum. These natural oils and extracts absorb easily into my skin, leaving it moisturized and glowing. What's not to love about that? Today, I want to share some of the best oil-based face serums I've personally tried - and that keep my skin looking great through dry skin season, and all year round. What is a Facial Oil Serum? But first, I want to make sure you know what a facial oil serum is. When you see the term facial serum on a label, you'll want to take a look at the label to see what type of serum it is. Facial serums can be either water-based or oil-based. A water-based serum is very lightweight and absorbs very quickly into the skin. These serums are usually used as a base layer, under your moisturizer or oil. A facial oil serum is a highly concentrated blend of nourishing oils mixed with powerful plant extracts, intended to penetrate deeply into the skin to deliver the active ingredients and combat specific skin conditions. Both types of serums can have wonderful benefits for your skin, depending on the ingredients included in the formula. Facial oil serums (also just called facial oils) tend to be rich enough to use on their own (after cleansing and toning), without any added moisturizer on top. One caveat - I do recommend using a water based serum such as hyaluronic acid underneath a facial oil, in order to lock moisture into your skin (or spritz your skin with a toner before applying facial oil.) What are the Benefits of a Facial Oil? Facial oils work to deeply hydrate, moisturize and soften skin as well as protect the skin barrier from environmental stressors. They also help to deliver targeted actives like Vitamin C or CBD to the skin. Facial oils also help to reduce wrinkles and the appearance of fine lines, when used as a regular part of your skincare routine. I tend to use facial oils at night when I'm not worrying about layering on SPF or foundation. Then, they can simply absorb into my skin and do their good work overnight! But facial oils can certainly be used during the day too, in fact a couple of my recommended products are specifically intended for daytime use. As you can see, there are lots of [benefits to using a facial oil](https://mindfulmomma.com/web-stories/why-use-a-facial-oil/) on your skin! Who Should Use a Facial Oil Serum? Contrary to what you might think, anyone can use a facial oil serum - even people with oily skin and acne-prone skin. Oily skin is actually a symptom of overly dry skin. I know that might seem counter intuitive, but your skin is producing extra oil to try to moisturize your dry skin. Adding oil to your skin care routine can actually stop your skin from producing so much oil! If your skin is on the dry side, like mine, it will drink up these oils like nobody's business! They will add the moisture you need to keep your skin healthy and glowing. Up for making your own [homemade facial oil](https://mindfulmomma.com/diy-facial-oil/)?
