To Our Coral Gables and Marine Campus Community (non-UHealth/Miller School), From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Miami has implemented an adaptive and responsive approach to keep our community healthy. Getting vaccinated\u2014including booster shots\u2014and correctly wearing appropriate masks continue to be the most effective measures for reducing transmission and minimizing serious illness. With the increase in cases brought on by the more contagious omicron variant, last week [President Frenk announced](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3e15292dc2683bac47cbf63ade87e167c03cc622aaca3e0fbfa8613d1fcc63a547b4f7fb72ac119d866dbd5eb21e9fce707137593c7befbc) several schedule and protocol modifications for the spring semester on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses. Students and employees on the Medical Campus should continue to follow guidance from UHealth and the Miller School of Medicine. This email expands on President Frenk's message and provides important details regarding the start of the Spring 2022 semester. Please review it carefully and in its entirety. Start of classes: Campuses will remain open, and the spring semester will begin on time. Courses will begin on Tuesday, Jan. 18, in a remote format for the first two weeks of the semester, with in-person instruction expected to resume on Monday, Jan. 31. Students in clinical rotations will be permitted to continue as scheduled, subject to requirements of their host sites. Guidance for faculty regarding online teaching refresher courses, materials, and resources will be provided this week. Students will receive detailed information from the University Registrar regarding how to access online courses. Orientation: All orientation activities will be held remotely as scheduled. Arrival testing: All students, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to complete a negative PCR or antigen test no more than 72 hours before their initial arrival to campus following the winter recess. Students must provide proof of the negative test result using this form: [https://umiamicx.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e9zHCWkBBY0Obhs](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3e15292dc2683bacef1ded497e353a05e6c9cebe5a6cebd7a5c7185680b46f0b76a754f9150e23a7a033e2f368fb84efb8a2538271c56b83). In addition, all resident students, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to test again immediately upon check-in to their on-campus housing location. Testing will take place at the Pavia Garage UScreen location. Additional details will be provided at check-in, and testing site hours of operation can be found at [coronavirus.miami.edu/testing](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3e15292dc2683bacddea5f1d0435953d9483020cf36ac12961e62a7eaff0a658ba9bf3dbd39cc658b25ea194d96b5d51035c9bb394379f07). Resident students should self-isolate until the result of their on-campus PCR test has been returned. We strongly encourage those traveling to complete a negative test before making their way to Miami. These measures are being taken to ensure, to the extent possible, that anyone who is positive for COVID-19 isolates in the comfort of their home before returning to campus, while also enabling us to best manage the University's finite isolation and quarantine spaces and other resources. Housing: Spring-semester resident students may return to on-campus housing on their previously scheduled date or at any time during the remote learning period. We do, however, strongly recommend that those students who are able to do so remain at home during the remote learning period. This expanded arrival period provides maximum flexibility to returning students and, importantly, reduces density during move-in periods. With the exception of those who assist resident students with move-in, only current University of Miami students will be allowed as guests of resident students within campus residential communities. Dining: On-campus dining locations, including dining halls, will be available in a take-out format only during the first weeks of the semester. Regular dining operations are expected to resume on Jan. 31. Faculty/staff work modalities: Only employees who already have been on campus, or who are engaged in critical functions that require them to be on campus, should return to on-site work this week. Employees who have been working remotely should continue to do so and will be expected to begin in-person or hybrid work on Jan. 31, or as directed by their supervisor. Research: Research activities on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses may continue with the appropriate safety precautions currently in place. Events: All indoor events and gatherings involving large groups of people should be postponed or held remotely until at least Jan. 31, when in-person instruction resumes. Varsity athletic events will continue as scheduled, subject to guidelines issued by the ACC and NCAA. Isolation/quarantine: Isolation and quarantine protocols on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses have been revised, consistent with the latest guidance issued by the CDC. They now include a reduced isolation period of five days for individuals who test positive but are asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing an effective mask at all times when they are around others. Students, faculty, or staff who experience symptoms consistent with, or test positive for, COVID-19 should continue to call 305-243-ONE-U. Masking: Masks continue to be mandatory in all indoor public and common spaces and are strongly encouraged outdoors in group settings. Single-layer cloth masks are not considered protective against the omicron variant and hence do not meet our current standard for campus safety; surgical masks or multi-layered, tightly woven cloth masks should be used. Masks should fit snugly, cover nose and mouth, and preferably have an adjustable wire nose bridge. Surgical masks will be available at various on-campus locations. Vaccination: Evidence shows that vaccination\u2014including boosters\u2014significantly decreases the most severe consequences of the virus. As such, we have updated our definition of \"fully vaccinated\" to include receiving the appropriate booster shot once you are eligible. (Those who are vaccinated but are not yet eligible for a booster shot are considered fully vaccinated until they reach their booster eligibility date.) All students are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated and boosted. All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral associates are required to be fully vaccinated, subject to the exemptions outlined in Florida law. Additional information regarding vaccination, how to provide proof of vaccination, and testing requirements for individuals who are not fully vaccinated can be found at [coronavirus.miami.edu/covid-19-vaccine](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3e15292dc2683bac56b5aa94dc02cc1df8a92607015b85ef1efa0e11c680edc8039f1bdf83fcd77d80cf5626a8c9e555f40c51380a513f80). Testing: Information regarding UScreen/surveillance testing, as well as symptomatic or close-contact testing, can be found at [coronavirus.miami.edu/testing](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=3e15292dc2683bacddea5f1d0435953d9483020cf36ac12961e62a7eaff0a658ba9bf3dbd39cc658b25ea194d96b5d51035c9bb394379f07). Town hall: We will host a virtual town hall for the Coral Gables and Marine campus community on Monday, Jan. 10, at 5:30 p.m. Additional details, including a registration link, will be provided by email this week. We all have come to realize the evolving nature of the challenges posed by COVID-19. At the same time, we also recognize that this is not the start to the spring semester that we had hoped for. However, the health and wellbeing of our community have been and will continue to be our priority. After carefully analyzing available options, and given the current trajectory of the omicron variant, we believe these measures will generate the least disruption and enable us to move forward with an engaging and on-campus spring semester. We thank you for your continued commitment to the health and wellbeing of all 'Canes. As President Frenk noted last week, together, we will continue to navigate changing conditions, to protect each other and the U. "}
