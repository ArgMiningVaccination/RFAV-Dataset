SLE patients have more sensitive B cells and reduced regulator T cell activity. The increase in activityof B which has play a role in the absorption and presentation of autoantigens to T cells. B cells and T cells will also affect the production of cytokines such as TNF and TGF-. We used forty female BALB/c mice, aged 6 until 8 weeks old received a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 cc pristane for lupus induction. At 16 weeks after injection, pristaneinduced lupus mice were divided into four groups based on the doses received by intragastrically: 10.5mg/kg/day, 21 mg/kg/day, and 42mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. At 38 weeks after injection, all of mice were assessed for inflammation marker. Study results showed that percentages of maturation of B cells, TNF-, were decreased (p<0.05) and percentages of TGF- were increased (p>0.05) in Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves ethanol extract-treated mice. Ethanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum can inhibit the maturation of B cells so that it can decrease the auto antigen presentation rate in T cells. Bryophyllum pinnatum can also reduce TNF levels that have been pro-inflammatory agents, whereas Bryophyllum pinnatum can increase TGF- levels which agent. Lupus Erythematosus, . INTRODUCTION: [The pathogenesis of SLE is very complex and is not clearly known yet and has many factors that play a role such as genetics, hormones and the environment. It is known that in SLE patients there are more sensitive B cells and reduced regulator T cell activity]1. Hyperactivity in B cells that deviate further will play a role in the uptake and presentation of autoantigen to T cells. B cells and T cells will also influence the production of cytokines such as TGF-, IL-1, IL-6, and and The Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves are said to be anti-inflammatory as it can inhibit or reduce TNF- concentrations in pleural exudates. In addition, it also shows inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) in enzymatics3. TGF- is one of the anti-inflammatory cytokines in innate and adaptive immune responses produced by T cells, especially regulator T cells, macrophages, and many other types of cells. TGF- works to inhibit proliferation and effector function of T cells, inhibits proliferation of B cells, inhibits IgA production, inhibits activation of macrophages, and increases collagen synthesis by fibroblasts4. In SLE patients excessive T and B cell proliferation occurs and regulator T cells decrease which results in a decrease in TGF- production. This decrease results in the loss of TGF- functions resulting in ongoing inflammation5. This mechanism will cause signs and symptoms appear in patients with SLE such as discoid rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, nephritis, and also serositis. Kidney involvement is marked by increasing of protein excretion and permanent escalation of blood pressure. So the need for research on the effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves extract on rats induced SLE on TGF- and alpha (TNF)- levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study Design: This experimental using randomized post-test only controlled group design study was conducted in Malang, East Java, Indonesia between November 2017 and April 2018. Female BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks (25-30g) were purchased and certified from Pusat Veteriner Farma (Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia). All the housed at Pharmacology Laboratory of Universitas Brawijaya and acclimatized in the laboratory for 1 week prior to experiment. The housing condition were controlled, with a room temperature and a diurnal 12-hour light/ dark cycle. All experimental protocols described in this study were approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya. Number: No. 279/EC/KEPK/08/2017. Induced SLE in Mice: Induced SLE in mice Female BALB/c mice were treated with single injection of pristane 0.5 ml intraperitoneally per mice. Spleen and serum were collected 16 weeks after the pristane injection. Clinical manifestations were also observed after 16 weeks of pristane injection. Plant Material: Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves were collected from Batu, East Java, Indonesia in August 2016. Leaves were identified and authenticated at Unit Pelaksana Teknis (UPT) Balai Materia Medica, Batu, East Java, Indonesia. They were air dried and grounded into fine powder. Extraction Preparation: Aproximately 800 grams of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaf simplicia were macerated using 96% ethanol solvent for 48 hours for as much as 20 times. Ethanol extract was filtered using Whatman No. paper. 42 (125mm), then evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 45 \u00b0C6. After that a qualitative phytochemical screening tests for the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and glycosides. SLE Mice: Diluted B. Pinnatum extract then divided into 3 (three) doses 10.5mg/kg BW; 21mg/kg BW and 42mg/kg BW then given orally to the mice with a special sonde a few days after induced by pristane. We evaluated the progress within 12 weeks. TGF- and TNF- Examination: TGF- levels in plasma (ng/ml) was measured by the ELISA method using LEGEND MAXTM Mouse latent TGF- Elisa kit with pre-coated plates no. 433007. TNF- was measured using the ELISA kit with pre-coated TNF- Mouse plates No 430907. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Clinical in Pristane-Induced SLE BALB/c Mice Model: Pristane-induced SLE Balb/c mice model had clinical evidence such as joint inflammation, gait changes, alopecia, and ascites which occured at 15 weeks after pristane injection in BALB/c mice. The first sign of allopecia seen 12 weeks after pristane injection. Signs of ascites seen at week 14. Figure 1. SLE clinical manifestations after 16 weeks of pristane injection.

Effect of Bryophyllum Pinnatum Leaves Extract on Inflammatory Marker Levels of Pristane-Induced SLE Balb/C Mice: Bryophyllum pinnatum which can be found easily in Indonesia has been used frequently in ethnomedical medicine and anthroposophy for treating various hyperreactive diseases. Various studies have been proven Bryophyllum pinnatum effect immunomodulator, anti-allergic, antiinflammatory, cytotoxic, and anti-tumor activity7. SLE clinical manifestation appeared in BALB/c mice was observed for \u00b1 5 months qualitatively. Clinical manifestations within \u00b1 20 weeks were alopecia, motoric changes (gait), inactivity, leg joints inflammation, and ascites (Figure 5.1). Arthritis assessment is done by observing the joints in the soles of the feet, ankles, and knees of the BALB/c mice. Arthritis is characterized by swelling and redness in the joints. These findings were also found in a study conducted by Leiss et al. which reported that arthritis manifestations began to appear in the 12th week after pristane induction accompanied by an increase in Rheumatoid Factor (RF) levels that appeared in the 8th week after induced by pristane8. TNF- is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the inflammatory and immune system responses. TNF- will stimulate production of other proinflammatory cytokines, increase the expression of adhesion molecules and neutrophil activation and act as a co-stimulator for T-cell activation and antibody production. Whereas TGF- is an anti-inflammatory cytokine in innate and adaptive immune responses that has a role in inhibiting proliferation and effector function of T cells, inhibiting proliferation of B cells, inhibiting IgA production, inhibiting macrophage activation, and increasing collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. TGF- is produced by T cells, especially regulator T cells, macrophages, and many other cells9. The results of this study indicate that TGF- levels of BALB/c mice serum in positive control group induced by pristane is significantly different from those of BALB/c mice in negative control group. This is consistent with the study of Manolova et al. where SLE patients have decreased TGF- production due to excessive T cell and B cell proliferation accompanied by a decrease in regulator T cells which resulted in loss of TGF- functions and chronic inflammation. Both of these cytokine s play a role in the inflammatory process5. The higher the dose of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves extract, TNF- level in serum will decrease. This situation is reinforced by research conducted by Cruz et al. which reported that flavonoid compounds, quercitrin were able to reduce the number of eosinophil cells and the production of IL-5, IL-10, and TNF- cytokines in the inguinal lymph glands of anaphylactic models given oral therapy of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves for 14 days. Other studies also reported that flerconoid quercetin glycosides inhibited inflammation by inhibiting mast cell degranulation and decreasing TNF- levels7. But the mechanism is not fully understood yet. The results of this study showed that the administration of ethanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves was able to significantly increase serum TGF- levels of balb/c mice at doses of 21 mg/kg BW and 42 mg/kg BW compared to balb/c mice in the control positive group. Based on the exposure, it was shown that the content of the ethanol extract of the Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves had an anti-inflammatory effect by increasing TGF- levels. Increased levels of TGF- can be thought to occur due to an increase in Treg cells, according to the research conducted by Indriyanti et al. where the administration of ethyl acetate fraction of Bryophyllum pinnatum has the ability to slightly reduce the levels of anti-Sm antibodies, and increase the percentage of CD4+ CD25+ regulator T cell, so that the immune system stability in lupus can be maintained10. In an in vitro study previously conducted by Nurdiana et al. was found that the Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves extract has an immunosuppressive effect, namely by suppressing Th levels and mature B cells in Balb/c mice with pristane-induced lupus models. Given that one of the functions of TGF- is to inhibit proliferation of B cells, the decrease in B cell levels after administration of Bryophyllum pinnatum ethanol extract in previous research allows for the influence of an increase in TGF-11. Based on the results of data analysis from this study shows that serum urea and serum creatinine levels in BALB/c mice positive control group after pristane administration is significantly different from the negative control group which did not get the same treatment. This condition can be caused by IgG and complement deposition in glomerulus or rarely due to direct damage by various cytokines and chemokines contributing in inflammatory damage as the disease progresses12. Pristane is proven to be able to induce plasmacytoma in Balb/c mice if given via intraperitoneal injection13. SLE patient are defined also has incident proteinuria if they had two or more measurement of protein urine was elevated14. On this result, we find that Bryophyllum pinnatum can reduce proteinuria levels on mice BALB/c which Bryophyllum pinnatum 21 mg/kg BW and 42 mg/kg BW dose except the positive control proteinuria levels is increase. According to the research that proteinuria can appear if kidney function was not good15. Bryyophyllum pinnatum had bioactive compounds that showed protective effect which prevent oxidative cell damage and also have strong anti-cancer activity16. It can be concluded that this compound in Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves extract can affect the inflammatory process occurs in the pathogenesis of SLE. Both of these cytokines are equally influential in the inflammatory process, the difference in the inflammatory state is TNF- acts as proinflammatory where the levels increase during inflammation. Whereas TGF- is an anti-inflammatory so that the levels decrease. This study proves that Bryophyllum pinnatum leaves extract can reduce TNF levels as a proinflammatory mediator and can increase TGF- levels as an anti-inflammatory mediator. Side effects study results suggest that there were no signs of side effects in the general condition, blood pressure, liver and renal function of the mice was not significantly affected by treatment. Bryophyllum pinnatum has the potential to be developed further as a new, safe, and effective oral-delivered immune modulator agent against pristane-induced SLE BALB/c mice. CONCLUSION: In sum, ethanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum can inhibit the maturation of B cells so that it can decrease the auto antigen presentation rate in T cells. Bryophyllum pinnatum can also reduce TNF levels that have been pro-inflammatory agents, whereas Bryophyllum pinnatum can increase TGF- levels which have the role of anti-inflammatory agent.
