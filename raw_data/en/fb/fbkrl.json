How do you treat a skin infection naturally? What are the best home remedies for skin infections? Let's see what we can find out! The skin is the first line of defense against viruses, germs, and fungi. And if it becomes infected, you are in grave danger. While serious infections require medical assistance, minor skin infections can be prevented or treated at home. No, you do not need to be a dermatologist to accomplish it. There are several simple home remedies for skin infections that work as an alternative to treat skin issues. Although you should always consult a dermatologist before using any home treatment, you can try these for immediate relief. Before we go into the list of home remedies for skin infections, let's define what a skin infection is and the various types of skin infections. Scroll down for more information. In This Article What Is Skin Infection? You get a skin infection when a bacterium, a parasite, a virus or a fungus enters your skin through a cut or an open wound and spreads. This causes pain, swelling, redness, changes in your skin color, and other symptoms. Skin infection should not be confused with skin rashes. You get rashes when your skin is irritated (by any external agent, including chemicals). Skin infection and [skin rashes](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-treat-rashes-on-the-face/) may have similar symptoms like swelling, redness, and pain. You may get a skin rash because of an infection, but not every skin rash is an infection. You need a proper, holistic diagnosis to determine that. Skin infections can be of many types. Let's explore them in the next section. Types Of Skin Infection Skin infections are classified into the following types based on the causes: 1. Fungal Infections Fungi love the warm and damp folds and areas in your body, especially your armpits, the areas behind your knees, and your feet. Fungal infections are pretty common and usually not contagious. Some common types of a [fungal infection](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-avoid-fungal-infections-during-the-rains-preventive-methods-and-home-remedies/) include: - Ringworm [Yeast infection](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-yeast-infection/) - Diaper rash - Athlete's foot 2. Bacterial Infections You might have noticed small red bumps on your face, neck, back, or hands. Often, these red bumps increase in size and are filled with pus due to bacterial invasion. Some common types include: - Boils [Cellulitis](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-treat-cellulitis/) - Impetigoi [X]A contagious skin infection found in children, causing red sores around the nose, mouth, and limbs, which burst and form crusts in a week. - Carbunclesi [X]An infection deep beneath the skin, usually involving multiple hair follicles, causing a lump with pus. 3. Parasitic Infections Parasitic infections are not life-threatening but can be uncomfortable. They are usually not localized to the skin and might spread to your bloodstream and organs. Common examples include: - Scabies - Lice - Bedbugs 4. Viral Infections Viruses can give you mild to significant skin infections. Common viral infections include: - Measles - Chickenpox [Shingles](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/treatment-for-shingles/) - Warts According to a [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8632754/) of European long-term care facilities (LTCF) that was undertaken between 2016 and 2017 and published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) is 3.7% or around 4.4 million cases. The most frequent types of HCAI in LTCF were respiratory tract infections (33.2%), UTIs (32.0%), and skin infections (21.5%). Now, the question is, how do you know if you have a particular skin infection? Simple. You have to check for the symptoms. Symptoms Of Skin Infection A tattoo, a piercing, a cut, or a bruise - germs are always looking for openings to invade and infect your skin. While some infections occur on the surface of the skin, some may go beyond that and cause serious issues. Here are a few symptoms you should watch out for: - Pus or fluid leaking from an open wound - A reddish bump or a pimple (with or without) a yellow pus-filled crust - The reddish hue of the skin around the wound - Sores that appear more like blisters - Swelling around a bump or wound that gets worse with time - An open wound that is not healing even after 10 days - An injury accompanied by a fever Consult your doctor immediately to identify what is causing the infection. It's important to know that as that will determine the course of treatment: What Causes Skin Infection? Whether it is a fungus, bacteria, virus, parasite or bug bite - anything can cause a skin infection. The causes depend mostly on the type of infection you have. Here are a few factors that might cause a skin infection: 1. Bacteria Open wounds, cuts, and sores are perfect gateways for bacteria to enter your body. A cut or a bruise always doesn't mean you will get an infection, but it makes your body more vulnerable to bacterial attacks. 2. Viruses These are the most common factors that cause an infection. Why? Viral infections are highly contagious. The most common viruses that cause skin infections are herpesvirusi [X]A virus with DNA as its genetic material with Types 1 and 2 which cause cold sores and genital sores, respectively. , poxvirus, and human papillomavirus (this causes skin warts). 3. Fungi Fungal infections depend a lot on your lifestyle (and cleanliness, of course!) Wearing sweaty clothes for long and not cleaning the folds of your body properly make you vulnerable to fungal infections. 4. Parasites These are tiny bugs that burrow themselves deep into your skin, laying eggs on your skin and feeding on you (for instance, lice). While you may treat these issues with over-the-counter, homeopathic, and herbal medications, you can also treat them with simple home remedies. Wondering how? Read on! How To Diagnose A Skin Infection? For initial diagnosis, you may check the common symptoms caused by different skin infections. However, a doctor is the best person to run a thorough diagnosis and determine what type of skin infection you have. The doctor can identify the type of infection by checking the appearance of the area where you got it. However, they may also do some more tests for a better diagnosis. The tests may include examining the skin sample and taking a closer look at the lesion. If the infection is severe, the doctor will suggest antibiotics and other topical medicines (spray, ointments, and salve). However, if you have a minor infection, you can try treating it with home remedies. Home Remedies For Skin Infection 1.
