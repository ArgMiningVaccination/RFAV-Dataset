PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and risk of cardiovascular disease? What is the answer to the question? Dietary Patterns: Children Limited evidence suggests that dietary patterns consumed by children and adolescents reflecting higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, low -fat dairy, legumes, and lower intake of sugar -sweetened beverages, other sweets, and processed meat, are associated with lower blood pressure and blood lipid levels, including low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides later in life. Dietary Patterns: Adults The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Commit tee conducted a systematic evidence scan and confirmed that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee generally reflects the current state of science: Strong and consistent evidence demonstrates that dietary patterns associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease are characterized by higher consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low -fat dairy, and seafood, and lower consumption of red and processed meat, and lower intakes of refined grains, and sugar - sweetened foods and beverages relative to less healthy patterns. Regular consumption of nuts and legumes and moderate consumption of alcohol also are shown to be components of a beneficial dietary pattern in most studies. Randomized dietary intervention studies have demonstrated that healthy dietary patterns exert clinically meaningful impact on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood lipids and blood pressure. Additionally, research that includes specific nutrients in their description of dietary patterns indicate that patterns that are lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium and richer in fiber, potassium, and unsaturated fats are beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Diets Based on Macronutrient Distribution: Children No evidence was available to determine the relationship between diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by children or adolescents and concurrent or future development of cardiovascular disease. Diets Based on Macronutrient Distribution: Adults Limited evidence suggests non- energy restricted diets based solely on macronutrient distribution with either carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein proportions 11 outside of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range, are neither beneficial nor detrimental regarding risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, primarily among those at high- risk, such as those with overweight, obesity or features of metabolic syndrome. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. How was this question answered? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review and a systematic evidence scan to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR ) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein , whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. What is the population of inter est? Children and adults, ages 2 years and older What evidence was found? This review i dentified 190 articles that met inclusion criteria. Four articles examined dietary patterns consumed by children and risk of cardiovascular disease. o Dietary patterns that were higher in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, low-fat dairy, legumes, and lower in sugar -sweetened beverages, other sweets, and processed meat, are associated with lower blood pressure and blood lipid levels later in life . o The 2020 Committee determined the strength of this evidence was limited. One- hundred forty -nine articl es examined dietary patterns consumed by adults and risk of cardiovascular disease. o The 2020 Committee determined these articles were generally consistent with those from an existing NESR systematic review. Therefore, the 2020 Committee carried forward the conclusion from the 2015 Committee. No studies were i ncluded that examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by children or adolescents and risk of cardiovascular disease. o The 2020 Committee could not draw a conclusion due to a lack of evidence. Forty -nine articles examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults and risk of cardiovascular disease, primarily in those who were overweight or obese, or had features of metabolic syndrome. o Most studies found no significant effects of macronutrient distributions outside the AMDR on risk of cardiovascular disease. 12 o Several limitations in the study design and conduct of included articles were identified. o The 2020 Committee determined the strength of this evidence was limited. How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for s tudies from January , 2000 to October , 2019; and updated existing systematic review s that included evidence from January 2000 to January 2014 . 13 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and risk of ca rdiovascular disease ? Conclusion statement s and grades Dietary Patterns: Children Limited evidence suggests that dietary patterns consumed by children and adolescents reflecting higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, low -fat dairy, legumes, and lower intake of sugar -sweetened beverages, other sweets, and processed meat, are associated with lower blood pressure and blood lipid levels, including low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides later in life. (Grade: Limited) Dietary Patterns: Adults The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic evidence scan and confirmed that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee generally reflects the current state of science: Strong and consistent evidence demonstrates that dietary patterns associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease are characterized by higher consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low -fat dairy, and seafood, and lower consumption of red and processed meat, and lower intakes of refined grains, and sugar - sweetened foods and beverages relative to less healthy patterns. Regular consumption of nuts and legumes and moderate consumption of alcohol also are shown to be components of a beneficial dietary pattern in most studies. Randomized dietary intervention studies have demonstrated that healthy dietary patterns exert clinically meaningful impact on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood lipids and blood pressure. Additionally, research that includes specific nutrients i n their description of dietary patterns indicate that patterns that are lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium and richer in fiber, potassium, and unsaturated fats are beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease risk. ( 2015 Dietary Guidelines A dvisory Committee Grade: Strong) Diets Based on Macronutrient Distribution: Children No evidence was available to determine the relationship between diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by children or adolescents and concurrent or future development of cardiovascular disease. (Grade: Grade Not Assignable ) 14 Diets Based on Macronutrient Distribution: Adults Limited evidence suggests non- energy restricted diets based solely on macronutrient distribution with either carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein proportions outside of the A cceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range, are neither beneficial nor detrimental regarding risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, primarily among those at high- risk, such as those with over weight, obesity or features of metabolic syndrome. (Grade: Limited) Methods Two l iterature searches were conducted using 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of dietary patterns consumed and the outcomes of cardiovascular disease. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee q ualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and graded the strength of evidence using pre- established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion was outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein, whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. Studies examining energy -restricted diets that induce weight loss or treat overweight and obesity for the purposes of treating additional or other medical conditions were excluded. Summary of the evidence One- hundred ninety articles were identified that met inclusion criteria and examined the relationship between dietary patterns and/or diets based on macronutrient proportion and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Four included articles , all from prospective cohort studies (PCSs) published between January 2014 and October 2019, examined the relationship between dietary patterns consumed by children and CVD . o Two of the articles used index or score analyses to examine dietary patterns. o Two of the articles examined the dietary patterns identified wi th factor and cluster analyses. o Most of the studies examined intermediate CVD outcomes in childhood, although one study reported on incidence of CVD in adulthood. o This body of evidence updates an existing systematic review from the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which found insufficient evidence in pediatric populations published between 1980 and 2013 that met inclusion criteria on dietary patterns and CVD and therefore, was unable to form a 15 conclusion statement at the time. One- hundred forty -nine articles examined dietary patterns consumed by adults and CVD. o These articles represent new evidence published since an existing systematic review that included articles published between J anuary 1980 and 2013, which was reviewed by the 2015 Committee. o A systematic evidence scan was conducted to identify and examine newly published evidence, and determine whether a full systematic review update was warranted. o Based on results from the syst ematic evidence scan, the 2020 Committee determined that the newly published evidence was generally consistent with the body of evidence from the existing review, and a full systematic review update was not needed at this time. Therefore, the conclusion st atement and grade from the existing review were carried forward. No articles were identified that met inclusion criteria and examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed in child hood and risk of CVD across the lifespan. Forty -nine included articles examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults and CVD outcomes, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2000 and October 2019. o Nineteen articles came from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and 30 articles came from PCSs. o When describing and categorizing studies included in these reviews, the Committee did not label the diets examined as \"low\" or \"high,\" because no standard definition is currently available for , for example, \"low- carbohydrate\" or \"high- fat\" diets. Instead, the Committee focused on whether, and the extent to which, the proportions of the macronutrients were below or above the AMDR. o Most studies enrolled participants who were overweight or obese, or exhibited features of metabolic syndrom e. o The majority of RCTs (n=11) reported no significant effects of macronutrient distributions on intermediate CVD outcomes, such as LDL cholesterol. Although results from several RCTs (n=8) reported significantly improved intermediate CVD outcomes, diets compared between studies were heterogeneous with macronutrient distributions inconsistently above or below the AMDR and dependent upon the comparison of interest (e.g., fat within vs. above the AMDR). o Many PCSs reported no significant associations across specified macronutrient distributions and CVD mortality endpoint outcomes. Among the PCSs (n=9 of 30) that also reported dietary patterns, the majori ty reported that diets with energy derived from total fat intakes above the AMDR were associated with increased CVD risk, and generally reflected lower diet quality. o Numerous limitations were identified across th e body of evidence: Vastly d ifferent study designs and diet assessment approaches were used to examine macronutrient distributions . Few studies evaluated macronutrient distribution in the context of dietary patterns in relation to CVD. Foods and food groups consumed as part of the diet pattern, were inconsistently assessed and reported, thereby limiting meaningful 16 conclusions regarding nutrient density and overall nutritional quality. The gradient between proportions compared within and across studies varied widely. Although many st udies compared proportions that were distinctly different, some compared only slight differences in macronutrient content (e.g., 42.0% vs 43.7 % fat), thereby reducing the specificity of the impact . Due to the var iability in methodology used to estimate m acronutrient intake and/or adjust for total energy, confidence in the accuracy of reported proportions of energy falling outside the AMDR is low. Several studies focused on a particular macronutrient of interest, such as \"high- protein\" or \"low -carbohydrat e\" intake, but the proportion for that macro nutrient was within the AMDR. 17 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and risk of cardiovascular disease?

Description of the evidence Dietary patterns: C hildren Population/participant characteristics The four articles examining the relationship between dietary patterns consumed by children and cardi ovascular disease (CVD) were conducted in 4 different countries: United Kingdom25 Australia30 United States36 Portugal139 Across these studies conducted in children, the analytic sample size ranged from 1,41930 to 42,11236 and all had a follow up time period of at least 10 years. Data from these studies represented 4 established cohorts ( Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort, Nurses' Health Study -II (NHS II ), and Generation XXI Birth Cohort). Three of these were birth cohorts following participants from birth onward, and one was a study of adults but inquired retrospectively about dietary habits in adolescence.36 Studies included participants who were under the age of 18 years at the time of diet exposure that were healthy and/or at risk of chronic disease. One study excluded participants that reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or cancer prior to returning dietary questionnaire. 36 The birth cohort studies included both girls and boys25,30,139 and the one study that evaluated intake retrospectiv ely included middle- aged women.36 The 3 birth cohort studies did not report information regarding race/ethnicity of participants, and the fourth study was conducted among predomina ntly White female participants . 36 Intervention/exposure Dietary patterns consumed during childhood were assessed by two different methods. Two articles used only index or score analysis30,36 and two used on ly factor and cluster analysis .25,139 Dietary intake was primarily assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) , with one study that utilized dietary histories. The diet assessment methods used are as follows: One article reported diet collection with validated FFQ at more than one time point over the course of the study [ at age 14 y (baseline) and age 17y (follow- up)]30 21 Two articles reported diet collection with validated FFQ at one time point at baseline36,139 One article reported diet collection with multiple food diaries (at age s 7, 10, and 13 y25 Outcome assessment All included studies examined risk of intermediate CVD disease outcomes and one evaluat ed CVD incidence. Included studies examined risk of CVD or intermediate outcomes , with follow- up ranging from 10 y to 17 y. For the birth cohort studies, the length of follow -up was equivalent to the age of participant. St udies examined the following CVD intermediate outcomes: high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and/or triglycerides (TG)25,30,36,139 with two of these studies additionally evaluating total cholesterol (TC).25,30 One study also examined risk of CVD.36 Dietary patterns: A dults Evidence scan results One hundred forty-nine article s that met inclusion criteria, were published between January 2014 and October 2019, and examined dietary patterns con sumed by adults and Among these 149, 137 articles examined dietary 12 examined both dietary patterns and diet s based on macronutrient distribution.31,38,39,47 ,83,106,120 ,145,149,154,159,180 Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Children No studies that were identified met inclusion criteria that examined diets based on macronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outsi de of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient in children and intermediate or endpoint CVD outcomes across the lifespan. Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Adults Forty -nine articles that met inclusion criteria, were published between January 2000 and October 2019, and examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults and risk of c ardiovascular disease. The 49 articles were comprised of 19 RCTs ,8,14,18 ,37-39,42, 45,56, ,120,126,141,142,149, 154,159,180, examining dietary patterns or diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults that are included in this systematic review were conducted in the following countries: Australia 38,39,42,180 studies were conducted in multiple European countries150,169, 176 Studies enrolled healthy adults as well as those that were obese or overweight , with high CVD risk, or those with features of metabolic syndrome. Participants were primarily middle -aged and older adults. No studies that were identified evaluated diets based on macronutrient proportions in children. Of the prospective cohort studies, many were conducted in the same cohorts of participants, including t he Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort ,47,98-100 Atherosclerosis Ris k Profes sionals Follow- up Study (HPFS) .101,141,142 Although multiple articles from the same cohorts were included, each of t he included articles represent unique data by examining different sub- samples , time -points or duration of follow- up, different CVD outcomes , or different macronutrient distributions and/or dietary patterns. Intervention/exposure Among macronutrient distribution, most used validated methods to assess macronutrient intake at baseline, although methods varied across studies. Dietary intake was measured by FFQ once at baseline in 13 articles ,23,24,31,43, 72,93 ,110,119,126,149,154,180,183 or using two or more FFQs at regular intervals during the study in 1 1 articles .54,59,61,65, 66,69,83,101 ,141,142,159 Several studies util ized multiple methods of measuring dietary intake, including FFQs and multiple day dietary records .47,98- 100 The remaining studies used multi -day dietary records106,120 or a 24- hour dietary recall .110 For the studies that evaluated both diets based on macronutrient distribution and dietary patterns, various methods were used to determin e or derive dietary patterns, including factor and cluster analyses , index scores , and reduced rank regression. Among the 19 RCTs ,8,14,18,37- 39,42,45 ,56,73,80,130,145,148,150,169, 176,179,184 participants were randomized to consume specific diets either based on an underlying dietary pattern or based on specific macronutrient levels . One RCT compared diets of different protein levels ,8 one compared a \"high- carbohydrate\" diet to a \"high- protein\" diet,42 four compared \"low-fat\" and control diet s,18,45,73,80 and five examined macronutrient distributions based on dietary patterns compared either to each other or to a control group.38,39,145,176,179 The remaining 8 RCTs compared low carbohydrate and low fat diets ,14,56,184 high f at and high carbohydrate diets ,37,148 or varying fat level diets with a change in the quality of carbohydrates compared to a control .130,150,169 The label of the level of macronutrients were determined by the authors of each paper (i.e., 'low fat' may have different definitions by each article). Among the macronutrient distributions reported , the proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR were as follows: 23 Carbohydrate below the AMDR ranged between 25.3% and 44.9% Carbohydrate above the AMDR ranged between 66% and 72.7% Fat above the AMDR ranged between 35.2% and 46.1% Fat below the AMDR ranged between 10.8 % and 18.9% Protein was above the AMDR in one study at 43.5% Most of the studies ( 38 of 49 ) examined macronutrient distributions in which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was below the AMDR in at least one of the cases, the corresponding proportion of energy from total fat was above the AMDR. In one of study, the proportion of ener gy from protein was above the AMDR .8 Six studies examined macronutrient distributions in which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was above the AMDR .80,110,119,120,183,184 In most but not all six of these studies , the corresponding proportion of energy from total fat was below the AMD R. Two studies examined macronutrient distributions in which the proportion of energy from total fat was above the AMDR in at least one of the exposure groups compared, wit h other macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein) within the AMDR.31,73 Outcome assessment Studies that examined the relationship between diets based on macronutrient proportion and CVD outcomes examined both endpoint and intermediate outcomes over follow- up ranging from 16 wk to 6 y (RCTs) and 4 y to 32 y (PCSs ). The following CVD outcomes were reported in these studies : Endpoint outcomes: C VD-mortality , and/or i CHD) Dietary patterns: C hildren Summary of results Results reported in the studies included in this systematic review were mixed ( Table 1). Bull and Northstone25 identified 4 dietary patterns using cluster analysis in a cohort of children (and their parents) in the United Kingdom assessed at ages 7, 10 and 13 y. Results showed that higher adherence to a \"processed\" compared to a \"healthy\" dietary pattern at ages 7 and 10 y was associated with significantly lower odds of high LDL and lower odds of high TG. Adherence to the \"packed lunch\" compared to the \"healthy \" dietary pattern at age 7 y was associated with significantly higher HDL. Higher adherence to the \"traditional \" compared to \"healthy \" dietary pattern at age 10 y was associated with significantly lower elevated DBP, high TG, and high TC . Additionally, there was no significant association between any of the patterns at any age and elevated SBP . Pubertal stage was not reported and the validation of the assessment methods and accuracy of the data tables are unclear . It should be noted that the accuracy/validity of these data are unclear and that study authors acknowledged a lack of robustness in results for these outcomes. 24 Pinto et al139 also utilized factor/cluster analysis to identify 4 dietary patterns, as well as including 3 patterns identified in a previous paper for a total of 7 dietary patterns examined at age 7 y in a Portugal birth cohort. Higher adherence to the Partial Least Squares - Factor 1 (PLS -1) pattern emphasizing processed meats, cakes, and soft drink s was significantly associated with higher DBP, and higher adherence to the \"Principal Component Analysis - Factor 1\" (PCA- 1) pattern emphasizing sugary drinks, sweets, and salty snacks was significantly associated with higher SBP. Both of these patterns w ere classified as \"less healthy\" than their comparator . There were no significant associations between PLS -2 or PCA- 2 at age 7 y despite the emphasis on fish in the PLS -2 pattern and the emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy in the PCA- 2 patter n with any of the evaluated intermediate cardiovascular outcomes (SBP, DBP, TG, HDL, LDL). Of the 3 patterns identified in a previous paper there were no significant associations between the \"Snacking\" or \"Energy -dense foods\" patterns when compared to the \"Healthier\" pattern and intermediate cardiovascular outcomes. Chan She Ping- Delfos et al 30 examined the relationship between the Australia n Dietary Guideline Index for Children and Adolescents (DGI -CA) and intermediate cardiovascular outcomes from age 14 to age 17 y . Higher vs. lower adherence to the DGI-CA score was significantly associated with decreased TG and SBP, but was not significant ly associated with any change in TC, HDL, LDL, or DBP. Finally, Dahm et al36 retrospectively evaluated the relationship between the Alternative Health Eating Index from 2010 (AHEI -2010) and hypertension and CVD risk in women from the NHS. Higher vs. lower adherence to the AHEI -2010 score was significantly associated with a lower hypertension risk but not significant ly associat ed with CVD risk. Assessment of the evidence 2Fiii This systematic review update in children included 4 studies that met inclusion criteria. There was l imited evidence that suggests dietary patterns consumed by children and adolescents reflecting higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, seafood, low-fat dairy, legumes, and lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages, other sweets, and processed meat, are associated with lower BP and blood lipid levels, including LDL, HDL and TG later in life . This new, but limited, evidence in pediatric populations highlights similar d ietary pattern components as those identified in adult populations that are associated with improved CVD outcomes. Included studies had relatively large sample sizes w ith both significant and non- significant results. Therefore, this risk of publication bias is relatively low . As outlined and described below, this body of evidence was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence Risk of bias: There were a number of potential risks of bias, or limitations, across the body of evidence (see Table 4 ) that make inter pretation of results difficult. Most studies adjusted for confounders, but a key confounder not iii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 20 20. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 25 considered in a ny of the four studies was race/ethnicity. Alcohol and smoking were not considered key confounders in this group due to the age of participants being under 18 y. Diet was assessed only once at baselin e in all of the included studies . While three of the studies assessed diet once prospectively at baseline, one study retr ospectively evaluated diet from a prospective cohort analysis which may have led to possible recall bias; the validity and reliability of those data are unclear. Consistency: All four articles came from observational studies that used two approaches to ass ess dietary patterns, including two that examined adherence to different indices/ scores and two that derived dietary patterns by factor/cluster analysis. Despite variability in the methods used to examine dietary patterns, consistent elements included rela tively h igher intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low -fat dairy, legumes, and lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages, processed meat, and sweets . Across the body of evidence, the direction of findings was relatively consistent, but varied based on age at exposure. Directness : The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest in the included studies are directly related to the systematic review question. Precision: Sample sizes were relatively large (1400+) in the four studies. Effect sizes were relatively small across the small body of evidence, pointing to imprecision. Generalizability: The study participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence may not be applicable to the United States population since three of the four included studies were conducted outside of the U.S. and had varying demographics . The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee updated an existing systematic review on dietary patterns and risk of CVD, which was used to inform the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2015 Committee found insufficient available evidence to assess in pediatric populations and was therefore, unable to draw a conclusion regarding dietary patterns during childhood and risk of CVD. Therefore, the current systematic review identifies a newly published body of evidence that evaluates dietary patterns consumed by children or adolescents and CVD risk, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2014 and October 2019, but is overall limited with four included studies. Dietary patterns: A dults Evidence scan results The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic evidence scan to identify and examine new evidence published since a review done by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 3Fiv The 2020 Committee determine that the newly published evidence was consistent with the evidence previously reviewed for the iv Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2015. Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 26 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Scientific Report. Results a cross the newly published body of evidence were generally consistent with the conclusion from 2015, showing that dietary patterns of higher diet quality were typically associated with protection from developing cardiovascular disease. The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest are directly related to the systematic review question. S tudy participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the newly published body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. population. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee noted in the existing review that most studies showing beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes considered regular consumption of nuts and legumes in the overall dietary pattern, but thes e were not necessarily components of all dietary patterns. Additionally, the existing conclusion statement from 2015 also noted that many studies reported beneficial effects between an overall dietary pattern that may include alcoholic beverage intake and cardiovascular outcomes in adults. For the newly published evidence, i nclusion of moderate alcohol intake within an overall dietary pattern may still be acceptabl e but not necessarily recommended, particularly with regards to prevention of co- morb id condit ions that may be exacerbated with alcoholic beverage intake , e.g., hypertension, cancer, etc. Studies that examine overall dietary patterns consumed by adults often vary in how alcohol intake is assessed, the thresholds applied for amounts of alcohol consumed, and scoring procedures of alcohol as a component (e.g., a positive component, positive in moderation, or negative component). Due to this inconsistency, the inclusion and specification of alcoholic beverages within dietary patterns warrants further in vestigation. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee determined that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee still generally reflects the current of science on dietary patterns consumed by adults and risk of CVD. Therefore, a full systematic review was not conducted at this time, and the 2015 Committee's conclusion statement and grade were carried forward. The 2015 Committee concluded that: Strong and consistent evidence demonstrates that dietary patterns associated with decreased risk of CVD are characterized by higher consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low -fat dairy, and seafood, and lower consumption of red and processed meat, and lower intakes of refined grains, and sugar -sweetened foods and beverages relative to less healthy patterns. Regular consumption of nuts and legumes and moderate consumption of alcohol also are shown to be components of a beneficial dietary pattern in most studies . Randomized dietary intervention studies have demonstrated that healthy dietary patterns exert clinically meaningful impact on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood lipids and BP. Additionally, research that includes specific nutrients in their description of dietary patterns indicate that patterns that are lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium , and richer in fiber, potassium, and unsaturated fats are beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease risk. Diets based on macronutrient distributions: C hildren No studies identifi ed met inclusion criteria that examined diets based on macronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outsi de of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient in children and CVD outcomes across the lifespan. 27 Diets based on macronutrient distributio ns: A macronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient and CVD outcomes . The 49 articles included (summarized in Table 2)8,14,18,37- 39,42,45,56,73 ,80,130,145,148 ,150,169,176, 179,184 and .23,24,31,43,47,54,59,61, 65,66,69,72,83, 93,98- 101,106,110, 119,120,126,141 ,142,149,154,159,180,183 Results reported across studies varied by study design, macronutrient distributions compared, dietary patterns examined, or reported outcomes. Significant and/or mixed associations were reported in 27 of the included articles , 14,23 ,24,31,37,39, 43,47,54,56,59, 61,69 ,73,80,83,93 ,98,100,106,110 studies reporting that certain diets based on macronutrient distribution were associated with decreased risk of CVD outcomes (e.g., low er BP, reduced incidence of stroke, MI, CHD , or lower risk of CVD- mortality ). Significant results were reported in eight RCTs .14,37,39,56,73, 80,145,184 Observational studies primarily examined endpoint outcomes with some reporting significant results for multiple types of endpoint outcomes , e.g., reduced CVD- mortality as well as reduced CVD- risk,83 or increased CVD- mortality and increased CVD -risk.69 No sign ificant associations between diets based on macronutrient distribution and any/all CVD outcomes were reported in 22 of the included articles, including both RCTs and observational studies described further below. Randomized controlle d trials Eight RCTs reported significant relationships between macronutrient based diet exposures and intermediate CVD outcomes ,14,37,39,56, 73,80 ,145,184 whereas the remaining (11 of 19) RCTs reported no significant relationship between macronutrient distributions compared and intermediate CVD outcomes . Among the studies with any significant effects reported, different macronutrient distributions were compared. Five studies com pared diets based on macronutrient proportions of carbohydrate below the AMDR compared to either carbohydrate within the AMDR14,37,56,145 or carbohydrate below the AMDR with fat above the AMDR .39 Results from these studies were inconsistent . Improved HDL levels after 12 mo were observed in two studies that tested participants exclusively with overweight or obesity, who were following \"low- carbohydrate\" diets, at 27.5% or 29. the AMDR at 27.9% or 28.7% fat. 14,56 Neither study reported any significant improvements in BP but both studies reported outcomes after 12 mo follow -up duration. It should be noted that Bazzano et al14 also reported significantly improved TG and TC:HDL ratio, but no changes in LDL and Gardner et al 56 reported no changes in TG. It is likely t hat methodolog ical differences between studies account for inconsistency in findings, such as the race/ethnicity was 51% African -American in Bazzano et al , 14 but ~ 3-4% in Gardner et al.56 Some studies showed improved HDL, TC, and LDL levels when comparing diets based on macronutrient distributions within the AMDR compared to outside with diets that emphasized plant -based elements labeled as \"low -fat Vegan\" or \"dietary 28 guidelines\" diet .80,145 Among studies testing varied levels of total fat intake, lower levels of fat intake within the AMDR were typically associated with improved CVD outcomes over shorter -term follow- up, but this was inconsistent. Howard et al73 tested diets at varied levels of reduced fat intake within the AMDR compared to control diets with fat intake above the AMDR from th e Women's Health Initiative Diet Modification Trial that targeted total fat reduction to 20% kcal with primary outcome being breast cancer. Qualitative changes in fat composition aimed at cardiovascular disease risk reduction was not considered. Lower BMI, waist circumference and body weight were reported after 1 y, but ultimately no significant differences between groups at the end of 6 y follow -up. Wan et al184 assessed \"low\", \"moderate\", and \"high\" levels of fat and carbohydrate intake, with the proportion of fat above the AMDR at 40% in the \"high -fat\" distribution, and proportion of carbohydrate slightly above the AMDR at 66% of energy in the \"high- carbohydrate\". All other proportions, including \"low -fat\" were within the AMDR. Lower - fat levels within the AMDR and either \" high-carbohydrate\" at 66% or \"moderate- carbohydrate\" at 56% were significantly associated with lower TC , HDL, and LDL a fter 6 mo of follow -up. Most of the se trials had sufficient contrast between comparisons of the macronutrient distribution s. However, one study compared intervention and control groups with macronutrient proportions similarly outside of the AMDR in the same direction (e.g., 37.8% carbohydrate, 38.8% fat fat , 19.2% protein).39 Observational studies Significant results were reported in 19 of the observational studies and varied depending on the macronutrient distribution compared or dietary patterns examined. Eleven studies reported macronutrient distributions that were significantly associated with reduced CVD outcomes, including lower risk of CVD- mortality ,23,31,83,98,100 decreased risk of (incident) CVD /CHD,24,43 ,47,61,83,93 or reduced cerebral infarction.93 Among those studies, the macronutrient distributions included fat above the AMDR compared to either fat within t he AMDR,43,61, 83 or above the AMDR ,47 and carbohydrate below the AMDR .93 Six studies reported macronutrient distributions with carbohydrate below the AMDR and fat above the AMDR that were significantly associated with higher CVD- mortality and CVD -risk, including CHD and CVD- events .54,59,69,110 ,126,154 One study reported higher CVD- mortality risk when comparing macronutrient distributions within the AMDR compared to carbohydrate above and fat below the AMDR .120 Two studies reported similar findings that were dependent on whether the underlying dietary patt ern was animal - or plant -based.54,159 Both studies reported that plant - or vegetable- based diets with macronutrient distributions of carbohydrate below the AMDR and fat above the AMDR compared to distribution s with all proportions within the AMDR were significant ly associated with lower risk of CVD- mortality , and the opposite for animal -based patterns , i.e., significantly associated with higher risk of CVD- mortality. 29 Assessment of the evidence 4Fv This systematic review included 49 articles that examined diets based on macronutrient distribution and risk of CVD, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2000 and October 2019. Multiple databases were used to obtain publications from a large, comprehensive search. Although several studies were from large prospective cohorts, studies with smaller sample sizes were also included and reported both significant and non- significant results. Therefore, this risk of publication bias is low. As outlined and described below, the body of evidence was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence. Risk of bias: There were a number of potential risks of bias, or limitations, across the body of evidence that make interpretation of results difficult ( Table 5 and Table 6). While studies adjusted for most potential confounders, they did not adjust for all key confounders, such as race/ethnicity. Many studies evaluated dietary data only once at baseline, though generally validated methods were utilized. Several s tudies did not assess the impact of missing data, either due to los s to follow -up or criteria used when selecting participants into the analyses. Studies enrolled healthy adult s as well as those who were obese or overweight, with high cardiovascular disease risk, or those with features of metabolic syndrome, so CVD risk at baseline varied across the body of evidence. Consistency: Of the 4 9 articles, there was variability in study design with 19 included from RCTs and 30 articles from PCSs . Results across the evidence, both in trials and observational studies were inconsistent in both directions and within outcomes. Most studies examined mac ronutrient distributions in which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was below the AMDR in at least one of the exposure groups compared and the corresponding proportion of energy from fat was above the AMDR . However, the direction of findings was relatively spilt in terms of r educed vs. increased risk of CVD . Statistically significant relationships were observed but the gradient between the macronutrient distributions was narrow across studies (e.g., 43.6% vs. 45.2%) . Studies varied in terms of the distribution of macronutrients that were examined and the methods used to estimate nutrient intakes, derive the proportion of energy from macronutrients (either from dietary record or FFQ data), and/ or apply substitution modelling. Directness: The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest in the included studies may be less directly related to the systematic review question. Several studies did not examine the impact of repla cing energy from one macronutrient relative to a nother. v A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 20 20. Scient ific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 30 Precision: All of the RCTs demonstrated adequate power with a wide range of sample sizes , although some studies had a very small sample size (n=16) . The assessment of variance within these studies was relatively narrow, but sever al indicated wider variance in results. Most of the observational studies did not report power analyses or sample size calculations. However, the majority had large analyt ic sample sizes, with a range between n=2,006 and n=92,088 Generalizability: The study participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. population. However, there is some concern with regards to variability in race/ethnicity of the study participants as a result of study design and a lack of accounting for race/ethnicity in many studies. Research recommendations 1. Determine the impact that dietary patterns may have that is independent of adiposity and/or weight -loss, to better inform studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and/or obesity . 2. Conduct well -designed, sufficiently powered, studies that examine the relationship between well- defined and quantified dietary patterns consumed by children/adolescents and the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adulthood; particularly lacking are RCTs . Assessment of pubertal status in adolescents is important due to hormonal influences on CVD risk factors. 3. Develop a standardized definition and validated assessment methods for what constitutes a on macronutrient proportion. 4. Examine the relationship between diets based on macronutrient proportions of energy from carbohydrate below 25%, that include adequate information about diet quality to determine if and what relationship may exist between macronutrient -based dietary patterns, e.g., \"low -carbohydrate\", and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. These types of studies need to adequately control for the quality of food intake and meeting Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ). 5. Explore the role that macronutrient quality may have in the relationship between \"low- carbohydrate\" diets and the prevention of cardiovascular disease (i.e. , effect modification) . 6. Examine additional body fat distribution outcomes and in particular, ectopic fat. 7. Assess habitual diet intake at more than one time- point, over the course of follow- up, to facilitate potential causal relationships between dietary patterns and CVD risk factors over time . 8. Differentiate specific foods and food groups, in particular, the types and amounts, relevant biomarkers, and repeated measures to facilitate development of both prevent ive strategies and evaluate impact on the overall outcomes 31 Included articles 1.

The results of t wo electronic database searches , after removal of duplicates, were combined for efficiency and screened independently by two NESR analysts using a step- wise process by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full -texts to de termine which articles met the inclusion crite ria (Table 7). Inclusion and exclusion criteria ) for each systematic review question depicted in the flow chart. Refer to Table 8. Excluded articles from updated literature s earch for the rationale for exclusion for each excluded full -text article. A manual search was done to find articles that were not identified when searching the electronic databases; all manually identified articles are also screened to determine whether they meet criteria for inclusion. 100 Figure 2. Flow chart of literature search and screening results 23Fxxiv xxiv The flow chart depicts the combined raw search totals from the electronic databases that were searched from both searches that included a total of 102,073 raw results, which were comprised of 63,384 raw results from the first search strategy and 38,689 raw results from the second search strategy as described in the Electronic databases section. That section also provides the date range searched. Search results from both searches were combined for efficiency because both searches were addressing the same systematic review question from different search date ranges. Results were screened together in sc reening software by two analysts independently . Due to topical overlap, both of the searches were designed to comprehensively identify relevant liter ature in this systematic review question as well as two additional systematic reviews quest ions to avoid screening the same results multiple times. 101 Excluded a rticles The table below lists the articles excluded after full -text screening from two literature searches for this systematic review question, as well as two additional systematic review questions . At least one reason for exclusion is provided for each article, which may not reflect all possible reasons. Information about articles excluded after title and abstract screening is availabl e upon request. Table 8.
