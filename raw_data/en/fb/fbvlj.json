Organic pillows are one way to ensure this. In addition to their environmental and health benefits, organic pillows are often highly breathable and extremely durable. Many companies who produce organic products have a close relationship with their sources, giving back to the local communities or participating in other green initiatives. Organic wool and down are produced with improved animal welfare compared to traditional means. Whether they're made of buckwheat, latex, wool, cotton, or other organic materials, organic pillows represent a choice that's better for you and the planet. There's a wide range of organic choices on the market. We'll describe the differences between different types of organic pillows and discuss how to know if a pillow is really organic. We'll also share our top picks for the best organic pillows available.

Organic pillows are any pillows made from organic materials such as latex, cotton, wool, kapok fibers, or buckwheat. Organic crops are grown without chemical pesticides, with farmers attempting to use less irrigation and produce less waste. Environmentally friendly and biodegradable, organic materials are increasingly gaining in popularity as consumers realize the impact their purchases have on the environment. What's more, organic certification often goes hand-in-hand with improved quality of life in the places where the raw materials are sourced. As it's virtually impossible for a customer to tell whether a finished product is organic or not, the USDA has established a set of regulations. In addition, there are several third-party organizations you can look to for assurance. The most commonly used are the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) and the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which we'll discuss more in detail below. Shoppers should be wary of a product that claims to be organic but doesn't hold any certification. Many companies advertise their products as \"natural,\" meaning the materials are not man-made. They are often biodegradable and less harmful to the environment than synthetic materials. However, farmers may use pesticides and chemical fertilizers to grow their crops, and the end products may contain bleach, formaldehyde, chemical dyes, or chemical fire retardants. This is why organic materials are generally considered safer for your skin and less likely to provoke allergies. How to Choose an Organic Pillow Within the world of organic pillows, you'll see a wide variety of materials used. In general, you can count on organic materials to be more breathable and durable than synthetic pillows. That said, each material has its own specific benefits. In the following sections we'll delve into the properties of different organic materials and how to choose the right organic pillow for you. What to Consider When Purchasing an Organic Pillow Your pillow is an important part of your sleep setup, supporting your head and providing a comfortable surface to lie on. In order to succeed at this, a pillow must have certain characteristics. Despite what pillow manufacturers may claim, there's no one-size-fits-all formula for pillows. The ideal characteristics change from person to person depending on body type and preferred sleeping position. Organic products are particularly susceptible to greenwashing, with many companies making claims they can't back up. Only by carefully analyzing the specs of an organic pillow can you be sure that it will deliver the benefits it promises. Loft To provide full support, a pillow should fill the space between the head and neck and the mattress. Side sleepers tend to need a higher pillow to compensate for the breadth of the shoulders, while stomach sleepers need a flatter pillow to minimize twisting of the neck. If you're unsure what loft is best for you, you may want to consider a pillow with adjustable fill. Organic Certification The organic industry has taken off in recent years, leading many companies to exaggerate their claims as an excuse to raise their prices. Certification from a trusted third-party organization can provide assurance that a product truly is organic. Support The most important job of a pillow is to support the head and neck, keeping them in line with the spine. A pillow that's too soft, too thin, or too thick won't provide adequate support and may lead to discomfort. Firmness Level Firmness level is not only a matter of comfort. A pillow that's too firm may cause pressure points, but a pillow that's too soft may fail to provide enough support. When considering pillow firmness, don't forget to take the loft into account. A high but plush pillow will allow the head to sink in further, which ultimately reduces the loft. Pressure Relief Pillows provide pressure relief in two ways: by minimizing pressure at contact points, and by reducing pressure build-up in unsupported areas. Materials such as plush latex, kapok fibers, and cotton contour more closely and tend to provide better pressure relief. Shape The vast majority of pillows are made in the traditional rectangular shape, with some including a gusset around the sides to help maintain a higher loft. However, sleepers with neck pain or other problems may benefit from a cervical pillow designed to provide extra support by following the curves of the head and neck. Organic latex pillows are best for this, as the material can be formed into any shape. Price Organic materials tend to command a higher price, but it is possible to get an organic pillow without breaking the bank. If latex pillows and buckwheat pillows are out of your budget, you can also consider alternatives such as cotton or kapok fibers. Higher-priced options are often more durable, but most organic pillows will outlive those made with synthetic materials. Quality Materials For any people, \"organic\" is synonymous with \"quality.\" However, as always, it's a good idea to check what exactly the pillow is made of, and whether it's 100 percent organic or blended with other materials. Understanding the properties of different organic materials can also help point you to the right pillow for your sleeping style. Moldability One quality that many sleepers look for in a pillow is the ability to hug it or scrunch it into shape. Pillows made with fluffier fibers such as cotton or kapok lend themselves well to this, as opposed to solid latex pillows which are less moldable. Temperature Regulation Materials that allow room for airflow can help prevent heat build-up and keep a cooler sleep surface overnight. By nature, many organic materials fall into this category. Latex, buckwheat, kapok, cotton, and wool are all known for their temperature neutrality. \"Regulating your core body temperature during the night can make a huge difference in your overall sleep quality, so breathable materials are optimal to promote cooler temperatures. I recommend looking for breathable, natural fibers for bedding, pillows, and cooling sheets, especially if you're a hot sleeper. Opt for more hypoallergenic materials like cotton, linen, silk, or bamboo, as synthetic fibers tend to be less breathable and trap more heat at night. Your body temperature needs to drop a few degrees to transition to sleep, so having breathable bedding that promotes cooler temperatures is optimal and can help assist with your body's natural temperature regulation process at night.\" - Sarah Silverman, Psy.D., a licensed psychologist and holistic sleep wellness consultant who treats patients in New York and Florida. What Are the Pros and Cons of Organic Pillows? Organic pillows can be made from a number of different materials, but most organic pillows share some common benefits and drawbacks. |Pros||Cons| What Types of Organic Pillows are Available? Common materials used in organic pillows include cotton, latex, wool, buckwheat, silk, down, and kapok. Both the cover and the fill should be organic in order for the pillow be considered 100 percent organic. Any materials that use chemicals in their manufacturing process, such as memory foam, are not considered organic. Organic Cotton: Cotton can be woven into fabric and used to make a breathable cover, or used in its fiber form for a soft and fluffy pillow filling. While regular cotton production is problematic due to its use of water and pesticides, organic cotton uses less resources and avoids harsh dyes and bleach. Looks for the GOTS certification in both the pillow cover and filling, which indicates at least 70 percent organic materials. Organic Latex: [Latex](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-pillows/best-latex-pillow) is a springy, buoyant material favored by sleepers who like a breathable, extra-supportive pillow with moderate contouring. Natural latex is made from the milky white liquid of the rubber tree and can be processed in two ways, Talalay or Dunlop. Dunlop latex is usually the more sustainable choice, as Talalay uses more chemicals. Organic latex is regulated by the GOLS certification, which requires that the latex be at least 95 percent natural. You may also see \"natural latex,\" made with a portion of synthetic materials, or fully synthetic latex, which is made of petrochemicals. Organic Wool: Used in both the cover and the fill of pillows, wool from sheep, lambs, and goats is one of nature's most impressive materials. Its crimped fibers provide a springy, supportive feel that's perfect for pillows, and the material does an excellent job of wicking moisture to keep you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Although wool can pose ethical problems, there are organizations that seek to highlight proper animal welfare and establish a humane shearing process. Buckwheat Hulls: Dried [buckwheat](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-pillows/best-buckwheat-pillow) hulls naturally interlock to provide a firm and solid sleep surface. They are extremely breathable and offer great support, but some sleepers find they are too firm and make too much noise. They also tend to be among the more expensive models, and they may be too heavy to manipulate easily during the night. Silk: Spun by silkworms, silk is a fine, smooth, and expensive fiber that is sometimes used as a filler for high-end pillows. Responsible Down: The fine duck and goose plumage used to make [down fill](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-pillows/best-down-pillow) are prized for their incredible softness, although due to their high expense they are often blended with regular feathers to lower the price. Down isn't always a very ethical choice, as it's often obtained from live-plucked birds. The [Responsible Down Standard](https://responsibledown.org/) aims to ensure humane treatment of these animals, including rules against live plucking, force feeding, and other brutal practices. However, shoppers who object to avoid animal by-products or those with allergies may want to steer clear of down altogether. Kapok fibers: Made from the fibers of the kapok tree, kapok has a lofty feel that's somewhat similar to down. Kapok production is considered more sustainable than other crops as it requires minimal irrigation or pesticides. What Organic Certifications Are There? Various third-party organizations attempt to regulate the organic bedding industry so that consumers can rest assured they're purchasing a safe and ethical product. The following certifications are some of the most common, indicating either that a product is organic or that it was produced with minimal environmental impact and low levels of harmful emissions. [Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS)](https://certifications.controlunion.com/en/certification-programs/certification-programs/gols-global-organic-latex-standard): The best organic latex pillows are certified by GOLS, a process that identifies latex sourced from organic plantations and processed into a finished product containing at least 95 percent organic material. It's virtually impossible to make entirely organic latex, as it requires a small amount of chemicals in order to be processed. [Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)](https://www.global-standard.org/): The Global Organic Textile Standard certifies that a finished product contains at least 70 percent organic fiber. It also guarantees that the product does not contain toxic dyes, and regulates the treatment of wastewater from the production process. [USDA Organic](https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic): Working together with the USDA, the [National Organic Program](https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program)(NOP) ensures uniformity in the production of organic-labelled materials. For a crop or livestock to be [certified organic,](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP_BehindTheSeal.pdf)it must be produced using approved methods, avoiding the use of genetic engineering, antibiotics, toxic fertilizers, and other prohibited substances. Among other requirements, animals must be raised under humane conditions, with access to the outdoors, and must be fed organic food starting from the last third of gestation. The USDA does not directly certify non-food organic products, instead encouraging companies to obtain the GOTS label for the finished product. [GreenGuard](http://greenguard.org/en/index.aspx?mobile=true): GreenGuard certification indicates that a product is low in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, otherwise known as off-gassing. Standard GreenGuard certification enforces safe VOC levels to minimize indoor air pollution. There is also a stricter category, GreenGuard Gold, which guarantees extremely low or zero VOC emissions. [OEKO-TEX Standard 100](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/business/certifications_and_services/ots_100/ots_100_start.xhtml): OEKO-TEX is an association of multiple research and testing institutes in Europe and Japan. The OEKO-TEX Standard 100 is an internationally recognized label awarded to products whose chemical levels fall within limits that are deemed to be harmless to human health. OEKO-TEX also awards other labels, among them the Made in Green label that ensures sustainability and ethical labor conditions. [Eco-Institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/): The eco-INSTITUT is an internationally recognized organization based in Germany that tests for pollutants and emissions in mattresses and bedding. Frequently Asked Questions About Organic Pillows The best way to check if a pillow is truly organic is by checking to see whether all the components, from cover to fill, carry third-party organic certifications. The most recognized certifications are GOLS and GOTS, which certify organic latex and organic textiles, respectively. Organic pillows can cost anywhere from $50 to well over $200 depending on the materials used to make them. They are one of the more expensive pillow types, although certain organic pillows such as cotton, feather, or kapok pillows may be more affordable than latex, down, or buckwheat. Care instructions for organic pillows differ depending on the material, although many pillows have removable covers that can be machine-washed. Spot-cleaning is recommended for wool pillows. Pillows made with organic fibers like cotton and kapok can sometimes be machine-washed and dried on low temperatures, but this should be done carefully to avoid the pillow shrinking or forming clumps. Likewise, one-piece latex pillows may be able to be gently hand-washed as long as they are thoroughly dried. Buckwheat hulls, on the other hand, should be dried in the sun and never soaked in water or they will lose their properties. When in doubt about how to clean your organic pillow, always check the manufacturer's care instructions. Organic pillows are widely available online, either directly from the manufacturer or through third-party websites that specialize in sustainable products. They are also available to a lesser extent in brick-and-mortar stores. Certain types of organic pillows, such as buckwheat, wool, or cotton-stuffed pillows, may be harder to find. Organic pillows are made with superior-quality materials that give them a longer-than-average lifespan. If properly cared for, some organic pillows can last for more than 5 years. In many cases, users can also purchase extra fill to liven up an older pillow and increase its lifespan. While organic pillows don't off-gas in the typical sense, many new organic pillows do present a mild odor. This is most common with latex, buckwheat, and down pillows. In contrast to synthetic pillows, the odors from these materials shouldn't be bothersome. However, they may provoke allergic reactions in those who are sensitive to the materials inside.
