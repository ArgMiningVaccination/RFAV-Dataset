We also reveal a step-by-step guide for cleansing crystals and explain how cleansing and programming your crystals is believed by some alternative health practitioners to have the potential to support your overall wellness. Let's get started! Introduction Crystals and stones have been popular since ancient times. When we open up the history books, we learn that crystals were used by the ancient Egyptians, Romans, Chinese, Japanese and Indians to encourage healing and enlightenment. Even today, various alternative health practitioners, such as Krista Mitchell, a spiritual teacher and author of the book Change Your Energy: Healing Crystals for Health, Wealth, Love & Luck, claim that crystals have metaphysical properties which can benefit health when used regularly. In particular, various alternative health practitioners believe that crystals and other stones have an impact on energy levels by emitting natural vibrations which help with physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Our [ancient ancestors](https://blog.sivanaspirit.com/ancient-cultures-crystals/) believed that crystals bring energetic changes by interacting with the human electromagnetic field. In particular, it was believed that they form a bridge between your conscious thoughts and your body. It was further believed that these healing crystals had a powerful vibratory effect which facilitates the free flow of energy throughout the body. In this blog post, we discuss the belief of some alternative health practitioners as to the need to cleanse your crystals. We will also discuss the various different methods of cleansing crystals, including the method of cleansing crystals with a singing bowl. We will then set out a step-by-step guide for cleansing crystals with a singing bowl and conclude by explaining how cleansing and programming your crystals is believed by some alternative health practitioners to have the potential to support your overall wellness. Why Crystals Need to be Cleansed A crystal travels from source to seller before landing in your hand. During this journey, a lot of energy can become collected in the crystal. In fact, research conducted by Jyngyu Zhang from the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom UK has demonstrated that [crystals have the ability to store a massive amount of data indefinitely](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2483919/-superman--crystals-could-store-360tb-of-data-forever.html). According to some alternative health practitioners, if you want to start fresh with your new crystal then the first step should be cleansing. This will help restore your crystal to its natural state. Crystals have a strong and unchanging physical structure called a [crystal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure). In particular, crystals are built in a specific geometric pattern without any randomness. Because this geometric pattern is repeated in a crystal structure, crystals can produce a steady vibration which is commonly referred to as the dormant oscillatory rate. It is believed that when a crystal with these characteristics interacts with you, it brings a balance to your energy field which supports your well-being. But, when unwanted excess energy becomes stored in a crystal, the vibration (or the oscillatory rate) of that crystal becomes disturbed. Some alternative health practitioners believe that crystals have the amazing ability to return to their dormant oscillatory rate on their own. However, it is believed that it takes a significant amount of time for a crystal to go back to its original state. By following the methods described below to properly clean your crystals, you can quickly restore your crystals to their dominant state. Some alternative health practitioners also believe that if you are using your stones for any healing then they should be cleansed before and after every healing session. It is believed that healing crystals work on the theory of 'vibrational healing', during which they absorb and release energy. For this reason, it becomes important to remove any built-up negative energy. Put simply, it is believed that crystals work better when they are cleansed regularly. There are many ways to cleanse your crystals. Most of the methods are therapeutic, not only for your crystals, but also potentially for yourself as well. Methods to Cleanse Your Crystals Some alternative health practitioners believe that [crystals can be cleansed](https://www.mineralism.com.au/pages/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals) in a variety of different ways depending on their nature, type and color. For softer stones, you can use sunlight or moonlight. In general, a minimum of four hours of sun exposure is needed to cleanse most crystals, but certain stones can become faded through this method. While moonlight cleansing may therefore be preferred, that generally requires a significant period of time. Similarly, while crystals are sometimes cleansed by washing using water or salt water, this is not suitable for some crystals or stones which may dissolve or disintegrate in water or salt water. One of the best methods for avoiding these and other common problems is cleansing using a sound bath. Each of the methods for cleansing crystals is discussed in more detail below. In general, you should aim to cleanse your crystal at least once per month, and more often if you feel that they have been affected by negative energy. 1. Running Water It is believed that water can be a great neutralizer for all the negative energy which can become inadvertently stored in crystals. Place your crystals directly under tap water or natural rain, or in a stream, for approximately 4 to 5 minutes. This method is believed to be most helpful in cleansing strong stones like quartz, amethyst and turquoise. 2. Sunlight and Moonlight One of the oldest methods of cleansing crystals is to use sun or moon energies. When your crystal becomes a bit dull in appearance or effectiveness, the best way to cleanse it is to return it to natural light. Place the crystal directly under sunlight or moonlight for at least four hours. Sunlight bathing works best with warm-colored crystals like yellow, red and orange crystals. Make sure not to expose them to the sun for a longer period of time, as they may become faded. - For best results, cleanse your crystals during a full moon light or during a cloudless day. - Some crystals respond better to moonlight, but it may be difficult to be certain of this without testing each method and evaluating the results. - Continue the moonlight or sunlight cleansing for three days. - Recharge your crystals using this process once a month. Moonlight cleansing is a delicate method but can be especially effective during a full moon. When the moon is bright with full potential, it can help increase your crystal's vibrational energy. 3. Cleansing with Quartz or Selenite Some alternative health practitioners believe that quartz or selenite has a special ability to purify and cleanse other crystals. This method requires the following approach: - Place your crystals on clear quartz or a selenite charging plate. - You can also place your crystal in a bag with quartz. - Leave them there for six hours, or overnight. It is believed that, after following this method, your crystals will become cleansed of any unwanted energies. 4. Cleansing with Smudging Smudging is an ancient cleansing method used in many cultures to cleanse items, rooms and other things of negative energy. Alternative health practitioners believe that surrounding crystals with smoke and letting the crystals pass through the smoke helps cleanse them. This method, which is believed to work for all kinds of crystals, requires the following approach: - Use a sage stick, sandalwood, cedar, palo santo or frankincense to create smoke. - Allow the sacred smoke to surround your crystals. - Smoke carries low or negative energies away from the crystal, which helps raise the vibrational energy of the crystal. 5. Cleansing with Soil This cleansing method is based on the theory that crystals can be cleansed by returning them to nature. This method is believed to be particularly helpful when a heavy cleansing is required to remove toxic or otherwise negative energies. This method requires the following approach: - Look for a clean place to bury your crystal. - Bury your crystal in the soil just a few inches deep. - Leave your crystal buried for a minimum of 24 hours and for up to three days for best results. Some alternative health practitioners believe that the elements present in the soil will help soak up all the unwanted energy present in the crystal, leaving the crystal restored. 6. Cleansing with Saltwater Some alternative health practitioners believe that saltwater can be a useful vehicle for absorbing unwanted energy. According to this method of cleansing, stones are soaked in saltwater overnight. It is believed to be ideal to use natural seawater for this purpose. Afterwards, rinse your crystals with clean water. Please be warned that saltwater can damage or change the appearance of certain delicate stones, with the result that this method is not suitable for all crystals and stones. 7. Breath Cleansing your crystals by breath is most suitable for crystals that are small in size. According to this method, you need to focus on your intentions and with quick exhalations blow away the negative, unwanted energy. This method requires the following approach: - Hold the crystal in your dominant hand. - Take a deep breath by focusing on your intentions. - Exhale on your crystal firmly with short quick bursts. - Continue this process for approximately 30 seconds. - Allow the stone to dissipate its negative energy. 8. Visualization or Meditation Some alternative health practitioners believe that you can use your own thought processes to cleanse your crystal. While this method is often referred to as the 'visualization' approach, it is also known as the 'meditation approach' given its similarities to meditation. This method requires the following approach: - With a clear mind, hold your crystal in your hands. - Visualize a bright, radiant light surrounding your crystal and passing through it. - Direct your thoughts to impurities flushing out of the stone. - End this process when you feel your crystal has restored its balance. 9. Rice Some alternative health practitioners believe that cleansing with rice is suitable for all types of crystals. In particular, it is believe to be beneficial for soft and protective crystals. For this method: - Bury your crystal in a bowl of brown rice. - Leave it there for approximately 24 hours. - Dispose of the rice after cleansing. 10. Cleansing with Sound If you are looking for a simple way to cleanse your crystals, then doing so with sound can be a great choice. Cleansing crystals with sound is one of the most effective cleansing methods available. Some alternative health practitioners believe that gentle vibration created by a tuning fork or a [singing bowl](https://www.shantibowl.com/) can help [clear negative energy](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/clearing-your-home-of-negative-energy-with-singing-bowls) quickly and effectively. In particular, it is believed that the vibrations created with sound helps break up any stuck negative energy in the crystals, and that the musical frequency of the process restores the harmony of the crystal. In essence, sound sends vibrations into the environment which penetrate the structure of the crystals. This method is particularly useful if you have a large collection of crystals and wish to cleanse them at the same time with minimal labour. You can create cleansing sound in a number of ways. The most popular and effective way is to use a [Tibetan singing bowl](https://www.shantibowl.com/products/tibetan-singing-bowl). While it is open to you to play a recording of a singing bowl, most alternative health practitioners believe that the cleansing will be most effective if used in the presence of a singing bowl. Cleansing Crystals with a Singing Bowl Singing bowls have been used [since ancient times](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/history-of-singing-bowls) for therapy, healing and meditation. They are designed to create a long-lasting and powerful vibration. Healing with sound, also known as sound healing or [sound therapy](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/healing-the-body-with-sound-therapy), is one of the oldest and natural methods of supporting health and well-being. Singing bowls are similar to bells and create a soothing sound which can help quiet your mind. The pure and gentle vibrations created by singing bowls can also help remove the stubborn energy that may become settled in your crystal. Singing bowls are not only used for cleansing crystals but are also used for healing, [meditation](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/meditation-and-singing-bowls) and for creating a sacred place. They use sound to balance the aura and the chakras. They are believed to turn unbalanced negative energy into positive balanced energy. This singing bowl originated from Tibet and developed in connection with Buddhism. Traditionally, Tibetan bowls are handmade in Nepal and India using brass, bronze and seven different metals. In order to produce the best sound, it is essential to use a singing bowl made with an optimal metal ratio that is high in copper and which is formed in the right shape. Tibetan sound bowls are available in different sizes. Tibetan singing bowls are also known as sound bowls, Himalayan singing bowls and meditation bowls. Practitioners believe that the healing sounds produced by Tibetan bowls not only restore crystal energy but can also raise your level of consciousness and support healing. Tibetan healing bowls create sounds that are believed to reach the chakras and energy points of your body. Chakras are the energy centers of your body. Notes of the singing bowl correspond to different chakras of the body and help to maintain [harmony and wellness](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/how-tibetan-singing-bowl-sound-meditation-can-improve-mood-tension-and-well-being). It is for this reason that singing bowls can also be called chakra bowls or chakra singing bowls. Tibetan singing bowls also help to release theta brain waves which are generally observed during deep sleep. The soothing sound creates a deep meditative state in your mind. It helps your mind temporarily distance itself from the busy world around you. Playing one of these sound bowls during meditation can also help to harmoniously return you to the world and keep you grounded. It is believed that when you meditate with a singing bowl your focus is tripled. In addition, when engaging in Tibetan bowl meditation the power of meditation increases with time. It helps keep your mind away from distractions by immersing you in sound. In fact, a study conducted has revealed that meditation with Tibetan singing bowls has significant [beneficial effects on well being, mood and physical pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871151/). When looking for a singing bowl, make sure you keep the following considerations in mind: - A small singing bowl is enough to cleanse small crystals and stones. - Small singing bowls produce a high pitched sound whereas larger ones produce a deep, resonating tone. - The singing bowl should be accompanied by a wooden mallet. - There are many varieties of singing bowls available, like brass singing bowls, [crystal singing bowls](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-crystal-singing-bowls)and [Tibetan singing bowls](https://www.shantibowl.com/collections/all-products/products/tibetan-singing-bowl). Guide To Cleansing Crystals With A Singing Bowl Follow this step-by-step guide to quickly and effectively clean your crystals using a singing bowl. Due to the healing power of singing bowls, this process is also supportive of physical and mental well-being. - Start by spreading a clean piece of cloth on a flat surface or on a table. The area should be clean and clutter-free. - Your crystals should be placed on the cloth surrounding the singing bowl. - Start [playing your singing bowl](https://www.shantibowl.com/blogs/blog/how-to-play-a-singing-bowl). You can do this by striking the singing bowl gently with the mallet to let it emit a ringing sound. - Move your mallet outside the rim of the singing bowl in a clockwise direction to cause it to \"sing\". This process will help perpetuate the ringing sound. - Continue to rub the mallet around the bowl for 5-10 minutes until you sense that the cleansing process is complete. Do not place the crystals inside the bowl, as the high vibration could damage them. If you are using the singing bowl for the first time, then you may need to practice to get comfortable. While buying make sure to choose a quality singing bowl. Good quality singing bowls emit a melodic ringing sound which continues for some time and gradually reduces. Poor quality singing bowls produce a dull metallic sound and will be less effective at cleaning your crystals. An alternative method is to hold the singing bowl in your hand rather than placing it on a table. To apply this method, place your crystals on a flat surface and stand next to them. Put the singing bowl on your non-dormant hand. With the other hand, strike the bowl with a mallet to produce a ringing sound. Firmly rub the outside rim of the singing bowl with the mallet in a clockwise direction. This will continue the ringing sound, which you can stop anytime. Program Your Crystals After cleansing your crystals, you will need to program them. Generally, crystals are neutral and they need direction to properly work for you. If not programmed well, they may amplify the unwanted energies in your life. With effective and clear programming, your crystals can help support your mental and physical health and well-being. - To begin with, first cleanse your crystal using one or more of the methods described above. - Once your crystal is cleansed, place the crystal in your hand and take deep breaths. - Express your faith and connect with your highest vibration. - Ask your crystal to let go of all the unwanted negative energy. - Command the crystal to hold on to your positive intentions and energies. - End the programming process by saying thank-you. Conclusion Whether you are buying a new stone or just looking to maintain an existing one, regular cleansing is important. Using a [singing bowl](https://www.shantibowl.com/) can be a great way to support your meditation practice while also keeping your crystals well cleansed and as vibrant on the inside as they are on the surface.
