This product was identified during an examination of imported goods. FDA laboratory analysis confirmed that Detox Plus contains tadalafil, paynantheine, and mitragynine. Tadalafil is the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Cialis, used to treat erectile dysfunction. This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates. Paynantheine and mitragynine are alkaloids found in the Mitragyna speciosa plant, commonly known as kratom, which grows naturally in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. FDA is concerned that kratom, which affects the same opioid brain receptors as morphine, appears to have properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and dependence. There are no FDA-approved uses for kratom. Health care professionals and patients should report adverse events or side effects related to the use of this product to FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program: - Complete and submit the report online [MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/), or - Download and complete the [form](/media/85598/download?attachment), then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.
