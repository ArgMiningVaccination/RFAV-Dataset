Quitting Smoking: Should I Use Medicine? | | 1 Get the | | 2 Compare | | 3 Your | | 4 Your | | 5 Quiz | | 6 Your Summary Get the facts Your options - Use medicine to help you quit smoking. This may include nicotine replacement products. - Don't use medicine. Key points to remember - Using medicines and nicotine replacement products (patches, gum, lozenges, and inhalers) can double your chances of quitting smoking. [footnote 1](#hw-references)They can relieve nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms. - Getting counselling, along with using medicine, can increase your chances of quitting even more. - If you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, you may not need medicines to help you quit smoking. - It's rare for someone to get addicted to nicotine medicines, because the nicotine is released slowly at low levels into your bloodstream. - Nicotine replacement products may cause some side effects, such as problems with sleep or red and itchy skin with the patch. Medicines in pill form can cause nausea, dry mouth, and trouble sleeping. For most people, the side effects aren't bad enough to make them stop using the medicines. - Nicotine medicines have less than half of the nicotine than cigarettes. And by itself, nicotine is not nearly as harmful as smoking. The tars, carbon monoxide, and other toxic chemicals in tobacco cause the harmful effects. - Some provincial health plans and private health plans will pay for all or part of the cost of medicines used to quit smoking. [What are the medicines?](javascript:void(0)) Your doctor may prescribe varenicline (Champix) or bupropion (Zyban) to help you cope with cravings for tobacco. These medicines are pills that don't contain nicotine. You also can use nicotine replacement products, which do contain nicotine. Medicines that don't have nicotine - Varenicline (Champix) blocks the effects of nicotine and reduces cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](/nicotine-withdrawal). If you start smoking again while you are taking the medicine, you won't feel as satisfied. This improves your chances of quitting. You take it 2 times a day, after meals. You can also take varenicline for 12 more weeks than the other methods for a total of 24 weeks. There are three ways to quit smoking when you take varenicline. These methods are: - Fixed: You will stop smoking after you have taken varenicline for one week. - Flexible: You can pick a date to quit smoking between 8 and 35 days after you start taking varenicline. - Gradual: You cut your smoking in half every 4 weeks until you quit at the end of 12 weeks, or sooner. - Bupropion SR (Zyban) can help balance chemicals in your brain to reduce your withdrawal symptoms. Doctors also prescribe this medicine (under the brand name Wellbutrin) to treat depression. But it can help you stop smoking even if you don't have depression. You start taking bupropion daily about 1 to 2 weeks before you quit smoking. You keep taking it for 7 to 12 weeks after you stop smoking. Nicotine replacement products Nicotine replacement gives your body some nicotine to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Nicotine is addictive. But this treatment has about one-third to one-half the amount of nicotine in most cigarettes. It also delivers the nicotine slowly, so it rarely causes addiction. And these products don't have the harmful tars, carbon monoxide, and other toxic chemicals that are in tobacco. There are several types of nicotine replacement: - Gum and lozenges slowly release nicotine into your mouth. - Patches stick to your skin and slowly release nicotine into your bloodstream. - An inhaler has a holder that contains nicotine. It delivers a puff of nicotine vapour into your mouth and throat. You can buy nicotine gum, inhalers, patches, and lozenges without a prescription. You may be able to use a couple of these products at the same time, such as a patch and gum. But talk to your doctor first to make sure it's okay to mix nicotine medicines. People younger than age 18 can't buy the over-the-counter products, but a doctor may prescribe them. Talk to your doctor if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant and want to stop smoking. If you have a health condition, such as mental illness or heart problems, or if you take medicine for a mental health problem, be sure to talk to your doctor before you use nicotine replacement products. [How well do medicines work?](javascript:void(0)) Medicines can double your chances of quitting. [footnote 1](#hw-references) - Some studies have found that varenicline (Champix) works better than [footnote 2](#hw-references), [footnote 3](#hw-references)But every person is different. So one medicine may work better for you than the other. - All forms of nicotine replacement products work about equally well when used in the right way. [footnote 4](#hw-references) - Your chances of quitting smoking are even better if you combine the patch with lozenges or gum. [What are the risks of using medicine to quit smoking?](javascript:void(0)) Medicines that don't have nicotine The most common side effects of varenicline (Champix) include: - Nausea. - Increased dreaming. - Trouble sleeping. Some people also have side effects such as headaches and dizziness. Champix may be linked with a small increase in risk for heart problems (including heart attack). Call your doctor if you have any cardiovascular disease symptoms that are new or getting worse, such as chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, calf pain when walking, or sudden onset of weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. Some people who take bupropion SR (Zyban) have: - Dry mouth. - Trouble sleeping. There is a small risk of having [seizures](/seizure) when you use bupropion. The risk increases if you have had a head injury or seizures. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take. When you stop smoking, there may be a change in how other medicines work for you. Warnings. Health Canada warns that people who are taking bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Champix) and who experience any serious or unusual changes in mood or behaviour or who feel like hurting themselves or someone else should stop taking the medicine and call a doctor right away. If you already have a mood or behaviour problem, be sure to tell your doctor before you decide to use these medicines. Nicotine replacement products The side effects depend on the type of nicotine replacement product. - Nicotine patches can cause itching and redness where you put the patch. If you use a 24-hour patch, you may have trouble sleeping or have very vivid dreams. This is because your brain isn't used to getting nicotine when you're sleeping. Taking off the patch a few hours before you go to sleep usually helps ease your sleep problems. - Nicotine gum can cause an upset stomach (nausea) or heartburn. Gum is not a good choice for people who have dentures or problems with their jaw joint (TM disorders). - Nicotine lozenges can cause an upset stomach, hiccups, heartburn, and gas. - Nicotine inhalers can cause a cough, a scratchy throat, and an upset stomach. An inhaler may not be a good choice if you have asthma, allergies, or a sinus problem. There is a small chance of addiction with the gum or lozenges. [Why might your doctor recommend that you use medicine?](javascript:void(0)) Your doctor might recommend that you use medicine to stop smoking if: - You have tried on your own to stop smoking but you weren't able to stop. - You smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day.

Personal stories from people who have quit smoking These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. I started smoking when I was in the military. But it is affecting my health, and I want to quit. I've tried the patch, gum, and cold-turkey methods to quit, and they didn't work. So I talked with my doctor about quitting, and he suggested that I try using Champix. He also recommended that I have counselling and join a support group. It's been a little over a month since I started Champix, and so far it is helping with my craving to smoke. Talking in counselling is also helpful. I think I finally am going to be able to quit. Dave, age 42 I thought about taking medicine to quit smoking, but I already take several other medicines for health problems. I just didn't want to take another prescription medicine and take the chance that it might cause problems. So I decided to try the nicotine patch. I set a date and started planning for the physical effects of quitting, like having munchies around and cleaning my car and house. I started with the largest patch available. It was great because the withdrawal symptoms were hardly noticeable. Then I went to the medium patch and finally the smallest patch. Now I don't smoke anymore. Alanna, age 44 I started smoking at 15. I always thought I could quit at any time and had tried to quit dozens of times. But then I'd start craving a smoke, and I'd go back to cigarettes. A few years ago, my doctor suggested I try taking Zyban and nicotine gum. It was great, because between the pills and the gum, the withdrawal symptoms were hardly noticeable. I was done with the gum after the first few weeks, but I ended up staying on the pills for 6 months. But using both worked for me, and I haven't smoked for 2 years. Carlo, age 52 My friends pushed me to quit smoking and suggested I talk to my doctor about getting some medicine to help. But I just wasn't comfortable with the idea of taking medicine. I have a strong will, and when I put my mind to doing something, I can usually do it. So I took my doctor's advice to have professional counselling to help improve my chances of success. I quit smoking\u2014cold turkey\u20145 months ago. All my friends are really surprised that I could quit like that. It has been tough at times fighting the cravings, but it has worked.

The next time I tried some kind of gum. This was in the '70s or '80s, so it was whatever kind of gum was available then, probably not the same as nicotine gum now. I quit smoking for a year that time, but I always craved cigarettes. The third time was right before I turned 60. I used Zyban and the nicotine patch for 6 weeks. I'm amazed at how well it worked. I have had no cravings for cigarettes, even from the very first day when I had my morning coffee.

It didn't work either. Finally, I tried the patch. I started with the largest one available. It was great because the withdrawal symptoms were hardly noticeable.
