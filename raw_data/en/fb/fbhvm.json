We investigated whether the two vaccine components adenovirus (Ad) and MVA could be coinjected as a mixture to enhance protection against malaria. A single-shot mixture at specific ratios of Ad and MVA (Ad+MVA) enhanced CD8+ T cell-dependant protection of mice against challenge with Plasmodium berghei. Moreover, the degree of protection could be enhanced after homologous boosting with the same Ad+MVA mixture to levels comparable with classic het-erologous Ad prime-MVA boost regimes. The mixture increased transgene-specific responses while decreas-ing the CD8+ T cell antivector immunity compared to each vector used alone, particularly against the MVA backbone. Mixed vector immunization led to increased early circulating interferon- (IFN-) response levels and altered transcriptional microarray profiles. Further-more, we found that sequential immunizations with the Ad+MVA mixture led to consistent boosting of the transgene-specific CD8+ response for up to three mixture immunizations, whereas each vector used alone elicited progressively lower responses. Our findings offer the possibility of simplifying the deployment of viral vectors as a single mixture product rather than in heterologous prime-boost regimens. Received 19 September 2011; accepted 24 January 2012; advance online publication 21 February 2012. doi:10.1038/mt.2012.25 IntroductIon Genetically modified human adenoviruses (Ad) and poxviruses are leading vaccine platforms in the development of prophylactic vaccines against infection by many pathogens, in particular where T-cell responses are protective (e.g., malaria, HIV , hepatitis, and influenza viruses). 1 Unfortunately, the concomitant induction of vector-specific immune responses can result in a lack of prolonged expression of newly delivered genes upon readministration of the same vector after short time intervals. 2 This has prompted the development of new viral vector platforms or alternative serotypes of Ad, in particular of chimpanzee origin, which would allow repeated use of different vectors for either the same disease (as a boost), or for another disease in the same population. 1 In practi- cal terms however, repeated boosting with the same vector could greatly facilitate the potential deployment of a vaccine, providing less expensive manufacture and administration compared with heterologous prime-boost immunization which requires different vectors encoding the same transgene to de be administered at dif- ferent time points. In addition, there is still a need to improve the protective efficacy achieved by Ad- and poxvirus-based vaccines. In the context of malaria, protection against liver-stage relies on the induction of high frequencies of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells producing interferon- (IFN-). 3 T-cell responses can effectively be induced by immunization with viral vectors such as fowlpox 9, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MV A), and Ad. 4-7 However, we have previously shown that a single administration of Ad and pox-viral vectors provides suboptimal protection to animals against a malaria sporozoite challenge, while prime-boost regimens using adenoviral vectors and MV A encoding the pre-erythrocytic ME.TRAP transgene enhanced both short- and long-term ster - ile protection against malaria. 8 These data highlighted the ability of optimized viral vector prime-boost regimens to generate more protective and sustained CD8+ T-cell responses. Nevertheless, the levels of efficacy attained in clinical trials with Ad prime\u2014MV A boost vaccine regimes encoding ME.TRAP are probably still insufficient for deployment of this single antigen vaccine on its own. 9 Therefore, increasing Ad and MV A vaccine-induced immu- nogenicity and efficacy remains a major goal. In this context, we have previously observed that MV A can act as an adjuvant for a coadministered protein.10 We demonstrated that repeated immunizations with recombinant or nonrecombinant MV A mixed with recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen induced higher titers of antibodies compared to immunization with either antigen alone or to formulations of the alum- adjuvanted Engerix-B vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK). The pox-viruses NYV AC, fowlpox, and ALV AC, and to a lesser extent, Ad, also displayed similar adjuvant properties when used in combina- tion with recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.

Therefore, combinations of par - tially effective vaccines may offer a more rapid route to achieving high efficacy than individual vaccine strategies. 11 In this study, we immunized mice with either simian or human Ad vectors mixed with MV A (Ad+MV A) coding for the pre-erythrocytic-stage malaria antigen ME.TRAP , a transgene that has been used in clinical trials, containing the TRAP antigen from Plasmodium falciparum fused in-frame to a multiepitope (ME) string with multiple known as Pb9 (SYIPSAEKI).12 We observed that specific ratios of Ad+MV A mixture enhanced CD8+-dependant protection of mice against a stringent sporozoite challenge with P . berghei, after single-shot and homologous prime-boost regimes, and report initial analyses of the underlying mechanisms. results Mixed Ad+MVA vector immunization enhances cd8+ t cell-mediated protection as compared to each vector alone We explored whether the immunization with Ad and MV A mixed in the same formulation could enhance the protective efficacy over a single vector immunization. We used a mouse malaria model that relies on the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ cells to mediate protection, 13 to this end, mice were vaccinated in the ear pinna with increasing doses of either AdC9 chimpanzee Ad or MV A alone, or with Ad+MV A mixtures, and challenged the mice two weeks later with P . berghei sporozoites (short-term protection). We noted that intermediate doses of Ad [5 \u00d7 109 viral particles (vp)] and MV A [0.1-1 \u00d7 106 plaque-forming unit (pfu)] appeared to elicit higher protection against the sporozoite challenge (55.6-61.3%, Figure 1a). Interestingly, the effect was dose specific and neither high nor low doses of mixed Ad+MV A elicited good protective levels (typically 0-33%, n = 6) (Figure 1a). Two vector mixtures at intermediate doses of AdC9 (5 \u00d7 10 9 vp) and MV A (1 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 106) were the most protective and the optimal dose of MV A (1 \u00d7 106 pfu) was chosen for the following experiments based on protective efficacy and immunogenicity, which elicited the high-est frequencies of CD8+IFN-+ with increased levels of IFN- on a per cell basis (integrated median fluorescence intensity) and enhanced multifunctionality (Figure 1b-d). To further extend our observations to other adenoviral sero- types and determine that any effect of a vector mixture immuniza- tion is not limited to a specific vector (v.gr. AdC9), we investigated this result in more detail using the clinically deployed adenovi-ral serotype, ChAd63 administered intramuscularly (Figure 2). The mixed ChAd63+MV A regime induced complete short-term sterile protection in two independent experiments while ChAd63 alone protected only 33% of the mice [hazard ratio of 17.73 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.365-93.38) P = 0.0007], and MV A 0% [hazard 95% CI (0.001892-0.1076) P < 0.0001] (Figure 2a).To investigate further the effect of the partially protective ChAd63 regime relative to the fully protective mixture regime, we used luciferase transgenic P . berghei parasites to quantify the parasite burden in the liver using an in vivo imaging system, in what we believe to be the first report of a malaria vaccine efficacy study using an in vivo imaging system method. We observed, in agreement with the results obtained from the parasite counts in blood, that the parasite burden in the liver appeared to be lower in the ChAd63+MV A group than in the ChAd63 or naive groups, although the differences were not quite statistically significant [mean for ChAd63 = 235,850 relative light unit, ChAd63+MV A = 122,367 relative light unit, 95% CI (10,197 to 237,164), P = 0.06 by a t-test] (Figure 2b,c). Altogether, these results demonstrated a superior ability of vector mixtures to reduce the hepatic parasite burden and an ability to induce high levels of sterile protection against stringent liver-stage malaria challenges as compared to each vector alone. Protection by Ad+MVA mixed vector vaccination can be enhanced in prime-boost regimes We have previously reported that a single immunization with adenoviral vectors can induce short-term protection,13 which can be enhanced upon vaccination with a heterologous viral vector expressing the same transgene. 8 We therefore assessed the protec- tive ability of the Ad+MV A regime both shortly and long after a single vaccination and compared this to the best regime identified so far, Ad prime-MV A boost. For this experiment, BALB/c mice (n = 6 per group) were primed with AdC9, MV A or a mixture of both vectors (AdC9+MV A) and an additional homologous or heterologous vaccination was administered at week 8. For the het- erologous prime-boost regime using the Ad+MV A mixture, we used AdC7 as an alternative serotype for the boost with the aim to determine if the Ad+MV A regimes require the use of heterologous vaccination to enhance efficacy and immunogenicity. Sporozoite challenge was administered 2 (short-term) or 8 (long-term) weeks after receiving the last vaccination (a study design we have previ-ously described). 8 Another group was immunized once only with the AdC9+MV A mixture at the time of the boost and challenged 2 or 8 weeks postinjection along with the other groups (Figure 3a). Short-term protection, 2 weeks after the last vaccination, revealed that a single dose of Ad+MV A mixture elicited similar protec-tive levels as the AdC9-MV A prime-boost (43%, Figure 3b). In addition, protection was even higher than AdC9-MV A shortly after mice were vaccinated twice with the homologous mixture AdC9+MV A\u2014AdC9+MV A [86% protection, hazard ratio 3.638, 95% CI (0.4627-28.6) P = 0.22]. Sterile protection was induced using the heterologous mixture AdC9+MV A\u2014AdC7+MV A [100%, hazard ratio 9.461, 0.059 compared to AdC9-MV A] (Figure 3b). In a sporozoite challenge performed 8 weeks after last injection (long-term protection), a single vaccination with AdC9+MVA mixture did not induce any protection. However, a homologous AdC9+MV A prime\u2014boost performed similarly to the heterologous AdC9 prime\u2014MVA boost (71 versus 57%, respectively, P = 0.62, Figure 3c). Long-term complete sterile protection was achieved only in the group immunized twice with mixture vaccines (AdC9+MV A\u2014AdC7+MV A hazard Molecular Therapy vol. 20 no. 8 aug. 2012 1635\u00a9 The American Society of Gene & Cell TherapyAdenovirus and MVA Mixed Vector Immunization Figure 1 enhanced protection by an adenovirus (Adc9) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector mixture (Ad+MVA) vaccine intra- dermally as compared to each vector alone in a Plasmodium berghei malaria pre-erythrocytic challenge. (a) Dose-escalation study to assess the protective efficacy of various ratios of Ad+MVA vaccine. BALB/c mice received a single immunization with viral vectors alone or as a mixture at increas- ing doses and modified ratios of viruses. Two weeks later, all mice were challenged by i.v. injection of 1,000 Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and screened from day 5 to 20 for presence of parasites in blood using Giemsa-stained smears. Outcome was measured as presence or absence (sterile protection) of parasites in blood. Experiments were performed once with the exception of the MVA group alone and the middle dose of adenovirus (5 \u00d7 10 9 viral particles (vp)) that elicited better protection for which these groups were assessed three to five times in independent experiments (n = 6-7/group). Experiments yielded similar results and data was pooled. Statistical analysis was performed by comparing every immunized group to the naive animals.

We next assessed the effect of repeated administration of the same mixture on CD8+ T-cell responses to the protective Pb9 epitope (Figure 4a). A single immunization with AdC9+MV A induced similar frequencies of IFN--secreting CD8+ T cells 18,708 15,414 spot- forming units/106 PBMC) which were significantly higher than frequencies induced by MV A (1,158 spot-forming units/106 PBMC, P < 0.001). A second homologous immunization with AdC9+MV A significantly enhanced the CD8+IFN-+ frequencies (mean 80,214/106 PBMC) compared to AdC9 (mean 42,671/106 PBMC, P and MV A (mean 23,983 spot-forming units/106 PBMC P < 0.001). Surprisingly, a third immuniza- tion with AdC9+MV A further increased the CD8+ responses 180,847/106 PBMC (Figure 4a). A fourth homologous vaccina- tion was still able to boost the memory CD8+ responses but they did not surpass the frequencies that were reached in the peak following the third immunization. While it is well known that pre-exposure to Ad (naturally or through a vaccine) can mark- edly impair the immunogenicity of a subsequent Ad vector, 2 our results suggest that this may not be the case with the Ad+MV A mixture. We further assessed if the vector mixture immuniza- tion requires expression of the same transgene by both viruses or whether MV A can adjuvant the Ad-induced responses despite expressing an irrelevant transgene. Optimal immunogenicity was elicited when both, Ad and MV A expressed the same trans- gene (ME.TRAP). Nevertheless, CD8+ responses where signifi- cantly lower when MV A expressed an irrelevant transgene (lacz) (Figure 4b). We further confirmed this observation in an addi- tional independent experiment where Ad+MV A vector mixtures expressed different transgenes (ME.TRAP from P . falciparum and Ag 85A tuberculosis) (Figure 4c-e). Again, CD8+ responses were optimal when both vectors expressed the same transgene (AdH5+MV A) ME.TRAP (Figure 4c) or nodominant CD4+ epitope in 85A revealed that frequency of these cells is enhanced when both vectors express the same Ag 85A transgene (Figure 4e). Mechanisms behind the Ad+MVA mixed vector immunization: kinetics of transgene expression and antivector immunity We sought to understand how the mixture regime might achieve the potent protective effects demonstrated. The action of the two viruses used differs markedly. For example, studying the in vitro kinetics of the expression of a GFP transgene in permis- sive cells after Ad or MV A infection, MV A induced a rapid trans- gene expression that peaked at 5-6 hours, while Ad transgene expression reached a maximum after 18-20 hours (Figure 5a). Induction of T cells in vivo also differs, perhaps due to different antigen expression kinetics: transgene-specific CD8+ T-cells peak at 1 week after MV A vaccination, while adenoviral vectors induce a delayed CD8+ response that peaks at 3 weeks post-prime. 14 A prime-boost regime might be expected to enhance the T-cell immune responses against the shared antigen (here the transgene) at the expense of the nonshared antigens (here the viral vectors backbone). 15 Thus, in Ad+MV A mixed immunization, T cell responses to the ME.TRAP transgene might be expected to be privileged (dominant as well as subdominant responses) while the antivector T-cell immunity would decrease as compared to single vector immunization. Therefore, we assessed the transgene-specific responses against the dominant Pb9 epitope located in the N-terminal region of our transgene (the ME string) as well as the subdominant T-cell epitopes located in the C-terminal region, TRAP . We observed that Pb9 responses were higher after Ad+MV A mixture immunization as compared to single Ad and Time (weeks) 2 48 10 16 0Vaccine 1 (pr ime) AdC9+MV A AdC9Vaccine 1 (pr ime) AdC9+MVA or Vaccine 2 (boost) AdC7+MVA AdC9+MVA MVASporoz oite challenge 0 100 80 60 40Percent sur vival 20 05 10 15 20 Time05 10 15 2016 weeks (8 weeks post-boost)Sporoz oite challenge (8 weeks post-boost)a b c Figure 3 Protective efficacy elicited by prime-boost vaccination with Ad+MVA vector mixtures in a Plasmodium berghei sporozo- ite challenge.

Ad+MVA mixture decreases cd8+ t-cell responses to the MVA vector We further investigated whether the mixture-induced increases in the transgene-specific response are accompanied by a decrease of vector-specific CD8+ responses. To this end, we constructed an Ad vector expressing a dominant MV A CD8+ epitope (E3, coded by the gene E3L) and primed groups of mice with AdHu5-E3L, or an Ad expressing a strong CD8+ epitope Pb9 (AdHu5-TIP). Unprimed mice acted as controls. The mice were then boosted 8 weeks later with MV A-TIP (expressing the major MV A CD8+ T-cell epitopes E3L and F2G, as well as responses against the three epitopes Pb9 (H-2K d), E3 (Dd), and F2G (Ld)16 were quantified. As expected, we observed that when mice were primed and boosted with the vectors encoding the same Pb9 transgene, strong responses were focused toward the shared Pb9 antigens at the expense of the nonshared MV A epitopes (E3 and F2G) (Figure 5d), which were decreased as compared to unprimed mice. When mice were primed with an Ad encoding E3L and then boosted with MV A-TIP , the response to the shared epitope E3 was strongly favored, at the expense of the Pb9 epitope (which was drastically decreased as compared to unprimed mice, Figure 5d) or the F2G epitope contained in MV A but absent in the Ad-E3L prime. These results confirm and extend to MV A the observations in Ad from Schirmbeck et al. 15 that CD8+ responses to the vector and trans- gene compete with each other, and demonstrate as expected that indeed a prime\u2014boost regime typically favors CD8+ response to shared epitopes between prime and boost, whether it is in the transgene or in the vector backbone. To further confirm decreased antivector immunity, we assessed the CD8+ responses directed against both Ad and MV A in the vector mixture by using major CD8+ epitopes described for each vector. Measuring anti-Ad immunity in an experiment required the use of AdH5 as epitopes in BALB/c mice have been described for this particular serotype. 15 For MV A these were F2G (Ld), E3 (Dd), and C6S (H-2Kd) (Figure 5e). We demonstrated that as soon as 1 week after immunization, anti-MV A CD8+ T-cell responses were significantly lower in the Ad+MV A mixture than in the MV A groups for the three dominant epitopes (Figure 5e). Moreover, this decreased anti-MV A CD8+ response was observed at all time points tested, 1 and 2 weeks after 1, 2, or even 3 injections (data not shown). The CD8+ response to Ad however was only margin- ally decreased for the Ld-restricted epitope dbp7 (located in the DNA-binding protein), while no decrease was observed against the H-2Kd-restricted hex3 (hexon) epitope.15 The latter may not be surprising, however, because the Ad preparation contains free hexon particles, detected by the immune system before any expression from the virus occurs. Additionally, we confirmed that the antivector immunity decreases when both Ad and MV A are injected as a mixture by pre-exposing BALB/c mice to Ad, MV A or Ad+MV A express- ing an irrelevant transgene (Ag 85A). Four weeks after the ini- tial exposure to viral vectors, all groups were immunized with Ad+MV A expressing ME.TRAP and the transgene-specific Pb9 responses were assessed (Figure 5f). As compared to a control group (no pre-exposure followed by Ad+MV A, mean of 17,108 SFC/million PBMCs), Pb9-specific responses showed a nonsig- nificant trend mice pre-exposed to MV A-85A (mean 14,294 SFC/million PBMCs. P = 0.25) and a significant reduction when pre-exposed to Ad 85A (mean 9,096 SFC/million PBMCs, P = 0.009). By contrast, Pb9 responses were not reduced in mice injected initially with an Ad+MV A Ag85A mixture (mean of 16,686 IFN- SFC/million PBMCs, P = 0.88). We also assessed the effect Ad+MV A mixed immunization on the generation of neutralizing antibodies against AdHu5 (Figure 5g). We observed that sera from mice immunized with Ad+MV A contained similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Ad vectors to those from immunized with Ad and similar titers of antibodies against the TRAP transgene in Ad and Ad+MV A immunized mice, both after priming (Figure 5h) and after four consecutive homologous immunizations (data not shown), indicating that the vector mix- ture reduces the anti-Ad immunity by decreasing the vector-spe- cific CD8+ responses rather than the antibodies directed toward the external parts of the Ad. Finally, we investigated whether both vectors could also be administered in separate sites (coadmin-istration) to enhance immune responses in a similar way to the vector mixture (Figure 5i). We observed that coadministration of Ad and MV A (without physically mixing them) significantly enhanced the antigen-specific CD8+ frequencies after a homolo- gous prime-boost regime when compared to a single priming immunization (mean after prime = 9.0%; boost = 21.7%, 95% CI (-21.58 to -3.748), P < 0.001). Significant enhancement was also induced by the vector mixture (physically mixed and admin-istered in the same site) in a homologous immunization (mean after prime = 9.7%; boost = 24.2%, 95% CI (-23.41 to -5.574) P < 0.0001). Increase in immunogenicity by homologous AdH5 (mean after prime = 11.2%; boost = 18.5%, 95% CI (-16.18 to 1.655)) or MV A (mean after prime = 2.2%; boost = 6.9%, 95% CI (-13.63 to 4.201)) was not significant. Ad+MVA vaccination does not influence the cd8+ t central memory responses We further explored whether the enhanced proliferative ability of CD8+ T cells elicited by homologous Ad+MV A prime-boost was related to a preferential T central memory (T CM) phenotype induc- tion. It has been shown that CD8+ TCM cells (CD62L+CD127+) have a high proliferative capacity, whereas TEM (CD62L-CD127+) are more limited and no proliferation is possible by TE (CD62L- CD127-) cells.17 We have previously demonstrated that MV A induces a preferential and accelerated CD8+ TCM phenotype on antigen-specific cells, which contrasts with a marked TE/EM pheno- type induced by Ad.14 This led us to hypothesize that an Ad+MV A vaccine mixture could skew the TE/TEM/TCM population as com- pared to Ad alone. We immunized BALB/c mice with MV A, AdH5 and AdH5+MV A regimes and assessed the CD8+ memory pheno- type of Pb9-specific cells 60 days later using a Pb9 tetramer and costaining with anti-CD62L and CD127. Our results indicated that the Ad5+MV A mixture does not enhance CD8+ T CM but rather resemble the profile obtained with AdH5 (Figure 6a). Therefore the increased CD8+ proliferation seen in Ad+MV A regimes 1640 www.moleculartherapy.org vol. 20 no. 8 aug. 2012\u00a9 The American Society of Gene & Cell TherapyAdenovirus and MVA Mixed Vector Immunization cannot be attributed to enhanced TCM responses. Interestingly, in the same analysis we detected that there was a high proportion of CD8+ TEM responses elicited by Ad+MV A immunization, which was only significant when compared to MV A (mean of 82.1% for AdH5+MV A; and 64.43 for MV A; P < 0.01) (Figure 6b). This result was of particular interest as we have recently demonstrated that the T EM phenotype mediates protection in a mouse malaria model.14 effect of the Ad+MVA immunization on innate immune responses We explored whether a vaccine consisting of a mixture of two viral vectors (Ad+MV A) modifies innate immunity, perhaps altering dendritic cell (DC) maturation. BALB/c mice were immunized with MV A ME.TRAP , the chimpanzee Ad AdC9 ME.TRAP , or a vector mixture containing AdC9+MV A as a single preparation. To determine directly the degree of in vivo DC activation, we assessed the upregulation of two canonical costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in DCs (CD11c+) from draining lymph nodes 18 hours after immunization (Figure 7). In agreement with a previous report, MV A alone was shown to induce moderate in vivo DC activation.18 MV A induced elevated levels of CD86 expression that was comparable to 10 \u00b5g lipopolysaccharide however, there was no significant increase in CD80 expression between MV A stimulated and naive. Conversely, Ad and Ad+MV A groups were more immu- nostimulatory than 10 and CD80 and CD86 expression (Figure 7a-c). Results here demonstrate that Ad is more potent than MV A in stimulating innate immune response in vivo . Importantly, the addition of MV A to Ad does not dampen the DC stimulating properties of the latter. A further analysis of the innate responses was performed using a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay (BD cytometric bead array) proinflam- matory and IL-12p70 24 hours after intradermal immunization.

This threefold increase in circulating levels of IFN- was not due to an additive effect by both viruses present in the same vaccine as this would have resulted in only a 1.24-fold increase of the AdC9-induced IFN- (17.18 pg/ml, 13.8 pg/ ml by Ad plus 3.38 pg/ml by MV A, would be the expected additive value as opposed to the 40.8 measured). Similarly, higher levels of MCP-1 were induced by AdC9+MV A as compared to the vectors alone but this was only significantly higher than MV A (mean of 107.8 pg/ml for AdC9+MV A, compared to 85.5 pg/ml for and 41.3 pg/ml for MV < 0.0001) (Figure 7e). Both AdC9 and AdC9+MV A vaccines induced the highest levels of circulating TNF but no significant differences were detected for any of the regimes (Figure 7f). Monitoring of additional cytokines showed that neither IL-6, IL-12p70, nor IL-10 were induced preferentially by any vaccine (data not shown). Microarray analysis of gene expression following vaccination with viral vectors To further investigate potential innate pathways underlying the observed effects of vaccination with the Ad+MV A mixture, we carried out a gene expression analysis using whole mouse genome microarrays (GEO accession number GSE30564). Multiple groups of 4 mice were vaccinated intradermally into both ears with either Ad, MV A or Ad+MV A mixture. Ear biopsies (vaccination site) or draining cervical lymph nodes were collected at several time points (6 hours and 24 hours for ear biopsies; 9 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours for lymph nodes). Differential gene expression assess-ment was carried out between each treatment/time-point and the corresponding samples from nonvaccinated animals (Figure 8). At the site of vaccination, we observed a striking increase in the number of differentially expressed genes with time: in a per-gene analysis, 6 hours after vaccination fewer than 50 genes were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) up- or downregulated in the biopsies from mice vaccinated with Ad or MV A and no differentially regu- lated genes were found in the mice vaccinated with the mixture (Figure 8a) suggesting that their coadministration impacted on their individual behavior. At 24 hours postvaccination, over a hundred genes were signifi- cantly differentially expressed as a result of immunization with Ad, and several-fold more in the mice vaccinated with MV A and the mixture (Figure 8a). Top 20 genes upregulated at the site of vaccina- tion in response to the Ad+MV A mixture were also upregulated by individual Ad or MV A vaccination and the majority were immune response-related (e.g., chemokine ligands, lipocalin), or IFN type I and induced proteins such as guanylate-binding protein, IFN--induced GTPase, IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats. In ear biopsy samples from animals injected with MV A or the Ad+MV A mixture, but not with Ad alone, the two highest upregulated genes were keratin and stefin, which are involved in epi-thelial proliferation and development. A heat-map representation of all genes up- and downregulated in the ear biopsies by at least three-fold and reaching the adjusted P value of 0.01 illustrates the similari- ties of the gene expression patterns induced by the Ad+MV A mixed vaccine to one or both of the Ad and MV A vaccines. The heat-map revealed that only a few genes are differentially upregulated by the mixture compared to the individual vectors, for instance, S100a8 at 6 hours and Fcrl3, Ly6c, Psmb10, and Usp18 at 24 hours. The earliest time-point analyzed for the lymph nodes, 9 hours postvaccination, showed a few thousand significantly up-and Figure 5 effect of the Ad+MVA vector mixture on the shared and nonshared transgenic protein and antivector immunity. (a) Kinetics of in vitro infection by ChAd63-GFP (Ad) and MVA-GFP vectors. Confluent 293 cells (Ad) or BHK cells (modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)) were infected with one infectious unit (Ad) or plaque-forming unit (MVA) per cell of virus in duplicate in black-wall 96-well plates, which were immediately placed at 37 \u00b0C + 5%CO2 in a BMG Fluostar fluorimeter for measurement of GFP fluorescence every 6 minutes for 36 hours.

Six animals per group were assessed against all peptides, and the weight of the lines is proportional to the intensity of the response as follows: 0-100 versus Ad, P = 0.0003, Ad+MVA MVA, P = 0.0000. (d) Prior immunization with adenovirus expressing immunodominant T cell antigens suppresses responses to mice. BALB/c mice were immunized intrader-mally 10 vp AdHu5 expressing epitope string containing Pb9-; the vaccinia virus gene E3L; or lacking a transgenic open-reading frame (empty); or were not primed. Eight weeks later, all mice were boosted i.d. with 106 plaque-forming unit (pfu) of MVA-METRAP E3 and F2(G) T cell epitopes were measured by interferon (IFN)- ELIspot using stimulation with the relevant synthetic peptides.

The number of significantly differentially expressed genes remained high at 24 hours postvaccination but had declined by 72 hours (Figure 8b). The highest 30 upregulated genes (P < 0.01) at 9 hours and 24 hours postvaccination were found to be identi- cal between Ad, MV A and Ad+MV A mixture, with the majority being type I and II IFNs, IFN-regulated genes and chemokine ligands. At 72 hours postvaccination, the most upregulated genes were still shared by the three vaccines, although most of the viral infection response elements were substituted by genes involved in DNA replication, cell proliferation and differentia-tion, and protein translation. A heat-map representation of all genes up- (red) and downreg- ulated (green) in the lymph nodes by at least threefold and reach-ing the adjusted P value of 0.01 also illustrates the similarities of the gene expression patterns induced by the Ad+MV A mixed vac-cine to one or both of the Ad and MV A vaccines. It can be noted however, that the Ad+MV A mixture at 9 hours postvaccination results in a lower level of gene downregulation overall, compared to Ad and MV A alone. In addition, at 72 hours postimmuniza-tion we found a threefold up regulation of molecules involved in host defense, in particular CCL3, CCL12, CXCL1, CCL4, CXCL9, that the coadmin- istration of Ad and MV A modified their rate of immune activa-tion, although no specific pathway was identified in the analyses performed.dIscussIon Viral-vectored vaccines represent one of the most promising vac- cination approaches for some infectious diseases where a preventa-tive vaccine still remains to be developed. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using MV A as a tuberculosis vac- cine, 19 and efficacy has been demonstrated in trials for HIV using a canarypox vector as part of a prime-boost regime;20 in malaria trials using fowlpox 9, MV A21 and chimpanzee Ad as a pre- erythrocytic malaria vaccine (K.J. Ewer, G.A. O'Hara, C.J.A. Duncan, S.H. Sheehy, A. Reyes-Sandoval et al., manuscript submit- ted). The use of viral vectors as vaccines has required heterologous prime-boost strategies to maximize immunogenicity and efficacy.21 In an attempt to enhance their efficacy while potentially simplify-ing the logistics of vaccine delivery, we assessed the effect on the immune response of the administration of mixed Ad and MV A, two of the most clinically advanced viral vectors, delivered as part of the same formulation. We explored the effects of the vector mixture on the adaptive immune responses. We chose a mouse malaria model where a pre-erythrocytic vaccine has shown the induction of protective CD8+ T-cell responses and for which we have a challenge model. 8,13 Our results indicated that intermediate doses for both vectors (5 \u00d7 109 vp for Ad and 1 \u00d7 106 pfu for MV A) elicited optimal immunoge- nicity and protection. We initially reasoned that higher doses of the vector mixture (1 \u00d7 10 10 vp of Ad and 1 \u00d7 107 pfu of MV A) could enhance efficacy but a detrimental effect was observed for 105 104 103 102 102 103 104 1050 0<Pacific b Ad+MV A 40 30 20 10 0% CD8 Tcm90 80 70 60 50% cd8+ memory responses induced by an Ad+MVA vector mixture immunization.

This result is in agreement with a recent report from Y ashima et al. where high doses of Ad (1010 vp) and MV A (107 pfu) were coadministered and a suppres- sion of the antigen-specific CD8+ T cells was observed.22 One of the major hurdles to overcome in viral vector vac- cination is the dampening effect of the antivector immunity on the antigen-specific T-cell responses. Natural infections with Ad induce neutralizing antibodies that limit the virus transduction, protein expression and therefore decrease the transgene-specific T-cell responses. 23 Moreover, priming with a recombinant adeno- viral vector prevents further expansion of T-cell responses by a subsequent homologous boost, reducing at the same time the breadth of the T-cell responses and limiting their ability to con- trol an infection. 24 This has prompted the scientific community to develop novel immunization regimes using alternative adenoviral serotypes that do not circulate in human populations. 8,24 Additionally, multiple approaches have been developed to cir - cumvent the antivector responses elicited by natural exposure or vaccination. These include relatively simple tools such as the use of heterologous prime-boost to efficiently amplify the immune responses. 25,26 and more sophisticated approaches that combine modern immunology and structural biology techniques to re- engineer an adenoviral vector with modified hypervariable regions of the hexon thus helping the chimeric virus evade the antivec- tor immunity. 27 The spectrum of developments also includes the chemical modification of viral surface proteins to mask the neu-tralizing epitopes 28 and the use of vectors engineered from rare or alternative serotypes.13,24 Most, if not all of these approaches aim at modifying one particular vector at a time, while the vector mixture described here would facilitate the use of one vector multiple times as well as the application as a heterologous mixed prime-boost regime, which in the case of the AdC9+MV A-prime followed by an AdC7+MV A-boost was found to be the most protective vaccina- tion regime that nevertheless presents increased difficulties in pro- duction and delivery that may counteract the modestly superior performance compared to the homologous mixed vaccine.

Previous reports have shown both stimulation and maturation of DCs by both chimpanzee (AdC68) and human Ad (AdH5) in vitro and in vivo . 29 Effects of MV A on DCs are controversial, with some reports describing a stimula-tory effect 18,30 while others observing an inhibitory effect.31-33 In this report, we show that MV A was able to marginally upregu- late the costimulatory molecules of DCs, while AdC9 appeared to be a stronger DC stimulant in vivo . Furthermore, the addition of MV A to AdC9 did not dampen the stimulatory properties of the latter; indeed, there were differences in early responses sys- temically, as evidenced by significantly higher levels of IFN- in Ad and MV A (Ad+MV A)-treated animals relative to single agent treated animals.We attempted to further understand specific pathway(s) induced by the mixture using transcriptional studies on tissues from the immunization site, or the lymph nodes draining it. One finding was of a threefold upregulation of a group of chemotac-tic molecules (CCL3, CCL12, CXCL1, CCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10) compared to vectors. group of molecules, in particu- lar CCL3 and CCL4, have been shown to enhance immunity by attracting CD8+ T cells to the sites where antigen-presenting and CD4+ T cells interact in lymph nodes. 34 Moreover, blocking CCL3 and CCL4 activity reduces the recruitment of naive CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes and decreases the ability to promote CD8+ T cell generation.34 Of interest, chemokines such as CCL4 (MIP 1-) have been using as genetic adjuvants and have shown to enhance 100 806hours 24hours 24h 72h 9h 60 40 20 0 60Number of genes Number of genesAdC9 versus naive1,500 1,000 500 0 1,000 500 01,500 1,000 500 0 420 24 9 hours 24 hours 6 hoursAdC9 v ersus naive MVA versus naive AdC9+M VA versus nai ve AdC9 v ersus naive MVA versus naive AdC9+M VA versus nai ve AdC9 v ersus Naive MVA versus Naive AdC9+M VA versus Naive AdC9 v ersus Naive MVA versus Naive AdC9+M VA versus Naive AdC9 v ersus Naive MVA versus naiveAdC9 versus naive MVA versus naive AdC9+MV A versus naive40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.10 024 Value2 0 24 6 Log2 Fo ld change Log2 fo ld change2 02 4 6 Color key and density PIDensity 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 -5 5 ValueColor key and density PIDensitya cdb Figure 8 Microarray analysis in ear and lymph node samples after immunization with an Adc9+MVA vector mixture.

In conclusion, Ad and MV A viral vectors can be adminis- tered as a mixture to enhance protection against pre-erythrocytic malaria in a model that relies on the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ responses to confer protection. The Ad+MV A mixed vec- tor immunization acts as formulation that provides an \"internal\" prime-boost to enhance the CD8+ responses directed toward the shared transgenic antigens at the expense of the nonshared antigens from both vectors to significantly decrease the antivec- tor immunity. This effect permits repeated readministration of the vector mixture as a homologous prime-boost regimen, reducing the potential problem of antivector immunity and offering simpli- fied deployment as a single product rather than as heterologous prime-boost regimens. MAterIAls And Methods Mice and immunizations. Female BALB/c mice 6 weeks of age were pur - chased from Harlan, Shardlow, UK. Viral vectors were administered intra- dermally into ear pinnae or intramuscularly in the gastrocnemius muscle by delivering a final volume of 25 \u00b5l per limb or ear (50 \u00b5l total volume per mouse). The concentration of viral vectors in endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma, Dorset, UK) was 1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/50 \u00b5l for MV A and 5 \u00d7 109 vp/50 \u00b5l for adenoviral (Ad) vectors, unless where specified otherwise (Figure 1). For all other experiments, Ad+MV A vector mixtures consisted of a single preparation containing both vectors at the same concentrations as the vector control (1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu for MV A plus 5 \u00d7 109 vp for Ad in 50 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline). Ethics statement. All animals and procedures were used in strict accor - dance with the terms of the UK Home Office Animals Act law. Procedures were approved by the University of Oxford Animal Care and Ethical Review Committee (PPL 30/2414). Immunizations were performed under anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering and reduce ani- mal numbers. Viral vectors. Vectors expressing the transgene ME.TRAP ,12,36 Pb9, and GFP37 have been described previously. The insert ME.TRAP is a hybrid transgene of 2,398 bp encoding a protein of 789 amino acids. The ME string contains the BALB/c H-2Kd epitope Pb9 (CS252-260, SYIPSAEKI) from malaria CS protein among a number of B- and T-cell ME.TRAP were constructed and propagated as described previously.6,12,39 Design and construction of Ad and MV A vectors express- ing the M. tuberculosis Ag 85A has been described earlier.40-42 AdHu5 expressed the E3 protein after cloning the E3L open-reading frame of MV A under control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was derived and prepared as previously described.13,42 ex vivo IFN ELISPOT. Isolated splenocytes or PBMCs were treated with ACK to remove red blood cells and then cultured for 18-20 hours on IPVH- membrane plates immunodominant H-2Kd-restricted Pb9 a final concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ ml. ELISPOT was performed as previously described.8,13 To analyze the sub- dominant responses to TRAP , PBMCs were stimulated with seven 20mer peptides covering the Ad response to MV A was measured using stimulation with synthetic peptides corresponding to the two immunodominant determinants originally identified in BALB/c mice, E3 and F2(G).16 In addition, we modified the more recently discovered SI9 peptide43 to make its sequence identical to that present within the MV A insert (Gly to Ser substitution at position 1), here referred to as C6(S), analogous to the derivation of F2(G) from vaccinia virus F2 peptide. 16 Neutralizing antibodies against Ad. BALB/c mice were immunized with AdH5 or AdH5+MV A mixture and 2 weeks later the neutralizing antibodies against AdH5 were measured by incubating with AdH5 expressing SEAP (secreted at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. The virus was then added to HEK 293 cells at various multiplicity of infection (4,000-0.98 by performing serial dilutions) and the reporter gene was measured using the Phospha-Light SEAP Reporter Gene Assay System (Applied Biosystems, the Plate reading luminometer Wallac MicroBeta TriLux (Perkin Elmer, Cambridge, UK). The neutralizing antibody titre was defined as the dilution of test serum at which reporter gene expression (secreted alka- line phosphatase) in permissive cells fell to 50% of the expression in cells infected in the absence of immune serum. Antibody responses against TRAP. BALB/c mice were immunized with AdC9, AdC9+MV A mixture or MV A-expressing ME.TRAP (n = 6). Serum was obtained 8 weeks later and antibodies against TRAP were quantified by a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. 44,45 Briefly, TRAP anti- gen was expressed in cell culture as recombinant Renilla luciferase (Ruc)- antigen fusion. The luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay was initiated by incubating Ruc- antigen extract with mouse sera in microti- ter wells. The antibody-antigen mixture is then transferred to a 96-well filter plate containing protein A/G beads to capture immunoglobulin G molecules. After washing the filter plate containing the protein A/G beads, antibody bound Ruc-antigen is measured by the addition of coelenterazine substrate and light units are measured with a luminometer. Activation of DCs. Groups of BALB/c mice (n = were dermally 106 pfu/mouse) or an AdC9+MV A ME.TRAP vector mixture (5 \u00d7 109 vp and 1 \u00d7 106 pfu, respectively). Twenty-four hours later, draining superficial cervical lymph nodes were excised and processed to obtain a single-cell suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media supplemented with serum, were stained in phosphate-buffered saline min-utes at 4 \u00b0C using anti-CD16/CD32 FcIII/II Receptor (2.4G2; BD/Pharmingen, Oxford, UK) for 30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. DC markers were stained for 30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were acquired on an LSR II cytometer (BD, Oxford, UK) and ana-lyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Cell staining flow For intracellular cytokine staining, ACK CD8+ T cells was performed by intracellular cytokine staining antibodies was prevented by incubating with anti-CD16/CD32 Fc produced by the NIH 1646 www.moleculartherapy.org vol. 20 no. 8 aug. 2012\u00a9 The American Society of Gene & Cell TherapyAdenovirus and MVA Mixed Vector Immunization tetramer facility (MHC tetramer core facility, Emory University Vaccine Center, Atlanta, GA) using the peptide SYIPSAEKI (Proimmune, Oxford, UK). Flow cytometric analyses were performed using an LSRII (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with either FACSDiva (BD) or FlowJo (Tree Star) software. Analysis of multifunctional CD8+ T-cell responses was performed using a Boolean analysis generated in FlowJo to be used in, Pestle and SPICE 4.0 software, kindly provided by M. Roederer (NIH, Bethesda, MD).46 Quantitative detection of multiple cytokines in mouse serum. Serum cytokines were quantified after intra- dermally AdC9 106 pfu/mouse) or an AdC9+MV A ME.TRAP vector mixture (5 \u00d7 109 vp and 1 \u00d7 106 pfu, respectively). Twenty-four hours later, sera was obtained and cytokines were quantified using a BD Cytometric Bead Array Mouse Inflammation Kit (BD Biosciences) following manufacturer's recom- mendations. Statistical analysis was performed using an ANOV A (Prism; Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). Parasite challenge. P . berghei (ANKA strain clone 234) sporozoites were isolated from glands of female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Parasites were resuspended in RPMI-1640 media and each mouse received a total of 1,000 sporozoites intravenously. Blood samples were taken daily from day 5 to day 20; blood smears were stained with Giemsa and observed under a light microscope for the presence of parasites within the red blood cells. The transgenic P . berghei parasites (PbGFP-Luc con) used in the study expressed fusion GFP (mutant 3) and firefly luciferase (LucIA V) genes under the control of constitutive EF1a promoter.47 The parasites were generated by a stable double-crossover homologous integration of the transgene into P230p locus in the reference line of P . berghei ANKA cl15cy1. The transgenic parasites were kindly provided by Dr Oliver Billker from Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK. Statistical analysis of the survival to a sporozoite challenge. Statistical differences between groups after challenge were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the survival curves using the log rank test in prism (Graphpad). Additionally, we assessed how rapidly the mice became infected by using the Hazard ratio, which is based on the slope of the sur - vival curve for each group (Prism, Graphpad). In vivo imaging after malaria sporozoite challenge. Bioluminescent luciferase signal was detected by imaging the whole animals using the in vivo IVIS 200 imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Runcorn, UK) as described before. 48 Briefly, 44 hours after the intravenous injection with 1,000 transgenic P . berghei sporozoites the mice were anaesthetized in batches of three using isofluorane, their fronts shaved and d-luciferin (Synchem Laborgemeinschaft OHG, Felsberg, Germany) injected into the neck at a concentration of 100 mg/kg in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). Animals were imaged for 120 seconds at binning value of 8 and FVO of 12.8 cm, 8 minutes after the injection of D-luciferin. Mice were kept anaesthetized throughout the whole procedure. Quantification of biolumi- nescence signal was performed using Living Image 4.2 software (Caliper Life Sciences). The region of interest were set around the liver area of the mouse body and kept constant for all of the animals. The measurements were expressed as a total flux of photons per second of imaging time. Microarray analysis of gene expression following immunization with viral-vectored vaccines. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 4 per group) were immunized with either AdC9-ME.TRAP (5 \u00d7 109 vp/mouse), MV A-ME.TRAP (106 pfu/mouse) or a combination of the two. The vac- cines were administered intradermally, half dose into each ear. Ear biop- sies of the immunization site and superficial cervical lymph nodes were collected into RNAlater (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) at specified time points (6 hours and 24 hours for ear biopsies and 9, 24, and 72 hours for lymph nodes) along with samples from nonimmunized animals. Within 2 hours of sample collection total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Subsequent sample processing and hybridization was carried out by Source Bioscience, Nottingham, UK. Briefly, the quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was evaluated and the best quality samples used for hybridization to whole mouse genome microarray chips (MouseRef8 v2.0; Illumina, Essex, UK) using four replicates for each time- point/treatment. The \"quantile\" normalization method was used for all reported analyses and background correction implemented within Illumina's Beadstudio software. Normalization corrects for the differences in expression levels across a chip and between chips and is performed so that the arrays are comparable. Quality assessment of the expression data (e.g., probe intensity, variation among replicates) was performed using the Bioconductor package, employing \"limma\" and \"Beadarray\" libraries. Differential expression data between vaccinated and nonimmunized samples contained various statistics including log (2)-fold change and P value (adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg's correction). Differential expression results were further examined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics resource (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases).49 Microarray data was submitted to the public functional genomics data repository Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) and a GEO accession number was assigned (GSE30564).
