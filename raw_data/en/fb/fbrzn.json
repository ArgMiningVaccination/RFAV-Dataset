My passion is providing compassionate and intelligent care so that you feel connected, vital and alive every day. Combining insights from Neuroscience with the wisdom of naturopathic, Chinese and herbal medicine, we will uncover what you need for your personal transformation and liberation. I love helping people become their best selves, surpassing their own expectation of health and happiness. I have made this journey myself. In my early twenties I was given the gift of desperation. I was beset with overwhelming fatigue, debilitating headaches, and had multiple parasites, all a result from a semester spent in South America. Making significant dietary changes, taking chinese herbs and receiving regular acupuncture was the first major step to total recovery. It was the gift that made me see the power of natural medicine. In the years since I have come to realize that my healing began with being sick and tired of being sick and tired. In my work with people who come to me for all kinds of reasons; addiction, digestive disorders, autoimmune disease, cancer - I have seen that the single most important factor in their recovery is this: the willingness to change. What follows looks different for each person. We begin by finding out how to create the conditions for healing. Taking a comprehensive look at your current state of health and your medical history, we tune in to the subtle energy of your body using various methods including 5 element constitution, pulse and tongue diagnosis. A unique and customized treatment plan follows and is fine-tuned as our work continues. It is a journey of authentic self-discovery on every level, grounded in science and in the intelligence of your own body. Our work together re-patterns your brain and your physiology, improving movement and flow and optimizing all levels of being. You will find yourself becoming unstuck - to discover and support the life you were meant to live. I offer in-office and phone consultations, am fluent in Spanish and can order blood work in most locations in the US.
