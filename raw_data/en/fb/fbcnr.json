Getting vaccinated is an essential step toward ending the pandemic. It's also the best way to protect yourself and others. But some people may still have questions or concerns about vaccine side effects. Here's what you need to know about the side effects, including why they happen and how to prepare for them. Understanding vaccine side effects can help you feel more prepared. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you might feel side effects in your arm or the rest of your body after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.1 Throughout your body: - Tiredness - Nausea - Headache - Chills - Muscle pain - Fever In your arm: - Pain - Redness - Swelling Side effects are a normal sign of building immunity, but don't always occur It's important to remember that these side effects are normal. They're a sign that your body is building immunity. The side effects don't come from the virus, but from your immune system's response to fight the virus. And if you don't have any side effects, that doesn't mean the vaccine isn't doing its job. With all vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine, everyone's immune response varies. \"From what we've seen in the clinical trials and now in the general population, most side effects from the COVID-19 vaccinations are temporary and feel like cold or flu symptoms,\" says Craig Robbins, MD, physician co-lead for Kaiser Permanente's national COVID vaccine program. \"Knowing that these side effects are expected and go away within a few days should hopefully help everyone feel more prepared.\" Simple ways to prepare for the COVID-19 vaccine Before you get the vaccine, consider these steps to help prepare for any side effects: Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water before getting vaccinated. This is especially important if you tend to feel lightheaded when getting a shot or your blood drawn.2 Staying hydrated is always good for your health. You should also try to avoid alcohol the night before your vaccine appointment. Drinking too much alcohol can cause dehydration. Get sleep. Studies have shown that sleep after vaccination strengthens your body's immune response.3 Aim to get 7 hours of sleep a night. Take care of yourself. Be good to your body and take care of yourself on the day or days that you get your vaccine. If you have pain in your arm, you can use an ice pack for relief. If you have chills, a warm shower or heated blanket may feel nice. When you receive your COVID-19 vaccine, it can be an emotional time of relief and joy, so be kind to yourself. Consider pain relief meds. Keep ibuprofen (like Advil) or acetaminophen (like Tylenol) on hand to help with body aches or a fever.4 But don't take pain medication before getting your COVID-19 vaccine. Taking pain meds beforehand may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness. Talk to your doctor about specific concerns If you have concerns about getting the vaccine because of a health condition, talk to your doctor. You should also talk to your doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions. You shouldn't get a vaccine that has any ingredients you've ever had a severe allergic reaction to. If someone is allergic to a certain type of vaccine, they shouldn't get another dose of that vaccine.5 Call our [24/7 advice line](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/get-care) if you experience side effects like: - Persistent headaches - Blurred vision - Shortness of breath - Leg swelling - Other long-lasting pain If you think you're having a medical emergency, call [911](tel:911). Benefits of protection are worth it Remember that all vaccines carry risks for side effects. But the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks of possible side effects. COVID-19 is serious \u2014 and anyone can develop life-threatening complications if they get it. Fortunately, we know the vaccine side effects are normal, expected, and only temporary. And clinical trials have shown that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. According to Dr. Robbins, \"When you get your COVID-19 vaccination, you're helping to protect yourself and your loved ones from a severe case of COVID-19, hospitalization, or death. The benefits of protection are worth it and certainly outweigh any temporary side effects you may feel.\" The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19 is to get vaccinated.
