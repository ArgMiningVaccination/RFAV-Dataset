Hexahydrocannabinol, also known as HHC, is a relatively new cannabinoid that has consumers in awe. It's quickly flooding the market. So what does that mean for us smokers? We should probably understand more about it and how to use it so we can truly make the most out of this new cannabinoid. When experimenting with substances you're unfamiliar with, you want to ensure that responsibility and safety are your main priorities. As such, take a look at this brief guide on how to dose HHC so you can get a better idea of what to expect. Photo by The Colonel / Adobe Stock Photo HHC is a naturally occurring cannabinoid that's found in very small amounts in pollen and seeds. Thanks to science, we can extract this naturally occurring cannabinoid and examine its psychoactive properties. This happens when producers hydrogenate Delta 9 THC, which turns into HHC. HHC is to THC what margarine is to butter: a stable hydrogenated form. This cannabinoid has a similar effect profile to that of THC. Its effects fall somewhere between Delta 8 and Delta 9 due to the availability of carbons in its chain. There are a lot of producers out there, so finding which HHC product is in its truest and most pure form can be challenging. Lucky for you, there's one particular company that puts safety and potency above all. When experiencing products from the careful and thorough hands of Binoid, we know you'll be in safe hands. Similar to most cannabis products, you want to start slow and work your way up. You may have a high tolerance to regular Delta 9 THC and other cannabinoids, but it's better to be safe than paranoid and sorry. Binoid knows that HHC is pretty potent, so when dabbling in its HHC products, the company recommends; Not all at once, of course. However, that's just the general dose for new HHC users. Below are the recommended HHC dosages for different kinds of users; HHC is around 90% as powerful as Delta 9 THC. This means that the HHC high is slightly milder than the one regular Delta 9 THC will create, except with a stronger head and body experience for relief. As always, the best way to dose out HHC is to try a little, then keep increasing until you feel what you need. There are two equally significant elements to consider when selecting how much hexahydrocannabinol to take: dosage and milligram strength. The dosage of HHC refers to the amount of product consumed. HHC strength, or product strength, refers to milligram strength, such as a 1000mg 30ml tincture or 25mg per piece of edible. It refers to the number of milligrams of pure HHC extract in each serving, indicating the potency of that serving.

There is still plenty of research to be done regarding the power and full range of effects of cannabis or hemp-derived substances. As such, we recommend you do your own self-study and go forward with care and knowledge of past experiences and tolerance with other substances if you've never taken HHC. As with every substance, each human mind and body reacts and interacts differently, so it's best to be careful and smart rather than go head first without a care in the world. As with all other cannabinoids, substances, or chemical compounds that may alter our state of mind, there may be some side effects. The most important thing to consider is that these substances may produce different effects according to each person's experience, tolerance, and internal or external differences. The most considerable effects we want to keep in mind are the same for most other substances that derive from cannabis or hemp. The mind and body may undergo temporary changes or alterations that may or may not be uncomfortable to you, but that will fade with time. In terms of mental effects, using too much HHC may result in; These effects will pass on their own, and not everyone gets them, but they may be an inconvenience to inexperienced users. Bodily side effects of HHC can include; The best thing to do in these scenarios is to chill, drink some water and let time fly. As hard as this experience may become, you will feel like your ordinary self in no time. Just remember, this too shall pass. Photo by rh2010 / Adobe Stock Photo As we mentioned earlier, research and science-backed data on the safety of HHC are scarce. But that doesn't mean it's unsafe; it's just new. However, because it's naturally occurring in the cannabis plant, there's a level of comfort in knowing that cannabinoids are safe to ingest and even have their own therapeutic properties. HHC is no different. Because it's made from the tried and true cannabinoid Delta 9 THC, we can only assume that it's safe to use. In terms of your personal experience and safety, we advise you to treat HHC the same as you would Delta 9 THC. Like we said, start slow to navigate your tolerance to HHC, then work your way up. You could throw yourself into the fire, but that could result in feeling uneasy. If worst comes to worst and you feel paranoid, just remember that time will pass. A glass of water and a short nap may be what you need, but try to remain calm and remember that everything you feel is temporary. Be safe and stay cool! Calm stoners are always ready for what their substance of preference throws at them, so try to consume when in a good state of mind to have a good time. Our minds may already be a turbulent place, so if you're not feeling like your best self, maybe save that new HHC product for later.
