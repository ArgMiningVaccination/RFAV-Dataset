If you've never been to a [chiropractic](/chiropractor/chiropractic-care/) doctor or received chiropractic services, this blog is for you. Maybe you've heard a friend talk about getting their \"back cracked\" and this sounded a bit scary. Well, rest assured, that is just an expression. Nobody is actually going to crack your back, although adjusting your back sometimes results in a popping sound due to air releasing from between the vertebrae when they are realigned. A chiropractic doctor is very well trained and knows the spinal column like the back of his hand. Chiropractors are specialists in the structure of the body. It is far safer than drugs or surgery; it is equivalent to massage, where someone is merely putting their hands on your back and feeling for places where there's tension or strain. The difference is that they are coaxing the spine into the correct position again, which actually does more to help your body heal than just easing painful muscles for the moment. Chiropractic care is non-invasive, drug-free, and non-toxic. You can't be allergic to it, you don't have to worry about overdosing, and it is administered by a highly trained, degreed and certified professional, so you can't mess it up by self-administration. Benefits of a Chiropractic Adjustment If you're suffering from neck pain, back pain, shoulder pain, etc., chiropractic care can have an amazing effect on your body. Many people report results after just one adjustment, although a series of adjustments are always the most effective. Adjustments range from being completely pain-free to causing mild discomfort for a short period of time. Here is how adjustments work. Your chiropractor will assess the condition of your spine's alignment by palpitations (feeling your spine to see where it's out of place.) You may also need x-rays taken in order to get an idea of where your spine is out of line. When your spine is out of line, it's called a subluxation. This is what a chiropractor can fix. When the spine is subluxated, the message system from the brain to the rest of the body is interrupted. This means that vital messages about the function of literally every system in your body aren't able to arrive where they should, and as a result, the performance of that part of the body may be hampered. With chiropractic care, you are taking pressure off of nerves and allowing the communication channel from the brain to the body flow freely. Most people take up chiropractic treatment just for pain relief, but it does so much more. It strengthens immunity, reduces stress, and it can even assist in the prevention of migraines, upper-respiratory illnesses, and a host of other health conditions. It is just as helpful in the prevention of disease, as it is in reducing pain. If you still have your doubts, visit our office and speak with our Doctor of Chiropractic. Ask as many questions as you want; after all, it's your body and your health. Your experience is more valid than what anyone would tell you, so seeing for yourself is always the best advice. "}
