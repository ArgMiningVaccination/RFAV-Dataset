How often do you think about your immune system? Chances are, you only give it a second thought when you're feeling under the weather. But this clever inbuilt defence system is always on the go and certainly deserves our attention. Your immune system probably isn't the first thing you think of when you bounce out of bed in the morning. But once the cold weather kicks in, or you start to feel less than tip-top, we soon begin to pay attention to our trusty immune system as we reach for a good dose of vitamin C. Now, more than ever, we need to be taking extra care of our bodies, making sure we have the basics right and are doing all we can to protect our natural defence. So, How Does it Work? Designed to fight germs and protect the body from substances that can be harmful or make us ill, our immune system is our very own personal army, trained to swoop in and flush out any nasties that can make us unwell. Your immune system is made up of lots of different components, from your skin and mucus to your lymph system (notice how your glands raise when you're feeling under the weather?) to your gut. In fact, over 70% of your immune cells are found in your gut! And whilst we can't wrap ourselves up in cotton wool and stave off every germ, bug, or harmful thing that comes our way, there are ways we can take better care of ourselves and give our immune systems a natural boost. Natural Defence It may sound simple, but ensuring that we're getting the basics right is key to a good functioning immune system. How easy is it to push the simplest things to the side when life gets busy? A quick check on the basics such as 'Are you getting enough sleep?', 'Are you drinking enough water?' and 'Are you getting enough exercise?' is always a good place to start. Your body will soon tell you when you're not! 1) Sleep Well We said we would start with the basics, and it doesn't get more basic than a good night's sleep. And there is so much more to a decent sleep than just helping you feel less tired and grumpy the next day. Sleep and immunity are interlinked \u2014sleep is a billion-dollar industry for a reason! Poor sleep and lack of sleep can contribute to lowering our immune system, but a good night's sleep can actually put a pep in it, so to speak! So, make sure you focus on your sleep hygiene by - Sticking to a routine. - Keeping your room calm and cool - 18 degrees is the optimal temperature. - Trying a [herbal sleep tea](/collections/sleep). - Relaxing with a sleep time meditation to help you drift. 2) A Gut Feeling With over 70% of your immune cells found in your gut, it's so important to take good care of it. We've all heard the term good gut health, but a healthy digestive system means a healthier immune system. Fermented foods are a great way to ensure that your gut gets just what it needs. Think yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, and [kombucha](/blogs/recipes/how-to-make-your-own-kombucha), which are packed full of the good bacteria that our tummies need to stay happy and healthy. So try adding a little fermented food into your diet daily for a good gut feeling and an immune boost. 3) Balanced Diet It's not always easy to make sure you're eating the right things all the time, especially when you're unwell. But limiting the number of processed foods you eat and ensuring you're getting plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables is key. Our bodies are finely tuned machines, and they need the right balance of everything to maintain, well, balance. Our food should be helping to nourish us and fill us with all the vitamins and minerals that we need to stay healthy, and to arm us in fighting off infection. Try and include immune-boosting foods like citrus fruits (which are high in vitamin C), garlic, ginger, and even [green tea](/collections/green-tea), into your diet. And, if you want to add a little more goodness into your daily diet, try one of our [superblends with added vitamins and minerals](/collections/superblends). 4) Keep On Moving From sitting at desks and computers all day to driving and watching TV, so much of our lives are pretty sedentary these days. But to make sure we have enough energy and are ready for whatever comes our way, we need to be active and move our bodies daily. Of course, that doesn't mean you have to hit the gym several times a week for a gruelling workout but walking, a little yoga, or even having a dance around the kitchen are great ways to keep active! And, if you can, try and get moving outdoors; why not try our [mindful walking exercise](/blogs/news/mindful-walking-walking-your-way-to-wellness)? 5) Manage the Overwhelm Easier said than done, but taking on too much can drain us of energy and lower our immune system. If you're feeling overwhelmed, try some [mindfulness exercises](https://twinings.co.uk/blogs/news/try-practising-mindfulness) such as meditation, mindful walking, or even a soothing tea meditation to help you find a moment of calm. Our bodies are pretty clever and work hard to keep us balanced, fit, and healthy, but there are plenty of ways we can help it on its way. Keep your immune system healthy and strong by getting back to basics and giving it a natural boost. "}
