January 2014 Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe SECOND NATIONAL POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY II (2012-2016) Final version - March 2012 2 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 PREFACE Poverty remains a scourge that afflicts a large segment of our population, with economic, social, political, institutional, and cultural implications. Given its characteristics, poverty can cause a persistent degeneration in conditi ons of life and generate situations that re produce its causes and effects, thereby making it increa singly hard to eradicate. Reducing poverty is therefore a challenge that requires the involvement a nd participation of so ciety as a whole. Aware of this fact, the Government of the Demo cratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has a responsibility to steer and overs ee coordinated po licies to combat poverty \u2014 making sure that the efforts of each and every person help mitig ate the causes of poverty and systematically reduce its effects, particular ly on the most vulnerable and needy groups in our population. Unable to remain indifferent to the reasons why the First National Poverty Reduction Strategy produced unsatisfactory results, the governme nt will activate accountability mechanisms at various levels in its pursuit of good governance policies, to ensure that financial investment to reduce poverty attracts interest fr om the country's development partners, as well as receiving contributions from the various sectors, in stitutions and segments of our own population. For the different political stakeholders, this Second National Poverty Reduction Strategy indicates the broad lines of government action for 2012-2016 , and constitutes a binding framework for priority actions, aimed at gr adually lowering the c ountry's poverty indices. We expect the overall comprehension of these aims to facilitate a climate of political and institutional relations that is propitious for implementing the programs included in the strategy's various pillars of action, namely: Reforming public institutions and stre ngthening the strategy of good governance; Promoting integrated and sustainable economic growth; Developing human capital and im proving basic social services; Strengthening social co hesion and protection. Clearly, a five-year timeframe will be too short to solve all the problems facing us in the multiple dimensions of poverty; but we ar e convinced that, if we all focu s on the priorities defined by the specifics of each of the pillar s mentioned above, we will make a significant contribution to reducing poverty in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe, and achieving the Mi llennium Development Goals, to which we are firmly committed.3 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 We welcome the publication of th is strategy document which, usi ng the aforementioned pillars to address the major aspirations of the Santom ean people, benefited from reflections and contributions from our public institutions at the national, regional, and local levels, as well as from representatives of the private sector and or ganized civil society, and the country's technical and financial partners. We would like to thank a ll participants, particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for their supp ort and close monitori ng throughout the design and production process.

In December 2005 a Priority Action Program (PAP 2006-2008) was submitted to the partners at the Brussels Round Table with a view to fo rming a partnership for good governance and poverty reduction that would make it possible to respond to the need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. This exerci se in negotiating with technical and financial partners was continued at the sectoral round tables held in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in December 2006 and a Coordination Meeting held in Santo Ant\u00f3nio in the Autonomous Region of Pr \u00edncipe in October 2007. Despite these initiatives, implementation of the Nationa l Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS-I) fell short of expectations, as evidenced by the progress repor ts and impact assessme nts for the policies and programs implemented. In light of this situation a nd the challenges faced in pursui ng poverty reduction actions, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe took the initiative to draf t an updated National P overty Reduction Strategy (NPRS-II) for the purpose of refocusing povert y reduction interventions for the period 2012- 2016. To that end, the present National Poverty Reducti on Strategy Paper (NPRS-II) is informed by the participatory spirit and process that guided the preparation of the NPRS-I and is linked and coordinated with previous polic y and planning instruments to cr eate a new strategic framework, which incorporates a number of changes that ha ve occurred at the national and international spheres, as well as new policy guidelines and concerns expressed by both the cooperation partners and the beneficiaries. This strategy is the result of a long process, which seeks to reconcile S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's aspirations with the opinions of the different national , regional, and district public institutions, as well as nongovernmental or ganizations, technical a nd financial partners, the private sector, and or ganized civil society. Assuming that the government does continue its actions to meet the aspirations of the S\u00e3o Tomean people, the medium-term vision envisions S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe as a country with: (i) good government and strong and credible instituti ons; (ii) a climate that is favorable to sustainable and integrated economic growth with income (re)distribution; (iii) well trained human resources equal to the challenges of de velopment; and (iv) valued cultural assets and guaranteed equal opportunity for both genders. Th e following general strategic objectives are defined on the basis of applying this vision to the 2012-2016 period: o achieving a GDP growth rate of at least 6 percent (creating the conditions for consistent diversification of the economy); o reducing the percentage of the S\u00e3o Tomean population livi ng in poverty by 10 percent (promoting income generating initiatives so as to improve the economy's productive capacity); o providing (easier and improved) access to basi c social services fo r the entire population. The general objectives defined must be achieve d though compliance with the programs included under each of the following strategic pillars: 15 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Pillar I - Reforming public institutions and strengthening the strategy of good governance. This responds to the need to crea te the conditions for institutions to function optimally, for guaranteed political stability, and for the success of economic and social policies in an atmosphere of transparency and accountability. The programs under this pillar cover issues related to the f unctioning of government institutions, public administration, the credibility and swiftness of justice, and eff ective and transparent public financial management. Actions and meas ures will also be taken to improve the quality of coordination and management of official development assistance, in compliance with the commitments assu med under the Paris Declaration. Pillar II - Promoting integr ated and sustainable economic growth. One of the basic assumptions of this strategy is the promotion of sustainable economic growth to generate employment and income with a view to reducing absolute poverty, which affects 66 percent of the S\u00e3o Tomean population.1 The programs should help restore the primary sector of the economy to its pos ition as the driver of domes tic production, with actions in the areas of agriculture, livestock, fishing, and tourism, in particular. The programs should also target the establishment of infrastr ucture for the sustaine d revitalization of the productive sector and for crea ting the conditions to attract foreign direct investment. Pillar III: Developing human capital and improving basic social services as one of the main prerequisites for attaining the planned objectives of economic gr owth, integration in the global market, and poverty reduction. This third strategic pillar is dedicated to strengthening the areas of e ducation, training, and health, et c., with a view to having better trained human resources to face the cha llenges of the future and contribute to the country's development. Pillar IV - Strengthening social cohesion and th e social safety net. Social cohesion is a necessary principle for building a more integr ated and balanced society and for reducing poverty. Under the current conditions, however, there are still social inequalities that inhibit citizenship, on the one hand, and have critical consequences for the advancement of underprivileged and vulnerab le social groups, on the other hand. Interventions in this area are intended to improve the living condi tions of the population through programs to support social integration, part icularly for vulnerable groups , to support the victims of catastrophes and natural disast ers, to provide assistance to underprivileged persons without employment, and to guarantee equal ity of opportunity across gender lines. The macroeconomic framework for the period of implementation of this five-year strategy presents two scenarios, namely: (i) a baseline scenario, which projects the start-up of oil production and exports in 2015; and (ii) an alternative scenario without oil produc tion or exports. Both scenarios project that the nominal exchange rate will continue to be pegged to the euro at the rate of STD 24,500 to \u20ac 1. Budget projections are based on the assumption th at the government will remain current on its energy supply payments through efforts that combin e strong fiscal discipline, structural reforms of the EMAE, and the adoption of a mechanism to automatically adjust retail fuel prices. The main features of the macroeconomic outlook in both scenarios are: 1 INE - STP, HCS, 2010. 16 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 In the oil scenario growth would rise to 6 percent by 2014 then take off with the start-up of oil production and exports, wh ile inflation would decline in to the single digits. It is hoped that the government will stabilize the dome stic primary deficit at 3 percent of GDP by 2014 given the available financing. The current account deficit would therefore decrease. In the nonoil scenario, the projec ted growth rate is lower than in the oil scenario given the absence of oil-related investment expenses and the sec ond-order effects of oil revenue inflows. Budget financing will be limited a nd the government will have to adopt more restrictive budget policies and target a domestic primary defi cit of around 2 percent of GDP. The key medium-term vulnerabilities that may c onstitute risks for the coherent implementation of the strategy include slower-than-expected GDP growth, persistent financial and economic problems in Europe, and international price shocks. In order to guarantee compliance with the pr ograms under each pillar, it is proposed that the performance of the execution, monitoring, and evaluation mechanism be updated and improved. This would include a redefinition of the or ganizational framework and enhanced human, material, and financial re sources for its operation. 17 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 1. Prior considerations S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe prepared its first National Poverty Re duction Strategy Paper in 2002 and submitted a Priority Action Program (PAP) for 2006-2008 to the Brussels Roundtable in December 2005 for consideration, with a view to establishing a partnership for good governance and poverty reduction, which would enable it to comply with the Mi llennium Development Goals. Based on this analysis of the pove rty situation and the id entification of its ma in determinants, the first National Poverty Reduction St rategy would be implemented to attain the following overall objectives: achieving a GDP growth rate of 5 percent from 2003; reducing the percentage of th e S\u00e3o Tomean population living in poverty by half in 2010, and by two-thirds in 2015; providing access to basic social services for the entire population by 2015 and fostering an improvement in living standards; considerably reducing social and gender differences between the districts, between the districts and the Autonom ous Region of Pr\u00edncipe, and between urban and rural populations; promoting institutional capacity build ing and a policy of good governance. The political will needed to draw up a profile of priority actions, political stability, and the proper functioning of democratic institutions should go a long way toward achieving the expected results. The National Poverty Reduction St rategy Paper was subsequently validated at the National Seminar held on December 10, 2002, approved by a decree of the regular session of the Council of Ministers on December 19, 2002 and promulga ted by the President of the Republic on January 23, 2003. However, it was found that implementation of th is National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS- I) fell below expectations, as demonstrated by the progress reports and imp act assessments of the measures and programs implemented. In addition, changes in the level of information and data used in desi gning and preparing the program needed to be factored in, based on a new assessment of the phe nomenon of poverty and, with a view to mobilizing resources that would m eet the financing needs of the current priorities. In this context, and in light of the current de velopment challenges, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe took the initiative to draft an updated National P overty Reduction Strategy (NPRS-II) for the purpose of refocusing poverty reduction inte rventions over the period 2012-2016. The purpose is to create a new strategic framework that takes into account a set of changes that occurred at the national and international leve ls and to incorporate new policy guidelines and concerns expressed by the developmen t partners and the beneficiaries. To that end, the present National Poverty Re duction Strategy (NPRS-II) Paper reflects the participatory spirit and process that guided the drafting of the NPRS -I and coordinates with 18 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 previous policy and planning instruments, su ch as the National Long-Term Perspective Study (NLTPS), Priority Action Programs, Governme nt Programs, Major Planning Options, and Development Plan for the Autonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe, the aim being to include priorities that can work over the implementation period. Moreover, the actions included under the different strategic pillars correspond to the need to comply with the Millennium Development Go als (MDG), given that the government is committed to and engaged in the process of attaining these goals. 19 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 2. Overview of the process of NPRS-I implementation Despite the fact that a particip atory approach was used in the process of preparing the National Poverty Reduction Strategy I, involving a wide variety of the country's institutions and individuals, the indicators of participation and relationships between the various governments and sectors in the process of implementing the NPRS-I show that neither the country nor the partners were effectively mobilized in implementing this important document. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy approv ed in 2002 for the period ending in 2015, included an initial Action Plan (2003-2005) covering the first stag e of implementation. But in the three years that followed its approval, it was not e ffectively implemented. This is basically due to insufficient financial resources and periods of political-institutional instability, which had repercussions for the degree to which stakeholders took ownership of Plan actions. Furthermore, the absence of a structure for c oordination and monitoring was also one of the factors responsible for the insufficient implementation of the plan during the period. Even so, some of the sectoral projects in the an nual PIPs were executed, al beit partially, and their results can be assessed because, even though they were not necessarily consistent, they did help improve the living conditions of the poorest and most underprivilege d segments of the population. In 2005, after the preparation of the Priority Action Program (PAP 2006-2008), a coordination, monitoring, and evaluation structure was cr eated by Decree 32/2005, including a Poverty Reduction Observatory (PRO), and a roundtable was held with th e principal donors and partners resulting in some improvemen t in the terms of execution of PAP actions and projects. Sectoral roundtables were also held in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 December 2006 and a Coordination Meeting in Santo Ant\u00f3nio in the Autonomous Re gion of Pr\u00edncipe in October 2007. However, a number of constraints led to the poor performance of the PAP (2006-2008) and, consequently, of the NPRS-I, in particular: insufficient ownership by the govern ment of the technical sectors; the absence of a dynamic communications stra tegy for consistent dissemination of the NPRS-I; a dysfunctional coordination apparatus and insu fficient technical and financial support for the PRO; poor coordination between the instruments of government planning and implementation, in particular the NPRS-I, the Government Program, the Major Planning Options, and the General State Budget (OGE). Another obstacle to NPRS-I implementation was th e fact that some sectors had no properly defined and coordinated sectoral strategies to ensure consistency between activities in these sectors and the objectives of the national strategy. 20 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 3. Features of the curren t profile of poverty Two methodologies were used in the framework of the second Household Consumption Survey (HCS) that was conducted in 2010: average income and cost of basic needs. According to the average income method, the poverty ratio decrea sed from 53.8 percent 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2010. Using the cost-of-basic-needs method, 66.2 pe rcent of the S\u00e3o Tomean population is poor or, in other words, is living on le ss than STD 30,000 per day per capita. Table 1.

The ratio of the incidence of poverty decreased from 53.8 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2010, representing a reduction of 4.2 percentage points, which is far below the target set in the NPRS-I for 2010,2 and also shows relative improvement in the depth of poverty (a reduction from 19.2 percent to 15.9 percent). Reduci ng the current level of poverty is a major challenge for the country. In the Autonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe (RAP ) the incidence of poverty declined by 1.6 percentage points (from 60.1 percent to 58.5 pe rcent), the depth of poverty by 3.5 percentage points (from 24.1 percent to 20.6 pe rcent), and the severity of poverty by 2.8 percentage points (from 12.1 percent to 9.3 percent). 2 The National Poverty Reduction Strategy I (NPRS-I) sought to reduce the percentage of the S\u00e3o Tomean population living in poverty (53.8 percent) by half in 2010. 21 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 According to the distribution of poverty by distri ct, poverty was reduced in every district, with the exception of \u00c1gua Grande (which increased from 39.4 perc ent in 2000 to 52 percent in 2010). The greatest reduction occurred in the M\u00e9-Z ochi district, where poverty declined from 58.9 percent in 2000 to 38 percent in 2010. Despite the overall progress, poverty levels are still considered to be very high in the districts of Cau\u00e9, Lemb\u00e1, and Lobata, where more than 50 percent of the population is st ill below the poverty line, defined as STD 24,000 per person per day.3 A comparison of the indices of depth and severi ty of poverty shows that in the districts of Cau\u00e9, Lemb\u00e1, Lobata, and \u00c1gua Grande the per centages are higher than in the districts of Cantagalo and M\u00e9-Z\u00f3chi.

The situation of poverty by district shows that the incidence of pove rty is greater in the districts of Cau\u00e9 (84.5 percent), Lemb\u00e1 (73.7 percent), \u00c1gua Grande (68.3 percent), and Lobata (67.8 percent) and in the RAP, compared to the national average, which other di stricts that display the highest poverty rates measured in terms of average income. The hi ghest rates for the indices of depth and severity of poverty continue to be reco rded in these districts, which means that the income of most of the poor peopl e in these areas is far below th e poverty line and the levels of income inequality between them are high in co mparison with the districts of M\u00e9- Zochi and Cantagalo, which have low levels of pove rty in the three i ndicators calculated. 3 Calculated on the basis of the average income method. 4 Calculated by the cost of basic needs method. 22 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 3.

It shows that households headed by women are more affected by poverty a nd those headed by men. About 71.3 percent of households headed by women are affected by pov erty, as opposed to 63.4 percent of those headed by men. The vast majority of the female h eads of household are single mothers with little education and their income is de rived mainly from agriculture or from the informal sector. The incidence and the depth and sever ity of poverty is also high in female headed households, which means that most of the income from poor househ olds headed by women is far below the poverty line and levels of inequality are greater in th ese population groups, comp ared with their male counterparts. 23 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Figure 1 - Distribution of poverty by socioeconomic group, 2010 (Percentages) 80 60 40 20 0 Public sector Private sector Self-employed Self-employed Unemployed Inactive workers workers workers in the workers in the persons Persons agricultural non-agricultural private sector private sector Incidence of poverty Depth of poverty Extreme poverty Source: HCS 2010, INE STP Figure 1 shows the breakdown of poverty by different socioeconomic groups. The impoverishment of the population seems to be di rectly related to empl oyment status, with a lesser impact on the working population than on inactive and unemployed persons. Among the employed, those most vulnerable to poverty are self -employed workers in the agricultural private sector (68.4 percent) and the nona gricultural private se ctor (67.7 percent), while others have levels of poverty lower than 60 percent. One in every three jobs that employ poor persons has a monthly salary of less than one minimum wage (STD 822,255), as opposed to one in every four jobs for nonpoor people.

This percenta ge is lower in RAP for both poor and nonpoor people. With respect to the breakdown of unemploym ent by district, based on individual living conditions, the study showed that the district s of Agua Grande and M\u00e9-Z\u00f3chi have high unemployment rates, whereas the district of Cau\u00e9, which is the poorest district, has a low unemployment rate. Agua Grande and M\u00e9-Z\u00f3chi co mprise mainly urban areas which, in the mid- 1990s and up until the beginning of the new mille nnium, saw their populations inflated as a result of the rural exodus of a large number of unemployed and uns killed individual s, who raised the existing unemployment rates of these districts. The districts of Cantagalo, Lemb\u00e1, and Lobata have similar unemployment rates. Table 4.

Overview of the current situation 4.1. Good governance and management of public assets Good governance continues to be a major challenge for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe. Of course, there have been considerable advances in the past 20 years with respect to affirming democracy and the authorities' commitment to implementi ng the principles of good governance in the management of public assets. The operationaliza tion of these principles still faces innumerable structural constraints, which li mit progress at various levels (maturity of the political system, greater supervision of the ex ecutive, modernization of govern ment administration, access to justice, effectiveness and transparency in public financial management). 4.1.1. Political governance The Constitution of the Republic has a coherent frame of reference to provide the necessary prerequisites for a democratic society. With th e advent of the multiparty system, elections are being conducted satisfactorily, with the result that political partie s take turns at holding office. Freedom of the press and of expression is alread y a reality in the country. Citizens have access to laws through their publicati on in the official gazette Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica and to deliberations in the National Assembly through different channels (seating in the public section, publication of the Assembly's journals on the Internet, direct broadcasting of plenary sessions on national radio). However, the legal framework in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe needs to be modernized in a number of areas to correc t the existing weaknesses. Political instability : The management of public issues over the last decade was marked by frequent changes in government (four changes in five years). These changes in the executive have resulted in significant shif ts in ministerial teams, altera tion of political priorities, and abandonment of previous projects and programs. Th e State's actions have been marked by a lack of continuity, making it difficult to follow-up on the reform process in a sustainable manner. Imbalances between the executive and the parliament: Although the Constitution establishes the parliament as the highest legislative institu tion in the country with the power of oversight, these two functions, legislation and oversight, are scarcely practiced by the parliament. Most legislation is initiated by the executive branch. Furthermore, the process of deliberation and approval of draft laws is slow and many bills ne ver reach the final phase of the process (being put to a general vote). Similarly, parliamentary debate on development options and public policy principles, as well as oversigh t by the specialized committees leaves much to be desired. Failure to monitor the regulations governing deputies : No structure was created to guarantee compliance with the regulations for deputies, par ticularly as regards incompatibility, incapacity, ineligibility, lifting immunity, c onflicts of interest. There are c oncerns and some confusion about the boundaries between roles (deputies ofte n work as civil servants as well). Need to update legislative texts : The body of laws must be revi sed and adapted to the current reality in several areas. The regulations governing holders of political and special office were reviewed after they became effective in 1991. Legislation must be adopted to develop the question of gender parity as qui ckly as possible, in particul ar with respect to political 27 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 responsibilities. Similarly, a lega l (and institutional) framework at the national leve l is necessary to regulate the organization and operation of NGOs. Restrictions on the media : Even though freedom of expression is clearly set out in the law, the media faces different operational constraints: in sufficient human resources, lack of equipment, unreliable financing, absence of specific legislat ion classifying journalis ts. Moreover, the small size of the country and overlapping family, social , and political relationships tend to have an influence on freedom of expression. 4.1.1.1. National security and defense National defense and security, which are prereq uisites for the survival of the nation as a sovereign entity, in peace and liberty, require that the State ma ke efforts to significantly improve its political, economic, and milita ry cohesion, safeguard national values, and consolidate the country's pluralist system. However, drug trafficking, arms smuggling, terrorism , and the proliferation of other crimes, such as piracy, degradation of ma rine resources, human trafficking, money laundering, which jeopardize the security of states, requires S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to re orient its defense and security policy for strategic reas ons, to ensure that the defense and security forces have the resources they need to cope with the new challe nges and safeguard the co llective safety of the citizenry. For this reason, a primary concern of the State is to have an overall strategy to promote systemic changes and reforms in the security and defense fo rces and services, to de velop their potential to meet modern-day challenges. The government is focusing on managing training activities, under a project grounded in criteria geared towards the acquisition of new knowledge in different areas of police and military expertise. At the same time, a retooling project will be developed and tailored to the types of threats and risks that exist and how they manifest. 4.1.2. Judicial governance The 2003 Constitution reaffirms the fundamental princi ples of the rule of law and guarantees the independence of the judicial branch. There are sti ll persistent and multiple flaws in the judicial system, which have a negative impact on economi c activity (limited capacity of the system to enforce the rights of economic opera tors) and citizens (hard-to-access judicial services). The lack of confidence in judicial institutions is detrim ental to the ability to obtain loans to develop business initiatives, business potential, and to attract foreign investment. An outdated legal framework: A vast number of legal instruments date back to the colonial era. There are important past and ongoing efforts to revise several legal te xts: Commercial Code revised in 2009, Criminal Pro cedure Code promulgated in 2 009, Civil Code, Code of Civil Procedure, Administrative Litigation Code, Cour t Costs Code, Penal Code (in the process of approval). After the national meeting on justi ce (November 2009), a new law on the judicial system took effect. Still, several legal texts need to be thoroughly overhauled, such as the land title code (1967) and the Ci vil Registration Code (1969). Deficit in the administration of justice: Besides the fact that legal texts are no longer applicable, the S\u00e3o Tomean judicial system ha s difficulty applying its laws and controlling the execution of justice system decisions. The main reasons are related to: (i) underequipped and 28 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 understaffed courts; (ii) organizatio nal weaknesses and human resour ce deficiencies on the part of attorneys; (iii) frequent interference by the poli tical or economic branch in judicial processes; (iv) weakness of the existing supervisory mechanism. 4.1.3. Administrative governance Despite the country's small size and successive a ttempts to implement reform programs, public administration in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is underdeveloped, cumbersome (in terms of bureaucracy), and overly centralized. It faces several structural problems: insufficient professional training or qualifica tions of its personnel; poor f acilities; under-utilization of information and communication technologies; lo w salaries and no career development; poor distribution of existing human a nd material resources; lack of work discipline; limited use and imposition of penalties in institutions; excessive concentration of responsibilities and decisions. 4.1.4. Local governance The decentralization process was launched in the 1990s with the publication of the framework law for the local authorities, which led to the holding of the first m unicipal elections in December 1994. However, the political structures of local administrations have not been effective in solving social, hous ing, and professional problems. This administrative process is ba sed on the division of the territory into six (6) districts in the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 (Agua Grande, M\u00e9-Zochi, Cantagalo, Cau\u00e9, Lemb\u00e1, and Autonomous Region spanning the island of Pr\u00edncipe . But real progress in affirming local power and local-level management has b een deficient for various reasons: lack of commitment on the part of the author ities to the decentralization process and to making it a priority on th e political calendar; for 10 more than years, local institutions had no authority; after the 1994 elections, no new elections were held until August 2006. The last local elections were held in 2010; the local authorities have no planning and m onitoring resources or instruments that serve as a frame of reference for managing developm ent actions or initiatives for drafting local development plans; the local authorities have a serious shortage of financial resources and institutional capacity and are therefore not in a position to provide effective services to the local communities in the various fields in which they operate; the specific provisions of the law on oil res ource management that are intended to build the financial capacity of the local author ities continue to be good intentions. 4.1.5. Financial governance and transparency in public financial management In 2005, the S\u00e3o Tomean authorities began a far -reaching process of public financial reform. Emphasis was placed on building human res ource capacity and developing an integrated computer system (SAFINHO), as well as moderniz ing the legal and regulatory framework. This resulted in the adoption in 2007 of the Law on the Government Financial Management System (SAFE), which replaced the previous organic law on public financial management dating back to 1986. The implementation of the SAFE-e made it possi ble to improve the quality of financial and budget information. 29 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 In 2008, a new budget classifier was introduced a nd a special coding was adopted to track pro- poor spending. Reforms were also undertaken in the area of cas h management and cash flow planning. On the other hand, the implementation of public proc urement reform (auctions and government contracts) based on new legisl ation, has already begun to yiel d encouraging results. Notwithstanding the progress made, the perfor mance of the S\u00e3o Tomean public financial management system is still below par and asse ssments reveal serious weaknesses. The most critical point is accountabilit y. Although the legal framework cl early defines the procedure and the timetable for approval of the General Gove rnment Account, the Court of Audit, after its establishment in 2003, has never had the opportu nity to issue an opinion on the General Government Account because the executive bran ch has never submitted annual accounts at the end of the fiscal year. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is currently in a critical position with respect to account transparency and public access to budget documents. The government 's action to combat corruption and money laundering must be reinforced. Corruption is a growing phenomenon and the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's ranking in the Corrup tion Perceptions Index is a test ament to this very critical situation.5 With respect to the fight against mone y laundering, it should be mentioned that a specific law was approved in 2008 (Law 15/2008 on Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism). Regarding oil sector transpar ency, it is important to stre ss that the Law on Oil Revenue Management was approved in 2004 by the Nationa l Assembly. This led to regulations governing the use of revenue related to o il exploration and production activiti es and to the creation of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), also in 2004. Despite the country's di squalification from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), for reasons beyond the country's control, transparency has improved considerably in r ecent times, with the creat ion of the Petroleum Supervisory Commission (2006) a nd the Public Registration a nd Information Office (2007). The lack of transparency preven ts the effective mobilization of resources, once the development partners lose confidence in the procedures for using and allocati ng the funds made available to the country. With the establishment of the Pub lic Accounting Directorate, actions have been taken to prepare and publish the General Government Account based for FY 2010 and subsequent years. For this purpos e, various steps have been take n to train national experts in government accounting with a view to improvi ng the quality of reporting in line with internationally accepted best practices. The compilation of a General Government A ccount and consolidated and sustainable government accounting will also require strengtheni ng the capacity of the Property Directorate to inventory nonfinancial assets. Th e Treasury Directorate should also develop its abil ity to present stock data on financial assets a nd liabilities so as to improve the risk forecasting associated with fiscal sustainability. 5 The Corruption Perceptions Index, disseminated in 2009, established by Transparency International, ranks the Democratic Republic of STP 111th out of a list of 180 countries. The country does not appear in the 2010 report. Its corruption index is 3 on a scale of 0 to 10. 30 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 With respect to External Debt Manageme nt, the government, through the Public Debt Management Office, has been drafting debt mana gement reports for submission to the National Assembly. There are also plans to publish them on the Ministry of Finance website, to increase transparency in management of the sovereign debt . Still on the subject of transparency in debt management, a draft framework law was prepared and presented to the Assembly for the purpose of adopting good internationa l practices in public debt manageme nt with a view to establishing a new procedure for borrowing. 4.1.5.1. Fiscal policies that expand the tax base With the international financial crisis, external aid in the form of bilateral loans has been the dominant form of credit. It should be gradua lly replaced with foreign private investment, a source of financing that does not create debt. Ho wever, this substitution cannot realistically be expected to happen in the short term. It is n ecessary to use the available official resources efficiently and effectively to create the condition s necessary for a flow of foreign private capital. The economy needs to be urgently restructured on the supply side to help attract foreign direct investment, which will be possible through budget policy measures designed to enhance incentives and investment in ports, airports, telecommunications, and energy. Government port and airport investment programs had already been facilitated by making c oncessions to foreign private investors. Fiber optics are expected to modernize telecommunications services starting in 2012, making the sector more competit ive at the intern ational level. Measures to privatize energy infrastructure ar e being considered, to make water and energy supply more competitive and efficient. But the government realizes that attracting fo reign investment does not depend only on the creation of basic infrastructure. Pr operty rights are of particular importance to foreign investors, particularly those interested in long-term investments. Safeguard s are critical to attracting long- term investment capital, particularly in an atmo sphere of international financial crisis. Recent strides in exchange rate stabilit y and flat-lining inflation are incr easing the probabili ty of returns on foreign capital and allaying investors' fears of possible expropriation. With the business climate significantly improved, according to Do ing Business 2012, the government intends to continue consolidating macroeconomic reforms so that its country and ex change rate risk is considerably reduced. 4.2. Analysis of the macroeconomic fr amework and the productive sectors 4.2.1. Macroeconomic framework Economic Growth Overall Change: In the last 10 years, the country had su stainable growth, with an average real GDP growth rate of 5.2 percent, which is slight ly above the average for the countries of Sub- Saharan Africa (4.8 percent). This growth led to a sustained increase in per capita income for the first time since independence. Two factors can be identified as directly responsible for this outcome: the first is the increase in inflows of foreign funding, esp ecially Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with the promise of oil pr oduction. The other factor has to do with the reallocation of resources from less productive uses (agriculture) to more productive purposes (services), which increases the country's growth potential. 31 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 The primary sector experienced a persistent decline, particularly in the production of cocoa, the traditional export product of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Since 2008, growth has been held back by the in ternational economic and financial crisis. The rise in the prices of foodstuffs and petroleu m products at the international level has had repercussions on household demand and the prod uction costs of domestic operators. This financial crisis has caused a decrease in FDI in the construction and tourism sectors as well as inflows of ODA, which has been the principa l source of public investment funding throughout the years. Figure 4 - Real GDP growth (%) Real GDP growth rate Source: IMF Contribution of the sectors: Economic activity has been domi nated by the tertiary sector (Table 6). From 2002 to 2011, this sector grew on average by 6 percent to represent 66.4 percent of GDP. This growth was driven by the trad e, transport, warehousing, and communications sectors, and by public administrati on. The secondary sector repres ents on average 16.4 percent of GDP, having grown on average by 2.6 percent duri ng the same period, and within the secondary sector, the fastest growth occurred in the manuf acturing industries. Finally, the primary sector grew on average by 2.3 percent and was the se ctor that contributed 17.2 percent of GDP. 32 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 6.

The purpose of this expansionary a nd counter cyclical monetary po licy is to stimulate the economy, when it showed signs of a slowdown. The decline in th e interest rate is, in turn, is related to the depreciation, albeit le ss volatile, of the NEER. Figure 5 - Annual change in the CPI Inflation: Annual rate of change in the CPI \u0000 Year-on-year inflation Average annual inflation Source: INE 33 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Public Finance The developing countries have four years in whic h to meet the Millennium Development Goals, but they continue to suffer from the effects of the historic internationa l economic and financial crisis and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is no exception to the rule. Circumstances determine whether S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr \u00edncipe will face the constraints on access to the international financial market given the redu ction in official develo pment assistance, which has placed serious pressure on the already frag ile situation of mobilizing additional domestic revenue. Figure 6 - Changes in primary income and expenditure Source: Budget Directorate/Treasury Directorate Change in primary income and expenses as a percentage of GDP primary expenditure domestic revenue (excluding oil) 34 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Figure 7 - Change in the primary balance Source: Budget Directorate/Treasury Directorate The primary deficit has been trending downwar ds since 2005, but this trend was temporarily reversed in 2009 when the country had recourse to exceptional domestic financing/privatization resources to implement countercy clical fiscal policies to help stabilize social investment spending. From that period onwards, the deficit ha s approached sustainable levels of 3 percent of GDP, based on stricter resource management . This positive trend in the deficit toward sustainable levels is due in par ticular to the fact that the budg et policy has matched investment spending to changes in revenue, in an esp ecially rigorous manner since 2005 (Figure 6). Moreover, in recent years, there has been a redu ction in the gap between domestic revenue and primary expenses, as evidenced through the re duction of the primary deficit (Figure 7). Figure 8 - Changes in the monetary gap ------ Nominal monetary gap Effects of the international financial crisis Source: Central Bank and calcu lations by Budget Directorate staff Primary balance as a percentage of GDP Impact of the international financial crisis 35 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 The international financial crisis was also asso ciated with a weakening of the economy and a 10- percent shortage of liquidity on the domestic market. Thus, the expansionary fiscal policy of using additional liquidity from privatization funds to finance pro-poor expenditure in an economic slowdown further deepened th e primary deficit recorded in 2009. At end-2008, the NEER fluctuated widely around the average, yet by 2009 it was already much less volatile. This narrow band of fluctuation around the average was reaffirmed with the Exchange Parity Agreement implemented in Ja nuary 2010. The flip side of this increased exchange stability is that inflation, even though it was trending downward, was high enough to cause the real effective exchange rate (REER) to apprecia te starting in 2009. Public Investment The level of public investment continued to decline between 2003 and 2010, with expenditure ranging from STD 200-300 million. Since 2008, public investment rose sharply, by as much as 190 percent between 2008 and 2010. On average, during the 2003-2010 pe riod, the sectors that most bene fited from public investment were, in descending order: public admi nistration (26.2 percent), transport and telecommunications (18.1 per cent), health (13.3 percent), and education (12.6 percent). Agriculture seems to be a neglected sector, obta ining just 3 percent of the PIP in 2010, the lowest value in five years. Table 7. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Public investment program by sector of activity (% of total) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2003-2010 Total 7.96 9.30 10.16 Source: DPE Public Debt In 2007 and 2008, when completion point was reached under the HIPC Initia tive, it was possible to reduce the stock of external debt from USD 359.5 million in 2006 to USD 110 million in 2008, in other words, a reduction of USD 259.5 million. Although the country was required to borrow at longer maturities and lower interest rate s after its debt relief, it still needed access to 36 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 external financing for growth and poverty reducti on programs, which caused the debt to continue to climb from 2009 to the present. It is important to note that in a situ ation of international financial crisis, access to grants from developmen t partners naturally becomes scarcer. But, even access to credit tends to be pro-cy clical, so this too becomes mo re limited. As a result of the continuous need for financing, the immediate alte rnative to grants w ould be loans\u2014mainly bilateral\u2014which increase the external debt, in particular, even when the terms are concessional. Despite the natural creep of the external debt, it will trend towards more sustainable levels when normalized by domestic wealth creat ion (Figure 9). However, the debt to exports ratio still poses a challenge for sustainability. In the general calculations, thanks to a s ounder fiscal policy, debt relief in 2007 and 2008, an increase in the concessional component of th e debt, and moderate inflation, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe now has more leeway to implement e xpansionary fiscal and monetary policies to intensify growth and poverty reduction efforts. This enhanced macroeconomic stability will be the vehicle that will ensure continued sustai nable development, thr ough the consolidation of reforms. Figure 9 - Trend of the external debt USD millions Debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative ------ Nominal value of external debt stock Debt as a percentage of GDP (right vertical axis) Current Account Balance Despite the opposite trend in intern ational prices and the resulting pressure to raise domestic fuel prices\u2014which occurred in March 2011\u2014inflatio n has been trending down since late 2008. The implementation of the Exchange Parity Agreement was a particularly important element. A stricter price control policy by the authoritie s also helped reduce general price levels. 37 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Figure 10 - Changes in th e current account balance Reduction in domestic demand as a result of the international financial crisis ----- Current account balance (USD millions) Source: Central Bank This loss of competitiveness on the domestic market is largely a result of the rise in imported inflation owing to increases in the international prices of raw materials and foodstuffs. The temporary reduction in the current account deficit in 2009 (Figure 10) is asso ciated, in particular, with a reduction in domestic dema nd for imported goods and services. Figure 11 - Exchange ra te volatility (2001-2011) Index (Jan 1999 = 100) Nominal Effective Exchange Rate\u2014NEER (+ appreciation; - depreciation) Real Effective Exchange Rate\u2014REER (+ appreciation; - depreciation) Source: Central Bank 38 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 On the other hand, the high interest rates in early 2009 were initially necessary to sustain confidence in the market and continue attracting flows of foreign capital in an inflationary climate with a highly volatile exchange rate, by compensating investors for the country and exchange rate risk premiums they would have to pay. These high interest rates are also an important means of preventing creditor resources from being siphoned off by borrowers paying a negative real interest rate. In a fixed exchange rate system, in order to en sure continuity in consolidating macroeconomic objectives, the monetary and fiscal authorities ar e committed to controlling inflation so that it does not compromise the country's competitivene ss goals. In order to introduce Treasury bills, the government will finance the deficit through th e banks and not through the central government so as not to compromise the level of reserves needed to safeguard the fixed parity system. Figure 12 - Reference interest rate Reference interest rate (in percent) Source: Central Bank Employment Generally speaking, growth has an impact on em ployment creation. According to the latest recent available data (Table 7), the unemployme nt rate declined from 16.0 percent in 2002 to 13.9 percent in 2008. There was less of an impact on underemployment, which increased by almost 40 percent above 2002 leve ls. Women continue to be harder hit by unemployment than men. In 2008 the rate was 17.4 percent, as oppose d to 13.9 percent for men. It should be noted that the decrease in the unemployment rate wa s more accentuated for women than for men. But women are less affected by underemployment. 39 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 8.

By contrast , the tertiary sector grew by 14.2 percent, primarily as a result of the publ ic administration and education sectors. 4.2.2. Change in the production sectors and the business climate S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is basi cally an agricultural country, with more than a third of the population working in agriculture, livestock, an d fisheries and earning incomes that are not sufficient to meet their basic needs. The agricu ltural sector contribu tes about 17.2 percent of GDP and 26.2 percent of the working populati on is directly dependent on the sector. Agriculture In order to increase and diversif y national agricultural production, land was distributed to former agricultural workers. Th e land was distributed without the accompanying technical and financial resources necessary for new landholders, who also had no experience managing farms. For this and other reasons, they ended up abandoning the land and feedi ng the population exodus from 40 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 the rural areas, with the resu lting negative impact on national agricultural production and, in particular, national food security. Table 9. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Agricult ural production, 2000-2009 (metric tonnes) Crops 2000 2001 2002 2003 2006 2007 2008 2009 Cocoa 2,883 3,652 3,462 3,820 1,900 2,800 12 22 25 28 30 26 30 23 Source: FAO According to the data presented in the table above, in terms of food crops, banana production increased from 26,000 mt to 30,744 mt between 2000 2009, while taro production decreased from 26,976 mt to 12,231 mt, more than a 50-pe rcent drop. In terms of export crops, the production of cocoa, the main export product, d eclined while coffee production increased from 12 mt to 23 mt. The sector faces a number of constraints and pr oblems: (i) a lack of coordination between the various agencies and operators involved in implementing a cohe rent policy for the sector (Agricultural Policy Charter); (ii) the dearth of laws, regulations, a nd effective services governing agricultural and forestry activities; (iii) the nonexistence of support infrastructure for agriculture; and (iv) the absen ce of farm and crop credits. At the operational level, steps are being taken to create decentralized services in the districts with the necessary technical expertise or transport facilities to train farmers. By the same token, the government has been unable to take action on a sustained basis to provide technical support (training and extension servic es), financial support (agric ultural loans), or irrigation infrastructure to revitalize agriculture. Livestock National livestock production is sufficient to meet demand and the population's need for animal protein and to generate income that would improve the well-being or quality of life of livestock breeders and other economic operators involve d in farming, marketing, and processing. According to the information available from the Livestock Directorate, meat production satisfies 59 percent of consumers' minimum requirements, namely 10 kg of meat per person per year, based on FAO standards. There are an estimated 11,000 livestock farmer s (10,000 in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and 1,000 in Pr\u00edncipe), most of whom raise poultry. Livestock production currently contribute s 4.2 percent of the national GDP. This activity is mainly a privat e sector undertaking, with a predominance of family farms. 41 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 10 - Changes in national livestock num bers and domestic meat production volume (2005-2010) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 LIVESTOCK (HEAD) Beef Cattle 834 857 867 870 950 MEAT PRODUCTION (METRIC TONS) Beef Cattle 6.2 10.4 6.1 5.9 6.4 6.1 Goats 2.1 2.6 4.5 2.7 2.7 2.6 Sheep 0.41 0.48 1.6 1.1 1.4 1.5 Pigs 339 315 323.2 225.4 320 347 Source: Livest ock Directorate Sustained livestock development in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe and the efficient use of existing resources could significantly in crease the production of animal protein, with the resulting improvements in diet, while retaining populat ion in the rural areas , reducing poverty, and alleviating the burden of imports. The main constraints and probl ems facing the livestock are: 1. health problems (hygiene and handling); 2. poor genetic performance of local breeds; 3. dysfunctional infrastructure for sales of animal products, which is frustrating to consumers; 4. inadequate legisla tion and regulations; 5. lack of technical and management expe rtise on the part of livestock breeders; 6. lack of inputs for the animals; 7. no credit policy for livestock farmers; 8. no coherent policy for th e Livestock Directorate. Fishing Fishing is the principal activity of coastal communities in the country and also has great potential for the development of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (S TP). It plays an important role in providing inputs and generating employment and income for communities. At the nati onal level, nutritional requirements have always been covered predomin antly by animal protein. However, a number of 42 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 deficiencies prevent the sector from making a more significant contribution to economic and social development. These deficiencies have repercussions at the institutional level and throughout the production chain, including for cat ching, processing, and marketing fish. The subsector is characterized main ly by subsistence fishing using small-scale and semi-industrial methods and accounts for 4 percent of GDP. According to surveys conducted at the sector al level, there are about 2,500 small-scale fishermen. A considerable number of farmers also practice fishing to supplement their income when there are no other alte rnative sources of income, and about 16,000-20,000 persons live directly from fishing. In the sphere of nonindustrial, sma ll-scale fishing, there are about 2,000 palai\u00eas (women who work in fisheries) and the number of pi rogues is estimated at 1,500. (Table 11) Table 11. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Number of fishing boats and catches, 2005-2007 Description 2005 2007 N\u00b0 of fishermen 2,200 2,500 N\u00b0 of palai\u00eas 2000 N\u00b0 of small-scale fishing boats 1,610 1,500 Small-scale fish catches 4,197 4,000 Source: FAO. Figure 14 - Small-scale and semi-industr ial fishing catch in STP, 2001-2010 Total catch (mt) Catch from small-scale fishing (mt) Catch from semi-industrial fishing (mt) Source: DGAP The country also grants fishing li censes to about 70 foreign boats annually, in particular from the European Union and Japan. Fishing currently contributes 4.7 percent of th e nation's GDP and employs about 15 percent of the working population. The domestic fishing market is poorly organized, mainly because there 43 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 are little to no proper structures for selling fish and operators in the sector are poorly educated. The productivity of fishing units is clearly on the decline and this affects the profitability of all segments of the industry, pa rticularly small-scale fishing and marketing activities. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has the potential to pr oduce an estimated 12,000 me tric tons per year (9,000 mt from the waters of Pr\u00edncipe and 3,000 fr om S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9). However, the country fishes only in the coastal waters of its Exclusive Econo mic Zone (EEZ), as a result of which much of its potential is underexploited. If tapped, it coul d represent substantial growth prospects for small-scale and semi-industrial fishing. The curren t catches could be doubled in size, thereby improving supply to the domestic market, income at the national level and, in particular, for the population that lives on fishing activities. To that end, the sector needs adequate investment (landing infrastructure, crafts, etc.), skilled hum an resources, sufficient financing, and adequate basic services of good quality. The main constraints and probl ems of the subsector are: 1. no landing bridge or fishing port; 2. lack of fishing equipment, materials, and gear; 3. no credit to the sector; 4. lack of supervisory and enforcement capaci ty in the maritime waters of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; 5. unavailability of updated st atistical data on fishing; 6. no quality control of fishery products; 7. overfishing in the fishing areas closest to the coast; 8. outdated and ill-equipped small-scal e and semi-industrial fishing fleet. Forestry Forestry resources can make a significant cont ribution to the economic development of the country. Wood is the predominant construction materi al and a major source of domestic fuel and has been so well commercialized in recent years that it has trul y become an alternative income generating activity for an increasing number of S\u00e3o Tomeans. The new value attached to timber resources since the 1990s has, unfortunately, led to uncontrolled a nd illegal exploitation, especially on the informal market. As a result, cocoa and coffee growing areas (shade forests) and more accessible secondary forests are alread y seeing a depletion of their timber stocks, including invasive tree felling a nd shrub removal in forest reserves located in mountains, hills, and steep valleys, which could lead to ecological imbalances with serious consequences for the entire national agrarian system. The number, and consequently the volume, of tr ees felled increased, part icularly in 2003, as shown in Table 12. This situation needs to be re versed to protect the forest ecosystem, water resources, and watersheds because deforesta tion swells rivers and increases flooding, which affects coastal communities located in river deltas (such as Ribeira Afonso and Santa Catarina). Therefore, if this subsector of the national agrarian system is to assume its real role in national economic life, its timber and non-timber resources must be more efficiently exploited in the interest of sustainability. 44 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 12.

Tourism Tourism is the main component of services export s and is currently a great er source of foreign exchange revenue than goods exports. However, th e share of tourism in GDP is still substandard, despite the country's natural pote ntial and broad cultural diversity. Tourism currently accounts for a mere 4 percent GDP and employs a very small segment of the working population. In 2010, the sector's accommodation capacity was 517 rooms and 842 beds in 30 hotel establishments and the number of visitors had peaked at 15,736 in 2005 (according to DTH data). In 2010, for example, 45 percent of tour ists came from the European market\u201435 percent of whom were from Portugal\u201436 percent from Africa, 10 percent from Asia, and 9 percent from the Americas. The government's objective, through the Strategi c Plan for Tourism Development (ILO/UNDP - 2001), was to attract 25,000 visitors in 2010. Howeve r, for a number of reasons, this objective was not met. Therefore, until certain preconditions are met, w ith respect to valuing the tourism product and reducing the cost of air trans port, energy, and telecommunications , and improving the quality of sanitation and the provision of good health servic es, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe will have little likelihood of tapping its potential. The constraints and problems of this sector are: inadequate and outdated legislation; 45 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 no professional school for tourism and the hot el industry to train the country's existing human resources; lack of incentives to stimulate investment in th e tourism sector; need for basic infrastructure (roads, wate r and electrical energy, and telecommunications) areas of hotel construction and elsewhere; little entertainment or touris t attractions (little nightlife, few theaters or cinemas); high rates charged by ENASA and INAC, which impact on the prices charged by airlines; few air and sea connections with the rest of th e world either at the re gional and continental level or with Europe and other continents. Key indicators of the tourism sector Table 13. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Entry of tourists and sightseers, 2000-2010 Seasons Numbers of t ourists and sightseers 2002 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Rainy season 3760 5735 very important to the nati onal economy and represents about 28 percent of GDP. However, it is completely disorganized, th e current legislation is outdated, there are no mechanisms that provide consumer protection, businesses are increasing ly undercapitalized, the sector is plagued by unfair competition, th e population has limited purchasing power, it is difficult to implement agreements signed with neighboring or partner countries for exporting domestic products, and the cost of transport is hi gh. These factors inter alia have been obstacles to the development of trade. For this reason, effo rts must be made to eliminate the constraints that currently hold back the development of this sector. Industry The industrial sector of the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00ednci pe economy is still in its infancy, accounting for a mere 6.2 percent of GDP in 2010. There are few significant industrie s and, most of all, production is unreliable (soap, beer , bread making, etc.). The resul ting situation is one of great external dependency for supplies of technology, equipment, and inputs and, consequently, for foreign exchange to defray those costs. On a re lated note, there are lit tle or no skilled human resources to operate industries. Transport and communications, water and energy infrastructures The basic economic infrastructures (for trans port and communications, water and energy) for developing the private sector a nd stimulating growth still does not meet the current needs. 46 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Road transport: The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe road network spans about 1,180 km, of which 250 are paved. However, road infrastructure suffers from chronic poor maintenance. The condition of the roads, especially those made of beat en earth, continues to limit the economy's competitiveness and the quality of life of rural dwellers. Sea transport: The country has four seaports, three of which are in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 (Ana Chaves, Fern\u00e3o Dias and the Neves fuel ferry port) and the fourth in th e city of Santo Ant\u00f3nio on the island of Pr\u00edncipe. The Ana Chaves port in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is unproductive becau se of its obsolete and shallow equipment (reaching a depth of 3 m on the high seas), which cannot be used for international ships. With these restrictions, most freight services must load and offload cargo outside the port using barged th at travel between the anchored ship and the port. This process requires that ships spend a long time in port (norma lly five to eight days) and increases the risk of damage to containers and missing cargo. The pr ice of insurance also goes up and therefore transport costs. The port of Pr\u00edncipe cannot acco mmodate ships with a dr aft of more than 1.7 m (which excludes most liners) and is poorly eq uipped. The current situation of the port and Principe is incompatible with a ny serious development of the region. Air transport: S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has two airports , one in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and the other on the island of Pr\u00edncipe. A public enterprise\u2014ENAS A\u2014is in charge of airport management. The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 international Airport is in urgent need of repair, does not meet international standards for security and quali ty, which limits the number of international flights and the exacerbates the country's isolation associated with distance and lack of territorial contiguity. Air connections are limited to eight flights pe r week to the continen t (Luanda, Cape Verde, Lagos, Libreville, Douala, and Malabo) and two flights per week to Europe (Lisbon). Energy The National Water and Energy Corporation (EMA E) has a network of 27,000 customers. About 62 percent of residences has access to 15 MW of electricity produced. Over the period 2003- 2010, energy received no more than 3.8 percent of total investment under the Public Investment Program (PIP). With respect to energy infrastr ucture, the country is facing enormous problems, which pose serious obstacles to the developm ent of the business/private sect or. Many businesses are required to use power generators, with the economic costs this entails, th ereby increasing their investment in operating expenses. The energy sector faces difficulties of various kinds: production far belo w installed capacity, frequent outages, approximately 40 percent of wh ich are due to the obsolescence of the network, no storage capacity, no backup systems, limited installed capacity, hi gh electricity production costs (because of the heavy dependence on importe d fuel for electricity production), expiration of the useful economic life of generators. Business climate S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe simplifie d the procedures for starting a business by creating a one-stop shop. The indices published in Doing Business 2012 show an improvemen t in the business climate of STP, which moved up in rank from 174th in 2010 to 163rd in 2011 as a result of the implementation of measures that improve the busi ness climate and reduce the cost of investment 47 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 in the country. These measures were intended to make it easier to start a business, obtain licenses, employ workers, register property, get cr edit, protect investors, pay taxes, trade across borders, enforce contracts, and close a business.

Instit utions are weak, lack skilled human resources, are poorly managed, and corrupt. 48 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 In a context where countries are constantly comp eting to provide more attractive incentives for companies and investors, STP needs to review and implement reforms and focus its efforts on a set of sectors and activities, in which the country is most likely to be competitive, and transform them into poles of attraction for both domestic and forei gn private capital. 4.3. Social sectors, poverty, and th e Millennium Development Goals 4.3.1. Performance of th e basic social sectors Education Education is a key area that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edn cipe must improve in order to develop a more innovative and knowledge-based economy. Since inde pendence, and particularly in recent years, there have been efforts to improve education in quantitative terms. Primary school enrollment and completion rates increased more rapidly than initially anticipated. However, the quality of primary education continues to be a concern a nd undermines efforts to increase secondary school attendance and pursue higher levels. This is an obstacle to development because qualified workers will be required in an increasing number of areas, particularly in the services, financial, and tourism sectors. Poor teaching quality is based on factors su ch as inadequate professional training and qualification of teaching staff, the lack of a prof essional career path, limited incentives and salary levels, limited time for study, and the lack of manua ls, laboratories, and other teaching materials, along with a system of triple shifts and overcrowded classes. Although the basic law institutionalizes secondary educat ion to grade 12, it has still not b een widely implemented in the public system. Preschool education: Educational development is limited at the preschool level, where the admission rate is on the order of 29 percent, with less than one-th ird of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's children entering this level of e ducation. Children's atte ndance at this level is reflected in the development of their cognitive abilities and in creased likelihood of success in primary school. Basic education: Although curriculum reform has been implemented to facilitate expanding basic compulsory education up to the sixth grade, the system is unable to provide a quality basic education because of the lack of learning mate rials such as manuals, laboratories, and other items, the limited number of schools, and th e lack of sufficien tly qualified teachers. Even so, some progress has been made, with gr ade repetition in basic education falling to 12 percent in 2010/2011 compared to 26.3 percent in 2007, a reduction of more than 100 percent. Thus, the challenge of reducing the grade repeat rate to single digits persists, although the country is much closer to achieving this objective. 49 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 15. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Indicators of the effectiveness of basic education (2007/2008) Indicators Basic education Secondary education 1st Cycle 2nd Cycle 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th Promotion rate 83% 61% 50.8 49.7 32.7 16.7 47.4 Dropout rate 5% 13% 16.2 12 24.2 23.1 % of teachers with specific training 47.1% 34.6% % of teachers without specific training 52.9% 65.4% % with triple shifts 9.4% Source: MEC Statistics Department. Secondary education: The situation is even more critical in secondary education. In this subsystem, close to 86 percent of youth at this age enter seventh grade, but only 16.8 percent continue to the end of the secondary cycle. The source of this problem is an insufficient number of secondary schools and the location of those schools. They are all lo cated in district capitals, so that students are forced to walk great distances to a ttend school. Dropout and grade repeater rates in secondary education are 24 percent and 20 per cent, respectively, and completion and survival rates are only 11.3 percent and 15.2 percent, re spectively (throughout the cycle). The teaching corps at this level of educa tion is characterized by weak qualifications as only 39.5 percent (average for all cycles) of teachers have adequa te training and 100 percent of teachers under the age of 24 are not specifi cally trained to teach. Technical and vocational education: Technical and vocational education is one of the least developed sectors and has limited social relevance. Vocational tr aining policy must be clearly linked to the country's development objectives, part icularly in strategic development areas, and must focus on entrepreneurship and promoti ng self-employment and creating small economic initiatives. Technical and vocational education is characterized by limited variet y in terms of training areas. The facilities of the Polytechni c Center have limited capacity, w ith only four office-workshops and four classrooms. The Budo-Budo Vocational Tr aining Center is limited in terms of its physical structure for meeting the high demand for training, and also faces financial constraints. Students show little interest in registering fo r vocational training becau se of how poorly it is presented and limited respect for technical and manual work. In this context, it is essential to decentralize vocational training centers and vocational education prudently and based on opportuni ties in the labor market (tech nical knowledge for construction, 50 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 agriculture and fishing, or tourism), providing access to all types of resources - knowledge, assets, rights, and contacts that make it possible to overcome pot entially vulnerable situations. Higher education: Higher education for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edn cipe's employees has primarily been provided abroad through the system of scholarsh ips offered by international cooperation and the government of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. On the other hand, the country already has some institutions of higher learning (ISP or the Universidade Lus\u00edada de STP and IUCAI, both of them private). Both supply and demand are still limited, not only by the limited number of tr aining programs in the area of technology but also and above all by the high fees that di scourage young people from attending these private educational institutions. Health Health care delivery also improve d considerably, particularly in the area of maternal and child care. Maternal mortality also fell sharply, due in large part to the increased percentage of childbirths attended by qualified professionals. S\u00e3 o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe reduced the incidence of malaria among the under-five, based on an integrated multipronged strategy of household spraying, treatment of cases with new artemisi nin-based antimalarial drugs, the use of insecticide impregnated mosquito nets and better sanitation. Mort ality due to malaria fell to nearly zero in 2009. HIV prevalen ce among pregnant women fell fr om 5.4 percent in 2006 to 1.5 percent in 2009. However, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's national health system is facing some problems that hamper the effective performance of its mission to prom ote public health and th e population's physical and mental well-being and to guarantee healthcare for all its citizens. The health sector is characterized by insufficient health infrastructures, low-quality service delivery, insufficient human resources poorly distributed throughout the country and with litt le motivation, and not enough specialists in various area s. In addition, access to healthcare is very uneven depending on region. The level of coverage by medical personnel is also good, considering the region where the country is located. There is a pproximately one physician for ev ery 3,000 inhabitants (considering only native physicians, while acknowledging the presence of some foreign physicians and specialists), one nurse for ev ery 900 inhabitants, and one midwife for every 168 pregnant women. However, they are not di stributed equitably throughout the country. In addition, it is important to note that, due to poor working conditions, inadequate availability of medications, the lack of incentives, and extremely low salari es, among other causes, medical staff in general are poorly motivated. The epidemiological profile of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr \u00edncipe continues to be dominated by a set of preventable diseases such acute respiratory di seases, diarrheal diseases, and malaria, and communicable diseases or diseas es linked to the environment a nd the population's habits and behaviors, which are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. 51 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 16.

With respect to maternal and child health, 68 percent of pregnant women report having been cared for under a checkup and follow- up program (65 percent in urban areas and 72 percen t in rural areas) and 85 percent of those who gave birth report having been attended in that birth. Malaria, until recently the country's principal pu blic health problem, is under control thanks to the intervention of inte rnational cooperation, with 11 deaths reporte d in 2008, a significant reduction compared to the 193 deaths recorded in 2003. Table 17.

The maternal mortality rate is still high, 151.4 fo r every 100,000 live births in 2006, higher than the rate reported in 1991, when it was 101.6 for every 100,000 live births. 52 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 HIV/AIDS The first case of AIDS in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe was reported in 1990. Since then the cumulative number of cases reported has in creased regularly every year. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, besides being an obvious and serious pub lic health problem, has a direct effect on the social and economic development of nations and is becoming a national security problem. AIDS has a negative impact on the willingness of invest ors, particularly in th e corporate sector, to invest in the development of highly infected co untries, because they know that the epidemic affects people in their produc tive years in particular. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS affects about one percent of the population in general, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has a widespread HIV epidemic.6 To deal with the epidemic, the government developed the National Strategic Plan to Combat AIDS. Its objectives are (i) to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS infection; (ii) to reduc e susceptibility to infection; a nd (iii) to reduce the impact of infection. According to the results from the Demographic and Health Surv ey (IDS), the prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection among the population aged 15-49 is 1.5 percent, 1.3 percent among women and 1.7 percent among men of the same age group. These two rates yield a ratio of infection between women and men of 0.77, meaning that there are 77 infected women for every 100 infected men. There are also differences based on region. The re gion of Pr\u00edncipe and northern S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 are characterized by higher levels of prevalence ( 2.2 percent and 2.0 percen t, respectively). The lowest prevalence level is found in southern S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 (percent). Water and sanitation Water: Although S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has high water potential based on more than 50 watercourses, water quality is a concern. Water resources ar e distributed unevenly, exposing certain regions to water shortages, with more than 60 percent of wate rcourses located in the southern and south-western areas of the islands. It is estimated that only four percent of total existing water volume is being used. A large part of the population, basi cally in rural areas, continues to be without access to drinking water and uses river water or existing sources wi thout any protection or control. By order of importance, the following were identified as th e principal causes of de ficient water quality: inadequate and degraded systems, vandalism and lack of awareness, lack of government support and insufficient investment, and defici ent management of water resources. 6 IDS, 2008-2009. 53 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 18. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Rate of Access to Drinking Water (2001-2006) Access Urban/rural environment 2001 (as a %) 2006 (as a %) Urban 29 57.2 Drinking water Rural 6.4 12 Total 19 38 Source: QUIBB, 2005 According to data from the 2005 QUIBB, 96.8 per cent of the population has access to water and 88.7 percent has access to piped water. However, sa fe access to drinking water is much lower. In fact, coverage in 2001 was 19 pe rcent, reaching 38 percent in 2006. In rural and semi-urban areas, the rate of access to drinking water we nt from 6.4 percent to 12.6 percent between 2001 and 2006, while in urban areas coverage varied on average from 29 percent in 2001 to 57.2 percent in 2006. Sanitation: The sanitation situation is much more cri tical than the water supply situation. The country is facing problems related to rainwater drainage and waste removal, particularly in urban areas. This situation contributes to the spread of infectious and parasitic diseases. The survey on the well-being of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe familie s conducted in 2005 indicated that three-fourths of the population does not have an adequate excr ement removal system. Despite the investments made in the area of protecting sources and building latrines, it is likely that the situation has deteriorated since that time, considering the high pace of demographic growth and increasing concentration of the population in areas on the ou tskirts of cities. The following factors were identified as the principal reasons for deficien t basic sanitation: limited community awareness, an inadequate Information, Education, a nd Communication (IEC) campaign, absence and insufficiency of sanitation infrastructure, limite d financial resources, lim ited availability of water, houses with structures making it impossible to install latrines, and lack of maintenance. 54 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 19. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe: Drinki ng Water and Environmental Sanitation Coverage (2001 and 2006) Access Urban/rural environment 2001 (as a %) 2006 (as a %) 2008-2009 Urban 20.8 39.1 42.2 Sanitation Rural 10.2 19.2 26.6 Environmental sanitation 16 30 34.8 Source: MDG Costing Report; IDS, 2008-2009. The national rate of sanitation infrastructure coverage was 16 percent in 2001, increasing to 34.8 percent in 2009, with va riations based on urban or rural location. In 2009, only 19.2 percent of the rural population had access to a sanitation syst em compared to 10.2 percent in 2001. In urban areas, 20.8 percent of the inhabitants had access to a sanitation system in 2001 and this coverage increased to 42.2 percent in 2009. Housing The housing problem is associated with numerous deficiencies that form the basis of the deterioration of the existing housing stock. The dism antling of old agricultural companies, tied to a lack of employment, deficient access to basi c services and bad housi ng conditions, led people to move to urban centers in s earch of better living conditions, particularly decent housing and employment. These population movements would lead to grea ter demand for social infrastructures, particularly housing. 4.3.2. Cross-cutting sectors Population and development A basic factor to be taken into account in this poverty reduction strategy is the effective growth of the population, considering its impact on the le vel of projected infrastructure, access to basic social services, job creation, natural resources ma nagement, and other asp ects. According to the most recent projections, the populat ion includes nearly 160,000 inhabitants and is growing at an average rate of 2.0 percent a year. The defined national population policy includes an approach to development that takes into account economic, social, cultural, envi ronmental, and demographic factors. 55 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Social security and protection In the current context, the system of social security and protection has various problems that hamper the expanded development of actions to m eet its obligations, which could call the system itself into question. Although social security in S\u00e3o To me and Pr\u00edncipe is based on pr inciples of social equality, it does not yet constitute a strong instrument of social policy, wi th services and a dynamic that could cover the social security needs of citizens, consistent with efforts made to meet the contribution requirements of which they should be beneficiaries. It is only a strategy for fulfilling social rights, without political or legal meaning in terms of the full exercise of social rights. Youth and sports Youth: The National Youth Institute, a public in stitution designed to wield policy instruments fostering opportunities for youth in tegration and development, is facing numerous limitations on its performance, particularly : (i) weakness of the legal a nd regulatory framework for the operational structure of the Youth Institute (IJ); (ii) inadequate financial and logistical resources; (iii) problems in terms of coordination and in ensu ring the sustainability of actions and projects already developed; (iv) lack of its own space. Sports: The national sports situati on is distressing and reflects the set of deficiencies faced by the country as expressed in: Deficient institutionalization of sports; Lack of human, material, and financial resources; Lack of and limited size of sports facilities. Success in sports will only be possible with a clear and sustained national development policy, reflecting what is actually planned for national sports. This success will depend on a split with the lethargy and empiricism of the past, making way to sports for the present and future in which long term forecasting and planni ng, based on sustained project development, must be the dominant note. Gender Analysis of the country's gender situation exposes the gender inequi ties that directly affect men and women, despite constitutional guarantees and other laws. It was found that women and men do not enjoy the same status in society and that men's predominance over women is socially acceptabl e. Women are economically active in various sectors but do not have the same access as men to the means of production and the financial resources needed for their activi ties. They bear the burden of pove rty more and are the victims of violence more often than men. They participate le ss in political life and are under-represented in decision-making bodies. The ratio of representation in Parliament between men and women is far short of what is desirable in order to achiev e equity. Since democracy was installed, the number of women representatives in each legislature has been far from th e 30 percent of legislative seats guaranteed in the law. Currently, only 10 of the 55 elected representatives are women. Equality between men and women to a large ex tent determines the success of the poverty reduction strategy. The causes of poverty aff ect men and women diffe rently. Inequalities between the sexes in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are significant and represent one of the fundamental 56 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 causes of poverty. For this reason, the povert y reduction strategy emphasizes the gender approach in developing, program ming, and implementing different public policies so as to undo the country's social and gender-based inequities. Mainstreaming gender in development means taki ng into account the con cerns and experiences of women as well as men when developing, im plementing, following up, and evaluating policies and programs in the political, econom ic, and social arenas. The objective is to ensure that women and men participate jointly in the planning and decision-making pr ocess and benefit equally from the fruits of development. Environment Threats from various natural phenomena such as vulnerability to climate change, reduced rainfall, and the resulting reduction in river flows create situations of risk that can compromise the efforts made to improve citizens' living c onditions. Coastal erosion and floods are some of the problems that concern S\u00e3o To m\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, due to the lack of protective barriers, dikes, and retaining walls against these phenomena. The following environmental problems were identified: Loss of biodiversity; Pollution of rivers, streams, a nd water sources by chemicals; Increased coastal erosion; Disorganized expansion of urban areas; Failure to ratify international conventions on the environment; Deforestation; Use of areas with agricultural potential for other purposes, with the resulting soil degradation. 4.4. Trends with respect to achievin g the Millennium Development Goals The challenges faced by the country indicate that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edn cipe must continue to strive toward the Millennium Development Goals. Howe ver, a series of goals and objectives will not be achieved by 2015 without exceptional efforts. El even years after the M illennium Declaration, some progress, albeit slow, has been made towa rd the goals established in some areas. The difficulties have been primarily financial. This s ituation involves the level of economic growth as well as the quality of governance, particularly economic governance, which has helped to slow the process of reducing poverty levels. Based on current trends in the various indicato rs that make up the eight MDGs, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe will not be in a position to achieve all the MDGs in 2015. Current development indicates that despite significant progress made in education and health, much remains to be done in the areas of gender equality and equ ity, empowering women, esta blishing partnerships for development with the effective implementation of the Paris Declaration and, primarily, in the fight to reduce poverty.57 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Table 20.

Medium-term vision a nd strategic objectives 5.1. Challenges and medium-term vision S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is a small island nation highly dependent on official assistance from partners within the framework of bilateral and international cooperation fo r developing priority actions intended to reduce poverty and create conditions for the country's development. However, a status review of th e NPRS-I and the latest data on the poverty profile points to a scenario of new challenges to be addresse d through policies consiste nt with the current imperatives associated with efforts to combat poverty, basically gear ed to creating income opportunities, facilitating accessibilit y, lending credibility to the deli very of basic social services, and ensuring assistance and protection for the ne ediest and most vulnerable social groups. Having committed to continued government action to fulfill the great aspirations of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's population, however, the medium -term vision specifically for the period 2012- 2016 also draws on the optimistic \"tl\u00e1b\u00e1 s\u00f3 c\u00e1 d\u00e1 t\u00ea\" scenario of the National Long-Term Study (NLTPS), according to which S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has opportunities for success in achieving harmonious eco nomic and social development. However, due to the lack of understanding on the part of the po litical class, in conjunction with ineffective governance and lack of continuity, successive governments been unable to capitalize on the resources available to STP or to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to th e country by the international community. These factors are compounded by weak pa rticipation on the part of civil society and the lack of an entreprene urial spirit. The Study adds that this strategy requires selfless efforts by all to reverse the trend and tr ansform STP\u2014a small island country without great resources\u2014into a true equatorial oasis and make this land a role model for the worl d with good governance and political stability and a common e ffort by the people of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe to build a society where work, justice, and social peace will be ca talysts for putting the country on the path to progress and well-being for all. Thus, the medium-term vision for the five-year period, through rational a ssessment of internal efforts and potential, as well as bilateral and multilateral cooper ation, plans to make S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe a country: that is well-governed with strong and cred ible institutions; (ii) with an environmental favorable to sustainable and inte grated economic growth and (re)distribution of income; (iii) with well-trained human resources up to the challenges of development; and (iv) that values its cultu ral heritage and guarantees ge nder equality and equal opportunity. 5.2. Strategic objectives The NPRS-1 established ambitious goals to be achieved by 2015, provided the actions planned for each of the defined strategic pillars are im plemented and the indicated risk factors do not materialize. However, as indicated in the conclusions from the evaluation7 of the implementation process, the NPRS focuses on id entified problems and on the need s of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, so that the programs, projects, actions, and act ivities carried out are relevant, incorporating identified priorities and needs, but in terms of general effectiv eness, the achievement of the specific goals fell short of the desires of the overwhelming majority of the sectors and the average execution rate of activities was low. The results achieved to date confirm that the NPRS 7 CIAD, NPRS Evaluation Report, STP, 2012 . 61 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 helped to improve S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe's economic and social situation, despite falling far short of expectations. The eff ectiveness of the NPRS was lim ited, which limited its contribution to poverty reduction. In terms of efficiency, the ra te at which financial resources were mobilized was also generally low, particularly in the period 2003-2005. The implementation mechanism established did not function effi ciently. The weaknesses of the actual implementation mechanism led to poorly coordinated efforts and the failure of the various programs and projects to converge in terms of objectives. Give n that the NPRS encompasses a very long time horizon (2003-2015), its implementation was also compromised, since the assumptions were in adequate and national priorities need to be redefined to some extent. Consequently, it is important to de fine objectives from a realistic perspective, objectives that can actually be achieved, anticipating their impact on improving citizens' living conditions, and particularly on reducing poverty in general throughout the country. Thus, bearing in mind the long-term vision acco rding to the scenario based on the National Long-Term Perspectives Study, the general strategic objectives of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe for 2012-2016 are as follows: o To achieve a growth rate of at least six percent (creating condi tions for consistent diversification of the economy); o To reduce by ten percent the percentage of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's population living in poverty (promoting income-pr oducing initiatives and thus improving the population's productive capacity); o To ensure that the entire popul ation has (facilitated and improved) access to basic social services. Achieving these objectives means recognizing that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is subject to the characteristic vulnerabilities of small island nations. It also faces problems based on its remoteness, isolation, and in sularity, the limited capacity of its institutions, limited diversification, susceptibility to climate change , and limited resources. These characteristics, when combined with potential external shocks , impose increased challenges and increase the need for domestic efforts and the ability to m obilize resources to finance priority poverty reduction actions. From this perspective, there are increasing conc erns regarding priority actions targeting the Autonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe, in the sense of a proper explorati on of its potential, taking into account both its territorial separa tion and some of the natural, social, and cultura l characteristics that make it distinct and require special attention. 62 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 6. Five-year strategy and priority programs The objectives defined are part of an approach that seeks to c onsolidate the gains already made by the country over the last decade. Thus, it is important to identify the priority areas of intervention for the five-year period (2012-2016), creating and ensuring th e conditions essential to growth and job creation and, consequently reducing the poverty that now affects 66.2 percent of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's population. This action approach entails great challenges over the next few years, such as ensuring macroeconomic stability, facilitating access and le nding credibility to ju stice, increasing the growth of the productive sector of the ec onomy, improving basic economic infrastructures, ensuring access to education and health, guara nteeing basic sanitati on and access to drinking water, and promoting food and nut ritional security. These are chal lenges that require coordinated action at various levels, whether pub lic or private, national, regional or district, as well as with organized civil society. To achieve these objectives concurrently with the millennium development goals, four strategic pillars of intervention were identified, including programs that when implemented will allow more rapid gains in the povert y reduction process, as follows: (i) Reform of public institutions and strengthening of good governance policy; (ii) Promotion of sustainable and integrated economic growth; (iii) Development of human capital and improvement of basic social services; (iv) Strengthening of cohe sion and social protection. The activities in each pillar form part of a framework requiring planning and execution of program-budgets to make priority actions technica lly and financially feasible, with support from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's cooperation and de velopment partners. The organization of government actions consistent with this focus se eks to provide more rational and efficient public administration and to increase the visibility of the results and be nefits generated for society, as well as to increase transparency in the use of public resources. In this sense, the indicative programs included in each pillar will be detail ed and quantified in a Priority Actions Program document to be designed as an integral part of this strategy and an instrument for its implementation. 63 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Strategic Objectives and Pillars Strategic Objectives Achieve a PIP growth rate of at least 6% Reduce the proportion of the population living in poverty by 10% Ensure that the entire populati on has access to basic social services Pillar I Reform of government institutions and strengthening of good governance policy Pillar II Promotion of sustainable and integrated economic growth Pillar III Development of human capital and improvement of basic social services Pillar IV Strengthening of social cohesion and protection 64 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 7. Pillar 1: Reform of government instit utions and strengthening of good governance policy Rationale for intervention: The current scene in government inst itutions has also hampered the country's development. The government's orga nization and operations must be reviewed, providing impetus for modernizing institutions, proposing another reengineering of institutional structures, as well as simplifying infrastructures. The reform of government and its institutions has been on the agenda of various governme nts, but its implementation has been time- consuming. For this very reason, it is imperative to (re)d efine the government's mission, reorganize its operations and its management style, and adapt human and material res ources based on their mission. Efforts to reform public administration must be sufficiently comprehensive to cover all government institutions, includi ng the National Assembly and re gional and local authorities, adapting their size, missi on, and other aspects. Good governance presupposes the proper opera tion of government institutions, the implementation of instruments that promote and ensure reform of government finance management, transparency in bidding procedures and government contracting, the preparation and disclosure of contracts a nd external audit re sults, improved monetary management, and improved management of government finances and the public debt. Accordingly, the following specific objectives for reform of government institutions and strengthening of a policy of good governan ce are defined for the five-year period: Adapt and modernize the government apparatus according to the country's needs and resources; Promote participatory involvement by the priv ate sector and civil so ciety in the design and implementation of measures to combat poverty; Guarantee efficiency and quality in the delivery of gove rnment services; Renew the framework of dialogue and consulta tion with development partners based on the Paris Declaration. The aim is to achieve these objectives by car rying out programs under the following three headings: 7.1. Consolidation of government authority and strengthening of good governance 7.1.1. Program: Restructuring govern ment and public administration To address various problems, constr aints, deficiencies, flaws, or imperfections that characterize government in general and public administration in particular, this program seeks to redefine the 65 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 role of government, restructure and adjust the si ze of the government apparatus, reform public administration, and strengthen standard s for protecting citizens' rights. Policy measures: Create a national council and a multidiscip linary technical office for governmental reform; Reorganize and modernize the National Assembly; Computerize government services; Streamline services and simplify procedures; Rationalize resources and increase labor productivity and efficiency; Introduce public services evaluation systems. 7.1.2. Program: Promoting local governance Expanded local governance is inextr icably linked to the strengtheni ng of the democratic system and improved effectiveness in public administrati on. Decentralization and re gionalization seek to improve accountability and sharing at the decisi on-making level by bringing government closer to the citizens and facilitating th e population's involvement in the ma nagement of public affairs. Policy measures: Promote initiatives to revise the political-administration division; Update the Local Finances Law and other le gal instruments not in keeping with the current needs of local government; Improve local authorities' access to fina ncial resources and promote efficient and effective management of those resources. 7.1.3. Program: Promoting national defense With this program, the five-year strategy calls fo r: (i) the preservation of national territorial integrity; (ii) combating cross-border insecurity and crime and the prolifer ation of light weapons; (iii) the development of military engineering; and (iv) participation in peace-keeping activities at the continental level. Policy measures: Decentralize the services of military units by rehabilitating infrastructures and building new ones; Promote human capital through domestic and foreign instruction and training actions with support from cooperation partners in th e areas of rescue operations and maritime security; Promote the participation of the armed for ces in humanitarian assistance operations conducted under the aegis of the United Nations and in the context of the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of Centra l African States (ECCAS), and the New Partnership for Africa' s Development (NEPAD). 66 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Adopt mechanisms to facilitate armed forces participation in multin ational operations to combat piracy at sea and armed a ssaults on ships and oil platforms; Expand the area of surveillance and control at sea, seeking to pr otect resources and rescue operations at sea. Implement mechanisms designed for effective control of the use of weapons, munitions, and other explosive devi ces, proceeding to seize those that are illegal. 7.1.4. Program: Guaranteeing public safety The principal objectives of this program are: (i) to guarantee the security of pe rsons and their property so as to ensure the peace and tranqu ility essential to the country's socioeconomic development process; (ii) to guara ntee that the police operate in proximity to the people; (ii) to guarantee tranquility and public secu rity; (iv) to combat organized crime, human trafficking, and drug trafficking; and (v) to improve the reputation of the police for ces in the eyes of citizens and society. Policy measures: Promoting human capital in law enforcement; Strengthening the security of i ndividuals and government property; Intensifying proactive inte rventions and strengthening local policing measures; Creating conditions for preventing and co mbating fires and other disasters. 7.1.5. Program: Reforming the electoral system The electoral system has operated reasonably well. Presidential, legislativ e, and local elections and the results thereof are generally accepted. In the context of this program, the aim is to consolidate the system and utilize mechanisms to strengthen transparency in the financing of candidates and elections. Policy measures: Revision of law on elections and the financ ing of political parties and electoral campaigns. 7.1.6. Program: Improving the credibili ty of and access to justice One of the major concerns in this sector is to modernize judicial mechanisms so as to provide citizens more expeditious a nd better quality services. The objective of the program is to improve the performance of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's legal and judicial system and make serv ices more accessible to citizens. Policy measures: Update and adapt the legislative framework of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to reflect current realities; Improve the organization and operation of the courts and other judicial institutions; 67 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Give the courts and the Public Prosecuto r's Office a sufficient number of judges and magistrates, based on the complexity of se rvices and in accordance with the new Basic Law of the Judicial System; Create a Criminal Investigation Police (PIC ) in the Autonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe. 7.1.7. Program: Ongoing training for human resources in public administration The lack of ongoing human resources training in public administration is one of the major limitations on the country's development. Hu man resources training and evaluation and the adoption of more modern methods of human re sources management are prerequisites for good governance and accountability. Policy measures: Create a national training fund for civil servants; Create a central unit responsible for civil service training; Develop a national training pr ogram for civil servants; Revise and update the Ci vil Service Statute; Develop and implement a positions, careers, and salaries schedule; Promote occupational retraining for excess personnel; Introduce civil service evalua tion systems based on specifi c objectives and merit; Urgently develop studies anal yzing and describing functions and positions in all sectors of central government administration; Develop studies with a view to changi ng current civil service working hours; Proceed to revise the civil service compensation system. 7.2. Promoting responsible and transpa rent management of public finances Establishing effective and transp arent management of public fina nces is one of the essential conditions for good financial and economic govern ance. It affects economic growth and the allocation of resources above all. In this contex t, introducing enhanced go od practices in the area of management and accounting of the public purse has been one of the concerns of successive governments and our foreign partners. In response to these concerns, the following programs will be developed: 7.2.1. Program: Public financial management In terms of the management of governmental affa irs, there is no culture of accountability. The rules governing bid solic itations and goods and services proc urement awards are most often ignored or ineffectively applied. Policy measures: Strengthen the mechanism for combati ng fraud, smuggling, and money laundering; Guarantee effectiveness and transparency in the use of resources, redirecting expenditures to the sectors that have a direct impact on reducing poverty; 68 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Use social communication medi a and other outlets to public ize the importance of and need for responsibility, transparency, and acc ountability with respec t to the management of public affairs; Strengthen the mechanisms for preparation, de velopment, approval, and execution of the general government budget, considering that bud getary choices should have an impact on strategic actions to reduce poverty; Promote responsibility and regul ar accountability in agenci es that collect government revenues; Develop the medium-term expenditure framework. 7.2.2. Program: Improving the effectivene ss of Official Development Assistance Despite how important Official Development A ssistance (ODA) is to th e country (averaging 75 percent to 80 percent of the annual volume of the public investments program), recent years have seen a decline in foreign aid funds to finance poverty reduction actions. Policy measures: Improve the mechanisms for mobilizi ng and managing foreign resources; Align ODA with national devel opment priorities so that it is used appropriately to leverage development; Strengthen collaboration among the Office for Coordination and Management of Assistance, International Coope ration Directorate, General Planning Directorate, Budget and Treasury Directorate to achieve better coordination in the planning, mobilization, implementation, and control of foreign resources; Create an integrated information system on ODA and public debt; Develop a policy on public aid for development to guide all actions associated with the mobilization of finances, methodologies, objectives, procedures, and negotiation; Develop a public debt strategy. 7.2.3. Program: Improving the information and public policy guidelines system The objective of this program is to help the cen tral and regional governments to make decisions in the area of economic and social policy. It s actions seek to pr ovide and improve the socioeconomic information system to guide deci sions in the area of pol icy to benefit the poor. Policy measures: Guarantee and provide support for collecti ng and processing economic, social, and demographic statistics and the monitori ng of poverty indicato rs and the MDGs; Ensure statistical coordination and dissemination of the results of surveys and censuses; Monitor and evaluate the country's overall a nd sectoral strategies; Provide a system of reliable data, particularly economic, social, demographic, technical, and other data; Improve the production and disseminati on of statistical information. 69 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 7.3. Promoting access to information and knowledge and citizen participation 7.3.1. Program: Accessibility of Informat ion and Communications Technology (ICT) The program on \"Accessibility of Information a nd Communications Technology\" seeks to make a contribution to the process of acquiring and managing information and knowledge as a condition for informed and responsible citizen pa rticipation in the process of combating poverty and developing entrepreneurial in itiatives to create wealth and the well-being of the population, particularly young people. Policy measures: Provide the infrastructures necessa ry for expanded access to ICTs; Promote the use of ICTs in government service, particularly in the education and health sectors; Ensure the sharing of experiences and bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the area of ICTs; Provide for widespread use of ICTs in the ce ntral government as well as in regional and local governments in order to reduce case processing time and stationery expenses. 7.3.2. Program: Promoting the mass media Policy measures: Improve the legal and regulatory framew ork for the practice of journalism; Strengthen the institutional capacities of social communications agencies; Facilitate initiatives for creating pr ivate social communication agencies; Support the creation of and provi de incentives for cultural, ed ucational, and science and technology dissemination programs. 7.3.3. Program: Promoting civil society and its participatory involvement This program seeks to strengthen an organized ci vil society and thus promote its involvement in the promotion of good governance, in partnershi p with government and the private sector. Policy measures: Improve the dialogue with organized civil soci ety, particularly on issues that require consensus at all levels for strengthening good governance; Continue the effort to strengthen the tec hnical capacities and the organization of the representatives of civil soci ety through substantive support on technical, material, and access to financing matters; Develop an NGO partnering stra tegy on priority intervention s in the poverty reduction strategy; Promote greater participation and involvement by organized civil society in the process of developing legal instruments as well as public policies and their implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. 70 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 8. Pillar 2: Promoting sustainable and integrated economic growth Rationale for intervention: In this pillar, the authoritie s commit to a reassessment of the primary sector of the economy, pa rticularly agriculture, livestock, and fishing, as well as tourism, as well as to creating infras tructure conditions for relaunc hing the productive sectors on a sustainable basis and promoting co nditions favorable to private sector development. To do this, laws must be revised in keeping with the cu rrent socioeconomic context. Similarly, the government must make available economic infr astructures to support the private sector. In all sectors of economic activit y, two basic principles must be considered: diversification and export promotion. The primary sector, particularly agriculture, lives tock, and fishing, must continue to play an extremely important role in upcoming years, in that it is these areas that represent the best short- and long-term opportunities for employment (201 0 IOF - 84 percent of those who identify themselves as poor pointed to the lack of empl oyment as the principa l cause) and for reducing hunger and poverty. They also help to stabilize rural populations as well as the production of food crops for domestic consumption and to guarantee the population's food and nutritional security. The authorities must begin to consider divers ified agricultural devel opment linking production, manufacturing, and tourism, and additional potential new services. Government will have to play the role of promoting the corporate sector, part icularly agriculture, by promoting agricultural, livestock, and fishing production, promoting rural extension, creati ng production support infrastructures and irrigation systems, as we ll as measures guaranteeing access to credit, by guaranteeing land rights not only to promote production but also th e export of agricultural and fishing products. From this perspective, family farming will continue to merit special attention from the authorities as a development model based on the diversificati on of export crops (particularly cocoa, coffee, peppers and other crops), the production of f ood crops (for the population's own consumption and for sale), and the integration of farming and livestock activities. Medium-sized agricultural companies will have to be restructured, promoting for this purpose the redistribution and/or merg er of abandoned plots and prov iding incentives for extensive livestock production and agricultural act ivities intended for export. In addition to improvements needed in terms of rural property rights, the development of agricultural policy will have to focus on five priorities: (a) Revitalizing the extension system; (b) Adapting agricultural training policy; (c) Improving production quantity and qualit y, particularly for cocoa, coffee, and peppers; (d) Organizing farmers; (e) Promoting exports. On the margin of sectoral policy, the rehabilitati on of rural roads is a precondition for increased production as are improvements in rural housing. 71 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Livestock development should also be one of the bases for agricu ltural diversification, considering the role that this activity plays in the income of rural families. This development should be based on family livestock and corporate livestock operations, par ticularly at the level of medium-sized companies. The government's ro le in this area should amount to: providing technical extension services, strengthening hea lth protection (creati on and updating of laws governing the transport and sale of animals and the animal health code), as well as organizing the importing of medications and access to them, a nd decentralizing animal slaughter activities (creation of small slaughterhous es at the dist rict level). The prospects for small-scale fishing are good an d the current catch level can be improved and more fish provided for the local market, maki ng a large contribution to job creation. Three priority action lines are defined: improve techni ques and thus vessels (more independent boats) and encourage fishing partnerships; create mech anisms to finance the investments needed to increase fishing production and national fish consumption; improve fish transport and preservation conditions. Given the fishing potential on the is land of Pr\u00edncipe, logistical conditions must be created to s upport development of this sector in the region of Pr\u00edncipe in order to create more employment and increase family incomes. Tourism, although not a large sect or at present, nonetheless shows significant development potential because of existing natural conditions (s ea and mountains), the history of the island, the hospitality of its people, and th e tranquility of the islands. Howe ver, this outcome will depend on preconditions to be met, such as a better as sessment of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's tourism products as well as sectoral policie s in the areas of air transport, health and sanitation, the legal framework, and institutional incentives in add ition to other factors. Bearing in mind the country's immense riches and sites, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe must harness its potential in order to increase tourism's contribution to both GDP and job creation. Efforts must be made to increase the occupancy rate of hotel faci lities, extend tourists' average le ngth of stay, and to gradually improve tourism services (car rentals, recreat ional boats, bars, nautical amusements, cultural events, the sale of handicrafts, etc.). In broad outline, the strategy for the private sector will call for improving the legislative framework for doing business in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe and for promoting economic and financial cooperation with the coun tries of the subregion. Incentives must continue to be granted in order to develop small produc tion units in the agri-food area (oilseed, coffee roasting, fruit preservation, beverage production, drying and smoking of fish, etc.). In addition, economic infrastructures play a very important role in im proving the population's living conditions. Investments made in economic infrastructures seek on the one hand to promote employment and to energize the economic base on the other, pr oviding financial resources for families through employment. This is the best way to minimize th e poverty of the strata identified as poor, who represent 66.2 percent of the population. These investments s hould make use of intensive manpower in the context of actions in the economic growth pillar. The benefits to family income of this political option will have a direct imp act on final demand and a multiplier effect boosting the country's economy and improving the population's access to health and education services. It is important to emphasize that the dynamism of the productive sector will depend to a large extent on the development of economic infras tructures: transporta tion (rehabilitation and maintenance of highways and rural roads, cons truction and rehabilitatio n of port and airport 72 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 infrastructures), electricity (improved EMAE ma nagement capacity; increased access in terms of energy quantity and quality of the national network in response to consumer demand; development and updating of electri cal sector legislation; estab lishment of energy efficiency programs; and rehabilitation of the electricity grid - power transmission and distribution (medium and low voltage). Opening up to and diversifying trade with the co ntinent and the world must be the essential function of transportation policy in upcoming year s. To achieve this, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's authorities must call for subregional cooperation in subregional and regional institutions in the sense of recognizing the particul ar characteristics of island mi cro-states like S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, so that those characteri stics can be taken into account in structural projects seeking to achieve the economic integration of Africa within the framework of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Similarly, neighbor ly relations will be st rengthened with the countries of the subregion, with Portuguese-speak ing countries, as well as with the European Union, taking into account the role that the latter plays in trade relations with the continent and the subregion in particular. If the agriculture, livestock, and fishing sectors ar e to represent the primary source of growth, job creation, and income for the national economy in upcoming years, particularly in rural areas, there is an urgent need to define a clear deve lopment policy for the sector to include creating conditions for increased production, diversifica tion, and implementation of small manufacturing industries so as to create products with value added for society, highlighting production chains for this purpose. Considering the above, achievement of the follo wing specific objectives will be pursued over the five-year period: Promote the development of the primary sector as a factor for incr easing national production, creating employment, and relaunching the economic sector; Halt the exodus from rural areas and improve the socioeconomic conditions of rural populations; Develop basic infrastructures to support economic development; Improve the business environment to attract private investment. Ensure environmental sustainability. The objectives established in the area of promo ting sustainable and integrated economic growth will be achieved by carrying out programs under the following headings: 8.1. Developing the primary sector Given the importance of the agricultural sector, particularly farming, livestock, and fishing, for economic growth, poverty reduction, and for food se lf-sufficiency above all, efforts must be 73 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 made to increase and diversify production so as to reduce the country's dependence on imports. Bearing in mind these objectives, th e following programs are decisive: 8.1.1. Program: Promoting the production and productivity of export crops This program aims to improve, increase, and diversify the production of food crops and high- yield crops like cocoa and coffee and to promote new activities such as the growing of vanilla and peppers, in order to diversify exports, increase national income, and reduce external dependence. Policy measures: Decentralize governmental agriculture services; Improve the supply network for the factors of production; Develop structures to proce ss and preserve farm products; Promote and organize marketing channels for chain farmers; Consult on legislative measures to co mbat theft on agricultural properties; Restart the process to control the use of lands distributed within the framework of agrarian reform; Promote the production and guarantee the qua lity of national plant products and their derivatives, in the context of national food security; Rehabilitate and construct infrastructu res to support agri cultural production; Strengthen the existing research center as an institution for conducting scientific and technical monitoring of ag ricultural development; Promote a microcredit policy for the agricultural sector; Adopt an integrated system to control pests and diseases; Promote actions fostering the emergence and strengthening of agricu ltural cooperatives; Strengthen land owners hip title rights. 8.1.2. Program: Increasing and improving the quality of animal production Livestock production should be encouraged, consid ering its role in feeding the population and importance in monetary income formation among rural populations. Policy measures: Strengthen the institutional capacity of the Li vestock Directorate (DP) with human and financial resources to support de velopment of the subsector; Include livestock activity in the diversification of agricultural production; Provide technical support to breeders on the purchase, production, and marketing of all livestock products and zootechni cal and veterinary inputs; Promote and publicize animal breeding t echniques through special microloans; 74 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Provide incentives for the de velopment of raw materials production to manufacturing animal feed in the country; Stimulate family livestock production so that the sector can help keep the population in rural areas and reduce poverty; Maintain sanitary control and nati onal epidemiological surveillance; Establish a research center for livestock development; Regulate the practice of livestoc k breeding at the national level; Develop structures for the processing and preservation of animal products; Promote a microcredit policy for the livestock sector. 8.1.3. Program: Increasing and improving the quality of fish production This program seeks to increase the production and productivity of th e fishing sector by distributing equipment and techniques more suit ed to the development of fishing (purchasing ocean-going ships, increasing fish-aggregating de vices and technical training for fishermen) so as to take advantage of a vast area of unexplored territorial waters, in conjunction with initiatives to promote processing and marketi ng methods and infrastructures. Policy measures: Take initiatives to renegotiate agreements on industrial fishing with the European Union (EU) and Japan in order to obtain greater advantages; Strengthen technical capacities and la boratories for analysis of fish; Update the Health Law to lif t the health embargo on fishi ng products in the European market; Reorganize fishermen and fishmongers ( palai\u00eas ) associations and encourage the creation of cooperatives; Promote increased fish production by enc ouraging small-scale and semi-industrial fishing, improving the fishing practices curren tly used, introducing new technologies, and disseminating new fish-aggregating device models; Strengthen the institutional capacity of the fish ing sector in the Fisheries Directorate; Create a competent authority for san itary control of fish production; Create an information system on fish (soc ioeconomic, biological, statistical, and community development aspects); Improve the supply network for the factors of production and increase microfinance policies. 75 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 8.1.4. Program: Promoting a healthy environment and rational use of natural resources The vulnerability and fragility of coastal ecosyst ems and areas necessitate the appropriate use of the environment, particularly when the negative effects of human pressure become more visible each day, both on geographic space and the na tural resources existing there. The major environmental concern at present involves defo restation. Close to 85 percent of families use wood or charcoal for cooking, and buildings and furniture are basically made of wood, representing a real danger of deforest ation accompanying demographic growth. Policy measures: Protect and preserve ecosystems; Promote sustainable economic development; Improve the Climate Monitoring Network; Strengthen the capacity of environmental institutions; Implement actions consistent with internati onal conventions for the protection of flora, fauna, water resources, biodiversit y, soils, and inherent ecosystems; Implement the management plan for the \u00d4bo national parks of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Build sanitary landfills. 8.1.5. Program: Guaranteeing food security Food security exists when everyone has physic al and economic access to enough healthy and nutritious food at all times to satisfy their energy requirements and food preferences and thus lead a healthy and active life. The domestic availability of food in our country is insufficient for food security, i.e., the supply of foods is insufficient to meet the citizens' consumption needs. To change this situation, a consistent revision of agri cultural policies is needed to make basic family farming a priority and define a food standard based on resp ect for the national food culture. Policy measures: Define agricultural policies making basic family farming a priority as a guarantee of food security; Support food processing and preservation activ ities and consumption of foods rich in proteins and other nutrients; Support the regular organization of nutriti onal education at th e community level. 8.2. Improving the environment for the private sector and strengthening performance in the tertiary sector 8.2.1. Program: Promoting the private sector as a viable option for development of the national economy The country's economic and financial context, coupled with the size of the market, limited infrastructure, weak domestic savings, and the fa ilure of the credit system to adapt have had a 76 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 deterrent effect on projects by economic trans actors. This program seeks to overcome the constraints facing S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's busi ness community and help create an environment favorable to the emergence of a stro ng and competitive private sector. Policy measures: Foster free enterprise as a decisive fact or in the process of economic and social development and the creation of an envir onment favorable to private initiatives; Promote incentives favorable to the creation and growth of micro-, small and medium- sized companies by reducing bureaucracy, simplifying procedures, and establishing flexible ways to access financing; Encourage the creation and roll -out of companies in the coun try's various districts, rural areas, and areas at a disadvant age due to their location, as a way to create income opportunities for the inhabitants of these zones; Revise the institutional and lega l framework supporting the sector; Develop a framework of at tractive tax benefits; Revise the institutional framewor k supporting trade and investment; Revise the labor code to make th e labor market more flexible; Create an agency to promot e exports and investments; Create an electronic system for assigning/ obtaining visas to enter the country. 8.2.2. Program: Promoting tourism and related activities S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe offers ex traordinary tourism potential thanks to its primary attractions (climate, landscape, historical and cultural herita ge, traditions, folklore, handicrafts). This should be used as the basis for the type of secondary attractions to be built (hotels, restaurants, recreation facilities). Given that the country has this potential, this program seeks to give S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe the wherewithal to meet the de mand for tourism, not only in terms of specific equipment and types of recreation, but also in te rms of professionals able to rehabilitate and preserve the historic arch itectural heritage of the rural and urban landscape. Policy measures: Create appropriate legislation to prom ote the country's tourism development; Provide incentives for touris m investments in rural areas; Promote training in the area of tour ism (creation of hotel school); Create better material and human c onditions for the tourism sector; Highlight the natural and sociocultural archit ectural heritage from the perspective of developing tourism; Develop laws governing hot el tourism activities a nd similar activities; 77 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Implement tourism statistics and t ourism satellite account services. 8.2.3. Program: Integrating the economy in the subregion and in the multilateral trade system This program seeks to integrate the country prop erly in the subregion and in the multilateral trade system in order to take full advantage of it s strategic location in the Gulf of Guinea and in the world. Policy measures: Create a National Trade Negotiation Commission; Consolidate the process of ne gotiating with regional orga nizations when reducing intra- African tariff and non-tariff ba rriers, always safeguarding the protection of emerging industries; Continue the process of adapting an d modernizing trade legislation; Promote international partnerships in the trade sector and comm it to subscribing to regional and international trade facilitation instruments; Design and implement actions leading to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe's membership in the WTO. 8.2.4. Program: Developing the oil industry The available data point to e xploration of the oil fields st arting in 2015 or 2016, with as yet unknown effects on the country's macroeconomic a ggregates, since production prospects have not been evaluated as yet. Oil could contribu te to the country's growth, provided that the resources generated are managed transparentl y and in accordance with government accounting standards. Policy measures: Secure national interests in the ZDC; Establish development strategies for oil expl oration and production ac tivities in the ZEE and ZDC; Consolidate and strengthen the ANP-STP as a regulatory agency for the petroleum sector; Reevaluate the geologica l potential of the ZEE. 8.2.5. Program: National program to support microfinance The main objective of this program is to promot e the access of poor or low-income families and micro and small entrepreneurs to microfinance se rvices on a sustainable basis by creating viable institutions integrated in the national financial market. The progr am should also be used as an instrument for implementing national policy in support of building the le gal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the harmonious and se cure development of th e microfinance sector and increased institutional professionalism as we ll as the development of a continuous supply of 78 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 diversified products and services. This program is expected to create tw o specific entities: a national committee to promote microfinance8 and a management unit, in addition to other bodies. Microfinance is a relatively re cent phenomenon in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, does not yet have an institutional-regulatory framewor k, and appears disorganized. It follows that adopting a national microfinance policy is an urgent matter. This microfinance policy should be the result of a concerted approach to promotion of the sector, defining a common vision shared by all the participants, the object ives, and the broad strategic pillars of the sector's development, the guiding pr inciples of the various partners, as well as the critical conditions to be met in order for microfinance to effectivel y carry out its role within the framework of financing the country's development and reducing poverty. This policy must take into account (i) the Nation al Poverty Reduction Stra tegy; (ii) development of the private sector and support for micro and sm all enterprises and, above all, the sector; (iii) the guiding principles, good practic es, and diagnostic assessment of the microfinance sector. Its implementation must respond to the desires of th e beneficiaries, microfinance institutions, the government, donors, and providers of technical support. Financing for the program will be guaranteed with resources from both the government and its partners. Thus, the following policy measures will be adopted: Support interventions targeting th e creation of permanent financial institutions in order to sustainably ensure the populati on's access to financial services; Ensure in microfinance entions, identifying complementarities and potential linkages; Facilitate the adopti on and application of the principl es of a code of ethics on good microfinance practices; Develop and implement a suitable le gal and regulatory framework; Facilitate the implementation of a national microfinance policy; Create a microfinance support fund; Create an institutional framework for th e implementation of microfinance; Create a mechanism for implementing a national microfinance program; Create a microfinance office. 8.3. Developing transportation networks and infrastructures The competitiveness of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is hampered by limited infrastructure. The country lacks modern transport infrastructures such as ports, airports , and roads needed to develop the private sector and stimulate growth. The country's deficient infrastructu re conditions, particularly in te rms of a port and airport, make trade with the rest of the world difficult, lead to high transportation cost s, and reduce the return 8 The unit of the national committee to promote microfinance is the steering committee, a decision-making body for the support program. It defines the program guidelines and the partnership framework as well as other microfinance participants, approves financing decisions for program activities, and ensures follow-up of the program's management (control of the management unit). 79 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 on capital, limiting competitiveness, discourag ing domestic and foreign investment, and hindering economic growth. In this respect, development actions focu s on basic transportati on and communications infrastructures to promote the country' s balanced and sustained development. 8.3.1. Program: Road transport infrastructure The objective of this program is to improve road way operating conditions, thus helping to reduce transportation costs and creating conditions for promotion of the local economy. Policy measures: Reorganize the public transportation network; Do maintenance work on the road network and preserve it; Improve the activities of the Road Maintenance Interest Group (GIME); Develop and implement the roadway mobility plan. 8.3.2. Program: Maritime transport infrastructures Development of maritime transport is a priority given that it serves 90 percent of inter-island trade and trade between the archipelago and the re st of the world. Construction of a deep water port provides a unique opportunity for transforming S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr \u00edncipe into a services center for the region.9 Policy measures: Strengthen the technical and operational capacity of the port of Ana Chaves in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9; Construct a new port in the Au tonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe; Prepare a study for developmen t of coastal shipping; Construct a deep-water port. 8.3.3. Program: Airport modernization and expansion The modernization and expansion of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe's airports, most particularly the international airport of S\u00e3o To m\u00e9, is a prerequisite for promoting its development. These interventions seek to promote the link between the islands and the rest of the world. This program thus proposes to create the conditions needed to welc ome larger airplanes by extending landing strips and aprons and expanding the pa ssenger terminal in S\u00e3oTom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Policy measures: Improve the infrastructures for safely rece iving and handling airplanes; Lengthen aprons (taxiway); 9 The technical-financial viability study for constructio n of the deep water port in Fern\u00e3o Dias, budgeted at US$475,990 has already been prepared. An agreemen t was signed in July 2007 with the third largest container operator (Terminal Link) to build the deep water port. Construction work has not begun so far. 80 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Expand the passenger terminal to meet the country's development needs; Improve fire-fighting services, as well as communication and navigation support services; Improve the management of the proce ss for recertifying ai rway capacities; Provide the National Civil Aviation Instit ute (INAC) with mode rn and appropriate legislation; Give the airports security equipment and appropriate information technology; Attract other airline companies to provide services in STP; Improve the quality of user services; Construct a new runway at least 1,800 meters long in Pr\u00edncipe and adapt airport infrastructures to meet the requirements of regional and na tional development. 8.4. Strengthening access to infrastr uctures to support development 8.4.1. Program: Providing reliable and low-cost energy The secure supply of electrical energy plays an important role in ensuring the progress of the country's economic and social activities. Investment for electrification is considered one of the important conditions for successfu lly stimulating economic and social development. In order to increase energy production and efficiency and reduce the country's dependence on imported fuel, consideration will be given to methods fo r rapidly increasing the share of hydroelectric power and improving the technical capacity of the national Water and Electricity Corporation (EMAE). Finally, a study will be conducted on pot ential in the area of alternative energy (biomass, wood, wind and solar energy). Policy measures: Increase the installed capacity and production of electr ical energy; Improve the electrical transm ission and distribution grid; Improve and expand energy services to populations; Strengthen the management capacities of th e EMAE, prioritizing technical maintenance services, and increase the co mpany's management autonomy; Rehabilitate and create netw ork security conditions; Organize and regulate the energy market; Implement electrical power generation projec ts using renewable energy sources (solar, hydro, and wind); Involve the private sector in the production of electricity. 8.4.2. Program: Promoting and developing the telecommunications network 81 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 This program seeks to implement a broad reform of the telecommunications sector based on a strategy to maximize investment opportunities, m eet the demand for new services, and improve effectiveness and efficiency. Policy measures: Develop universal services, w ith particular impact on basi c telephone servi ces in rural regions; Define a sectoral legal and regulatory framew ork to ensure the promotion of investments in the sector and clarify the specific obj ectives of the government and network and services operators. Development of new services provided by ICTs. 8.4.3. Program: Land use planning and urban planning The establishment of a National Policy on Land Use Planning and Urban Planning is considered an imperative for the objectives of poverty re duction and for pursuing the development goals. Land use planning promotes job cr eation and helps to allocate equipment and infrastructure, increasing accessibility to that equipment w ith the resulting reduction in inequalities. Policy measures: Develop a National Land Use Plan; Create a Geographic Information System (SIG); Continue with the ESPERG-IPAD projec t on formation and updating of national mapping; Proceed with topographical surveys in areas of expansion and design and draw up an integrated plan to detail soil use and occupancy activities as well as services areas, residential areas, recreational areas, nationa l parks, schools, hospitals, shopping, etc.; Update the cities' topographi cal plans for installation of local supporting social infrastructures; Develop basic laws on land use planning, registry, and mapping; Develop urban planning in conjunction with the regional government and district chambers; Promote technical-vocational tr aining for geographic and re gistry services and local government staff. 8.4.4. Program: Constructing low-cost housing In the area of housing, there is a continued housin g deficit amounting to 60 percent and there are no general construction regulati ons governing urban constructi on and housing in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. This program proposes to create targeted but no t just social housing programs to include both low- and middle-income families, making different types of housing availa ble at various prices based on the users' social level. Policy measures: 82 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Give the IHI (Residential Housing Institute) properly qualified human resources and financial resources needed to make its services more operational; Create an ad hoc multisectoral committee, to include IHI members, local governments, and cooperation to be more proactive with th e cooperation partners in order to obtain material and financial resources; Create do-it-yourself construction brigades or construction cooperatives in all the country's districts in order to reduce costs, ta king social characteri stics into account and involving the community or familie s in building their own homes; Update the entire registry of government properties and adopt coercive collection measures or utilize the banking system; Create a housing promotion fund that is prope rly structured and targeted for social housing, with collection of re venues through real estate; Encourage and support private companies or privat e initiatives that want to invest in the real estate market; Create new neighborhoods based on integrated projects with social housing, recreational areas, schools, shopping, health centers, etc.; Plan and build social housing based on current categories and at low cost; Develop a national policy and a Strate gic Housing and Real Estate Plan; Establish housing investment priorities for low-income groups or those most in need (large family groups), taking into account ge nder approaches and respecting principles on proper treatment of those with any type of disability; Develop a basic housing promotion law; 8.5. Mainstreaming climate change issues in the country's development policies Available statistical analyses and date on risk analysis indicate that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is susceptible to threats from both man and nature. The group of natura l threats includes threats that have a hydrometrical, geological, or biologi cal source and the group of man-made threats includes threats with a technologi cal and environmental source. Based on this data and taking into account the objectives outlined in the Kyoto Conference on climate change,10 S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe must strive to instill a culture of prevention and response to the consequences of climate chan ge, mainstreaming climate change issues in planning for all sectors of national life, so as to minimize biodiversity losses, combined with 10 The Kyoto Conference outlined two broad objectives: 1. More effective integration of disaster risk analys is in sustainable development policies, plans, and programs at all levels, based on prevention, m itigation, and disaster prevention as well as on reducing vulnerability; 2. The creation and strengthening of institutions, mech anisms, and capacities that are able to contribute systematically to increased resilience against threats, at all levels, particularly the community level. 83 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 efforts to reduce food [insecurity] and vulnerability in general. In this context, urgent measures are needed to ensure: (a) Mandatory inclusion of the \"Climate Change\" dimension in sectoral and national diagnostic assessments in order to minimi ze and restore the environmental costs of development policies; (b) Creation of competence and knowledge regard ing the importance of climate change in the country's sustainable development process; (c) Mainstreaming of climate change i ssues in national a nd sectoral plans; (d) Advocacy actions with decision-makers on the harmful effects of climate change; (e) Promotion of awareness campaigns to inform the population concerning the harmful effects of climate change; (f) Training of sectoral expert s and civil society regarding th e basic concepts of climate change, as well as its harmful effects. (g) Urgent preparation of a guide on integrating climate change issues in the instruments of development policy, as well as in their implementation. 9. Pillar 3: Developing human capital and improving basic social services Rationale for intervention: The development of hu man capital is one of the central concerns in assessing the possibilities and oppor tunities for a substantial reduc tion in the percentage of the population living in poverty, considering that the combination of actions in various fields requires capacities and skills ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency needed to produce results that match and satisfy the population's expectatio ns. This means that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe needs human capital of a quantity and quality to ensu re that it can act in priority areas and ensure gains in effectiveness and efficiency in its efforts to combat poverty. Thus, it is committed to improving human res ources education and training, through basic education and vocational training to foster a bett er approach among citizens to the issues of well- being (health, environmental sanitation) and produc tivity and promote the ex ercise of citizenship and mutual respect. For this reason, in order to \"dem ocratize education and restructure the educa tional system,\" the government believes that human resources develo pment should be tied to policy measures that are not just educational but also relate more broadly to vocational qualification and requalification. Education, as a priority area, is one way to ensure promotion of the individual and the preparation of society as a w hole. Thus, there should be continued efforts to extend basic education to six years and guara ntee the quality and effectiven ess of teaching and learning. However, the strengthening of human capital requires more than improving the quality of education and access to it by the poor and direc ting the poor to vocational education. It also requires continuing programs to combat AIDS and control the malaria vector as well as improvements in health services delivery. 84 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 For this reason, the specific strategic objectives for the de velopment of human capital and improvement of basic social services are as follows: Develop quality education and promote vocati onal training in priority development areas; Guarantee by 2016 that all children and school-aged youth complete basic education; Guarantee by 2016 that 100 percent of the population has access to quality basic health services. To achieve these objectives, actions will be deve loped in programs under the following headings: 9.1. Improving access, equity, and quality in the system of education and training Inasmuch as human resources are one of the mo re important and long-term resources a country must have, educational policy should be desi gned so that various training categories and modalities are made available to all social group and age brackets. Thus, it becomes necessary to ensure conditions of access and acces sibility for all, at all levels of education, particularly basic and secondary education, while at the same tim e making the effort needed to guarantee that children stay in school and to promote academic success. The intent is to help improve educational acce ss, equity, quality, and management to respond to educational needs, the Millennium Developmen t Goals (MDGs), and Education for All (EFA) goals. 9.1.1. Program - Preschool education Policy measures: Revise and update the curriculu m for preschool education; Create standards for preschool education; Rehabilitate and build children's institutions; Regulate the activities of all teaching staff; Carry out training activities fo r all teaching staff, managers , inspectors, and supervisors in preschool education. 9.1.2. Program - Basic education Policy measures: Strengthen system capacities to ensure widesp read access to school and a full six years of basic schooling; Strengthen school canteens and make them ge nerally available in basic education; Effectively implement the vocational career plan; 85 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Expand educational supply; Update the legislative framework; Define the school management regime; Train human resources. 9.1.3. Program - Secondary education Policy measures: Implement a vocational career plan; Expand educational supply; Strengthen institutional capacity; Update the legislative framework; Define the school management regime; Train human resources; Implement 12th grade across the bo ard throughout the public system. 9.1.4. Program - Special education Policy measures: Update the legislative framework; Revise and update the st rategy and curriculum; Expand access to the district capitals; Train human resources. 9.1.5. Program - Higher education Instruct and train human resources in the most diverse areas of knowledge and learning in order to respond to the needs for skills in the labor market and the challenges of development. Policy measures: Expand the supply of training services in vari ous areas in order to meet current demand. 86 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 9.1.6. Program - Technical vocational education Policy measures: Develop and approve the law gove rning vocational training; Strengthen the capacity of institutions involved in vocational training; Create a technical and vocational education department; Increase and diversify the supply of quality vocational training; Include young people in vocational training structures and create conditions for the formation of microenterpris es of young boys and girls. 9.1.7. Program - Continuing education/literacy Policy measures: Eradicate illiteracy among youth olde r than age 15 and among adults; Promote education for young people and adults in coordination with income-producing activities and incorporate in job market. 9.2. Improving access to and quality of health , the water supply, and basic sanitation Under this heading, the aim is to help improve access to and equity in both preventive and curative healthcare services and to improve access to drinking water and basic sanitation. 9.2.1. Program: Equitable access to and use of healthcare and viability of the healthcare system Policy measures: Construct new hospitals to reduce the time n eeded for patients/users to travel to the hospital; Train and hire medical staff; Improve and restore existing hos pitals and health centers; Improve the country's exis ting maternity services; Improve the quality of hea lth care services so as to reduce waiting time at hospitals; Develop specialty servic es at hospital centers; Regulate, encourage, and supervise the development of the private health sector. 9.2.2. Program: Rehabilitation, expansion, a nd improvement of water supply systems Policy measures: Promote the rational use of water resource services; 87 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Rehabilitate water supply, transp ort, and distri bution networks; Construct dams and reservoirs in agricu ltural areas where water is most scarce; Consolidate studies of river basi ns as well as of the potential of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Rehabilitate the water supply system; Renovate and expand the water supply sy stem to meet growing demand; Improve the sector's institutional apparatus; Approve a water code. 9.2.3. Program: Improving access to basic sanitation Policy measures: Properly inventory all wetland areas in S\u00e3o To m\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe so that a consistent wetland policy can be defined; Rehabilitate the old sewer systems for rainwa ter disposal in the city of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and construct new systems; Promote a broad campaign to encourag e healthy habits and lifestyles; Construct improved latrines; Promote policies for building houses with bathrooms in urban areas 10. Pillar 4: Strengthening social cohesion and social protection Rationale: Social cohesion is a fundamental princi ple for building a more inclusive and balanced society, and for mitigating poverty. Under curr ent conditions, however, persistent social inequalities continue to impede the exercise of rights of citizenship. Moreover, inequality has serious consequences for children's development, a dignified life for seniors, and social participation by those with disabilities. Young people and women heads of household swell the ranks of vulnerable groups, which lack occupati onal options and employment opportunities that would enable them to improve their living c onditions. In most cases, individual survival strategies are adopted simply to fulfill the obj ectives of meeting imme diate needs and do not prioritize concerns with rationali zing resources and preserving the environment. Cultural and moral principles and values are being eroded in an environment th at lacks guidance and education in best practices. The intention of the measures pl anned under this pillar is to improve living conditions for the population. This will be done by carrying out pr ograms in support of social inclusion, particularly for the most vulnerable groups - such as family heads living in extreme poverty, the unemployed, and pensioners - to enable them to develop the ability to support themselves. Programs will also provide care for the victims of disasters and natural cata strophes; assist needy and vulnerable seniors in every district throughout the country; combat child labor, the sexual abuse and exploitation of minors, and domestic violence; and work toward a level playing field for men and women. The following strategic objectiv es have been identified: 88 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 1. Promote the national identity and devel op the country's cultural heritage 2. Guarantee equality and gender equity 3. Promote initiatives for the effective protec tion of vulnerable or disadvantaged social groups with policies of s upport and social inclusion 10.1 Promoting citizenship and social equity 10.1.1 Program: Developing and preserving the hi storical and cultural identity of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Culture is the calling card of a people and the driv er of a country's development. The country is facing trends, such as globalization, that are lead ing to a crisis of identity. Accordingly, dynamic cultural policies need to be developed and adopted, to support the process of regional integration and the dynamics of global transformation while safeguarding national dive rsity. In this way we can underwrite our country's identity. Against this backdrop, it will be imperative to engage in cross-cutting efforts to ponder the importance of dialogue in affirming national culture. The aim of the program is to reinforce S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe's cultural identity to contribute to the development of culture by implementing strategi es that work toward meeting the needs of all citizens. Policy measures: Define and prepare an inventory of th e national cultural heritage in close collaboration with district chambers a nd the Autonomous Authority of Pr\u00edncipe; Take urgent action at the archives of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe to conserve and preserve existing assets, including the mandatory incorporation of relevant documentation of a historic nature into the Historic Archives of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Record the general history of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Develop historical memory by erecting st atues and monuments of major figures and role models from the history an d culture of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Promote cultural manifestations threaten ed by extinction (quin\u00e1 and others); Promote greater interconnection between traditional and scientific medicine to take advantage of the development poten tial offered by the country's flora; Salvage ethical and moral values by streng thening the national cultural identity; Improve the linkages between the cultural sector, cultural sponsors, and producers of culture; Create networks of cu ltural groups, and men and women of culture; Promote creativity and revitalize the culture of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Promote research in various areas of cultu re in order to gain a better knowledge of the country's social, cultural, and historical reality; Preserve historic sites and build historic monuments and landmarks; Build the institutional capacity of the Directorate of Culture; 89 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Develop and preserve colonial architecture, chiefly in rural areas, in view of its advanced condition of deterioration; 10.1.2 Program: Promoting gender equality and equity This program aims to promote equality between men and women and diminish the marginalization of women in order to achieve sustainable human development and eradicate poverty. Policy measures: Improve women's access to decision-making positions; Create conditions to ensure greater acce ss for girls to the various levels of education; Accustom children (girls and boys) to part icipate equally in a ll tasks - at home and at school; Promote actions to eliminat e all forms of violence. 10.1.3 Programs: Promoting youth and sport Policy measures: Reinforce the legal framework a nd regulate the Youth Institute Develop and implement the National Youth Plan 10.2 Social assistance and social protection 10.2.1 Program: Development of the social protection system This program calls for the adoption of a series of transfers in the form of facilities for basic services to which all citizens should have access, i.e. social protection that prioritizes the most vulnerable and the need for poor families to break the cycle of inte r-generationa l poverty. Policy measures: Develop a National Strategy for Social Pr otection that brings all programs under one conceptual umbrella and serves as a guide for the development of an efficient and effective system of social protection; Budget for an operating plan to implem ent the strategy that includes secure sources of financing and clearly id entifies partners for cooperation; Develop a lobbying plan to obtain the fi scal space for financing the operating plan; Develop a plan for the development of pub lic service staff in the social sphere. 11. Priority areas The phenomenon of poverty breaks down into multiple scarcities and results in the perpetuation of needs that call for setting multiple priorities in terms of sectors and areas of intervention. Accordingly - and in the context of a crisis in wh ich there is uncertainty as to the actual potential for mobilizing resources - the Government intends to identify those areas having the highest 90 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 priority for action in order to effectively ensu re macroeconomic stability and access to basic goods for decent survival. To this end, the following interven tion areas have been identified: (i) Good governance, judicial credibility, and m acroeconomic stability - considering that it is urgent to redefine the mission of th e Government, adapt human and material resources based on that mission, reorgani ze government operations, and revamp government management. In the legal sphere, reforms are needed to improve the credibility and increase the swiftness of th e judiciary. Specificall y, these include, inter alia, modernizing the legislat ure, strengthening and traini ng judges, introducing legal inspection, and ensuring universal access to justice and compliance with obligations and contracts. In the area of public financ ial management, it is urgent to continue actions to consolidate the gains already made. Specifically, this calls for, inter alia, improving the regulatory framework underlying the management of public finances, improving government accountability, enhancing the public procurement and contracting system, improving information syst ems, refining the system for collection of taxes and other fiscal a nd non-fiscal revenues; and inte grating the various services and institutions involved in resource ad ministration within a single information systems platform. (ii) Recovery, promotion, and diversification of production - to enable the primary sector, and specifically agriculture, livestock and fishing, to move toward playing a significant role in the coming years. It is th ese areas that hold out the best short- and medium-term prospects for employment, reduction of hunger and poverty, and contributions toward stabilizing rural populations. (iii)Strengthening and upgrading of basic economic infrastructure - in view of its crucial role in improving living conditions for the popul ation. In addition, ma intaining a dynamic productive sector is also largely contingent upon th e development of economic infrastructure. Included here are: trans portation - rehabilitati on and maintenance of roads and rural tracks, construction and rehabilitation of port and airport facilities; electric energy - improvements in the management capacity of the Water and Electricity Corporation (EMAE), increased access to energy in terms of quantity and quality for the national grid to meet demand from consumers, development and updating of legislation on the electricity s ector, establishment of programs for energy efficiency, and rehabilitation of the electri city transport and distribution system, both medium and low tension. (iv) Development of human capital and social so lidarity - because improving education and training for human resources in the form of basic educati on and occupational training, in addition to increasing the involvement of cities and citizens in issues of well-being (health and sanitation) and productivity pr omotes the exercise of citizenship and mutual respect. In this regar d, it is equally urgent to pr ioritize issues relating to health, sanitation, and a safe water supply. This entails promoting improvements in the workings and performance of the heal th care system; improvements in access and quality for primary health care and speci alized health care services; promoting communication campaigns to change behaviors; strengthening capacity to train health care workers; pursuing efforts to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV/AIDS; reducing infant mortality rates and mortal ity among children under five years of age; improving the availability of medicine and inputs (anti- malarial, anti-retroviral, 91 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 tuberculostatic drugs, impregnated mosquito nets, screening tests, and diagnostic equipment and supplies); pursuing campaigns to combat malaria and non-contagious diseases; upgrading sanitary infrastructure ; and improving access and coverage of the population in terms of safe water and basi c sanitation: information, education, and communication on water management, cons truction of drainage systems and treatment of sewers, construc tion and rehabilitation of wa ter capture systems, rural water supply, and a stronger institutional and legal framework for the water and sanitation sector. Social safety nets will also be strengthened to benefit the neediest, specifically by setting up day care centers and centers to se rve children at risk, among others. 12. Macroeconomic prospects for 2012-2016 12.1 International macroeconomic prospects The global economy is undergoing a rapid rec overy following the severe recession of 2009. Indeed, following a decline of 0.7 percent in 2009 , global output grew 5 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2011. However, the pace of recovery vari es substantially from one region to another, with emerging market economies and certain de veloping countries posting a stronger dynamic. The recovery in the global economy is expected to continue in 2012 at a similar rate as in 2011, according to calculations by the IMF. In the commodities market, prices for energy products (petroleum products) are rising in response to strong global dema nd and supply shocks. Brent crude oil, which was selling at US$63.21 per barrel in 2009, less than in 2008, incr eased to US$93.21 per barrel. Expectations are that the rising trend will continue in the comi ng years. Brent transactions are expected to be priced at US$95.34 per barrel in 2012 and US$119.34 in 2016. With respect to nonoil products such as food, pr ices for major consumer staples fell in 2011 globally. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Orga nization of the United Nations (FAO) stood at 211 points in December 2011, 5.5 per cent lower than the same month the year before. The drop was caused by a sudden decline in wo rld prices for grain, edible oil, sugar, and dairy products. FAO projections call for a contin ued drop in food prices for most of 2012 as a result of the expected increase in supply for se veral basic food staples a nd uncertainty about the global economic situation. The US economy also recovered from the severe recession of 2009, posting an increase in real GDP of close to 3 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011. Growth was supported mainly by private consumption, driven by fiscal stimulus measures and exports. IMF projections call for growth in real GDP on the orde r of 1.8 percent in 2012. Inflation remains stable and moderate. The Eurozone economies are showing a more mo dest rate of economic growth after having suffered a severe economic recession in 2009 of -4.3 percent. Despite th e elevated financial instability seen in 2010 in the Eurozone, econom ic results were surprisingly positive, with growth of 1.8 percent in 2010 and 1.7 percent in 2011. Economic growth is expected to slow to 1.1 percent in 2012. The level of inflation in th e euro area, as measured by the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI), posted a rate of 1.6 percent in 2010 and 2.5 percent in 2011. Projections for 2012 called for the infl ation rate to fall to 1.5 percent. [...text missing...] sub-Saharan Africa. Albeit to a lesser degree, the su b-Saharan economy was also affected by the international financial cris is, with the rate of ec onomic growth declining 92 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 from 7.2 percent in 2007 to 2.7 percent in 2009, the lowest figure in recent years. However, the pace of economic activity recovered rapidly, pos ting growth of 5.4 percent and 5.2 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Projections for 2012 call for an expansion in economic activity of 5.8 percent. However, the sustainability of ec onomic growth continues to depend to a large degree on the external economic s ituation, prices for commodities , the continued existence of domestic stimulus, and strong capital infl ows from foreign di rect investment. Inflation in sub-Saharan Afri ca stood at 7.5 percent in 2010 and 8.4 percent in 2011, higher in both cases than in 2009. The Chinese economy weathered the crisis very well wi th the help of expansi onist fiscal policies. In 2009, growth surpassed 9 percent, and in 2010 and 2011 it reached figures verging on 10 percent. Projections for 2012 call fo r growth of around 9 percent. At the same time, inflationary pressures increased as a result of rising food prices caused mainly by problems with supply. In Japan, following a severe economic recession of 6.3 percent in 2009, the greatest recession in recent years, the economy grew 4 percent in 2010 . In 2011, Japan was tragically hit by a strong earthquake and tsunami that took the lives of thousands of vict ims, caused serious damage to nuclear power stations, and disrupted the enti re workings of the economy, which led to a recession in economic activity (-0.5 percent). Growth of 2.3 percent is projected for 2012. 12.2 Domestic macroeconomic prospects The macroeconomic situation for the period 2012- 2016 was conceived in terms of two scenarios, as follows: (i) the base scenario, which assumes that petroleum production and exports will start up in 2015; and (ii) an alternative scenario without petroleum production and exports. Both scenarios assume that the nominal exchange rate will continue to be indexed to the euro at the rate of STD 24,500 to EUR 1. Budget projectio ns are based on the assumption that the Government will continue to make timely payments for the supply of energy, through an effort that will combine strong budget discipline, struct ural reforms to the EMAE, and the adoption of an automatic indexing mechanism for retail fu el prices. The chief characteristics of macroeconomic prospects under both scenarios are as follows: Under the petroleum scenario, growth will rise to 6 percent by 2014 and take off thereafter with the start-up of oil production and exports, while inflation will fall to single digits. The Government is expected to hold the domestic primary deficit steady at about 3 percent of GDP until 2014, in line with available financing, wh ile the deficit on current account is expected to decline. Under the non-petroleum scenar io, projections call for growth at a lower rate than under the petroleum scenario, in th e absence of oil-re lated investment spending and the knock-on effects of oil revenues. Budget financing will be limited, and the Government will tend to adopt more restrictive budget policies and aim for a dom estic primary deficit of around 2 percent of GDP. 12.2.1 Base scenario External environment As the global economy recovers, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe will be able to star t reaping the benefits of its public investment program , making positive strides in tourism and telecommunications as well as additional investments in the oil sector. Proj ections call for oil prices to remain high or at 93 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 least sufficient to attract addi tional investments in this sect or through the medium term. The country is highly dependent upon imports and th erefore fluctuations in world prices for commodities and in the euro-dolla r exchange rate have a major impact on domestic inflation. The expected moderation in oil and food prices in the medium term should offset the projected weakening of the euro and the dobr a (STD) with respect to the dolla r (US$). The rate of growth in imports will fall in tandem with the decline in world commodity prices. Prospects for growth and infl ation and sector projections The best way to reduce poverty is by increasi ng growth in real GDP. The economic growth strategy is laying the foundation for devel opment of the private sector and economic diversification. Prospects for the medium-term (2012-2016) call for annual growth in GDP of close to 5.5 percent in 2012 and 6 percent until 2014 (table 1 in the annex). Oil production will take GDP growth to close to 25 percent in 2015. Th e drivers of growth will relate to drilling in the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria and potentially in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as well, since there is pot ential for drilling oil wells in blocks 2, 3, and 4. The construction sector will benefit from investments in the areas of transportation infr astructure (ports and airports), as well as energy and telecommuni cations. The social investment program will continue to be supported with funds provide d by international donors. Improvements in infrastructure will help promote growth in tourism, external transport services, and telecommunications. Projected inflation will reflect the expected decline in prices for nonoil commodities over the medium term. Inflation is expected to fall fr om an average of 14.3 percent in 2011 to about 9 percent in 2012, and then continue to decline to about 3 percent by 2015, as the parity set vis-\u00e0- vis the euro succeeds in managing inflationary expectations and as economic diversification continues. Public finances In the medium term, the Governme nt's objective is to stabilize the domestic primary deficit to keep it in line with available non-debt-generating financing. To this end, the Government plans to step up revenue collection and mobilize more domestic revenues as the benefits of the economic expansion resulting from starting up petroleum production accrue, as of 2015. Total revenues, excluding oil revenues, should increase from STD 0.8 billion (1 7.5 percent of GDP) in 2011 to STD 1.4 billion (16 percent of GDP) in 2016 (see tables 2 and 3 in the annex). The major source of revenue growth will be tax revenues - chiefly direct taxes - which are projected to increase about 1 percentage point of GDP in the medium term as a result of efforts to mobilize tax revenues by means of measures to improve th e tax and customs administrations. In addition to these efforts, the Government plans to contro l spending, and particularly to give priority to spending on goods and services and transfers that are compatible with available resources. Generally speaking, the overall pr imary deficit should improve gra dually to 3 percent of GDP by 2014, rising to close to 6 percen t of GDP as oil production and exports get under way, as the Government implements its public investment pr ogram. Financing in the form of budget support grants is expected to be pr ovided by the World Bank, other deve lopment partners such as the European Union, and regional partners, while the G overnment will continue to transfer resources from the National Petroleum Account. As of 2015, financing will come mainly from oil revenues. 94 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 External sector and prospects for debt The external current account deficit is not expected to improve significantly with the start-up of oil production, based on the assumption that major oil-related investments will need to be made in 2015 and 2016. 11 When oil production commences in 2015, the spike in exports will be largely offset by the strong expected increase in imports relating to large-scale oil investments in 2015 and 2016, on the order of US$200 million. The im provement in the trade balance deficit will be offset by an expected worsening in net fa ctor services relating to profit remittances and cost recovery by oil companies (tables 4 and 5 in the annex). Growth in pre-oil exports will be driven by increases in co coa production, re-exports of fuel to air and sea transport companies as S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe rehabili tates the airport and implements connectivity, and an expansion in tourism. External financing should remain more or le ss unchanged, given the expectation that private flows - particularly foreign direct investme nt - will support the expected growth in oil investment, while grant financing should dimini sh as a proportion of total financing as the country makes the transition from grants to loans under the Agency for International Development (AID). Even with the start-up of oil production, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe still presents a high risk of overindebtedness. A recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA),12 prepared jointly by the IMF and the World Bank, shows that the net present value of the debt to exports ratio remains above the indicative threshold spec ified for the country for an extended period of time. Overall external debt indicators are high in the short term but should begin to fall after oil production and exports commence in 2015. It should be noted in this regard that the projected debt profile is consistent with a high but manag eable debt dynamic and that the country will be able to meet its current obligations. Monetary projections Projections call for monetary expansion hand in hand with economic growth. Credit to the private sector should rise a bout 10 percent per annum during the period 2012-2016 with a spike in growth in 2015 when oil revenues begin to en ter the economy (tables 6 and 7 in the annex). The rate of expansion in the monetary base will be consistent with maintaining gross international reserves equivalent to approximately 4 months of imports, averaging 13.5 percent per annum. Currency circulation speed should co ntinue to be about 2.7 percent until oil production commences. Foreign direct investment inflow s in preparation for petroleum production will raise the level of international reserves from about 3.5 months of imports at the end of 2011 to about 4 months of imports at the end of 2014. When oil production begins in 2015, intern ational reserves are expected to rise to about 5 m onths of imports in the medium term. The nominal exchange rate should remain linked to the euro at the rate of STD 24,500 to EUR 1, supported by a line of credit from the Portuguese treasury. The dobra - like the euro - is expected to depreciate gradually vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar. Bank supervision will be strengthened with peri odic inspection visits, regular monitoring of bank solvency indicators such as the loans-to-deposits ratio, the review of bank business plans, and the implementation of a liquidity management framework. 11 This assumption will be monitored closely in the coming months. 12 IMF report 12/34. 95 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 12.2.2 Alternative scenario (nonoil) External environment This scenario assumes that the amounts of oil reserves to be discovered in the ZDC and ZEE will not be commercially viable. In this case, the co untry will have to seek to diversif y its export base. Donor assistance will also be more critical to modernize the country's infrastructure and train capacity in economic management. Prospects for growth and inflation It is assumed that growth in real GDP will be 0.5 percent of GDP, less than under the oil scenario, in 2013-14. This reflects lower inflows of petroleum-rela ted foreign direct investment and a slower rate of implementation of the G overnment's public investment program in the absence of financing generated by oil revenues (table 8 in the anne x). In the long term, projections call for steady growth in the range of 5.5 per cent, at close to the historic norm. In order to achieve this potential, sound macroec onomic policies will be needed, together with measures to improve the investment climate, and the successful implementation of a tourism development strategy. Growth will be driven by t ourism, agriculture, and fishing. In the absence of oil, investment will need to be funded by infl ows of grants. Projections for inflation remain unchanged, since inflation is influenced above all by external factors and exchange parity. Public finances In the absence of oil production, resources to finance the budget would be more limited, since the Government would not be able to continue to re ly on the oil bonanza. Re sources in the National Petroleum Account would be scarcer and economic activity would be less intense, generating a lower level of tax revenues. In this event, the Government would adopt a target for the domestic primary deficit of about 2 percent of GDP up to 2016, which would be in line with available non- debt-generating financing (tables 9 and 10 in the annex). This w ould require an adjustment of close to 1.5 percentage points of GDP in the medi um term. To this end, the Government plans to redouble its efforts to mobilize more revenues, and expects that tota l revenues will rise to close to 17 percent of GDP in 2016. The e xpectation is that measures re lating to the tax administration and intended to expand the tax base will generate an increase in tax revenues and help mitigate the impact of the lack of oil revenues. At th e same time, the Government intends to limit non- priority spending and keep the payroll at the same level in real terms. Under this scenario, the Government would continue to depend on grants from its development partners to provide budget support. External sector and prospects for debt The projected deficit on the exte rnal current account (excluding official transfers) would fall from about 48 percent of GDP in 2011 to a near medium-term level of 30 percent of GDP in 2016, reflecting the decline in imports that w ould occur under the hypothesis that petroleum- related projects are not impleme nted (tables 12 and 13 in the a nnex). It would be difficult to obtain resources to finance the current account de ficit since it is unlik ely that non-concessional loans could be maintained at the unsustain ably high levels posted in 2009-2011. Capital investment of about US$24 milli on to be financed by concessi onal loans in 2013 and 2014 would have to be deferred to avoid a pot entially unsustainable debt dynami c. In order to maintain debt sustainability, external indebtedness will have to be reduced in 2012-2015 by about 3 percent of GDP per annum. In the absence of investment opportunities in the oil s ector, foreign direct 96 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 investment flows will fall to about 6.5 percent of GDP, which is consistent with the average for sub-Saharan countries. Grant fina ncing is expected to remain near historical norms, but the mobilization of additional grants could attenuate the impact of lower borrowing levels for capital investments. Under the nonoil scenario, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe would continue to present a high risk of overindebtedness in the medium term and would be more vuln erable to adverse economic shocks. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase stead ily to more than 30 percent before falling off gradually as a result of a co mbination of fiscal discipline and GDP growth. Ensuring debt sustainability over the longer te rm would require a sustained effort at budget adjustment. Monetary projections With the decline in investment in the oil se ctor, demand for currency would soften, along with foreign exchange deposits at commercial banks . The monetary base would grow at a rate compatible with maintaining gross usable intern ational reserves equivalent to approximately 4 months of imports, at an average of about 11 percent per annum (versus 13.5 percent per annum under the oil scenario). Slower growth in the monetary base and a slower accumulation of net external assets would lower the ra te of growth in net domestic asse ts. Credit to the private sector would rise at about 8 percent a year between 2012 and 2016, compared to a rate of 10 percent in the event of a start-up in oil production (tables 13 and 14 in the annex). 12.3 Risks Major vulnerabilities in the medium term include slower growth in GDP, continued financial and economic problems in Europe, and shocks in global prices. Slower GDP growth could occur as a result of the failure to discover petroleum in commercially viable quantities in the JD Z and EEZ or financial problems in the developed countries. The high risk of recession in the develope d world generates a significant risk of deterioration in the outlook presented here. Problems in the Eurozone, the major source of investment and trade for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, could limit the country's prospects for growth. Economic disturbances in the Euro zone countries, especially Portugal, would have immediate repercussions on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 a nd Pr\u00edncipe through the resulting decline in external aid, financial flows, and remittances. Shocks in global prices for food and fuel c ould generate an adverse impact on inflation by raising the effective real exchange rate and reducing the country's competitiveness, in addition to having an enormous adverse impact on the poor. 13. IMPLEME NTATIO N, MO NITORI NG, A ND EVALUATIO N MECHA NISM The existence of a functional structure for im plementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy will ensure the effective implementation of the actions planned. Nevertheless, the experience with the monito ring mechanism for the first PRSP disclosed weaknesses and indicated deficient functionality owing to limited commitment at the sector and national levels. This situation - wh ich could also be attributed to distortions in the horizontal and vertical relationships among th e institutions responsible fo r the programming, execution, and 97 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 monitoring of strategic prioriti es - necessarily impacted both performance and the quality and dissemination of information and statistical data , and therefore the evaluation of the actions taken, as well as their impact. Accordingly, one of the main pillars of the Fi ve-Year Strategy is to strengthen the existing mechanism so that once it is fully functional it can take on with greater determination the commitment to implement, monitor, and evalua te the strategy based on the programs set up. To this end, and considering that what is at st ake is the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation mech anism for the strategy, a process should be undertaken to amend the provisions of Decree-Law 32/2005 in order to: Create conditions for the regular functioning of the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation mechanism; Incorporate the Aid C oordination Unit (ACU); Provide for the participation of the Budget Directorate; Strengthen the role of the Poverty Reduction Observatory and define the institutional framework for its relationsh ips with the other institutions involved, specifically the Planning Directorate and the National Statistics Institute; Redefine the focal points for the various sectors as well as regional and local decision-making bodies; Clarify the forms of participation (whe ther monitoring or contribution) for technical and financial partners; Ensure that the institutions involved, at the central, regional, and district levels, are accountable for the process of co llecting, systematizing, and disseminating information and data relating to the pr ocess of implementing and monitoring the programs provided for, as well as the ev aluation of their re spective results and impact. 13.1 Organization figure for implementa tion, monitoring, and evaluation The organization figure for the implementation, monitoring, and evaluati on of the Five-Year Strategy is intended to overcome the weaknesse s seen in the past a nd to ensure better coordination of implementation a nd circulation of information. In this regard, the amendmen t of Decree-Law 32/ 2005 will restructure and make improvements in the implementation, monitoring, and evaluati on mechanism, which will then include the following bodies: (i) Ministerial Council; (ii) National Consultative Council; (iii)Technical Coordi nation Commission; (iv) Poverty Reduction Observatory; (v) Focal points. Ministerial Council The Ministerial Council is the supervision and oversight agency for poverty reduction actions, and is responsible for facilitating the implemen tation of the programs and for taking decisions 98 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 and measures to improve the institutional framework and the system for monitoring and evaluating the impact of policies, the implementa tion of the activities carr ied out, and the results obtained. The Ministerial Council brings together all th e members of the Government as needed to evaluate the realization of th e National Poverty Reduction Strategy. Meetings of the Ministerial Council will be convened by the Minister for Planning. The meetings of the Ministerial Council will be chaired by the Prime Minister and Head of Government or, in the event of the latter's absence or inabil ity to attend, the Minister for Planning. Experts and technicians directly invo lved in the implemen tation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy may be invited to me etings of the Ministerial Council as needed. National Consultative Council The National Consultative Council is an expa nded consultative body on poverty reduction, and presents proposals and initia tives, provides opinions, formulat es recommendations, and makes contributions for the effective a ppropriation of the Na tional Poverty Reduction Strategy at the level of all higher-level decision-making bodies. The members of the National Consultative Council include the Directors of Planning and Budget and of the National Statistics Institute, the Ai d Coordination Unit, and the Poverty Reduction Observatory, as well as focal points at the sector, regional, and district le vel, and delegates from institutions representing the private sector and organized civil society. The National Consultative Council meets at least twice a year under the chairmanship of the Minister for Planning. Special mee tings may be convened as needed. When necessary, the National Consultative Council will hold special meetings co-chaired by the Ministers for Planning, Finance, Cooperation, and Foreign Trade, with the participation of technical and financial partners for purposes of monitoring and consul tation on cooperation and partnership issues around the Na tional Poverty Reduction Strategy. Technical Coordination Commission The Technical Coordination Commission is a standing technical body that coordinates all activities relating to the implementation, monito ring, evaluation, and updating or revision of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Technical Coordination Commission is responsible for the following: (i) Promote institutional relations among all th e parties involved in the process of implementation, monitoring, and evalua tion of the Five-Year Strategy; (ii) Ensure the workings of horizontal institutional relations to ensure the flow of information on regional, district, and s ector contributions to the execution of the Five-Year Strategy; (iii)Provide ongoing technical assistance to the decision-making bodies in connection with the evaluation of the execution of the Five-Y ear Strategy; (iv) Evaluate the results of performance by the various focal points for monitoring purposes; (v) Contribute to the production and presentation of summary reports on the contributions by member institutions; (vi) Propose revisions or updates to the Stra tegy based on developments in the poverty situation. 99 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 The members of the Technical Coordination Commission are the Directors of Planning and Budget and of the National Sta tistics Institute, the Aid Coordination Unit, and the Poverty Reduction Observatory. For purposes of consultation and consensus-buildi ng or clarification, any of the focal points may be invited to participate in the meetings of the Technical Coordination Commission, which meets quarterly. Special meetings may be convened at the request of any of the members. The meetings of the Technical Coordination Co mmission are co-chaired by the Director of the Poverty Reduction Observatory and the Director of Planning. Poverty Reduction Observatory The Poverty Reduction Observatory is the t echnical body responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Nationa l Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Observatory ensures interaction among th e agencies comprising the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation mechanism. Therefore, it is important not to neglect its instit utional (re)focusing, and it must be granted the authority and jurisdiction ne cessary to fulfill its mandate. This implies that in the context of the new dynamic of poverty re duction, regardless of the new policy or any decision as to its bylaws, the Observatory is f undamentally competent or being strengthened in terms of human resources as well as material and financial resources - so that the analysis and evaluation components can effectively be prioriti zed and their results used to determine the substance of future programming. To this end, the provisions of Decree-Law 32/2005 should be revised accordingly. Focal points The focal points are technical agencies th at provide support to the Poverty Reduction Observatory and are tasked with ensuring the coordination of interventions by the various organizations involved in the implementation of programs and projects under the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. The reliability and the flow of data and information for purposes of monitoring and evaluation are largely dependent upon them. For the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, focal points are established with respons ibilities at the following intervention levels: (i) Technical or sector ministries and autonomous central institutions; (ii) The Autonomous Region of Principe; (iii) Districts. Sector focal points: The sector focal points are the serv ices responsible for research and planning within the sector ministries and autonomous centr al institutions or services tasked with the mandate for planning, programming, and implementa tion of policies, programs, and budgets, as well as the monitoring thereof.13 13 The existence of a planning service at the level of each sector, in the Autonomous Region of Pr\u00edncipe, and including the districts, under the guidance of the Ministry of Planning, would be a great asset. This would: (1) solve the problem of nominations or appointments of focal points; (2) improve the viability of coordination; (3) facilitate the standardization of procedures for institutional relations ; and (4) streamline matters relating to the collection, systematization, processing, and circulation of data and information generally. The Technical Coordination Commission could play a key role in this regard. 100 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Regional focal point: The regional focal point is the Regional Comm ission for the National Poverty Reduction Strategy created at the leve l of the Autonomous Region of Principe and composed of representatives of the Regional Government and Regional Assembly, and the Central Government of the Region, as well as th e private sector and regional civil society organizations. The Regional Commission for Poverty Reduction meet s quarterly under the chairmanship of the President of the Regiona l Government, and special meetings may be convened as needed. District focal points: The dist rict focal points are the Dist rict Commissions for Poverty Reduction created for each district and composed of representative of the District Chambers and District Assemblies, and the Central Government of the District, as well as representatives of the private sector and civil society organizations present in the dist rict. Each District Commission for Poverty Reduction meets quarterly under the chai rmanship of the President of the District Chamber, and special meetings may be convened as needed. The focal points at the various levels will be re presented by the respective responsible parties or by technicians designated by the latter at mee tings of the National Consultative Council. The focal points are responsible for: Maintaining institutional relations with the Poverty Reduction Observatory for purposes of coordinating monitoring and evaluation activ ities on the implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy; Compiling data and information to enable the monitoring of the physical and financial execution of poverty reduction programs and projects, taking into account th e specificities of the sectors or institutions they represent; Producing periodic reports on th e activities carried out and the results obtained, as well as the respective impact on the evol ution of the poverty s ituation, considering th e strategic pillars set forth in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. 13.2 Implementation and Monitoring of the Strategy The objective of the Strategy 2012- 2016 is to improve the lives of the population by promoting economic growth, poverty reduction, and achieveme nt of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Performance will not be measured solely and exclusively by the actions taken and resources mobilized, but also in terms of the scop e of the objectives initially set. Therefore, the principle of results-based manageme nt will be taken into account at every stage in the process of planning, implementation, and monitoring and evalua tion of the various s ector programs. This concern was expressed by the various participants in the process of de veloping this strategy. The strategy will be operationalized by means of the following programming instruments: the Priority Action Program (PAP) and the Regional and District Operating Plans (PORD). The PAP should include all investment and priority actions inherent in th e various strategic pillars. The PAP represents the conversion of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy into programs and projects and should be consiste nt with the Public Investment Program (PIP), based on the Program Budgets for the sectors, and serve as a link between the Strategy and the General Government Budget, which is the main instrume nt for implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. Each of the ministries will be required to be organized and operate in such a way as to optimize 101 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 the structuring of sector programs, as well as obtain resources for their implementation and instruments for monitoring and evaluation. At the level of regional and distri ct authorities, the strategy will be operationalized in accordance with the Operating Plans, taking into account the strategic pillars and the investment priorities contained in both the strategy and the accompanying action plan. Local community development projects will be implemented with the involvement of the communities, through and/or in lia ison with the local authorities in order to not only promote capacity-building at this level of government but also to better focus interventions on an evidential basis. Technical and financial partners will need to ha rmonize their country programs and interventions with the Strategy, in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Ai d Effectiveness. The programs and projects proposed by the development partners will be analyzed and evaluated to ensure that they pursue the Strategy's objectives and priorities, prior to implementation. In 2014, an interim evaluation will be carried out to: Assess the degree of alignment of the various interventions with th e Strategy's objectives and priorities; Assess the degree of achie vement of the Strategy; Adjust the interventions as needed to contribute to improving the performance and implementation of the Strategy. 13.3 Monitoring and evaluation system An analysis of the root causes of poverty and the desired changes calls for vigorous action and needs to be upheld by supporting prin ciples and measures, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the poverty reduction strategy. In this context, it is urgently necessary to ensure or monitor the proposed interventions by building a monitoring and eval uation system in order to: (i) Strengthen human and institutional capacity in the areas of planning, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii) Coordinate the implementation of interventi ons and the circulation of information; (iii)Monitor and evaluate the results. In this regard, two levels of monitoring are proposed: (A) Higher-level or strategic m onitoring is intended to: Collect and process data on the physical and financial ex ecution of sector programs, focusing on indicators measuring outputs and results on sectors with direct links to poverty; Collect, record, analyze, and disclose in a sp ecific report to be pr oduced periodically the evolution of the indicators included in frameworks adopted previously; Produce a periodic monitoring report on the implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, for submission to the vari ous agencies included in the mechanism. 102 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 (B) Sector, district, and regional monitoring refe rs to monitoring of sector, regional, and district implementation, through sector fo cal points and regional and district committees: Sector monitoring will be provided by the S ector Focal Point (SFP) , represented by the sector planning services (SPS) , which have a mandate to ensure consistency in the planning of interventions and coordinate th e implementation and monitoring of actions falling within the jurisdiction of the sector; Regional monitoring will be provided by the Regional Focal Point (RFP), represented by a representative of the Regional Government, with the mandate to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of actions in the field at the regional level; District monitoring will be provided by the District Focal Point (DFP), represented by a representative of the Dist rict Chamber, with the ma ndate to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of actions in the field at the district level. 13.4. Dissemination of information for monitoring and assessment of results 13.4.1 Disclosure of information Monitoring and evaluation will enable information to be fed back to political decision-makers and society on the performance of institutions an d the impact of existing policies and programs. In this context, the dissemination of inform ation is the means whereby the monitoring and evaluation results will be disclosed so that they may be taken into account in sound and timely decision-making. The results are to be disseminate d extensively to ensure the broadest possible use. Extensive dissemination of results will cons olidate the system and reinforce a culture of results-based management. 13.4.2 Ways and means of disseminating information In view of the constraints that exist in this area, it is crucial to (re)define a communication strategy that takes into account the needs of different users: decision-makers, program managers, technical and financial partners, th e media, and the public at large. In addition, it is important to identify communicators possessi ng the skills and vocation to disseminate appropriate, structured inform ation tailored to the target consumers. The following ways and means of disseminating information will be employed: Publication of periodic reports; Organization of dissemination seminars; Sector meetings with technical personnel; Radio and television programs; Publications in the written press; Meetings at educational establishments and communities; Distribution of pamphl ets and brochures; Website promotion with updated information. 103 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 Organization Figure-Implementation, Monitori ng, and Evaluation Mechanism for PRSP II 104 National Poverty Reducti on Strategy II, 2012-2016 ANNEXES National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2012-2016 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework Pillars/Objectiv es Indicators Baseline situation Targets Entity responsible Base levels Means of verifica tion/sources 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Pillar I - Reforming public institutions, stren gthening the strategy of good governance Average time for resolution of legal cases n. a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a.
