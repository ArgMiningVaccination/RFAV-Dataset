On Wednesday 10 Nov first Pfizer jab. That weekend the problems started... tingling/numbness in feet, which worsened with the days... went up my lower legs, then onto upper legs... Walking became more and more difficult. On Sat 4 Dec I had the 2nd jab (Pfizer again). Within 24hrs things got worse. Today 14 Jan... tingling/numb feet/legs... cramped toes... my lower legs and feet feel like in a vice... everything below waist is numb/dead. Can barely walk... I shuffle unsteadily about and need a walking stick to get around the house. But that is not all... there are other side effects. To say I am stressed out of my mind, and furious about this situation, is putting it mildly. I (now) live in the Netherlands, and since I started getting these side effects I have been 2x (before Xmas and including today) in contact with the Dutch govt side effects centre LAREB, who yet again confirmed that my/our side effects are known to them. Thus the tingling/numbness/etc, as well as water retention/swollen feet (which I have on and off) / (LAREB said besides feet, swollen hands was another known side effect)... dizziness... etc etc etc. These side effects could last a few days to months... LAREB said some were still suffering after 6 months or more. Begrudgingly Pfizer also confirmed last month that the above were known side effects. LAREB told me today, even though Pfizer are fully aware of these side effects, they have not started addressing this. I also contacted the Erasmus Medical Centre, who set up a dept/helpline re Covid vax... the lady I spoke to the other day strongly advised me to avoid getting a booster shot. HA! No kidding! Who knows how disastrous a 3rd jab of that poison could be...! She also advised it might be wise to have tests done to find out what I am intollerant to or allergic to. I have a life long history of reacting adversely to meds, so across the last few decades I've avoided chemical meds, in favour of natural meds on the rare occasion I needed something. I explained to the lady that my GP/doctor wasn't interested, and I had no faith in him. Besides that the useless git doesn't listen. I live in a large rural village, and although there is another doctor's practice, it appears that transferring to another doctor is VERY difficult in this country. The lady at Erasmus also advised strongly that I get a doctor's exemption for any further jabs/boosters. But will that doctor cooperate? It's all stress I dont need on top of everything else. I am currently taking Vit B Complex... and A.Vogel natural meds in lieu of pee pills. (The Furosemide that doctor prescribed crashed my BP badly, and made me VERY dizzy). Even though I'd told him that I'd reacted adversely to antihistamine (knocked me out), he prescribed it... I tried a pill the other day... I pulverized it, and took half at bed time. Lo and behold, even half a pill knocked me out! But weirder yet, following that pill I had several days that I was very itchy in places (my arms, here and there on my torso, around my waist area...), so no more antihistamine either. Do plan to order D3, and some other things online... I'll try just about anything. It's more than 2 months now, and I am becoming despondent. This morning when I woke up, I experienced a moment of hope, as it seemed that my right upper leg felt a tad less numb... but that didn't last long. With having had the jab in my left arm, the left side is worse. Oh yeah, and another thing, after more than a month the place where I had the jab the 2nd time/4 Dec still feels bruised - sometimes just a dull faint bruised sensation, and sometimes noticeably there. Anyway, that moment of hope had evaporated within an hour or two. In fact today is a pretty bad day... such difficulty walking and so very unsteady on my feet/legs. I am one of very many. What strikes me is that we are virtually left to cope on our own. Like many of you, I too have reached out to amongst others my doctor, and got nowhere. So we have recognised by a.o. Pfizer, the Dutch govt LAREB, Erasmus Med Centre, etc, side effets, but beyond the recognition, and confirmation no one has answers or can offer any help or hope. What I would like to know is HOW do you know when things are improving? What are the signs to look out for? I really would appreciate knowing this. [@sahmed](https://vestibular.org/participant/sahmed/) Hey, How are you feeling? My head starting to feel like before. I'm hoping it gets better. I'm tired of waking up hoping it will be a good day. Hi. I am glad that I have come across this page. I got my first Pfizer vaccine September 2021, 8 weeks after the dose I started experiencing tingling/pins and needles in both my hands and feet. I went to my GP they did blood tests to rule out conditions such as low B12 levels and Diabetes - all bloods normal. A couple of weeks after these symptoms I began experiencing right sided facial numbness (intermittently, not there all the time) almost like an altered sensation to my nose, cheek and ear. I returned to my GP who couldn't explain what was happening and told me to get back into contact with him if I started with any facial drooping or muscle weakness, which I haven't. I got my second vaccine (hesitant) 8 days ago as my GP advised I should. The pins and needles seem to have settled but I'm still experiencing right sided facial numbness. I'm 25yr old, normally fit and healthy no medical conditions. It may be all coincidence but my only personal explanation is that all these symptoms occurred after having my vaccine. Is anybody else experiencing facial numbness? I have numbness on both legs, hands, face , gum...2 weeks after my pfizer vaccine. And many other symptoms. Guys, you are not alone. I've had calves muscle twitching for the last 6 months 24/7. This is a video of what I've been experiencing: [https://www.reddit.com/r/vaccinelonghaulers/comments/rlw1r9/pfizer_4_months_of_nonstop_twitches_after_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaccinelonghaulers/comments/rlw1r9/pfizer_4_months_of_nonstop_twitches_after_the/) I've seen all doctors and all results are negative, ANNA negative, muscle tests: needles, nerve conduction tests, everything is clear. Developed the same week after the first Pfizer shot, still no answers - doctors ignore everything and advice meditation, at this stage it is very hard to cope with all of this. Hi all, I just got my booster a week ago. I was worried about this because I suffered this issue for 3 weeks after a flu shot 3 years ago. They thought maybe GBS, tingling , burning and prickling all over body. It resolved. So I got both my Pfizer covid vaccines and did fine. Didn't think the booster would be an issues. Well 7 days post booster shot, I'm having pins and needles, flushing feeling, burning feeling in all my extremities. Upper back pain(maybe not related). When this happened before with the flu shot nobody had answers. I do however have some autoimmune stuff and believe there's a connection there. 7 years ago I was treated for Lyme and mold poisoning body hasnt been the same sincd. I called my functional medicine Dr and he said he isn't shocked. It is an over reaction of the immune system. Basically our nerves on fire. Regular doctors have no idea why this goes on. I'm just confused how 2 shots I was fine with but not the booster 7 months later. I think Mayne this is just too much on our bodies. It is so many shots. Wish I had answers. Now I always worry about Gullian Barre (GBS). Has all these same symptoms we are suffering from. No dr will say it's the shot. Also feel like there's no choice as I don't want severe covid. [JMac](https://vestibular.org/participant/macdonalddobies/) I have been posting some things that have helped for me, and I'm pretty much symptom free now: \"Second, and I have already wrote down a few times what I felt helped me out most. But to be clear I will share it again. Most important I felt was the supplement NAC - every 12 hours - for me (there's also many scientific research about NAC and COVID-19 and related vaccines about the effectiveness), technically the literature states that NAC works as spike protein neutralizers, preventing it from causing further damage to cells. But also Omega 3, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Zinc, vitamin B(12), C, D, Selenium, Magnesium were part of my supplement intake. I didn't drink any alcohol, this seemed to really worsen the side effects (tingling & muscle spasms). I also drank a maximum of 1 cup of coffee everyday, no more. Food wise: many greens (freshly cooked) added with some rice / couscous (or whatever), fish and no other meats. I also kept working out throughout, for about 5 days a week, between 1,5h - 3h per session. I understand that that's a bit much for some, but I would definitely try to keep your body moving every day and stay fit. It really feels like the vaccine is a huge shock to your immune-system, and you need to do everything you can to pretty much build that up again. (Again, I am nor a doctor or a scientist, this just feels like that for me). I didn't stop any of this, and will not for a few months.\" Also from NL by the way. I haven't checked in for a while, but my symptoms dropped off by a lot. I started taking an antibiotic that said you shouldn't take if you are having nerve issues, which I was post vax. And since finishing the antibiotics my tingling has dropped by like, 99%. Except my lips bother me occasionally. For anyone willing to try anything to help, vitamin b complex has helped me tremendously. I take two 150mg tablets every 7-8 hours and it really reduces tingling, and prickly sensations. hi guys. I found this topic almost 5 months ago after I got 2 Pfizer Biontech vaccines. The 1st one I got in the end of July, then history has begun. numbness, jabs everywhere from my head to the feet, almost everyday. I was always sure that it has begun because of vaccination as I didn't have anything like this before. I took the checkups by doctors, did EMG of the nerves of my leg (in my home country) - all is okay. but I still have these shitty side effects. Without vaccination I lived 3 times in a same flat with Covid infected but didn't get anything. After this vaccine I have got side effects which are still lasting and make my life worse. Additionally, I am infected with Covid now. Earlier I wrote to the Health Ministry in Hesse, Germany about such side effects- no answer, I went to some doctors- they were only surprized by what I said, and offered me expensive check-ups which I could not allow to do (in Germany). Now, we are forced to get the 3rd,4th booster vaccines, but I am still suffering from the first one. Biontech is making money, the governments do not think about people. No one is worried about such problems. What do you think if we make some kind of petition about these side effects and send it to ,I don't know where, to Biontech, to WHO or where else? We are from around the world, so maybe we could gather and give to know to the general public about this problem. I also have videos with twitching of the nerves or muscles in my leg, and can make it every day as Biontech or who else wants to see it. I have had the 1st and 2nd dose of Pfizer vax in May 2021 and as far as I am aware, I had no side effects. on the 5th Jan i went for the Pfizer booster shot and a few days later I started having tingling all over my body when I usually feel hot its like pins and needles and I have mainly my calf muscles twitching non stop, also I get numbness in my sole on both legs. I am too early after the vaccine cause it has been 12 days now since I took the shot, but I am having anxiety attacks with these symptoms and I really hope that I don't develop andy new ones. I regret the morning I woke up to go for the booster shot! Never again. [@cedrbal](https://vestibular.org/participant/cedrbal/) I am sorry you are living these difficulties. What you are experiencing is something many of us are experiencing here since our 2nd shot, some first. Including the all over body tingling and axiety. Many of us are very reluctant to get the booster, if we are even considering it. We are from all over the world. It Is a bit of a long road but some recover in a couple of months, some a bit longer. Just to let you know that your axiety has been/is a place many of us are. It is far from normal but you are not alone and if you want to trow out something you think might help you, this a good place to gauge if others have tried it, how it worked for them. Medical support and Acknowledgement is harder as well but we have this \"near a vaccine timeline trigger to symptoms\" What I can suggest is to do research with whats available, look at old trails on here of some of your symptoms. Example, at my second Morderna shot, I had twitches and tingling all over my body (I have other stuff too). Started in my eyelids then moved to different parts of my body. Of course as many on here, I panicked thinking I had MS, and when to the emergency a few times. I wrote about my experience here and I just wanted to provide some updates to anyone that might be interested. The first doctor I went to said it could be due to sitting for too long ... even though I've been working from home for the past 3 years. I didn't even bring up the link between the vaccination because he seemed clueless and uninterested. Today, I went to see a second doctor. When I explained my symptoms, the first thing he asked was, \"has anything new happened to you e.g. a vaccination\" and I immediately said yes. I told him that with the first dose, the left side of my face was tingling. He tested my balance and strength and said everything was fine and it was most likely from the vaccination. He said it lasts up to 45 days, so 6 weeks. He told me to come back if I have difficulty breathing or if I feel pins and needles on my torso. My symptoms have actually become better over the 4 days but it's still annoying and the fact that it worsens at night when I lie down is affecting my sleep. [@cedrbal](https://vestibular.org/participant/cedrbal/) Im one of the ones who is taking longer - I'm at 6 months. I have more symptoms as well, so somethings have improved, but some people just have the vertigo or the twitches only. I guess the more symptoms you have the more your body has to get over. I don't think this is a life sentence but it's taking me time and I do see improvements. Another different is that if your drs actually take you seriously (many, as myself, are told it's axiety), then they give you medication that seem to improve that healing timeline. I think I would heal faster if that was the case for me. [@jessm](https://vestibular.org/participant/jessm/) Hi Jess and others on this site, I have had my 'post-vaccine persistent symptoms' for 9 months now. I got my Covid vaccine on April 1, 2021 --- J&J. My long term symptoms started about 6 days after vaccination. It started with burning in my hands and tingling in my legs and feet; then progressed quickly to internal vibrations, adrenaline rushes, increased blood pressure and heart rate, chest pain. I saw my primary care physician when the strong internal vibrations started (about 10 days after vaccination) --- it was chalked up to anxiety by my PCP and I was told the tingling would resolve in a couple weeks. Here I am 9 months later. I have had every blood test imaginable, an EKG, heart monitor (for 2 weeks) and full neurological exam. I have seen a cardiologist and a neurologist -- both believed that the vaccine caused the symptoms. All my blood work is normal and no definitive diagnosis except peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia and nervous system imbalance. Both the cardiologist and neurologist told me they expected my symptoms to eventually resolve. The good new is my symptoms have slowly improved over time. The first 8-10 weeks were very intense --- I couldn't sleep due to adrenaline rushes in the middle of the night --- heart racing and internal vibrations would wake me up several times a night --- really scary. The intensity lessened in the third month. There have been times since about month 4 when I thought 'maybe it's gone' but it always starts up again and I have flare-ups. Today (Jan 16, 2022), I still have mild internal vibrations and heart palpitations --- I now am able to sleep but I feel the vibrations when I wake up in the morning. I also have tingling in my lower legs and feet all the time. I actually feel better when I exercise (which seems different from many other people on this forum) as deep breathing and moving really helps me move the energy out of my body. I highly recommend walking and yoga. Like many others, I have had to stop using caffeine and alcohol as they trigger the vibrations/buzzing in my body. I have found chiropractic treatment helpful -- especially for the internal vibrations and I am about to try acupuncture for the tingling in my legs and feet. I have found traditional medicine useless so far. I have not received a booster yet as I am very afraid that my symptoms will worsen and that I will go back to feeling like I did the first couple months after vaccination. My PCP did test my antibody levels a couple months ago and they were still high. I want to note here that I was completely healthy and had never experienced any of these symptoms before receiving the vaccine. I am also 'pro-vaccine' and could not wait to get this one! I have had many vaccines throughout my life (I am 64) and have never had any side effects before! I am extremely frustrated that our symptoms are not being acknowledged by the media, the vaccine makers, the government (CDC) and most physicians. "}
