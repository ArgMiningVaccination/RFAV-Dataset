This build-up can manifest as headaches, bloating, and weight gain to name a few. Yet, most of us don't think to give our bodies a regular cleaning the way we would with a house or a car. At [Freedman Chiropractic](/about-us/), we offer the Standard Process 21-Day Purification Program. This program is your guide to purifying, nourishing and maintaining a healthy body and weight by rebuilding your body from the inside out. This deep, cellular cleanse of the liver, kidneys, intestines, lungs, lymphatics and skin helps clear the body of toxins in order for organs to function optimally. Am I A Good Candidate for 21 Day Purification Program? How Does the 21 Day Purification Program Work? Our program works in three simple steps. - Step 1: Purification : Purification, also known as detoxification, to remove toxins from the body and support a healthy weight. Toxin overload increases the risk for a stuffy head, reduced mental clarity, low libido, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, indigestion, food cravings, weight gain, and joint discomfort. - Step 2: Nourish : Nourishing your body with nutrient rich foods provides the right combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants for protecting and promoting optimal health. - Step 3: Maintain: Once you've completed the initial detoxification program, our team will help you create a long-term plan. After following the diet, you will need to slowly and systematically reintroduce foods to gauge how your body responds to them. Once you've completed the 21-day purification program, our wellness team is here to help you successfully transition to a healthier lifestyle and enjoy the benefits that go along with it.
