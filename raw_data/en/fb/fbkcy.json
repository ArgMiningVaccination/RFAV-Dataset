But, as an active grandmother and frequent caretaker of seven grandchildren, Laurie doesn't have the time to let the pain keep her down. \"I have a busy life, like most women,\" says Laurie. \"I watch several of my grandkids, which involves a lot of lifting, as well as getting down and dirty with them when we play together.

Not necessarily. Although every over-the-counter (OTC) drug must have been proven safe and effective before it's released, FDA regulations only require that supplements must not be \"adulterated\" or \"misbranded,\" and asking manufacturers and distributors to follow safety requirements of the FDA and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.

In the meantime, potentially harmful products continue to be sold,\" says Pieter Cohen, MD, an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a leading expert on supplement safety. (FDA.gov reveals just a handful of recalls in the past year, for issues including salmonella contamination and undeclared ingredients.)
