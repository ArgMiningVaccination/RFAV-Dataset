Unfortunately their use is self-prescribed and patients rarely view them as medication reveal their use to hospital staff. Garlic has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation and may interact with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. Other alternative supplements have also been associated with potential increased bleeding, including ginkgo biloba, ginger, ginseng, and omega-3 fatty acid. It is essential for surgeons to be apprised of all substances ingested by patients, so they can identify potential adverse effects and drug interactions. References 1).
