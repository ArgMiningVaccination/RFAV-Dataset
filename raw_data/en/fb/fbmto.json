Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Healing with Plant Medicine Ceremony - Palm Springs This was my second wellness experience with Island Tribe (huge fan) and my first plant medicine experience. I knew it would be something special but I was not prepared for the incredible healing that took place. Angeline, OD and the rest of their staff are exceptional. They are forces of nature with intuitive healing gifts. I was very vulnerable and released a lot of unexpected trauma, but felt so safe, supported and loved through it. The combination of sisterhood, healing and beauty was exactly what I was looking for and I received so much more. I believe the world would be a better place if everyone could experience Island Tribe Wellness. I left this experience completely bonded with my friends and myself in a new way, heart open, mind open and with a new found strength. Island Tribe is an annual priority on my healing journey. Can't wait to come back next year as my own tribe keeps growing. If you are curious about breath work and plant medicine or just need some deep soul healing, look no further and book your experience! Highly recommend anything IT has to offer. 10/10! I am forever grateful for the Island tribe retreat and plant medicine. I am a sacred plant holder and Dahn Master. I came to this retreat open minded and ready to receive. The moment I met with Angelina and Odie I knew I was in for a special treat. The ambiance , light workers , and medicine was perfect. I was able to get out of my way and really release what no longer served me. I literally felt my legs open and begin having this spiritual baby. I could literally feel it trying to come out, as I have given birth 3 times. After the last attempt I was loving supported by all the staff in such an inspiring way. I am feeling much lighter and brighter and ready to serve as the light worker I came to earth to be. Such a Divine relaxing uplifting high vibrational gem EVERYONE must support to be supported. I love you all Island Tribe and look forward to seeing you all again and referring family and friends. Thank you for helping me deliver my spiritual baby so lovingly. I will forever keep you all in my heart of hearts. I am forever grateful for the Island tribe retreat and plant medicine. I am a sacred plant holder and Dahn Master.

The amount of love and attention they put into every detail is truly a wonder blessed by magic. I felt seen and heard in ways I never have been in my entire life. I believe this experience also made us all so much closer as friends and a strongly woven \"Sol Tribe\". This is, by far, the best place to try your first micro-dose experience. The ambient and spiritual space and consideration put into these experiences is second to none. Thank You. Thank You. Thank "}
