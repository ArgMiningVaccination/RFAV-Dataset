If you need immediate attention, call 911 or your provider's office, or visit the nearest hospital or emergency room. Note that message response times are not immediate and may vary, and MyChart messaging should be used only for non-urgent messages to your provider or care team. Our new electronic health record system offers a new and improved patient portal called MyChart. This portal allows patients to view test results, pay bills, schedule your next appointment, request medication renewals, and view medical information from anywhere. The staff at your IHA practice location will help you create your MyChart account in person at your next appointment. All IHA patients will be receiving an instructional email about how to sign up for a MyChart account soon. Need help logging in? Call our support line at 844-982-4278.
