I was there at the founding meeting, April 30-May 1, 1976 (!), but I swear it was only about ten or fifteen years ago. I know I am no more than fifteen years older than I was then. Really! I'm still young. Would I kid you? Well, despite the apparently relativistic time compression, it has been a wild and eventful, sometimes even amazing, perhaps even fruitful ... twenty-five years. In this issue we begin our twenty-fifth anniversary observance with the first of several short anniversary sections that we plan to spread over three of the next four issues. We originally considered a single-subject anniversary-observance special issue, but that would have kept us from giving you our usual variety of substantive arti\u00ad cles on diverse subjects. So we are going to try to do both\u2014to take appropriate notice of how this special enterprise all began, with some short features and per\u00ad sonal perspectives on what has happened since, and also to present the kinds of critiques and evaluations for which you are reading us in the first place. This first anniversary section leads off with personal recollections by me and by Jim Alcock, a CSICOP Fellow and member of the Executive Council for that entire time (he's still young too!). One refreshing aspect of Jim's essay: He points out something we rarely emphasize\u2014while a lot of what we do is serious, over the years we've had a lot of fun doing it. (Shhhh! Don't tell anyone!) In future issues we'll hear from chairman Paul Kurtz, the mastermind who started it all, and oth- ers. All of these are excerpted from a forthcoming book. Skeptical Odysseys (Prometheus 2001), edited by Paul Kurtz in honor of CSICOP's twenty-fifth anniversary. The many eminent contributors to the book could write on any topic, but for these SI essays we've selected several who reflected in very personal terms about CSICOP and the modern skeptical movement itself. We would be interested in hearing from any readers whose experience with CSICOP and the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER spans all or most of these twenty-five years. We are also interested in hearing from new readers and younger readers for your own perspectives on science and skepticism today. We have renewed our\u00ad selves repeatedly throughout our existence. In fact, SI has been in its present for\u00ad mat and bimonthly frequency only since the start of 1995, and CSICOP is creating new programs continually. We strive to be lively, dynamic, and vital for the new challenges of the twenty-first century. * * Our regular content leads with Douglas M. Stokes's new analysis of die \"file- drawer\" problem in parapsychology\u2014how to properly allow for the likelihood that experiments with positive results will be preferentially reported or published. Stokes works within the parapsychological community, but he is an internal critic of the field's statistical methods. His new analysis, supported by his own comp\u00ad uter simulations, finds a serious flaw\u2014a wrong assumption\u2014in statistical meta\u00ad analyses of experiments traditionally used in parapsychology research. \"It is one of those strikingly novel observations diat once brought to our attention is obvious,\" said our reviewer. It may well have significant implications. It would appear to considerably weaken the contemporary case for psi.

The show proved to be one of the most balanced nationally tele\u00ad vised forums for skeptics to debate psy\u00ad chics in recent years. Six other guests appeared on King's program: mediums Sylvia Browne, John Edward, and James Van Praagh, along with Rabbi Schmuley Boteach, retired physicist Dale Graff, and former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt. Larry King began by bring\u00ad ing Jaroffs critical March 5, 2001, Time article \"Talking to the Dead\" on John Edward to viewers' attention (see Articles of Note, page 63). He then showed a clip from the Sci Fi Channel's Crossing Over with John Edward, in which Edward delivers a child's message from the beyond to weeping parents in the studio audience. King then quoted a skeptical descrip\u00ad tion of mediumship from Jaroffs article: \"It's a sophisticated form of the game Twenty Questions, during which the sub\u00ad ject, anxious to hear from die dead, sel\u00ad dom realizes that he, not the medium or the departed, is supplying the answers.\" Edward called Jaroffs article \"insult\u00ad ing to the intelligence of people in the audience\" and \"the credibility and the integrity\" of those who work on his show. When asked to respond to allega\u00ad tions that Edward's demonstrations were aided by eavesdropping, questionnaires, and crafty editing, Edward replied, \"All of that is completely wrong,\" suggesting that Jaroff had not attempted to inter\u00ad view him or people working on the show. (Jaroff later pointed oui when he tried to contact people on the show, he was told that \"John Edward does not respond to criticism.\") However, when pressed about allega\u00ad tions from Michael O'Neill in Jaroffs article, Edward waffled: KING: \"He quotes a Michael O'Neill, who attended one of your shows, and writes that O'Neill claims that his encounter on the show was edited and gave a false impression. Clips of him nod\u00ad ding yes' spliced into the videotape about Paul Kurtz appears on Larry King Live opposite modern-day mediums. statements [to] which he remembers dis\u00ad agreeing. Is O'Neill wrong?\" EDWARD: \"You know, I have to say that I would believe so, because I don't believe that they'd edit the show in that capacity. And again, I think diat this is subjective to somebody's experience... . I can't speak for, you know, Michael, I can only speak for myself.\" When King asked how he would prove his abilities, Edward replied, \"You know, I think that to prove it, is a per\u00ad sonal thing. It is like saying, prove God. If you have a belief system and you have faith, then there is nothing really more than that.\" Throughout the night, Edward, Browne, and Van Praagh insisted that any proof of mediumship was a matter of personal experience and preference, above the merely mortal realm of critical, scientific investigation. In the next segment, King asked Jaroff whether he thought John Edward and others are frauds. \"I think they're very good at what they do,\" replied Jaroff, \"but what they do is baloney\"\u2014 namely cold reading. Browne bristled at the remarks. \"I don't think he's done his homework very well,\" snapped Browne, alleging that she has \"saved baby's lives,\" \"found people that were dead,\" and \"solved crimes.\" Later in the program, when Browne again rattled off a resume of paranormal achievements\u2014 \"finding bodies, and World Trade Center with Ted Gunderson and all that\"\u2014 Kurtz retorted: \"You throw out these wild claims that you've done this, have done that; they don't hold up under scrutiny.\" Kurtz blasted mediums on intellectual and moral grounds: \"Well, I think the claims are preposterous. ... If someone makes a claim, an extraordinary claim, then we ask for evidence of the facts. And there are no facts to sup\u00ad port this. What we're faced with are psychic sharps, like card sharps: sleight of hand, sleight of mind. They're using methods of deception to confuse poor people who have suffered death and are bereaved and I think this is not only false, but also immoral.\" Later in the show John Edward played his wild card for scientific respectability, citing his participation in Gary Schwartz' study, conducted at the Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Arizona, as docu\u00ad mented scientific evidence of his powers. \"Gary Schwartz believes in the tooth fairy,\" Jaroff blasted back, \"He believes in UFOs. He believes in levitation.\" Rabbi Boteach, despite being a cred\u00ad ulous friend and supporter of Uri Geller, planted his feet firmly on the side of the skeptics when asked about his belief in mediumship: \"Well, aren't you a bit sur\u00ad prised that the only message that the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 5 NEWS AND COMMENT dead seem to be able to give to us is [that] someone had a nickname 'Miss Piggy' and they can only tell us that, you know, I had a heart condition? For goodness sake, if that's the case then\u2014 no pun intended\u2014to hell with them. ... I mean, I would think that if someone is up there in the cosmos unre\u00ad strained by the constraints of the body, they could tell us about the great secrets of existence, where is God, and how can we better human life?. . . Instead they're telling us things like 'I choked on a chicken bone and I'm here to tell you that I don't hold you accountable for serving me that soup.'\" A former chief hostage negotiator for the FBI, Clint Van Zandt, described himself as open to the possibility of psy\u00ad chic abilities but noted that psychic practices were clearly irrational: \"One of the first things a psychic asks a law enforcement officer to do is take your reason and logic and set it aside.\" When asked by Larry King whether he had ever found a psychic crucial to the solu\u00ad tion of a crime, Van Zandt responded: \"I've seen law enforcement try a lot of times. When I've seen them participate in the solution of a crime, my experi\u00ad ence and the experience of my col\u00ad leagues is that it's usually been some type of vague information, like a kidnap victim was kidnapped somewhere up along the Great Lakes and we've been told, 'You'll find the victim buried near a body of water.' Well, we understand the Great Lakes are a body of water. . . . I know there are people who will say, 'Well, we've been a consultant to the FBI.' But as far as seeing a case solved or a kidnap victim recovered\u2014eidier dead or alive\u2014based solely on the infor\u00ad mation of a psychic, no.\" Toward the end of his show, Larry King set aside time for Browne, Edward, and Van Praagh to perform readings and have them analyzed by the skeptics. Sylvia Browne did a reading for one caller from Santa Fe, New Mexico, looking for a family history for her parents. Closing her eyes and focusing on die spiritual realm, she fastened onto the name \"Burgess ... in and around Memphis.\" \"I don't know if this is funny or sad,\" Kurtz commented. \"She's engaged in guesswork.... The scientific commu\u00ad nity has been investigating these claims for a century and a half. It can find no hard evidence that people can commu\u00ad nicate with the dead, no hard evidence that psychics can help detectives.\" If the denizens of the spirit realm had any chance to prove their existence to skeptics in one fell swoop, it would have been on Larry King Live. Alas, they were content to let James Van Praagh choke on national TV. A caller from Williston, Vermont, looked to Van Praagh to find out more about a brother-in-law who had \"passed.\" Van Praagh responded with vague intuitions about a throat or breathing problem, family separations, someone he couldn't trust, a tattoo, and a baby. Despite a string of generalities applicable to many American males. Van Praagh came up empty handed: KING: Ma'am, is any of that clear to you? CALLER: No, I have to say it really isn't.... KING: Does that mean, James, you missed on this one? By the end of the evening, Browne, Edward and Van Praagh were increas\u00ad ingly irritable. Faced with skepticism, Van Praagh was reduced to aspersions of the motives of Kurtz, Jaroff, and CSICOP: VAN PRAAGH: \"I just want to say that it's interesting that these people here are in the business to destroy and destruct, while we are here to heal peo\u00ad ple and to help people grow. And these people, you have to look very carefully at what these people, their jobs, are. They are here to destroy.\" KING: \"Well the Rabbi isn't here to destroy. The writer isn't. Why are they here? They're [here] to investigate or be skeptics. I mean, that's ...\" PRAAGH: \"OK, let's hear the skep\u00ad tics dien, 'CSICOP's,' whatever. They're just here to destroy people. They're not here to encourage people, to enlighten people. They're here to destroy people.\" A full transcript of the March 6, 2001, Larry King Live is archived on the CNN.com Web site at www.cnn.com/ TRANSCRIPTS/lkl.html.

Evolution Returns to Kansas: Board Supports Science Standards To die relief of scientists and science edu\u00ad cators both locally and nationwide, evolu\u00ad tion has returned to Kansas. In a widely watched vote on Valentine's Day, February 14, evolution was restored as a central theory to Kansas school standards. The newly constituted State Board of Education voted 7 to 3 to approve the new science standards. The new standards include questions on evolu\u00ad tion, which will now be considered one of the unifying concepts of the state's science curriculum. References to the great age of Earth and to the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe were also restored. The new standards are based on sci\u00ad entific theories accepted by die majority of scientists around die world. They draw on documents from the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Science Teachers Association. The three organi\u00ad zations issued a joint statement praising the new board's actions. \"These standards can and should serve as a model for other states that are considering revising their own stan\u00ad dards,\" the statement said. The vote reverses an August 1999 .111ion of the Board on a 6 to 4 vote diat had stripped evolution from its accepted place at the center of biological studies and created a furor that embarrassed Kansas educators and politicians and rip\u00ad pled throughout the nation. Governor Bill Graves had called the Board's 1999 action \"terrible, tragic, embarrassing\" (SI 6 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT November/December 1999). That vote aroused the state's scien\u00ad tific community and others concerned about creationist interventions in edu\u00ad cational standards for science courses. New candidates, with an invigorated pro-science movement in Kansas behind them, actively campaigned for restoration of evolution content. On August 1, 2000, two of the six members who had voted for the watered-down 1999 standards were rejected in the Republican primaries. A third member resigned and moved out of the state. Sue Gamble, a moderate who ran on a pro-science education plank, defeated Board chairwoman Linda Holloway, who had supported the creationist- influenced standards (SI, Novem\u00ad ber/December 2000). That set die stage for new standards restoring evolution, the Big Bang, and Earth's age to science curricula. The board discussed the standards for thirty minutes. A pro-creationist revision amendment was defeated. Then, with eight television cameras watching, including one from CNN, the board voted 7 to 3 for the new standards. After the positive vote, some people in the audience applauded. \"I believe now that we have science standards that the rest of the world could look to,\" said board member Carol Rupee, who voted for them. \"I'm really gratified that this chapter is over,\" said John Stager, a Kansas State University professor and co-chair\u00ad man of the 27-member committee of science educators who wrote the new standards. But he cautioned that the fight is not over. John Calvert, managing director of the Intelligent Design Network, which proposes that life arose not through nat\u00ad ural processes but through design, expressed disappointment in the vote. He said his group plans to push intelli\u00ad gent design to school boards across the country. Said Shawnee, Kansas, businessman Dave Raffel, an evolution supporter: \"This is one step down a long road diat there doesn't seem to be any end to.\" \u2014Kendrick Frazier Kendrick Frazier is Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Urban Legend Makes International News In late 2000, a horrifying news story came out of Russia: A grandmother was arrested for allegedly trying to sell her five-year-old grandson Andrei. Police in Ryazan, south of Moscow, said that the grandmother told the boy he was going to Disneyland. With the help of the boy's uncle, little Andrei was handed over to a man in exchange for $90,000. But the story is more than just a tragic talc of a child sold into slavery or prosti\u00ad tution: according to the uncle and police, Andrei was sold to a man who would dien take him to \"the West,\" where he would be killed and his kidneys and orJier organs would be removed and sold. That's the story, anyway. Several news organizations carried some version of the article, including the Times of India, the Associated Press, and Cable News Network (CNN). The story first appeared October 28, 2000, in the Associated Press, and was pub\u00ad lished exactly a month later by CNN. The CNN story was the most complete of the lot, with photos of a young boy and a woman in dark glasses and a hat, identified as Andrei's grandmother. The grandmother claimed that she was simply putting the orphaned boy up for adoption. In the CNN.com version (available at www.cnn.com/2000/world/europe/ 11/28/russia.children), a short video clip accompanies the story. The piece, narrated by correspondent Steve Harrigan, identifies the uncle as Sergei Tkachov and a police spokesman as Dmitri Korneyev. It also includes what is claimed to be undercover surveillance videotape, though much of the footage looks suspiciously staged. There arc several reasons why this story is suspect. First, in the print ver\u00ad sions, the principals are identified only by their first names. Other than the boy \"Andrei\" and his grandmother \"Nina,\" no one else is identified. Quotes are unattributed, with phraseology such as \"a police detective said . . .\" and \"police SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 7 NEWS AND COMMENT said.\" Of course, \"police\" don't say any\u00ad thing; if a certain police officer says something, then he or she should usu\u00ad ally be identified. This sort of writing helps obscure the sources, thus making follow-up verification difficult. The story falters on its own logic. A five-year-old's organs, specifically the parts die article says he was sold for\u2014 the kidneys, heart, or lungs\u2014would likely be unusable. No adult could ben\u00ad efit from a five-year-old's organs. They would be much too small and underde\u00ad veloped to simply insert into a grown adult. And it stretches credulity even further to posit that there is one or more five-year-old children in American or European hospitals awaiting stolen hearts, eyes, kidneys, or lungs. I wrote about diis urban legend in a previous issue (\"Bitter Harvest: The Organ-snatching Urban Legends,\" SI 23(3) May/June 1999), and die reasons to be suspicious. It's important to realize that organs can't simply be pulled out of one person and put into another; transplants can't be done in someone's basement. Sophisticated medical equipment must be used, and donors and recipients must be carefully matched. Blood and tissue typ\u00ad ing and histocompatibility tests must be done in advance. Well-paid medical staff, both here and abroad, are unlikely to risk their careers and reputations performing such illegal and unethical procedures. Urban legends, presumed by some to be primarily a Western phenomenon, are in fact global. The film Mute Wittiest, whose topic was the urban legend of die snuff film, for example, was set (and filmed) in Russia. Another oddity about the case is that while die grandmother and uncle are photographed, (partially) identified, and arrested, no mention at all is made of diose allegedly buying the organs. While die grandmother could get three to ten years in jail, die story is curiously silent about the person (s) she \"sold\" Andrei to. Presumably, they would be the larger threat. There can be a seamy side to the transfer of children. That children are bought and sold in economically depressed areas is firmly established (usually they are used for child labor or prostitution). In addition, there is also unquestionably a global effort to provide children and babies for adoption\u2014 usually legally, but sometimes not. There is, however, a giant leap of inference between saying that the child was sold (or illegally adopted) and saying diat he was sold to be subsequently killed for his organs. Some police officials undoubt\u00ad edly believe in the commerce of stolen childrens organs, and in many places the urban legend is wholly believed. Ms. Ofelia Calcetas-Santos, of die Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, isn't convinced that the trade in children's organs exists, calling the stories \"rumors.\" According to the 1999 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, \"Rumors persist diat there exists an illegal trade in human organs, and die Special Rapporteur has received allegations diat street children in [Latin America] and the Russian Federation are being killed so diat their organs can be used in transplant operations. Such allegations have recurred repeatedly for over twenty years, but to the best of the Special Rapporteur's knowledge, nobody has been convicted of being connected with such an offense.\" There are several scenarios under which this story may have occurred. First, the grandmother may have (as she claimed), been simply selling the child in an illegal but common adoption scheme, with no intention of selling the boy's organs. The fantastic and lurid details of the organ-snatching aspect were later added by die press. This inter\u00ad pretation is endorsed by Nancy Scheper- Hughes, professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley and co-founder of Organswatch, a group fighting the inequitable distribu\u00ad tion of organs. She was interviewed by die BBC, and writes that \"My under\u00ad standing is that the grandmother was willing to hand over her grandchild for a cash payment, but that it was a paid international adoption 'deal,' not for organs trafficking which was the surreal layer added on to a story that was sad enough as it was.\" It is also possible diat die story's sensa\u00ad tional details were encouraged by Russian organized crime. A motive for inflating the story is provided by Viktor Vasilievich Luneev, a professor and chief scientific researcher at the prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences. In a report tided Crime in the Twentieth Century: International Criminalogical Analysis (available at www.american.edu/trans crime/work), Luneev notes that in recent years it has become fashionable in Russia to sensationalize crime stories, in particu\u00ad lar ones with a possible connection to organized crime. In fact, one of the tactics of Russian organized crime is \"Dissem\u00ad ination of frightening rumors as to their power, which brings criminal organiza\u00ad tions more benefit than harm, since it demoralizes witnesses, victims, journal\u00ad ists, and law enforcement organs and sup\u00ad ports the criminal spirit of rank and file members who execute functions.\" Steve Harrigan, of CNN's Moscow bureau (from whose television report the print version of the story was taken), has another take on the story. He believes that the grandmodier did indeed believe she could get money for Andrei's organs (regardless of whether or not she actually could). He noted that local police showed reporters their videotape of the woman being tackled and arrested widi money attempting to make die deal. The question is a deal for what? A deal for an illegal adoption or a deal ultimately for organ theft? And wouldn't the video look die same either way? After all, the dis\u00ad tinction is one of intent. Harrigan's take may be the correct one, but it leaves odier questions unan\u00ad swered, including why those allegedly trafficking in children's organs weren't named or arrested. \u2014Benjamin Radford Benjamin Radford is Managing Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. 8 May/)une 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT Fox Special Questions Moon Landing But Not Its Own Credulities Fox television aired a special on the alleged Moon landing hoax conspiracy on February 15, 2001. I had hoped the spe\u00ad cial might include a skeptical treatment, but all hopes were dashed as the program unfolded. They presented the arguments of the \"true believers\" without any signif\u00ad icant skeptical rebuttal. The program claimed to \"let die viewer decide for themselves\" about whedier there was a hoax or not, but failed to present a bal\u00ad anced program, instead giving the viewers a highly biased pro-hoax set of evidence on which to base dieir conclusions. The \"star\" of the Fox special was Moon landing \"skeptic\" Bill Kaysing, whose credentials include seven years in the technical publications department for the Rocketdyne research depart\u00ad ment in Simi Hills and who claims to have had a top-secret clearance at that time. Other \"experts\" who supported the hoax included the producer of the movie Capricorn One, Paul Lazarus; author and scientist Ralph Rene; pho\u00ad tographic expert David Percy; Jan company; Boris Valen- tinovich Volinov, a Russian cosmonaut; the son and wife of astronaut Gus Grissom; and astronaut candidate Brian O'Leary, whose comments may well have been taken out of context in order to appear to support die claims of a Moon landing hoax. On the anti-hoax side were only three experts whose on- air commentary did little to actually rebut the hoax proponents arguments. During the hour-long special, Fox trotted out most of die tried and true arguments used by me hoax believers. This author and others have pointed out the flaws in all of dicse arguments prior to the production of die program on Web pages and Internet Usenet groups, but Fox made little attempt to address die argu\u00ad ments. Here are a few of the arguments presented by the hoax proponents. 1. No stars are visible in the sky. The program claimed that since diere is no atmosphere, stars should be visible in the black sky of the lunar surface pho\u00ad tographs, yet none are visible. Despite having two photographic experts in their number, the pro-hoax proponents are unable to recognize the reason die stars are not seen. The photographic expo\u00ad sures are set to record a brightly-lit day\u00ad light scene. These exposures are nearly identical with the exposures expected on Earth and are too short to correctly expose the faint images of stars. 2. The flags are seen to wave as if in a breeze. The Fox special showed several instances of the American flag flapping around as if it were blowing in a wind, despite the lunar vacuum. However, in every instance, an astronaut can be seen actively adjusting the flag or having just finished adjusting the flag. After the motion damps out, the flag comes to rest, just as it should. In one telling scene, an astronaut is actually twisting the flagpole as the viewer is expected not to notice. 3. Identical backgrounds are seen with differing foreground objects. The Fox special showed two photographs obtained during the Apollo 15 flight. One showed the Lunar Module sitting in front of a background of mountains. The second photograph shows the same background mountains, but with a boulder-filled crater in the fore\u00ad ground. This apparent anomaly shows just how uncritical the Fox special was. The mountains in question are several miles behind the Lunar Module. Two photographs taken even a few hundred feet apart can show the same mountains, nearly unchanged, especially at the level of examination shown on the program, with two rather different foregrounds. 4. You can see details in the shadows. The hoax proponents claim that with\u00ad out an atmosphere, there should be no details visible in the shadows, since there is only one light source\u2014the Sun. However, once again they overlook the obvious explanation, namely that light scatters off of objects including the lunar surface itself as well as astronauts and their equipment and fills the shadows with light. The scattered light from the surface is an effective source of shadow illumination. Any real photographic expert should be familiar with the use of reflectors to help fill a shadow, yet the two such \"experts\" on the Fox special fail to mention this important detail. 5. Comparison with Capricorn One. At one point, the producer of Capricorn One compares the budget of his film to the total budget of the Apollo program and suggests that the relative budgets would allow the nearly perfect fakery of the Apollo missions. The narrator goes on to compare die events in the Moon landing films with those from the movie, suggesting even that perhaps the Moon landing copied die movie. The narrator failed to point out that the film was released in 1977, some eight years after the first Moon landing. Some might wonder what the harm is in credulous programs like this one. But given the high levels of scientific illiteracy in America today, surely we don't need programs such as this confus\u00ad ing the public with bad science. Furthermore, their investigative ap\u00ad proach is biased and uncritical, looking only for the evidence that supports dieir claims, all the while claiming to be skep\u00ad tical and scientific. A one-sided presen\u00ad tation such as this leads the viewers to only one conclusion\u2014that there was in fact a Moon landing hoax and a con\u00ad spiracy to cover it up. Unfortunately, as time goes by, fewer and fewer of those who were involved in the Apollo program and those who watched in amazement as twelve men walked on die Moon are around to pro\u00ad vide witness to those events. The theo\u00ad ries of the hoax \"true believers\" defile the achievements of Apollo and ignore physics and logic. All of the evidence and the accounts point to only one con\u00ad clusion: Apollo landed twelve men on the Moon.

Scotti is an astronomer at the Lunar & Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Richard Wiseman Tries to Tune into Ever-Elusive ESP On December 7, 2000, the \"Museum of the Unknown\" in London, England, hosted \"The World's Largest ESP Experiment,\" the brainchild of Richard Wiseman. The museum was the venue for a day-long series of ten half-hour ESP trials. Members of the public were asked to psychically transmit a series of images they viewed on a projection screen to a \"receiver\" who sat in the \"ganzfeld state\" (a mode of sensory iso\u00ad lation) 200 yards away in a nearby building, 19 stories above street level. Wiseman was leading what CNN.com Europe described as \"a sort of brain-wave blitzkrieg,\" getting crowds of \"senders\" cooperate as psychic messengers. \"By boosting the signal, by having lots of senders,\" Wiseman told a British ITN television reporter, \"you'd expect that maybe you can achieve spectacular results and that's what we're trying to find out today.\" In another experiment that day, while thirty people sat in a room concentrating on the projected images of gophers and other assorted objects, a sequestered receiver relaxes in the \"ganzfeld\" state: she reclines with ping-pong ball hemispheres taped to her eyes, listening to white noise and bathing in soft, red light. Her goal is to empty her mind for ten minutes, then focus on any psychic impressions that might be emanating from the people back at the room in the museum. If the battery of trials had yielded six or more hits out often, Wiseman would conclude that the results hint at some phenomenon other than chance. Speaking to a reporter from the ITN Network in the United Kingdom, Wiseman described the goals of the tests he had set up: \"It's very difficult to tell ESP from chance. I mean, we could do a hun\u00ad dred trials. They could all be hits. It could still be chance. But what we're looking at is saying, 'Well look, if it goes to 100 to one, if it goes to 200 to one, that doesn't feel so much like chance, that feels like something else going on.' And that's really how we're measuring things.\" The results of the experiment\u2014two hits out of ten\u2014failed to find any evi\u00ad dence of a psychic message transmission. \u2014Kevin Christopher Faster than Light? Well, Yes and No Perhaps you saw the headline from The Sunday Times (London) on June 4, 2000: \"Eureka! Scientists break speed of light.\" Or perhaps you caught mention on radio or television about research by Dr. Lijun Wang (of the NEC Research Institute in New Jersey) involving viola\u00ad tions of one of the most important rules of physics, namely that nothing can exceed the speed of light. Several other \"superluminal\" experiments have made the news this last year. What you won't always hear is that the experiments don't disprove Einstein, and that causality has not been violated. SaIon.com carried an excellent analy\u00ad sis by Chris Colin (8/3/2000), who got to the bottom of the Wang story. After the initial excitement and confusion, it had turned out that, \"Far from challeng\u00ad ing fundamental rules of nature, the team developed a method of manipulat\u00ad ing the wavelengths of a beam of light, thereby altering the way it arrives at its destination. Because short wavelengths become longer and long ones become shorter, the natural fanning outward that marks a light pulse is eliminated; consequently the shape of the pulse at its destination appears the same as at its origin. This effect, called anomalous dis\u00ad persion, had never been produced in a transparent medium [until Wang]. . . . The light didn't speed up, but rather the peak of its pulse shifted, thereby chang\u00ad ing its intensity.\" In light of what the Wang experi\u00ad ment did\u2014and didn't\u2014show, it's amus\u00ad ing to note the reaction of physicist Russ Humphreys, a young-Earth creationist from New Mexico. Humphreys wrote on the new \"speed of light\" experiments for the Answers in Genesis web site (www.answersingenesis.org), focusing on Wang's article in the journal Nature (Vol. 406, pp. 277-279). Humphreys wrote \"The most puzzling thing to me is how the authors appear to deny the obvious implications of their data. They imply that their results do not suggest that information could be transmitted faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and yet the nearly-raw data in their fig\u00ad ure 4 says [sic] just the opposite.\" Humphreys goes on to say \"The news\u00ad papers actually got that point right. This raises the possibility of transmitting information 'backwards' in time. That would be astonishing!\" In other words, creation physicist Humphreys, like the Times, completely misunderstood the Wang research. Causality violation wouldn't bother Humphreys anyway; he also writes \". . . for millennia the Bible has been transmitting detailed informa\u00ad tion to us about the future. I haven't noticed the world collapsing into non- causal chaos quite yet!\" Recently, New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) heard Dr. Mohammed Mojahedi, of the University of New Mexico Physics Department, speaking on his \"superluminal\" research. Mojahedi works at the University of New Mexico's Center for High Tech Materials (CHTM), and his group's fascinating experiment was reported in the October 2000 issue of Physical Review E. In Mojahedi's work, pulses have been mea\u00ad sured as traveling faster than the speed of light in vacuum, some 300 million meters per second. In Mojahedi's experiment, a beam of 12 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT microwaves was split into two, and the path lengths for the two beams cali\u00ad brated. Then, a special array of plastic window panes was inserted into one of the beams. One might expect that the array of windows might slow down the pulse, delaying the arrival of diat beam. But just the opposite happened. Mojahedi's group consistently measured the window-path beam's main pulse as arriving half of a billionth of a second before the pulse from the vacuum-path beam; for the small distances involved on the lab table, this amounted to a speed of 2.38 times the speed of light! The effect is due to quantum tunnel\u00ad ing effects in the window materials, dielectric photonic crystals. Mojahedi exploited a curious property called Evanescent Mode Propagation to achieve his surprising results. But how surprising were the results? Was Einstein causality (\"superluminal\") propaga\u00ad tion was observed only for the main part of the pulse signal. This is the large- amplitude part of the pulse thai is easy to measure. It's much harder to measure the very beginning of the signal\u2014the \"forerunner\" or \"precursor\"\u2014because those signals have very small amplitudes. Yet the forerunner signals are the ones that obey the cosmic speed limit of the universe, the speed of light. Mojahedi used an analogy involving race cars. The forerunner signals corre\u00ad spond to the sharp front edge of die race cars, while the main section of die race cars, containing the driver, correspond to the main pulse of die signals. In both die \"normal\" and \"superluminal\" paths, the forerunner signals arrive at the same time\u2014both travel at the speed of light, no faster. (See points labeled A and A' on the diagrams.) However, the main pulse is accelerated in the photonic crys\u00ad tals, with the result that it arrives earlier in the superluminal path (going through the special windows) tlian through the vacuum path. (See points labeled B and B' on the diagrams.) The figure shows signals like die ones Mojahedi's group measured. The Sommerfeld forerunner signals arrive at the same time for both the normal path (A, top) and \"superluminal\" path (A1, bottom). The Brillouin forerunners arrive next, with the superluminal path's signal winning that race by a small amount. The main envelope of the superluminal pulse arrives earlier (B1) than the envelope for die normal pulse (B). And so the velocity of the forerun\u00ad ner pulse docs not exceed that of light, but the \"group velocity\" (for the main pulse envelope) does. Mojahedi described how his work challenges some of the earlier thinking in this field, such as comments by Borne and Wolfe, and Brillouin, that superluminal group velocities had no physical significance or meaning. Does this work suggest that faster-than-light communications might be possible? Unfortunately, no. While the superlu\u00ad minal pulse (B1) might arrive before its vacuum counterpart (B), it will never precede the arrival of its precursor (A1). That would be like the driver of the race car reaching a point before the leading edge of the car does. However, the work may hold promise for speeding up detection of pulses in applications such as computing. With other interesting experiments being conducted, such as slowing light down to a crawl inside a special medium, the speed of light continues to be an entertaining subject. Rumors of the demise of Einstein and causality are still a bit premature. \u2014David Thomas Dave Thomas, a physicist, is president of the New Mexicans for Science and Reason and a SKEPTICAL INQUIRER consulting editor.

I .say this because I didn't under\u00ad stand a lot of what was said at a recent seminar on alternative medicine spon\u00ad sored by the Washington Science Policy Alliance. Although I have a master's degree, I've had no medical training, never taken a course in physics, and high school chemistry was\u2014well, let's say, a long time ago. So I was pretty befuddled that afternoon, especially during one speaker's presentation. He might as well have been speaking a for\u00ad eign language; it wouldn't have made any difference. It all sounded like gob\u00ad bledygook to me. Later, at the reception, I met a young woman who works for the American Physical Society. In confessing my inability to understand what the one speaker had said, I repeated my \"gob\u00ad bledygook\" description. But rather than enlightening me, as I had expected her to do, she declared: \"It was gobbledy- Melissa Pollak is a senior analyst at the National Science Foundation where she's currently in charge of NSF's Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Under\u00ad standing of Science and Technology and an author of the National Science Board report. Science & Engineering Indicators. The opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. gook! I have a Ph.D. in quantum physics, so I should know!\" Actually, the most lasting impression I have of the session was not what the speakers said, but the reaction of the audience. I was astounded at how little the speakers were challenged during the question and answer period, especially since the seminar was held in the audi\u00ad torium of the American Association for the Advancement of Science headquar\u00ad ters in Washington, D.C. In attendance were well-educated people, including many scientists, and it seemed that most of them were actually buying what the speakers were saying. At one point, a woman stood up not to ask a question but to deliver her own message. Facing the audience, she described herself as a physician who had practiced medicine for twenty years. Then, with fervency normally reserved for the pulpit, she proceeded to berate her colleagues in the medical profession for unnecessarily prolonging the pain of their patients by failing to prescribe alternative therapies for their ailments. Also in the audience were a number of congressional staffers and a group of individuals whose nametags read \"Friends of Health.\" In fact, the names of four of the five speakers on the pro\u00ad gram appear on a brochure put out by this new organization and made avail\u00ad able at the seminar. All were listed as members of a \"Science Advisory Committee.\" The first page of the pam\u00adphlet contains the following quote: \"Combining the wisdom of the ages with the inspiration of modern science for new paths to health.\" The mover and shaker behind \"Friends of Health\" appears to be Rustum Roy, the well-known scientist\u2014and highly excitable first speaker at the semi\u00ad nar. No one could accuse Professor Roy of lacking enthusiasm for the subject. Partly in order to beat the clock (each speaker was allotted only fifteen minutes), words spilled out of his mouth so fast that I had trouble keeping up with what he was say\u00ad ing. According to my notes, these are some of the points he made: The U.S. ranks twelfth out of thir\u00ad teen countries in terms of the quality of health of its citizens. Therefore, health care is not reaching as many people as it should. Millions of people are turning to alternative therapies, even though most of these treatments are not being reim\u00ad bursed by health care plans. These peo\u00ad ple must know something. Millions of people cannot be wrong! Friends of Health is not your typi\u00ad cal alternative medicine organization because it is \"very data oriented.\" There is an enormous wealth of scientific data supporting alternative therapies. These data have been ignored, but people should look at them. The study of sci\u00ad ence is full of examples in which uncon\u00ad ventional theories have been repeatedly rejected by a mainstream scientific 14 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER community only to eventually achieve acceptance at some later point in time. We now have evidence that these therapies work\u2014\"from machines,\" such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). William Tiller (also on the Friends of Health Science Advisory Committee) and others have conducted detailed physics experiments, and we now have \"hundreds of data points.\" Not only can MRI prove the effectiveness of acupunc\u00ad ture, but MRI can also tell the \"yin\" people from the \"yang\" people. Hans-Peter Duerr, the next speaker, spoke gobbledygook. In addition, he used a prop, a fancy pendulum, to illustrate whatever it was he was trying to say. I did manage to jot down one quote: \"Our rational thinking has natural limitations.\" During the reception, the young woman from the American Physical Society informed me that Professor Duerr was a world-famous physicist, and that she and other scientists were rather puzzled by his involvement in alternative medicine. The fact that Duerr has a reputation as a bril\u00ad liant scientist didn't surprise me. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to observe a lot of highly intelligent people who have made many notable contributions in their fields of expertise. At the same time, I've discovered that sometimes there are chinks in those brilliant minds\u2014blind spots that defy explanation. Duerr's uncritical enthusiasm for alternative med\u00ad icine must fall into that category. If anyone seemed out of place on the panel, it was the third speaker, Henry Heimlich. By far the most famous of the quartet, he's known not just in the scien\u00ad tific community, but throughout the world. (Has anyone on this planet not heard of the \"Heimlich maneuver\"?) So what was Dr. Heimlich doing on the panel? Well, like the others, he's got a problem with the medical profession. However, unlike the others, his com\u00ad plaint seems to have merit. Apparently, until recently, the medical profession refused to recognize the superiority of the Heimlich maneuver over mouth-to- mouth resuscitation in emergency situa\u00ad tions other than choking. In addition to lobbing a little undeserved criticism at Heimlich's maneuver (it may cause vom\u00ad iting), the medical profession has been slow to acknowledge the ineffectiveness of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in sav\u00ad ing heart attack and drowning victims. Recent research has just brought this fact to light. For drowning victims in particu\u00ad lar, there now seems to be a sound body of evidence that mouth-to-mouth may do more harm than good, and that the Heimlich maneuver should be used instead. Apparently, this conflict with some intransigent colleagues was enough to send Dr. Heimlich into the very recep\u00ad tive arms of Friends of Health. Dr. Wayne Jonas, former Director of the National Institutes of Health Center of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, was the last scientist on the panel. His presentation was mosdy visual with slides showcasing lots of statistics extolling the popularity of alternative medicine. Among his numbers were those documenting how few physicians recommend alternative therapies\u2014and that the more popular the therapy among the general public (e.g., herbal remedies), the less likely it was to be prescribed. He cautioned the audience that the appropriate term for the topic was \"complementary\" instead of alternative medicine, because most people\u201483 percent\u2014who use alternative therapies also seek advice from their primary care physicians. Most of these patients (72 percent), however, fail to tell their doctors about their use of alternative therapies. According to Dr. Jonas, this communication gap is a serious pro\u00ad blem with public policy implications. Although Dr. Jonas's presentation was certainly informative, it didn't provide a clue about the secret of his success as an advocate for alternative medicine. I didn't gain that insight until I had a chance to chat with him during the reception. More about that later. The last speaker was Addeane Caelleigh. She was introduced not as a scientist but as a social historian and the editor of the journal Academic Medicine. According to Caelleigh, the popularity of alternative medicine \"is driven by medi\u00ad cine as a social activity.\" In addition to describing this justification for the high level of interest in alternative medicine, she also brought up one point that none of the other speakers had mentioned: the high level of scientific illiteracy among the general public. This is ironic in light of the fact that, according to Dr. Roy, the best proof we have that alternative thera\u00ad pies work is the many millions of people who are drawn to them. At the reception, I had the opportunity to chat with a number of people, most of whom were strong advocates of alternative medicine, including two women who work for science-related associations. After listening to them describe how they had been helped by all sorts of alternative ther\u00ad apies, I couldn't resist trying to make a lit- de joke by commenting that alternative medicine for pets has reeendy gained pop\u00ad ularity. Much to my surprise, my little remark was treated with die utmost in seriousness. One of the women was only too happy to tell me that her dog's arthri\u00ad tis had been completely cured by an alter\u00ad native practitioner. GOBBLEDYGOOK AND CHARM Continued on page 19 A lot of highly intelligent people have made many notable contributions in their fields of expertise. At the same time, I've discovered that sometimes there are chinks in those brilliant minds\u2014blind spots that defy explanation. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2001 15 White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Is Biased PAUL KURTZ The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine policy was created by an executive order of President Clinton on March 7, 2000. This was in response to enormous political lobbying, especially by Senators Orrin Hatch and Tom Harkin. The purpose of the Commission is to develop a set of legislative and administra\u00ad tive policy recommendations that will \"maximize the deliv\u00ad ery of alternative medicine to the public.\" The former president was to appoint nineteen commis\u00ad sioners. It is the view of the editors of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine (the only peer-reviewed skeptical journal in the field) that virtually all of the members of the Commission selected thus far are in favor of alternative med\u00ad icine, and that the Commission is not fairly represented by skeptical medical scientists. Incidentally, it is unclear at this time as to what the new Bush administration will do with the Commission. The Commission has been holding open public forums throughout the country. I was invited by the Commission to present testimony before it arid I did so on behalf of CSICOP on December 4, 2000, in Washington, D.C. The following are my written responses to questions provided to me beforehand. 1) Should Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) be integrated with conventional medicine and why or why not? I do not think that it should be integrated. I deplore the efforts to do so. The term \"conventional medicine\" is a mis\u00ad nomer. What is labeled as \"conventional\" is modern scien\u00ad tific or evidence-based medicine. Many or most CAM thera\u00ad pies on the other hand are conventional and ancient, such as traditional Chinese medicine, qigong, or spiritual importa\u00ad tions from India. Scientific medicine is a relatively recent development in human history, especially since the nineteenth century, when increased knowledge of physiology and human anatomy was refined. There have been a number of brilliant researchers who have contributed to our understanding, such as Claude Bernard, Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch and Joseph Lister. Theories about the nature and transmission of infectious diseases\u2014such as diphtheria, tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid, tetanus, polio\u2014and the development of vaccines had important roles in immunization. Likewise important were the advances in epidemiology, public health, and sanitation. In the twentieth century endocrinology advanced\u2014with the discovery of insulin, cortisone, and sex hormones. In the field of nutrition, researchers discovered the role of vitamins. There have been significant new diag\u00ad nostic tools, such as X-ray imagery, CAT scans, mammogra\u00ad phy, and sonograms, to mention only a few. The great strides in surgery have been impressive, including cardiology, neu\u00ad rosurgery, and organ transplantation. The discovery of antibiotics has made enormous contributions to the cure of infectious disease. We should add to this the discoveries of DNA, biogenetic research, gene therapy, and other innova\u00ad tions on the frontiers of research. All of these achievements have led to the reduction of infant mortality and the exten\u00ad sion of life spans. Part of this process was the development, beginning in 1904, of rigorous standards of education in medical schools. Thus we see the remarkable effectiveness of modern scientific medicine\u2014all for the benefit of mankind. The key factor in evidence-based medicine is that any new diagnostic techniques and therapies be submitted to rigorous, double-blind clinical tests. Unfortunately, CAM therapies, in our view, have not been adequately tested. Too often the claims of their validity have been anecdotal or highly subjective, uncorroborated reports by practition\u00ad ers and/or their patients, some of these based upon the placebo effect. Surely, we cannot lump all CAM therapies together and make a blanket indictment. Each has to be examined objec\u00ad tively and impartially. Scientific medicine admits that fallibil\u00ad ity and skepticism are parts of its process of inquiry. On the other hand, we should insist that the public be safeguarded against unproven cures, untested therapies, and quackery by practitioners and manufacturers out to make a profit. 2) Should there be access to and delivery of CAM products and practices? If so, why? If not why not? I do not think that there should be universal access and delivery of CAM products and nostrums. This will tend to weaken what is one of the finest health care systems in the world. CAM could undermine the line between genuine sci\u00ad ence and pseudoscience. Each claim to validity must be tested by impartial, neutral observers\u2014not simply their advocates. If a therapy proves to be effective, then it becomes part of scientific medicine. It is vital, in our view, that this Commission represent not only proponents of CAM, but scientists and physicians who are skeptical of its claims. 3) If current CAM utilization trends continue, what con\u00ad sumer protection should be implemented? CAM seems to be growing. I think the public should be protected. The government has an obligation to act against spurious or fraudulent claims. The free market\u2014in selling adulterated goods and questionable services\u2014needs to be monitored. The misuse of taxpayers funds needs to be safe\u00ad guarded. The great issue is the health and welfare of the American public. Government sponsorship of questionable CAM therapies would be a disservice to the public interest. 4) What policy recommendations do you have for the Commission? I would strongly urge as a first step the repeal of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which freed herbal medicines and dietary supplements from regulation by the FDA. Prescription drugs are required to be tested. There are no such safeguards for dietary supplements. There are now some 20,000 such supplements\u2014including herbal and homeopathic remedies\u2014on the market. Many of the manufacturers make false and misleading claims. Many have dangerous side effects. Some may have positive results. In any case, the packages should be properly labeled\u2014there should be \"truth in labeling.\" Those medications deemed to have possible noxious side effects by misuse should require a prescription. Second, similar regulations should be enacted against other false claims\u2014such as quack cancer cures, crash diets. Chelation therapy, iridology, therapeutic touch, and mag\u00ad netic therapy. This is particularly important when patients avoid scientific medicine and substitute alternative thera\u00ad pies, believing that since they are offered by the health delivery system, they must be effective. There needs to be peer review, as in scientific medicine, not simply by the practitioners in a field, but by other objective and neutral scientific reviewers.

The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. 16 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NOTES OF A FRINGE-WATCHER MARTIN GARDNER Primal Scream: A Persistent New Age Therapy Alternative medicines and curi\u00ad ous treatments for physical ills are flourishing as never before around the world. The same is true of alternative mental therapies. Every year it seems as if new and outlandish forms of psychiatry appear in books and arti\u00ad cles, along with thousands of satisfied patients who provide glowing testimoni\u00ad als about how completely they have been \"cured\" by the new techniques. In this column I focus on one of the once-popular New Age therapies, the so-called \"primal scream\" technique dis\u00ad covered and promoted by Dr. Arthur Janov, a California psychologist. Born in Los Angeles in 1924, Janov obtained his doctorate in psychology in 1967 from Claremont College, in Claremont, California. During the second world war he was a Navy signalman. In 1976 he divorced his first wife, Vivien France, who had helped pioneer his work. He later remarried. Janov and Vivien founded the Primal Martin Gardner has two new books of essays: Did Adam and Eve Have Navels? Discourses on Reflexology, Numerology, Urine Therapy, and Other Dubious Subjects (WW Norton, 2000), based on his SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Notes of a Fringe- Watcher columns; and From the Wandering Jew to William F. Buckley Jr.: On Science, Literature, and Religion (Prometheus Books, 2000), a collection of his other essays and reviews. Institute in Los Angeles in 1970, where some two dozen staffers then practiced primal therapy. Three years later he began publishing The Journal of Primal Therapy and the monthly Primal Institute Newsletter. The public first became aware of the new therapy in 1970 when Janov pub\u00ad lished his first book. The Primal Scream. It became an instant best seller, and the therapy became something of a fad around the world, especially in California. A handsome Janov appeared on die Dick Cavett show. He was interviewed by Vogue. John Lennon, Yoko Ono, actor James Earl Jones, and other Hollywood bigwigs praised primal therapy. Sweden aired a long documentary about it. The basis of primal therapy, which came to Janov like a revelation from on high, is easily capsuled. All neuroses, psychoses, and psychosomatic ills derive from repressed memories of childhood traumas, particularly the violent trauma of being born. This central role of die birth trauma goes back to Otto Rank, a psychotic Vienna psychoanalyst who broke with Freud. Rank traced all neu\u00ad roses back to a painful birth. He even wrote a book titled The Trauma of Birth (English translation 1929), which he dedicated to Freud. By a series of interrogations\u2014the details of which Janov has kept secret for fear of their being used by untrained therapists\u2014a patient is slowly regressed to childhood. Unconscious memories of incidents which he or she suffered as a very young child start to emerge along with memories of actual birth. When these memories are recovered the ills begin to disappear, though it may take many sessions and much time and money. Moreover, Janov claimed, one's aging process slows down\u2014he once likened his therapy to the Fountain of Youth. Resistance to all diseases increases. In brief, the patient starts to lead a normal, healthy, happy life. Once healed, Janov asserts, a patient will never need therapy again. The Primal Scream was followed by a spate of popular books with such titles as The Primal Revolution; The Anatomy of Mental Illness; Primal Man; The New Consciousness (written with Michael Holden, M.D., men Janov's medical director); The Feeling Child, The New Primal Scream; Prisoners of Pain; and Imprints: The Lifelong Effects of Birth Experiences. All diese books are now out of print. In 1972, when Simon and Schuster published The Primal Revolution, it was an alternative selection of several book clubs. A full page ad in The New York Times Book Review (November 19, 1972) included a list of ailments primal therapy\u2014and only primal therapy\u2014can cure or alleviate: alcoholism, addiction, psychoses, para\u00ad noia, depression, and manic-depression. In a similar ad for The New Primal Scream, in the same periodical (May, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Mjy/lunr 2001 17 1991), the following ills, all helped or cured by the therapy, are added to the previous list: tension, stress, anxiety, sleep disorders, high blood pressure, cancer, sex difficulties, obsessions, pho\u00ad bias, ulcers, colitis, migraine, asthma, and arthritis. Not only was Janov convinced that no other form of mental therapy works, but primal therapy must be administered only by workers trained at his institute. Later he speculated that perhaps some\u00ad day families would learn the technique. This could result in a world with less injustice and no wars. \"It would be,\" Janov is quoted in Contemporary Authors (Volume 116), \"the only hope if mankind is to survive.\" All mental ills, Janov is convinced, result from what he calls \"primal pain,\" a suffering arising from repressed memo\u00ad ries of childhood traumas. Illness is a \"silent scream.\" When patients recover their lost memories of early traumas, especially the trauma of birth, they often writhe on the floor, sobbing, and scream\u00ad ing with rage at whatever was done to diem or at the violence of their birth. Such sessions are called \"primals.\" The recovery process is called \"primaliz- ing.\" Primals take place in soundproof rooms with padded floors and walls to prevent patients from injuring them\u00ad selves while writhing and screaming. The entire process is, of course, faster and cheaper than psychoanalysis, which can go on for years. Janov was a pioneer practitioner of what later came to be called the \"false memory syndrome.\" During the 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent parents and teachers were falsely accused of sexual molestation, frequendy of school children. These fake memories were implanted in the patients mind by well-meaning but self-deceived therapists. Thanks to the valiant efforts of Pamela Freyd, who started the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992, the tide has slowly turned. Judges and attorneys have become aware of how easily such memories can be fabricated, with the happy result that many therapists and quack psychiatrists have lost cosdy lawsuits, and dozens of innocent adults had their convictions overturned after spending years in prison. For details about this great psychi\u00ad atric scandal you can consult the two chapters on it in my Weird Water and Fuzzy Logic (1996), or such excellent books as Mark Pendergrast's Victims of Memory: Sex Abuse Accusations and Shattered Lives (1995). The False Memory Foundation is at 1955 Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103-5766. Janov is not particularly concerned with memories of sexual abuse since any old kind of early childhood trauma will do. Prior to primalizing, patients spend a week in a hotel room without radio, television, or anything to read. They are not allowed to sleep the night before their first session. In his section on pri\u00ad mal therapy Pendergrast quotes Janov as saying, \"The isolation and sleeplessness are important techniques which often bring patients close to a Primal. Lack of sleep helps crumble defenses.\" Of course there is not the slightest reliable evidence that any adult brain har\u00ad bors repressed memories of birth. Nor, for that matter, any memories of the first one or two years of life, or of pre-birth mem\u00ad ories of life inside the womb as Janov also believes\u2014a belief he shares with L. Ron Hubbard, Stanislav Grof, and others.1 In a letter to the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (Fall 1988) Janov canceled his subscrip\u00ad tion and asked for a refund. He was furi\u00ad ous because in the magazines Winter 1987-88 issue Barry Beyerstein, writing on \"The Brain and Consciousness,\" had called primal scream therapy \"suspect.\" There have been several tragic spin\u00ad offs from primal therapy. In 1971 a Center for Feeling Therapy made its appearance in Los Angeles, founded by two defectors from Janov, Joseph Hart and Richard Corriere. Its techniques included ordering patients to strip and to endure beatings. The center closed in 1980 after losing many lawsuits. Later it was roundly pummeled in such books as Therapy Gone Mad by Carol Lynn Mithers (1994) and Insane Therapy (1998) by sociologist Marybeth Ayella. An even uglier spinoff was the rise of \"rebirthing therapy,\" a crazy New Age technique started in the 1970s by one Leonard Orr. The therapy consists of wrapping a patient in blankets to simu\u00ad late the mothers womb, then pushing pillows onto die patient's face to arouse feelings of labor contractions. An elderly born-again Christian, Orr lives in his birthplace, Walton, New York, where he runs a rebirthing training center and edits its newsletter. He has written some twenty books. They include Rebirthing in the New Age (1977) and The Healing Power of Birth and Rebirth (1994). His therapy is closely related to breathing exercises and what he calls the \"power of fire.\" In a trip to India he met a number of yogis who claim to have lived more dian 2,000 yean. One of them, Yogi Babaji, Orr believes to be over 9,000 years old. You can read all about him in Orr's 1992 book Babaji, The Angel of the Lord Somehow Orr manages to combine his Biblical Christianity with India's belief in reincarnation and karma. In April 2000, in Evergreen, Colorado, a social worker named Connell Watkins and her three associ\u00ad ates\u2014none with any training in psychi\u00ad atry\u2014charged a Durham, North Carolina, pediatric nurse $7,000 for two weeks of therapy on her adopted daugh\u00ad ter Candace Newmaker. The girl, 10, was said to be suffering from \"attach\u00ad ment disorder,\" characterized by her inability to form loving relationships. At the culmination of \"attachment ther\u00ad apy\" the child was wrapped in a flannel blanket and large pillows shoved against her face. Candace cried out repeatedly that she couldn't breathe and was about to vomit, but the therapists kept pushing the pillows and urging her to fight her way out of the \"womb\" through a twisted part of the blanket. Candace soon stopped crying. A half-hour later There is not the slightest reliable evidence that any adult brain harbors repressed memories of birth. 18 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER the dierapists unwrapped the blanket. Candace was lying in vomit, not breath\u00ad ing. She died of asphyxiation the next day at a Denver hospital. Watkins and her colleague Julie Ponder were arrested and charged with child abuse resulting in death; their trial began in early April. (For more on this case see \"New Age 'Rebirthing' Treatment Kills Girl,\" SI 24 [5] September/October 2000.) If you care to learn more about primal therapy you can read Janov's books, and A Scream Away from Happiness, by Daniel Casriel (1972). For attacks on the uSerapy and its spinoffs see the chapters in Margaret Thaler Singers Crazy Therapies (1996), R.D. Rosen's Psychobabble (1977), and Michael Rossman's New Age Rossman's chapter is tided \"The I-Scream Man Cometh.\" I close on a depressing note. In the spring of 2000 Prometheus Books pub\u00ad lished Janov's latest work, The Biology of Love. In an ad for the book on Janov's Web site, Janov calls it \"the most impor\u00ad tant book of the century.\" It concerns such questions as, \"What makes us humans, the hormones of love, shaping personality in the womb, the nature of feeling, the power of love, die origin of anxiety and depression, the source of GOBBLEDYGOOK AND CHARM from page 15 But not everyone there was a firm believer. A woman who works for AAAS shared my views. She told me a story about her father, a well-known physician who had passed away recendy. In going through his belongings after his death from cancer, she was horrified by one dis\u00ad covery. No, it wasn't pornography or any other typical secret stash found after die death of a loved one, but bottles and bot- des of every kind of herbal remedy now on die market, thanks to passage of The Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994. I could tell that she was still terribly upset by diis discov\u00ad ery, and although they were probably wordi hundreds of dollars, she felt diat the right thing to do was to throw them away, which she did. addiction and obsessions, sleep and eat\u00ad ing disorders, die causes of sexual act out, and many more.\" On January 2, 2001, E. Patrick Curry, an articulate consumer health advocate in Pittsburgh, sent Paul Kurtz, founder and head of Prometheus, a strong letter protesting the book's publi\u00ad cation. Long an admirer of Prometheus for its willingness to publish books attacking pseudoscience\u2014books odier publishers are reluctant to take\u2014Curry urged Kurtz to withdraw the book and issue a mea culpa for the failure of Prometheus editors to recognize Janov's book as bogus psychiatry.' Curry cited an incredible passage on page 319 of The Biology of Love diat should have been a tipoff to Prometheus editors. Janov reports diat a photograph of a primal, in which a patient is experi\u00ad encing rebirth, shows the fingerprints of the obstetrician miraculously appearing on die patient's legs! \"The first time I saw this,\" Janov writes, \"I was as skeptical as 1 am sure many readers are now. But it hap\u00ad pens and is not a chance occurrence.\" If you can believe that, you can believe anything Janov says. To keep up with the doings of what he now calls his Primal Center, in Venice, California, The last person I had an opportunity to chat widi at the reception was Dr. Jonas himself. During this conversation, it suddenly dawned on me why he made such an effective spokesperson for alter\u00ad native medicine. He is the quintessential itician. One of the long-standing problems with communicating science to the pub\u00ad lic is diat the scientific community has a paucity of politicians, leaders who are so polished and charming and charismatic that people are naturally drawn to what\u00ad ever it is they have to say. Their words don't need to be convincing, because it's dieir style and personality that do the heavy lifting. Dr. Jonas fits this model of the ideal spokesperson. I managed to ask Dr. Jonas several questions, and I couldn't help noticing how skillfully he managed to dodge each one. Talk about a good politician! you can check the center's Web site at www.primaltherapy.com. Janov's earlier Primal Institute is now run by his ex- wife Vivien. Notes 1. Grof is a Czechoslovakian-born psychiatrist, 1960s LSD researcher, and paranormalist now liv\u00ad ing in the United States. SUNY Press has pub\u00ad lished several of his controversial books. One of Carl Sagan's rare lapses is his unfortunate chapter on Grof in Broca's Brain In his 1993 book The Holotropic Mind, Grof credits LSD widi changing him from an atheist into a mystic. He writes (page 18): \"... we can reach tar back in time and witness sequences from the lives of our human and animal ancestors, as well as events that involved people from other his\u00ad torical periods and cultures with whom we have no genetic connection whatsoever. Through our consciousnesses, we can transcend time and space, cross boundaries separating us from various ani\u00ad mal species, experience processes in the botanical kingdom and in the inorganic world, and even explore mythological and other realities that we previously did not know existed.\" 2. Paul Kurtz responded to Curry, with a copy to me, on February 7. He noted that despite Prometheus review process, \"We may sometimes err. We are not infallible.\" But he noted that Prometheus has a long tradition of publishing unpopular books, and criticisms come from virtu\u00ad ally every viewpoint. Kurtz said he appreciated Curry's distress with Janov and said he himself was also dubious of \"primal scream.\" He said Prometheus is still committed to a rationalist-sci\u00ad entific agenda but contended that Curry's sug\u00ad gested remedies could be considered suppression. 1 would consider them damage-control. For example, I mentioned diat I was reading Robert Park's recent book Voodoo Science, and that it contained several unfavorable references to Dr. Jonas. Would he care to comment on what Professor Park had said about him? But rather than answer the question, he responded by saying how impressed he was diat Park has now become a \"good skeptic.\" According to Dr. Jonas, Park has gone from being a not-so-good skep\u00ad tic to being a really good one. I got sim\u00ad ilar non-answers to my odier questions. All in all, the afternoon I spent at the seminar proved to be quite insightful, although I realize diat my observation that people are easily deceived by a lot of fancy words and a winning personality is really nodiing new. Alternative medicine certainly isn't die first kind of pseudo- science to be sold in that way, and it won't be the last. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 19 INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL In Search of Fisher's Ghost During an investigative tour Down Under, I was able to examine the persistent legend of \"Australia's most famous ghost\" (Davis 1998). 1 was generously assisted by magic historian Peter Rodgers with whom 1 shared several other adventures (Nickell 2001). One writer has commented, \"It is a mystery why some ghost stories catch the public's imagination and survive while others, often more shocking and more credible, are forgotten\" (Davis 1998). He cites the story about Frederick Fisher, which has been related in countless newspaper articles, as well as poems, songs, books, plays, an opera, and other venues (Davis 1998) and provided the inspiration for a movie (Fowler 1991). It once attracted the attention of notables like Charles Dickens, who published a ver\u00ad sion in his magazine Household Words, and entertainer John Pepper, who used it as the subject of one of his \"Pepper's ghost\" stage illusions in Sydney ca. 1879 (\"Illusionist\" 1984). Today, Fisher's ghost remains the subject of an annual festival. All this\u2014even though die ghost reportedly appeared \"to just one man on one occasion\" long ago (Davis 1998). The story began June 17, 1826, with Joe Nickel/ is CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow and author of numerous investiga\u00ad tive books. the disappearance of Frederick Fisher. Fisher was a \"ticket-of-leave man\"\u2014a paroled convict\u2014who had acquired land at Campbelltown where he built a shack. Unfortunately he also caroused there with itinerants and other ticket- of-leave men including his neighbor and best friend George Worrell (or Worrall). When Fisher found himself in debt and facing possible arrest, he trust\u00ad ingly signed his property over to Worrell\u2014either to conceal or to protect his assets. But when Fisher was released from prison after six months and returned to his farm, he found Worrell had been claiming it as his own. After Fisher disappeared, Worrell resumed possession of the property, telling anyone who inquired that his friend had returned to England in search of his estranged family. The fact that Worrell wore Fishers clothes and\u2014 to prove his ownership of one of Fisher's horses\u2014offered a crudely forged receipt soon raised suspicions. On September 23 the Colonial Secretary's Office offered a reward for \"the discovery of the body\" of Frederick Fisher, or a lesser reward for proof that he had \"quitted the Colony\" (\"Supposed Murder\" 1826). Subse\u00ad quently, a local man named James Farley reportedly had an encounter with the ghost of Fisher. Farley was walking near Fisher's property one night and saw an apparition of the miss\u00ad ing man sitting on a fence, glowing eerily and dripping blood from a gashed head. Moaning, the phantasm \"pointed a bony finger in the direction of the creek that flowed behind Fisher's farm\" (Davis 1998). Thus prompted to search the area, police soon dug up Fisher's corpse. Worrell was convicted of the murder and reportedly confessed just before his hanging (Fowler 1991, 13). Such are the main outlines of the story. Queensland writer Richard Davis observes in his book The Ghost Guide to Australia (1998), \"From the beginning distortions occurred\u2014almost every aspect of the story was changed and romanticised so that truth became indis\u00ad tinguishable from fiction.\" Indeed, the version published by Charles Dickens (\"Fisher's Ghost\" 1853) contains numerous altered details\u2014\"Penrith\" for Worrell, etc.-\u2014that link it to a fictionalized account written by Australian writer John Lang (n.d.). Those promoting the tale cite an alleged deathbed statement by the per\u00ad cipient James Farley (or \"John Hurley\" in the earliest versions [Cranfield 1963]). Queried about the matter on his deathbed, Farley supposedly raised him\u00ad self on an elbow and told his friend: \"I'm a dying man, Mr. Chisholm. I'll speak only the truth. I saw that ghost as plainly as I see you now\" (Davis 1998; Cusack 1967, 3). Alas, the story is not only unverified but has a suspiciously literary quality about it. 20 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER In fairness it should be acknowledged that debunkers have offered their share of doubtful claims as well. One pur\u00ad ported explanation for the ghost was given by a seventy-three-year-old barber. He said he heard it from his grandfather who in turn allegedly learned it from an ex-convict who had secretly witnessed the murder and burial. Wanting to expose the trudi but afraid of being implicated, he hit on a plan. He fash\u00ad ioned a pair of cloaks\u2014one white, anorJier black\u2014wearing the first at night to simulate the ghost. When some trav\u00ad eler happened by, he moaned and pointed to the burial site in die swamp. Then readying the black cloak as he walked toward that spot, he would suddenly pull it over him so that \"to the terrified onlooker it seemed that the ghost had suddenly disap\u00ad peared.\" Supposedly this re\u00ad peated ruse brought die desired result and the corpse was searched for and discov\u00ad ered\u2014believe it or not! (\"Ghost\" 1955) Another hand-me-down tale was related by a seventy- four-ycar-old resident. He said diat Farley simply \"saw a man whom he took to be Fisher (but it was not Fisher) sirring on die rail of die bridge.\" When the man \"dropped from the rail of die bridge apparendy into die weeds\" and so seemed to vanish, \"Farley thought it must have been a ghost on account of the sudden disappearance\" (Lee 1963). While such an incident could happen, diere is no good evidence that it did. Not surprisingly, diose inclined to dis\u00ad miss ghost stories have suggested the tale was simply a journalistic invention. One writer has stated that \"there can be litde doubt diat it was a hoax first published by a Sydney magazine\" (Cranfield 1963). In fact, however, that account\u2014in die March 1, 1836, Teggs Monthly\u2014was preceded by an anonymous poem published years ear\u00ad lier (September 1832) in Hill's Life in New South Wales. Tided \"The Spirit of die Creek,\" it bore a prefatory note diat it was based on die murder of \"poor F*****\" at Campbelltown. It is important to note diat diis was a creative production. Not only was Hills' Life a literary paper and the narrative written in verse (thus inviting \"poetic license\"), but die story was actually fictionalized. For example, Fred Fisher became a rich ex-con via named \"Fredro\" and the murderer Worrell was represented as \"Wurlow\" (Fowler 1991, 15). To assess the credibility of the Fisher's ghost story, it is necessary to go back in time, as it were, to the February 2, 1827, proceedings of die Supreme Criminal Court (\"Supreme\" 1827). As An artist's impression of the appearance of Fisher's Ghost beckoning ident named Farley, in 1826. others have previously noted (e.g., Cranfield 1963), the trial records make absolutely no mention of a ghost. In addition to this negative evidence, I was struck by the positive evidence in the proceedings that Fisher's missing body had actually been located in a rational rather than supernatural manner. Constable George Looland testified that, on the previous October 20, blood found on several fence rails at the corner of Fisher's paddock led him to search the area. He was assisted by two aboriginal trackers who soon reported traces they thought was \"the fat of a white man\" (presumably human tissue) floating on the creek. Proceeding on, they came to a spot (apparently identified by a distur\u00ad bance of the marshy area) which they probed with an iron rod. One of the trackers \"called out that there was some\u00ad thing there,\" and a spade was procured to excavate die site. Soon the search party had uncovered the \"left hand of a man lying on his side.\" The coroner was summoned, and (the next morning) the body of Fisher was exhumed and exam\u00ad ined, whereupon \"several fractures were found in the head\" (\"Supreme\" 1827). However the story of Fisher's ghost was actually launched\u2014and it may have originated with the previously mentioned anonymous poem in 1832\u2014the legend has persisted. In the narrative the phantom behaves as one of those purposeful spirits of yore who sometimes \"advised where their bodies might be discovered\" (Finucane 1984, 194). Folklorists recognize such tales as types of supernatural legends\u2014that is, \"supposedly factual accounts of occur\u00ad rences and experiences which seem to validate superstitions\" (Brunvand 1978). Evidence of folklore in progress is quite evident. Numerous variations in the tale (apart from the fictional\u00ad izing process) are suggestive of oral transmission. Consider a specific example. Since at least the 1950s lighthearted vigils for the ghost have been held, widi crowds typically gather\u00ad ing at midnight on June 17. The chosen site is the bridge across Fisher's Ghost Creek because, according to one account, \"it was on die rail of the bridge ... that Fisher's Ghost was always seen\" (\"Fisher's Ghost\" 1957). But when Peter Rodgers and I made our pilgrimage to the spot, locals told us (and other sources confirmed) that the original bridge was not in precisely the same place. More significantly, the earliest accounts of the story have the ghost sit\u00ad ting on the rail of z fence. With that sim\u00ad ple transformation of a motif {as folk\u00ad lorists term a narrative element)\u2014from fence rail to bridge rail\u2014the site of the purported apparition also became translocated.

DOUGLAS M. STOKES There are 86,493,225 ways to pull 12 rabbits out of a hat containing 30 rabbits. This and similar facts have major implications for the validity of the statis\u00ad tical meta-analyses that form much of the present case for the existence of such parapsychological phenomena as ESP and psychokinesis. The above factoid is just one example of the combinator\u00ad ial explosion, or the counterintuitively large number of ways that one may select k objects from a set of n objects. For instance, there are more than 635 billion 13-card bridge hands that can be dealt from a 52-card deck. My attention was drawn to the implications of the com\u00ad binatorial explosion for parapsychology as I read a recent 22 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER article in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research describ\u00ad ing an ESP study conducted by Alan Vaughn and Jack Houck (Vaughn and Houck 2000). Vaughn and Houck's experimen\u00ad tal data consisted of the ESP-gucssing results sent to them by twelve subjects who had used their newly developed intuition- training software. Vaughn and Houck state that the probabil\u00ad ity that the level of success achieved by these subjects could have occurred through plain luck (i.e., in the absence of ESP) is equal to .00036. As this probability is very small, the authors conclude that their experiment provides statistically significant evidence of an ESP effect. The twelve subjects who voluntarily contributed data to Vaughn and Houck's study were self-selected from a group of subjects of unknown size who also participated in the experi\u00ad ment, but whose results were never recorded because they were never sent in. As the subjects knew their ESP scores before sending them in, it might reasonably be expected that only those subjects who were excited by the high scores they had attained would submit their results. Thus, it is possible that the entire group of subjects actually scored at chance, and that there would be no evidence for ESP if all the scores were exam\u00ad ined rather than only the scores of the twelve subjects who chose to mail their results to Vaughn and Houck. The odds against the results of the twelve subjects being due to chance are 2,778 to 1 according to Vaughn and Houck's sta\u00ad tistical analysis. They argue that, for these results to be ascribed to data selection, the larger group of subjects would have had to consist of 33,333 subjects. (This number is obtained by multiplying 12 by 2,778, the deficiency of 3 subjects being due to rounding error). They further state that they have sold fewer than 1,000 copies of their software, thus implying that die larger group of subjects could have consisted of at most 1,000 subjects. As someone who has taught statistics for over twenty years, I found Vaughn and Houck's esti\u00ad mate to be suspiciously high. It is true diat 33,333 subjects can be divided into 2,778 (actually 2,777.75) disjoint (i.e., nonoverlapping) sets of 12 subjects. But this is not the issue. The issue is rather how many potential sets of 12 subjects could have been chosen from a population of 33,333 potential subjects. The answer is a stag\u00ad gering 3.92 x 1041 sets. This number familiar combinatorial formula 033333,12) = 33,333!/(12! x 33,321!). Even if one assumes diat only 500 potential subjects existed, the number of possible sets of 12 subjects that may be chosen is 4.46 * 10:\\ nearly Avogadro's number (the number of molecules in a mole). Thus, if the 12 subjects with the best scores were to submit their data, one might expect the odds against chance to be more than 10'' to 1, even in the absence of psi. Even if only 17 potential subjects existed, there would be 6,188 possible sets of 12 subjects that may be chosen from a set of 17 subjects. Thus, I initially thought that this number of potential subjects would suffice to explain Vaughn and Houck's results, in that if only the 12 subjects with the best scores were to submit their results, one would expect results that would occur only once in 6,188 times. Thus, it seemed that one only had to assume that there were five subjects who took part in the guessing but did not send in their results in order to wipe out the evidence for ESP. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Miy/June 2001 23 A Glossary of Statistical Terms Meta-analysis: The statistical analysis of a group of experiments to determine the overall statistical sig\u00ad nificance of a reported effect. Meta-analysis may also be used to evaluate the overall size of an effect across experiments and to determine the influence of mod\u00ad erator variables on the reported effect. nl: \"n factorial.\" For a positive integer n, n< repre\u00ad sents the product of all the positive integers up to and including n. For instance, 5! = 5x4:<3*2\u00ab1 = 120. C(n,k): The number of ways that a set of k objects can be chosen from a set of n objects. C(n,k) = n\\ I (k\\ x (n - k)<). For instance, the number of ways that two objects can be chosen from a set of five objects is C(5,2) = 5! / (2! 3!) = 120 / (2-6) = 10. Statistical significance: In the present context, the probability that the results of an ESP experiment or series of experiments would occur by chance. For instance, if the results of an ESP experiment are sig\u00ad nificant at the .01 level, then there is less than a 1% chance that an ESP effect of the observed size or larger would have occurred by chance. Generally, an ESP effect would not be regarded as statistically sig\u00ad nificant if it did not reach the .05 level of significance, as in that case there would be a greater than 5% probability that such an effect could occur through random fluctuations (i.e., in the absence of ESP). Filedrawer size: The number of unpublished experi\u00ad ments that would need to be assumed to exist in order to explain away a significant effect found by meta-analysis as being due to data selection (e.g., the tendency not to report or publish experiments that do not demonstrate the effect). \u2014Douglas M. Stokes Analyzing Subjects Versus Scores However, I soon realized that the statistical tests were directed at the improbability of the psi scores, not of the sample of subjects. My next step was therefore to conduct a standard \"filedrawer\" analysis of the kind that is often used in evaluat\u00ad ing the statistical significance of psi research. The filedrawer analysis is directed at determining how many additional sub\u00ad jects (or experiments) with scores averaging exactly at chance would need to be assumed to exist in order to wipe out the statistical significance of a parapsychological study (or series of experiments). In the case of Vaughn and Houck's results, the filedrawer analysis indicated that 39 such additional sub\u00ad jects would be required. But even this number seemed suspi\u00ad ciously high to me. After all, there are more than 158 billion Douglas M. Stokes is a well-known internal critic of research methodology in parapsychology. He was one of the contributors to The Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology, and a summary of his work may be found in his book The Nature of Mind, pub\u00ad lished by McFarland in 1997. He is presently a management con\u00ad sultant specializing in statistical analysis with the firm of Sullivan, Cotter, and Associates, Inc. in Detroit. sets of 12 subjects that can be chosen from a set of 51. This seemed like overkill. Then I realized what was wrong with statistical meta\u00ad analysis as it is traditionally used in parapsychological research. It assumes that the results of the unselected sub\u00ad jects or studies are at chance. However, suppose that a large number of experiments are being conducted and only those with the highest scores are being reported or published. In that case, one would expect that the remaining scores would average below chance, rather than at chance as is assumed in the usual statistical meta-analysis procedures employed by parapsychologists. I therefore performed ten computer simulations in which I generated random data for 30 subjects and then analyzed only the 12 highest scores. In every case, the results were statistically significant at the .01 level, and in four out of the ten cases the results were even more significant than those reported by Vaughn and Houck. Thus, one does not have to assume that there must be 33,321 additional subjects to explain Vaughn and Houck's results, as those authors contend, nor must there be 39 additional subjects as die traditional meta-analysis in parapsychology would indicate. There only have to be 18 sub\u00ad jects who took part in the experiment but did not send in dieir scores in order to explain Vaughn and Houck's results. It does not seem at all implausible that there might be this many such unrecorded subjects. It is not surprising that only 18 additional subjects are required in order to explain Houck and Vaughn's results on the basis of data selection. After all, there are more than 86,493,225 different sets of 12 subjects that can be chosen from an initial set of 30 subjects, just as there are that many ways of pulling 12 rabbits out of the overpopulated hat described earlier. With over 86 million sets of subjects to chose from, it is not surprising diat the set of subjects with the high\u00ad est scores would have statistically significant results, even in the absence of ESP. Ganzfeld Results Re-analyzed The combinatorial explosion has major implications for the validity of traditional statistical meta-analyses in parapsychol\u00ad ogy. A considerable portion of die existing evidence for psi phenomena such as ESP, precognition, and psychokinesis is based on the relatively young science of statistical meta\u00ad analysis. To give a (more or less randomly chosen) example of how statistical meta-analysis usually works, let us consider Charles Honorton's meta-analysis of a series of twenty-eight ESP experiments that conducted using ganzfeld stimula\u00ad tion (Honorton 1985). Honorton's meta-analysis to CSICOP fellow Ray Hyman's criticisms of ganzfeld research. (The ganzfeld, for SKEPTICAL INQUIRER readers who may be unfamiliar with die term, is a homogenous visual field, which is often produced by shining red light on ping pong ball halves strapped over a subject's eyes. While under the ganzfeld stimulation, die subjects attempt to use their psychic powers to describe a picture or movie being viewed by a sender or 24 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER being shown on a computer screen in a distant room.) Based on the meta-analysis, Honorton concluded that the aggregated results of the 28 ganzfeld experiments were statisti\u00ad cally significant, with odds of over a billion to one against their occurrence by chance. As discussed above, a standard practice in statistical meta\u00ad analysis, at least as practiced in parapsychology, is to compute the size of the \"filedrawer.\" The filcdrawer is the number of unpublished experiments with null results that would have to be assumed to exist in order to explain away the evidence for psi provided by these 28 experiments as being caused by data selection. (Data selection in this case consists of the tendency of parapsychological researchers to publish successful psi experiments and not to publish experiments that fail to obtain evidence of psi.) Honorton conducted the standard filedrawer analysis and concluded that there would have to be 423 unreported studies averaging null results in order to attribute the overall effect found in the 28 experiments in his sample as being due to data selection. Surely, the argument goes, there cannot be this many unpublished studies in view of the small size of the ganzfeld research communiry in parapsychology and the difficulty and expense of conducting such research. After all, one is talking about more than fifteen unpublished studies for each study that was published. (As an aside, it should be noted that the filedrawer analysis is primarily directed at ruling out chance coincidence as an explanation of the results. The meta-analysis does not exclude the possibility that the significant results could be due to fraud or methodological flaws.) Again, however, the standard filedrawer analysis may be quite flawed. As discussed above, if only the best results arc selected for publication, one might expect the results of the tcmaining experiments to average below chance, rather than at chance as assumed in the usual filedrawer analysis. This would substantially lower the number of unpublished studies that would need to be assumed. Computer simulation indicates that the level of statistical significance found by Honorton is quite frequently attained when one analyzes only the 28 experiments with the best out\u00ad comes out of a set of 90 experiments with randomly generated data. Thus, the size of the filcdrawer needed to explain the results of these 28 ganzfeld experiments appears to be closer to 62 unpublished studies than to the estimate of 423 obtained by Honorton using the traditional filedrawer analy\u00ad sis. This is perhaps not so startling when one considers the fact that there are 1.55 * 10\" ways to choose a set of 28 exper\u00ad iments from a population of 90 experiments. With this many options, it is not surprising that one can find a set of 28 experiments with odds against chance of a mere billion to one. While it may be ludicrous to suppose that there are 423 unpublished experiments, it is not at all ludicrous to suppose that there might be 62. Now we are talking about only a lit\u00ad tle over two unpublished studies for each study that was pub\u00ad lished, rather than fifteen. Surely it is not beyond the realm of possibility that only one-third of the ganzfeld studies con\u00ad ducted are eventually published. Statistical meta-analysis forms a large part of the founda\u00ad tion for the scientific case for psi phenomena such as ESP and psychokinesis. The foundation may be less solid than it appears.

Though popularly attributed to photosensitive epilepsy, the episode has many of the hallmarks of mass hysteria. BENJAMIN RADFORD Pokemon is everywhere; more than a game, more than a movie, even more than a merchandising juggernaut, it is a phenomenon. It has spawned countless video games, comic books, Web sites, video tapes, magazines, clubs, music CDs, books, trading cards, three films, and, of course, an animated television series. It became such a cul\u00ad tural phenomenon that Time magazine featured Pokemon on the cover of its November 22, 1999, issue. For kids it's an engaging pastime; for Nintendo, it's a multibillion-dollar moneymaker, possibly the largest mar\u00ad keting effort in the history of toys. (The theme song's refrain contains a catchy ode to merchandising, \"Gotta catch 'em all!\") Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri spent six years 26 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER developing die game and world of Pokemon. Pokemon (a shortening of \"Pocket Monsters,\" from the original Japanese name Poketto Monsuta) began as a video game for the hand\u00ad held Nintendo Game Boy system. The television series centers on young boys and girls who wander the world of Pokemon looking for small creatures (called Pokemon) to capture, befriend, and train for battle against other trainers (and their Pokemon) in the Pokemon League. The ultimate goal is for the kids to collect one of every species and become Pokemon Masters. There are currently S more than 150 different % Pokemon (with more on the - way), and each creature has % special powers and individual = personalities. The most popu- \u00bb lar Pokemon, Pikachu, looks \u00a3 something like a yellow rat o\" with a lightning-bolt tail and = has the ability to shock its j\u00b0 opponents with electricity. \u00a3 Although it is largely for- * gotten and rarely mentioned = in current news accounts of j, \"Pokemania,\" Pokemon wasn't 3 always the benign cartoon whose worst threat was empty\u00ad ing bank accounts. In December 1997, up to 12,000 Japanese children reported ill\u00ad nesses ranging from nausea to seizures after watching an episode of Pokemon. The Episode and the Attacks On Tuesday night, December 16, 1997, Pokemon episode number 38, Dennou Senshi Porigon (Computer Warrior Polygon) aired in Japan at 6:30. The program, broadcast over thirty-seven TV stations, was already very popular in Japan, and held the highest ratings for its time slot. In the episode, Pikachu and its human friends Satoshi, Kasumi, and Takeshi, have an adventure that leads inside a computer. About twenty minutes into the program, the gang encounters a fighter named Polygon. A battle ensues, during which Pikachu uses his electricity powers to stop a \"virus bomb.\" The animators depict Pikachu's electric attack with a quick series of flashing lights. In all, millions watched the program. In one section of Japan, Aichi Prefecture, an estimated 70 percent of the 24,000 elementary school students and 35 percent of the 13,000 junior high school students watched the program, for a total of more than 21,000 in Aichi alone (Japan Times 1997). In Tokyo, the local board of education investigated all public kindergartens, primary and middle schools in the area and found that 50,714 students, or 55 percent of the whole, watched the episode ( Yomiuri Shimbun 1997c). At about 6:51, the flashing lights filled the screens. By 7:30, according to the Fire-Defense agency, 618 children had been taken to hospitals complaining of various symptoms. News of the attacks shot through Japan, and it was the sub\u00ad ject of media reports later that evening. During the coverage, several stations replayed the flashing sequence, whereupon even more children fell ill and sought medical attention. The number affected by this \"sec\u00ad ond wave\" is unknown. Doctors said that child\u00ad ren \"went into a trance\u00ad like state, similar to hypnosis, complaining of shortness of breath, nausea, and bad vision ...\" (Snyder 1997). According to the Yomiuri Shimbun news\u00ad paper, \"Victim's families re\u00ad ported that children passed out during the broadcast, went into convulsions, and vomited\" (Yomiuri Shimbun 1997b). Yet another account gives a slighdy different set of ail\u00ad ments: \"Most children report\u00ad edly said they had vision problems . . .\"(Next generation.com 1997). The victims themselves described their attacks thusly: Ten-year-old Takuya Sato said \"Toward the end of the pro\u00ad gram there was an explosion, and I had to close my eyes because of an enormous yel\u00ad low light like a camera flash\" (MSNBC 1997); a fifteen-year-old girl from Nagoya reported, \"As I was watching blue and red lights flashing on the screen, I felt my body becoming tense. I do not remember what hap\u00ad pened afterward\" (Asahi Shimbun 1997a). Information regarding exactly how many children became sick (and when) and how many were taken to hospitals is piecemeal and at times contradictory, but, as with many aspects of diis case, specific figures are known for certain areas. One hospital in western Tokyo started to receive children shortly after 7 P.M. A Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper story states that \"A total of six children aged between 9 and 15 were taken to the hospital Tuesday night. . . . After treatment there, all six returned home before midnight, a hospital employee said\" (Yomiuri Shimbun 1997d). Although many news accounts simply stale that around 12,000 children were sickened and 700 had seizures and/or were hospitalized, the truth is somewhat more complex. Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 27 The Aftermath The story of thousands of children made sick by their favorite cartoon raced through Japan. The following day TV Tokyo issued an apology, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers from Atago Police Station, acting on orders from the National Police Agency, questioned the program's producers about the car\u00ad toon's contents and production process. The Health and Welfare Ministry held an emergency meeting, discussing the case with experts and gathering information from hospitals. Video retailers across the country pulled the series from their rental shelves. Outraged mothers accused TV Tokyo of ignoring their children's health in the race for ratings, while other parents called for the implementation of an electronic screening device similar to the American V-chip that would block intense animation. Even Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto weighed in, with a comment of dubious relevance: \"Rays and lasers have been considered for use as weapons. Their effects have not been fully deter\u00ad mined.\" Although a spokes\u00ad man from Nintendo rushed to explain that the only link between its game and the car\u00ad toon was the characters, the company's shares dropped nearly five percent on the Tokyo stock market. TV Tokyo put warning labels on all future and past Pokemon episodes. Despite the scare, both kids and adults soon missed Poktmon. It was back on the air by April, along with the new release of spring shows, and promptly climbed up to third in the ratings.

Epilepsy warning on video to explain why the episode might have caused the problems it did. That bright flashing lights can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is fairly well established. There seems little doubt that at least some children did in fact experience seizures and other afflictions from watching Pokemon. Researchers believe the technique of flashing lights caused the problem, perhaps made worse by the red/blue color pat\u00ad tern. And Dr. Akinori Hoshika, a neurologist at Tokyo Medical College, confirmed that optical stimulation can pro\u00ad duce some of the symptoms found in the Poktmon victims (Sullivan 1997). In 1994, British commercial television ads and programs were limited to a rate of three flashes per second. The limit fol\u00ad lowed a 1993 incident in which an ad for noodles featuring fast-moving graphics and bright flashes sparked three seizures. In 1991, an American woman named Dianne Neale suf\u00ad fered seizures from hearing Entertainment Tonight co-host Mary Han's eerily perky voice. Her doctors said Hart's electronically transmitted voice triggered Neale's epilepsy by creating abnor\u00ad mal electrical charges in her brain (MSNBC 1997). After several teens suffered seizures while playing Nintendo video games, the company began including warning labels on much of its software (see fig\u00ad ure 1). The notice told users that the games' graphics and animation could cause a shigeki, a strong stimulation resulting in unconsciousness or seizures. In the Pokemon case, though, there appeared to be few leads to go on. Although the bright flashes seemed to be the likely culprit, the flashes had been used hundreds of times before without incident. The tech\u00ad nique, called paka-paka, uses different-colored lights flashing alternately to create tension. It is common in anime, the distinc\u00ad tive Japanese animation tech\u00ad nique used in Pokemon (and many other popular cartoons, such as Voltron, Sailor Moon, and Speed Racer). There was apparently very little difference between ep\u00ad isode 38 and the other Pokemon episodes. The best guess was that the sheer num\u00ad ber of flashes or length of the segment (reported as five to eight seconds, depending on the source) made the differ\u00ad ence. Producer Takemoto Mori had used virtually identical paka-paka in most of the previous episodes, with slight varia\u00ad tions in color and background combinations. \"During edit\u00ad ing, that particular portion didn't call my attention or bother me,\" he said. All Pokemon episodes were pre-screened before airing, and no problems were reported. Despite all the furor and theories, a clear genesis of the Pokemon panic was elusive. After four months Nintendo game booklet. 28 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER announced that it could find no clear cause for die outbreak, and Pokemon returned to the airwaves. Further research was left to doctors later that year. To date there have been only a handful of accounts and analyses of the Pokemon episode in scientific journals, three of them published in the Annals of Neurology (one by Takashi Hayashi et al., another by Yushiro Yamashita et al., and a much mote in-depth piece by Shozo Tobimatsu et al.). Hayashi et al. (1998) surveyed patients in the Yamaguchi prefecture (population 1,550,000) and found twelve affected children with no history of epilepsy. During the program, two had fainted and ten had tonic-clonic convulsions (in which the victims lose consciousness, usually with a stiffening of the body and forceful expiration of air, along with muscle contractions and other symptoms). Eleven of the twelve had \"epileptic EEG abnormalities or photosensitivity.\" The researchers concluded that the children had latent photosensitive conditions that became seizures when induced by the flashing lights. They fur\u00ad ther estimated the incidence of seizures triggered by Pokemon was greater than 1.5 per 10,000, ten times the incidence found by British researchers (Quirk et al. 1995). Yamashita et al. (1998) investigated all the children in eighty elementary schools in an area widi a population of 470,807. Out of the 32,083 students, only one child had a convulsion, but 1,002 reported minor symptoms. As half of all boys and girls saw the program, Yamashita et al. suggest that 6.25 percent of the children were affected. This is similar to the percentage of children in the general population who show photosensitivity (8.9 percent). Tobimatsu et al. (1999) studied four children who had been affected by Pokemon. The authors write that \"The prob\u00ad able cause [of the attacks] was PSE [photosensitive epilepsy] because a tremendous number of children developed similar symptoms at exactly the same time in a similar situation. . . . However it is not clear as to why so many children without any previous seizures [75%] were also affected or exactly which components of the cartoon [caused die attack].\" None of die children had a previous history of convulsions before me Pokemon episode, and all were found to be more sen\u00ad sitive to rapid color changes than monochromatic ones. All were considered to have PSE. The researchers suggest that \"the rapid color changes in the cartoon thus provoked the seizures.\" The researchers believe that the children's sensitivity to color\u2014in par\u00ad ticular rapid changes between red and blue\u2014played an impor\u00ad tant role in triggering the seizures (Tobimatsu et al. 1999). Four children, however, represent a very small sample, and die results found may not be applicable to the general population. The childrens' viewing habits and the physical setup of Japanese homes exacerbated the effect. In a country with more than 126 million people in an area the size of Montana and a population density of 865 per square mile, Japanese homes are typically quite small. Big-screen televisions are the norm, and most living rooms could apdy be described as small theaters. Many children sit very close to the television as well; one 14- year-old boy sitting three feet from his big-screen television was struck unconscious. Doubting Doctors and the Hysteria Hypothesis Yet several doctors expressed skepticism at the reported breadth of the outbreak. Dr. Yashudi Maeda, of a Fukuoka children's hospital, suspected that \"the cases [regarding video game seizures] were most likely epileptic fits due to hypersen\u00ad sitivity to light, but I am not sure about the cases in which children just felt sick.\" ABC News reporter Mark Bloch (1997) also found some scientists skeptical: In fact, epilepsy experts interviewed by ABCNews.com were skeptical the seizures experienced by hundreds of viewers were triggered by an epilcpsy-likc syndrome. \"I've never heard any\u00ad thing like it,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, director of the Epilepsy Program at the Clinical Neuro-Physiology Laboratory at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center. He said it's possible that a few of the children watching may have experienced photosen\u00ad sitive-induced seizures. \"But it's hard to conceive that 700 did.\" The director of New York University's F.pilcpsy Center agrees. \"1 think there were maybe two or three or ten that went to emergency rooms, then the media picked up the story and that in turn produced a wave of anxiety-based reactions,\" Dr. Orrin Devinsky said. The reaction could just as likely have been produced by anxiety and hyperventilation, he said. Rika Kayama, psychologist and author of a book on video games and health, told Kyodo news that the illnesses might have been caused by photosensitive epilepsy or \"group hyster\u00ad ics\" (Snyder 1997). To understand why the Pokemon episode may qualify as a case of mass hysteria, a little background is necessary. Mass hysteria (or mass sociogenic illness, as it is also called) begins when individuals under stress unwittingly convert that stress into physical ills. Peers, family members, or friends may also in exhibiting the symptoms through contagion, in which the suggestion of a threat can be enough to create symptoms. Outbreaks are most common in closed social units (such as schools, hospitals, or workplaces) and where afflicted individ\u00ad uals are under social pressure and stress (Bartholomew and Sirois 1996). The victims are firmly convinced their illness is \"real,\" although extensive tests and investigations fail to identify a cause for the symptoms. Victims are usually very reluctant to accept the diagnosis, however, and remain convinced of the legitimacy of their illness (Stewart 1991). It should be understood that the illness complaints are real and verifiable; the victims are not imagining their problems. Episodes of mass hysteria can last anywhere from a couple of hours to a few weeks, with many averaging about a week. The cases usually arise quickly, peak, and then subside just as quickly. Media reports and publicity help fuel the hysteria as news of the affliction spreads, planting the idea or concern in the community while reinforcing and validating the veracity of the illness for the initial victims. Many aspects of the Pokemon panic lend itself to a diag\u00ad nosis of mass hysteria: Many of the Pokemon-'mduccd symptoms reported (e.g., headaches, dizziness, vomiting) arc less typical of seizures than of mass hysteria. Conversely, symptoms that are associated with SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 29 seizures (e.g., drooling, stiffness, tongue biting) were not found in Pokemon victims. Three other symptoms (convulsions, faint\u00ad ing, and nausea) that were common to Pokemon victims are associated with both seizures and mass hysteria (see table 1). (It is important to distinguish seizures from epilepsy. A seizure is a symptom of epilepsy, which in turn is a general term for an underlying tendency of the brain to produce a variety of electrical energy that disrupts brain function. Seizures can be brought about through various ways [e.g., a lack of oxygen, brain injury, high fever], and one seizure does not in itself establish epilepsy. There are several types of seizures; research by Tobimatsu et al. found that the Pokemon victims they stud\u00ad ied all had generalized tonic-clonic seizures, so that is the type I have used for comparison.) The incidence of photosensitive epilepsy is estimated at 1 in 5,000 (Cohen 1999). Such an incidence (0.02 percent of the population) comes nowhere near explaining the sheer number of children affected (in some cases nearly 7 percent of the view\u00ad ers). This is not to say that some children did not endure seizures, but clearly the vast majority of children did not. Stress frequently plays an important role in cases of mass hysteria, and Japanese youth are under tremendous academic and social pressures to achieve. Japanese schools in particular are known as high stress-generating institutions, and students with low (or even mediocre) grades have been known to kill themselves. The week the episode aired, many Japanese youths were preparing for high school entrance exams and therefore already under added pressure (Asahi Shimbun 1997a). Extraordinary stress by itself cannot and does not trigger epidemic hysteria. Another aspect of Japanese culture. Table 1: A comparison of symptoms typical of gran mal (tonic-clonic) seizures, the Pokemon attacks, and mass hysterias. Aside from the first three symptoms shared by all three afflictions, the symptoms reported by the Pokemon victims more closely match those of mass hysteria than seizures. however, may contribute to mass hysteria\u2014the compulsion to conform. Bob Riel (1996), manager at a Boston-based cross-cultural training firm, puts it this way: \"One of the most important traits of the Japanese mindset is its collective nature. In Japan, we comes before /\u2014 a concept that's taught early on. Unlike Western children, who are taught to be independent self- thinkers, Japanese children are educated in a way that stresses interdependence, and reliance on others. Many Japanese habits and customs stem from this desire to maintain the group.\" This type of collective social order makes a fertile ground for contagion. In addition, some facets of Japanese culture may lend itself toward acting out. When Japanese rock star \"Hide\" Matsumoto hanged himself in May 1998, three people tried to follow him in suicide; one fourteen-year-old girl hanged her\u00ad self using a towel, the same method Matsumoto used. A rash of Japanese youth suicides also followed the death of singer Yutaka Ozaki in 1992 (Watanabe 1998). The Missing Link While several facets of the incident suggested mass hysteria, there was one large problem with that hypothesis: Most of the children were separated in their own homes. There was little opportunity for contagion, no way for a few real \"index\" cases to influence other children. With no plausible vehicle for inde\u00ad pendent children to see or hear others having seizures or symp\u00ad toms, there could be no mass hysteria. So how did it happen? The answer is that the Pokemon seizures didn't occur just at one time. The phenomenon unfolded in stages, and the chronology of events is crucial. The jump in reported cases (see the timeline) is strong evidence for the role the media played in the panic. According to news accounts of the time, the number of children said to be affected stays around 700 the evening of the Pokemon episode (Tuesday night) and the next day. The next morning \"Television and newspaper head\u00ad lines were dominated by the reports. 'Pokemon panic,' screamed national newspaper Mainichi\" (MSNBC 1997). Japanese children who hadn't heard about their peers from the news or their parents learned of it that morning, when the seizures \"were the talk of the schoolyards\" (Yomiuri Shimbun 1997b). Once the children had a chance to hear panicky accounts of what had happened through the media, their friends, and their schools, the number of kids reported the next day to have been affected\u2014two days before, Tuesday night\u2014shot up a staggering 12,000 cases. The first accounts of thousands of students being affected appear only after extensive media coverage and the opportunity for contagion in the schools. And schools are among the most common places for outbreaks of mass hysteria to begin (Stewart 1991; Bartholomew and Sirois 1996). Interesting and possibly similar incidents occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in parts of the south\u00ad ern United States during certain religious revival meetings. Fervent participants at the nighttime rallies would \". . . with a piercing scream, fall like a log on the floor, earth, or mud.

Pokemon Episode 38 (Computer Warrior Polygon) airs; the flashing lights segment begins at about 6:50; the Fire- Defense agency claims that between 6:50 and 7:30, 618 chil\u00ad dren were rushed to hospitals with convulsions, headaches, and vision problems. Tuesday December 16, 1997 (later that night) Evening news reports that hundreds of children were taken to hospitals from Pokemon fits; some news shows then rebroadcast the scene suspected of causing the seizures. A second wave of children (number unknown) is affected upon hearing the news. Wednesday December 17. 1997 Pokemon attacks are \"the talk of the schoolyards\"; \"Television and newspaper headlines Wednesday morning were dominated by the reports.\" The number of victims reported in the media ranges from over 600 to over 700. Thursday December 18, 1997 Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reports that nearly 13,000 chil\u00ad dren had \"at least minor symptoms,\" with 685 taken to hos\u00ad pitals. Friday December 19, 1997 Yomiuri Shimbun reports on completed investigations by the newspaper and local boards of education, finding the number of children reported to have experienced \"fits, nausea, and other symptoms\" to be 11,870. and appear as dead.\" The limbs and head of those afflicted would jerk and twitch. The episodes often ended with the person collapsing, though sustaining little actual harm from the episode. Neurologist E. Wayne Massey and his col\u00ad leagues at the National Naval Medical Center examined first-hand accounts of this phenomenon (called \"the jerks\") and suggested that the wild and apparently involuntary actions may have been triggered by epilepsy which was then imitated by other highly suggestible group members. Massey et al. (1981) write that among the participants \"there were perhaps some who had epilepsy. Some meetings were held during the evening with only light from torches flickering in the night. Did this trigger any seizures? Did those few with epilepsy set the stage by example to trigger mass hysterial response from others?\" Conclusion Although widely regarded either as a mystery or as a simple case of mass epileptic seizures, the 1997 Pokemon panic is much more complex than that. With very few exceptions, much of the media overlooked the possibility of, and con\u00ad tributing factors to, mass hysteria. Several researchers have noted that mass hysterias are prob\u00ad ably more common than currently recognized (sec. for exam\u00ad ple, Jones 2000). Victims are frequently reluctant to accept a verdict of mass hysteria, and Japanese victims are likely to be even more so because of the importance of \"saving face\" in Japanese culture. But there is no shame in being a victim of mass hysteria, if that is in fact what occurred in December 1997 in Japan.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 31 The Antinous Prophecies A Nostradamoid Project The prophecies of Nostradamus are said to foretell events centuries in his future. Are the prophecies merely verbal ink blots to which humans \"fit\" events? Here's a test using random simulations. CLIFFORD A. PICKOVER Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking. \u2014Wolfgang von Goethe Michel Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus (1503-1566), was a French astrologer and physi\u00ad cian, the most widely read seer of the Renaissance. Nostradamus began making prophecies around the year 1547, which he published in 1555 in a book titled Centuries. The work consisted of rhymed quatrains grouped in hundreds, each set of 100 called a \"century.\" Some of his prophecies appeared to be fulfilled, and his fame became so widespread that he was invited to the court of Catherine 32 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER de Medicis, queen consort of Henry II of France, where he cast the horoscopes of her children. I call the attribution of meaning to imprecise, poetic phrases \"the Nostradamus effect,\" and I have long been curi\u00ad ous to determine if the Nostradamus effect could be simulated with random quatrains. For example, could it be that Nostradamus's quatrains were like ink blots\u2014not really fore\u00ad telling anything but permitting people to fit future history to rather nebulous poems? To test this theory, I composed the fol\u00ad lowing quatrains of gibberish just by letting my mind wander and writing the first images diat came to my mind. As far as I was concerned, they had no particular meaning or signifi\u00ad cance. Nostradamus looked into a glass flask of steaming liq\u00ad uid to inspire his visions. I looked into the shiny glass of my computer's CRT. He may have sought to predict the future. I sought to write random phrases with absolutely no correspon\u00ad dence to historical events. After composing the quatrains, I asked people to match my quatrains with actual historical happenings. I called the qua\u00ad trains the \"quatrains of Antinous,\" which sounded and looked suitably exotic, especially with the umlaut u symbol. The ran\u00ad domized quatrains arc listed in the following table. Judge for yourself. Did I actually channel a man named Antinous? Could I be die next Nostradamus, \"the Nostradamus from New York\"? If my prophecies actually do predict future events, I hope a hundred years from now people will remember me. . .. Some of the people I surveyed considered the idea that these nine prophecies of Antinous may have been actual ancient prophecies. For some reason, quatrain 8 generated a lot of interest. Marsha S., a respondent from California, sug\u00ad gested quatrain 8 prophesied the Loma Prieta earthquake back in 1989 when the Bay Bridge broke and everyone had to drive around to get into the city. The doggone thing began in the Santa Cruz mountains ... \"silica\" refers to Silicon Valley. Mike V., from Colorado State University, writes to me: Quatrain 8 describes the asteroid impact 65 million years ago that is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs. Here is my logic. 1) Lightning comes near the peninsula, and one will swim: An observer near the impact site might see the streaking meteor as it ablated in the atmosphere as lightning. The impact crater is in the Yucatan peninsula. The Chicxulub impact would cre\u00ad ate massive ocean waves that would wash inland, thus the \"one will swim.\" 2) There is ruin, Isster, but all is not lost. The comet caused a huge crater, tidal waves, firestorms, and airborne ash that blocked the Sun for years. The dinosaurs went extinct, as did over 80 percent of life on Earth. (Not all is lost.) Life went on, and the small furry mammals that survived led eventually to ourselves. 3) From the steel and silica brim I Blood, and water, but not at cost. The impact fused the silicates and sand into a crust around the edge of the crater. If the impact object was a stony carbonaceous chondritc there would be silicates all over the impact site. If it was nickel iron, the site would be ridden with nickel, and iron, which is a component of steel. Blood and M 5Ilj\u00a3 Antutoita IJrnpljrrieB, in (Quatrain Dfarm 111 1. After the skirmish, one is wounded the other dies. The great white one sings by the fire of night. The European does not rise but merely flies Near the water, near the cross and knight. 2. An ape came from North, cool and damp. The stegosauri cry, poe, poe, loe. My rear end hurts beneath the lamp Thirty thousand opalescent hearts are low. 3.

He will leave through feigned desire. She will be united twice until the end Near the buildings, desert, and melted mire. 8. Lightning comes near the peninsula, and one will swim.

As much good as Asia, the winged, had done. There are the enemies, three, a ring, The exiles scream, while J., the wires, do not shun. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 33 water refers further to the death and destruction caused by the impact. I cannot think of any reason for \"but not at cost\" except to fill out the rhyme. Another respondent, computer scientist David G. from Lexington, Kentucky, said, \"All of these seem to be very prophetic!\" This respondent suggested diat quatrain 1 foretells the demise of IBM. The first line \"After the skirmish, one is wounded the other dies, \"refers to the fight between IBM and Microsoft. The respondent wrote to me: IBM's operating system, OS/2, was killed by the fight, and, although Microsoft's Windows was wounded, it survived. Microsoft, being the great white hope, at least initially, sings the praises of their Windows operating system in a world dark\u00ad ened by IBM. Microsoft, whose president is of European her\u00ad itage, flies into market domination from their location in Redmond, Washington (near the water), and takes over the world. I'm a litde confused by the \" cross and knight\" reference. Could it refer to a chess board? One respondent suggested that quatrain 8 referred to the Cherynobyl nuclear disaster. Denise W. wrote to me suggest\u00ad ing that the first quatrain refers to the wreck of the Titanic: The skirmish could refer to the actual collision. Trie \"great white one\" is the iceberg that have struck the ship; it would have been \"wounded' in the crash. The reference to the European refers to a flag that floats on the water in the after\u00ad math. The cross and knight nay represent some of the remain\u00ad ing wreckage or perhaps survivors in rafts. L.R. writes regarding quatrain 1: The first quatrain refers to the American War of Independence. \"After the skirmish\" refers to the war between the colonics and England. \"One is wounded the other dies\" represents America coming to power and the abolition of English rule. \"The great white one sings by the fire of night represents America celebrat\u00ad ing Independence Day with bonfires and fireworks. \"Near the water, near the cross and knight\" signifies the souls of the English and the remnants of their pride\u2014all slowly returning to England as they feel defeat deep down in their weary bones. Bill W. suggests that quattain 1 refers to Moby Dick killing captain Ahab and his crew in the novel Moby Dick. Tom R. suggests that the first quatrain refers to King Arthur Pendragon, and that the first line refers to the battle of Camlan where Arthur fought his son Mordred and impaled Mordred on a lance, while Mordred managed to mortally wound Arthur. Line 2 refers to Arthur's flag, which was a red dragon on a field of white. Line 3 refers to Arthur's having united Britain against the Romans. After Arthur died, various con\u00ad flicts arose regarding succession to the throne. Line 4 refers to Arthur's corpse being laid to rest near a lake, and the term \"the cross\" refers to his famous sword. The knight is his retainer who threw the sword back into the lake. L.R. writes regarding quatrain 2: The second quatrain predicts the fall of the Jews under Hitler. Clifford A. Pickover is the author of Dreaming the Future: The Fantastic Story of Prediction (Prometheus, 2001) in which he discusses the Antinous and other prophecies. His Web site, www.pickover.com, has received over 300,000 visits. \"An ape came from North, cool and damp\" refers to Hitler. \" The stegosauri cry, poe, poe, loe\" represents the Jews crying from the soul of a whole being annihilated. \" My rear end hurts beneath the lamp\" refers to the torture that was inflicted upon the Jews. \" Thirty thousand opalescent hearts are low\" refers to Jewish deaths. Mike F. suggested that Quatrain 2: refers to die Carthaginian general Hannibal (247 B.C.\u2014183 B.C.) who commanded the Carthaginian forces against Rome in the Second Punic War. The phrase \"came from the North, cool and damp\" refers to him crossing the Alps to attack Italy. The stegosauri (dinosaurs) are a metaphor for the large ele\u00ad phants Hannibal brought with him. \"Poe\" refers to the Po River to which the Romans rushed to protect the recently founded Roman colonies of Placentia and Cremona. \"Rear end hurts\" refers to the Allobroges, a Celtic tribe that attacked Hannibal's troops from the rear as they marched to Rome. Thirty thousand refers to the number of infantry. When I looked up the Punic War in a history book, I found that there was only 20,000 infantry. When I told the respon\u00ad dent this, he replied that \"the quatrain refers to all the hearts in: 20,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, 38 surviving elephants, and miscellaneous pack animals which might very well produce a sum close to thirty thousand.\" Other respondees thought this predicted the appearance of Yeti or Bigfoot. Jessie G., age twelve, had this to say about quatrain 3: Quatrain 3, with phrases like \"From the edge America, even as north\" refers to the pilgrims landing at Plymouth rock. \"The change is nearly as the fourth\" means the Fourth of July signing of die Declaration of Independence. \"Sea, land a victory and a cart\" refers to how the American revolution was won, because we fought the British in the sea, and on land. I don't know what a can stands for. Jack H., an electrical engineer from Portland, Oregon, sug\u00ad gested that quatrain 3 predicts Henry Ford and his impact on society. Jack writes to me: The first line, \"From the edge America, even as north,\"predicts Henry Ford's birth in Dearborn, Michigan. The line, \"A child, the rock, is born with an amber heart,\" gives us the message that Ford would have a gold heart and show stability in his personal relationships. Although Ford was not a saint, he was a family man and basic good guy as evidenced by the commission of the Oscar II in 1915, the ship he used for his pacifist expedi\u00ad tion to Europe to try and end WWI, and the Ford Foundation and Ford hospital. The most significant item is in the fourth line, \"Sea, land a victory and a cart.\" \"Sea\" refers to the ship Oscar II; \"land\" Ford's tractor company; \"a victory\" refers to Ford's factories during World War I and II that pro\u00ad duced planes, jeeps, tanks, and munitions; and \"cart\" refers to the first mass produced cars. Computer scientist Dave G. comments about quatrain 3: This is another reference to the victory by Microsoft over IBM. Microsoft, located at the edge of America, specifically in the northern part of America, is led by Bill Gates, who was regarded as a child programming prodigy, and whose heart is not blue (e.g., not Big Blue, which is IBM). The change referred to is the domination of the software industry, which occurred with the fourth release of Windows (e.g., Windows 95). The victory is over software running in computers on land, and also on the sea (as witnessed by the Navy's tests of 34 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER using Windows to control their modern ships). The victory represents Microsoft's domination of the software industry, and the cart refers to the cart that Bill Gates needs to carry his profits (e.g., money) with. Michael D. writes regarding quatrain 3: Quatrain 3 may refer to the war of 1812. 'From the edge America\" refers to the fact that one of the final battles of that war, fought near New Orleans, was actually on the \"edge,\" or border, of our country. \"Even as north\" means that this battle, like in the North (which was won by the USA, thereby end\u00ad ing the war, months before the Battle of New Orleans), would be a victory. \"A child, the rock\" may be referring to Stonewall Jackson, the general who won thai famous battle. The victory for America over the British was 'nearly as the fourth\" of July, of which the comparison is obvious. Also, this final battle (along with many other parts of the war) was won by Americans in both land and sea. Laura T. writes regarding quatrain 5: The third line, \" The white dove is a bee\" refers to Bernard of Clairvaux, who, along with Ambrose, used bee and beehive imagery when referring to the Church and faith. Bernard actu\u00ad ally said that the \"bee\" was the Holy Spirit, which of course would be the \"white dove.\" Line 2, \" With a trinity of peppers.\" may refer to the Jews, Muslims, and Christians of Jerusalem. There was some friction between the groups, and a \"pepper\" can certainly be an irritant. Bernard was a major factor behind the Second Crusade (1146-1148). As to the fourth line, \"A Bill W. Suggests that quatrain 3 refers to the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota. Huge sculptures of the heads of presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt are carved in granite on the northeast side of Mt. Rushmore. Other respondees thought quatrain 3 referred to Christopher Columbus. Some respondees thought quatrain 4 predicted the rise of Hitler. Mike M. suggests that quatrain 4 refers to the Spanish Conquistadors who came to South America and plundered the gold from the native people. The smoke refers to the tobacco that was discovered in the New World and traded for slaves. Dave G. interprets quatrain 4: This is another reference to Microsoft replacing IBM as the dominating force in the software industry. The robber again refers to the wealthy Bill Gates, who lives in the western part of the country (Washington state). The reference to gold and not silver represents the high prices charged by Microsoft for its Windows operating system. The cauldron refers to the soft\u00ad ware development process, and the placing of this on the dark\u00ad ening wine refers to Microsoft's techniques dominating the research being performed by IBM at places like its Almaden Research facility (and, Almaden is also famous for its vine\u00ad yards, thus the reference to darkening wine). Smoke refers to software, which has no physical properties (e.g., vapor), and the reference to \"often less than soW refers to software licens\u00ad ing (e.g., the process of charging for the use of software with\u00ad out the actual transfer of a tide to the software). The hash rep\u00ad resents a symbol used in programming, and the reference to a line refers to a line of code. Lea Z. felt quatrain 5 referred to Mother Teresa; however, Clark R has his own ideas about the meaning behind quatrain 5: \"Charlene\" was said to be a code for Chariemangc, king of the Franks (768-814). king of the Lombards (774-814), and emperor (800\u2014814). The line \"Princess Charlene in Italy\" refers to Charlemagne's conquering the Lombard kingdom in Italy. The \"trinity of peppers' refers to Charlemagne's father, Pepin III. The white dove is pope Leo III who crowned Chariemangc. The \"hat\" is the crown. Could it be that Nostradamus's quatrains were like ink blots\u2014not really foretelling anything but permitting people to fit future history to rather nebulous poems? hat does not hurt lepers,\" a \"hat\" can symbolize power and reli\u00ad gious orders. \"Hat\" may be a reference to Pope Eugcnius III. who approved of Bernard's Crusade, lepers lose their limbs and arc sequestered from society; similarly, the men who enter a monastery cast off items and are part of an enclosed society. Bernard was a leader of the Knights Templar, and so the \"hat,\" being the Pope, would not stand in the way of the efforts (\"harm\") of the \"lepers,\" namely the Knights. The possible meaning of the first line, \"Princess Charlene in Italy,\" has eluded me (a royal female descendent of Charlemagne?). So, in a nutshell, I think quatrain 5 refers to the Second Crusade. Lea Z. felt that quatrain 6 referred to Lady Diana Spencer. Dave G. comments about quatrain 6: Quatrain 6 refers to the demise of IBM at the hands of Microsoft. One definition of capuchin is of a South American monkey with the hair on its head in the form of a crown. This refers to the pointy haired managers of IBM going under water (sinking) in their business struggles. The holy music refers to the \"Start Me Up\" song by the Rolling Stones used in Microsoft's Windows 95 announcement. IBM has a head\u00ad quarters in England. After the fight between IBM and Microsoft (the rain), there is nothing but IBM divisions reduced to starvation (bone), with the S/390 division (the long one) suffering the most. Lea Z. said that quatrain 7 refers to John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife and also sister Caroline. Bill W. suggests that qua\u00ad train 7 refers to \"Jesus and the resurrection.\" Other respondees also thought this referred to Jesus. Judi L. writes, \"I believe quatrain 7 refers to Cleopatra and her associations with Caesar and Marc Antony.\" Some people thought that quatrain 9 described World War III. Dave G. comments about quatrain 9: This quatrain indicates that Bill Gates (\"tire dark head\") causes trouble for IBM (the small king). The reference to Asia refers to the offshore computer manufacturers, and how the cheap Asian computer clones have helped Microsoft dominate the software market. But, despite die good done by the clone makers, there SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 35 are enemies, such as the governments antitrust suit.

However, despite the screaming, the Justice department does not cause problems for Microsoft, which contin\u00ad ues to take over (\"do not shun\") the Internet (\"the wires\"). Bill W suggests that quatrain 9 refers to the \"axis powers of World War II.\" Discussion As you can see, many of the historical interpretations provided by respon\u00ad dents reflect our modern minds react\u00ad ing to amorphous poetry. Nostra\u00ad damus's prophecies tend to be general and unordered. This makes it difficult to say when a particular quatrain has missed or hits its mark. Judge for your\u00ad self. Many Web sites contain Nostradamus's prophecies, and there are a number of excellent books that delve into their possible meanings (or nonmeanings). I've also randomly scrambled real Nostradamus quatrains in order to conduct future experiments to see if people can eas\u00ad ily find \"meaning\" in them. Although I've done the scrambling by hand, I suggest future researchers write computer programs that randomly select lines from quatrains to make computer- generated \"Nostradamemes\" or \"Nostradamlets.\" It would be interesting to rigorously determine if the Nostradamus prophecies yielded more historical matches than the Antinous's prophecies. This would be difficult to assess because of die difficulty of assigning a correctness estimate to the unfalsifiable prophecies. One test would be to determine which prophecies elicited the most similar historical interpre\u00ad tations by different interpreters. I look forward to additional interpretations that you might Antinous, lover of Roman emperor Hadrian. solicit from friends regarding the Antinous's prophecies. I'd like to create a big collection of possible meanings. In any case, any\u00ad one who thinks that Nostradamus truly predicted the future should realize that his focus on France made him miss some of the most Earth-shattering happenings in the centuries after his death, from the American civil war to Darwin's theory of evolution. Incidentally, an \"Antinous\" really existed although only one of my respon\u00ad dents realized this. Antinous (110 B.C-130 A.D.) was the homosexual lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian, and they trav\u00ad eled togedier on many journeys through\u00ad out the Mediterranean world. While the two were visiting Egypt, Antinous drowned in the Nile. Hadrian loved Antinous so much that when Antinous died, Hadrian deified him. Hadrian erected temples to him all over the empire and founded a city, named Antinoopolis in his honor, near the place of his death. Many sculptures, gems, and coins sur\u00ad vive depicting Antinous as a model of youthful beauty. Finally, Linda Z. from Canada was perceptive in her analysis recognizing the possible identity of Antinous. She writes Many of the places and people men\u00ad tioned in your \"Antinous Quatrains\" would have been inconceivable in the era of Hadrian and Antinous. Such anachronistic terms include \"knight,\" \"America,\" and \"stegosauri.\" Even though the verses are supposed to be prophecy, they clearly arc not couched in the language of Roman times. From this I surmise ili.u you refer to a differ\u00ad ent Antinous, or that die \"prophecies\" arc a more recent forgery. I sense the stench of computer-generated verse. I looked a little farther, and the only \"Princess Charlene\" I could find on the Web was a llama! I suspect I'm on the right track. Nevertheless, here are my interpretations. Quatrain 3 with the phrase \"the northern edge of America' refers to Canadian geog\u00ad raphy. The second line is a reference to Newfoundland, which is always called \"die rock.\" The child with the amber heart refers to salmon. The third line, \"the change is nearly as the fourth\" clearly refers to the issuance of a new Canadian quar\u00ad ter, depicting native art from British Columbia. The fourth line with \"sea, land\" clearly refers to the Great Lakes; the vic\u00ad tory could be the War of 1812, and the can is clearly the Canadian Mint's online shopping can where coin collectors worldwide can purchase die aforementioned new quaners.

D 36 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Common Myths of Children's Behavior A number of false belief about children's behavior are very common among parents and the lay public. This article summarizes scientific findings and applies critical thinking to show what's tripped up so many of us. CATHERINE A. FIORELLO No one considers parenting a pseudoscience, but many of the \"truths\" that parents believe are con\u00ad tradicted by scientific knowledge. Discussion of these myths can shed light on our knowledge of children's behavior. In addition, the discussion illustrates some basic scientific principles that can also be applied elsewhere. 1. \"Don't give Sheldon that candy\u2014sugar makes him so hyper!\" Many parents and teachers report that childrens' consumption of sugar results in hyperactivity. But the empirical research is clear: consumption of sugar has no effect on children's behavior as rated by objective observers (Milich, Wolraich, and Lindgren 1986). So why are parents SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 37 and teachers convinced it has such devastating effects? They are not aware of the need to control fir covariates. A covariate is another variable that is associated with the variable of interest, in this case sugar consumption, but that might not be as noticeable. What variables might be overlooked by parents and teachers in judging the effects of sugar? Well, think about the situations in which children eat a lot of sugar, like birthday parties and Halloween\u2014these are situations that are likely to excite children. There's another possible covariate, too. Children whose parents don't restrict sugar at all, letting their children eat whatever they want whenever they want it, are also more likely to let their children run wild in other ways. And parents who restrict sugar (it is bad for your teeth, after all) are also more likely to teach self-restraint and obedience. But we often see the child without seeing the parenting. So we see an associa\u00ad tion between the sugar and the behavior, instead of an associ\u00ad ation between parenting style and behavior. 2. \"She's writing her letters backward\u2014it must be dyslexia.\" Many parents and teachers become concerned when a child is reversing letters, afraid that this is a sign of dyslexia. But the empirical research indicates that the primary indicator of reading disabilities such as dyslexia is difficulty with auditory processing and phonemic awareness\u2014breaking words down into their component sounds (Beitchman and Young 1997; Shaywitz 1996). Dyslexia isn't a visual disability at all, but an auditory one. Parents and teachers should be concerned about a child who can't generate rhyming words, not one who is reversing letters. So why are people so concerned about reversals? They arc not aware of the effect of base rate in interpreting behavior. The base rate is the percentage of the general population that has a given characteristic. In this case, all children start out making reversals. After all, letters and numbers are the only things that we draw where the direction the figure is facing makes a difference in its name. (A dog facing right instead of left is still a dog; a 'd' facing right instead of left is now a 'b'.) Children gradually learn which way the letters face and by second or third grade they are no longer making reversals. The same percentage of children make reversals, whether they are having difficulty with reading or not (Black 1973; Pemberton et al. 1993), although children with reading dis\u00ad abilities may keep it up a little longer. But people only notice with the kids who are having trouble\u2014and never compare it to the base rate. 3. \"Tanisha is just immature. If we have her repeat first grade, she'll do better in school.\" Many parents and teachers are convinced that some children are too young or too imma\u00ad ture for their grade placement, and that retention will help them catch up. But the empirical research indicates the oppo\u00ad site\u2014retention not only has no long-term benefits, it can actu\u00ad ally harm children emotionally (Jimerson, et al. 1997). In fact, children rate retention as the third most horrible thing they can imagine happening to them\u2014after losing a parent and going blind (Yamamoto, et al. 1987). So why are par\u00ad ents and teachers convinced that it is helpful? Lack of long- term followup and lack of a control group. In most cases, a teacher judges the outcome of retention the next year, when the child is actually repeating the same grade. At that point, the child may be doing well academically. But the following year, when the child starts to fall behind again, the teacher isn't following up any more. And the parent says, \"Well, the retention helped for a while, but now we need to try something else.\" And without a com\u00ad parison to children who weren't retained, it's hard to see the benefits of promotion\u2014and the costs of retention. 4. \"Praise doesn't work. After I compliment John, his performance goes downhill. It's yelling when\u00ad ever he messes up that really gets results!\" Many parents and teachers are convinced that punishment Catherine A. Fiorello is an assistant professor of school psychology at Temple University. She is a licensed psy\u00ad chologist in Pennsylvania and Kentucky and a nationally certified school psychologist. Fiorello can be contacted at the School Psychology Program, Temple University (004-00), 1301 Cecil B. Moore Ave. RA- 260, Philadelphia, PA 19122-6091 or by e-mail at cfiorell@nimbus. temple, edu. 38 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER is more effective in changing behavior than praise. But the empirical research indicates that positive reinforcement is more effective than punishment in changing behavior and especially in teaching new skills (Alberto and Troutman 1999). So why are parents and teachers convinced that pun\u00ad ishment is better? They aren't familiar with the statistical con\u00ad cept of regression to the mean. When you are first learning something, there is a large element of random chance in how good your performance will be. Statistically, this random vari\u00ad ation causes an interesting effect. After a particularly good performance, the chances are the next one will be worse, no matter what happens. And after a particularly bad one, the chances are the next one will be better, no matter what hap\u00ad pens. So it looks like the praise caused your performance to deteriorate, and the yelling caused you to do better. But really, it was just random variation bringing you closer to the aver\u00ad age. (For more on the regression effect, see \"Superstition and the Regression Effect,\" by Kruger, Savitsky, 23[2] March/April 1999.) 5. \"I was spanked as a kid and I turned out okay.\" Many parents and teachers are convinced that occasional spanking is necessary, or at least not harmful. But the empirical research indicates that, while most children who are spanked do turn out all right, children who are not spanked do better, and for a significant minority of children, spanking is harmful and abu\u00ad sive (Hyman 1990; Straus, Sugarman, and Giles-Sims 1997). So why are parents and teachers convinced? They aren't aware of the necessity of an appropriate comparison group. They look at their own experience without considering, \"what would I have been like if I hadn't been spanked as a child?\" Of course, children can't be exacdy equated. But when you randomly select large groups of children, you can compare the groups and draw some conclusions. As a group, children who are never spanked are in better shape psychologically\u2014they are less likely to be aggressive or depressed later in life. There is even some evidence that they may be smarter (Straus and Paschal! undated). Of course, we don't know if parents who \u00a3^ spank are different in other ways from parents who s S \" don't\u2014they might reason verbally with their children *.*\" j>. instead of spanking, or be more educated overall. The T4 only way to directly test the effects of just spanking . would be to randomly assign children to be ^^ spanked\u2014and we couldn't ethically Hyperactivity Disorder ^^V. doesn't really exist. all, we're all fidgety and A^^ ' inattentive sometimes.\" Many parents and teach\u00ad ers are convinced that ADHD isn't a \"real\" disor- \\ der, but an excuse for bad behavior or poor par- TSV^. enting, or just a way to label normal kids as hav- I ^w ing a problem. ADHD may, indeed, be over- I *^_^- diagnosed in this country. But the empirical research indicates that 3 to 5 percent of children have such severe symptoms that it affects their functioning in almost every area, including school performance, making friends, and getting along in the family and community (Barkley 1998). So why are parents and teachers convinced? They're not familiar with the process of diagnosis and the importance of norms. Parents and teachers may have read an article or heard a speaker that presented a list of symptoms, including items such as that the child \"often does not seem to listen when spoken to direcdy\" and \"often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat.\" The part that seldom gets presented, though, is the fact that diagnosticians must determine that the symptoms \"have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level\" and cause \"clinically significant impairment\" in functioning (American Psychiatric Association 1994). In other words, we are not diagnosing chil\u00ad dren who are normally fidgety; we are comparing children to others of the same age and gender and diagnosing those who have very extreme symptoms (often the most extreme 2 percent). We only diagnose children whose functioning (usually in school, with peers, and at home) is significantly impaired by their inat\u00ad tention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. And in addition we rule out other causes of the symptoms\u2014such as reactions to grief, trauma, or abuse; hearing difficulties; or physical illness. 7. \"We're in the middle of an ADHD epidemic! Ten to twenty percent of all children should be on Ritalin!\" This myth is the converse of the above. Because there is no objective test for ADHD, actually diagnosing it can be tricky. Many pediatri\u00ad cians diagnose ADHD based on a short office visit and good response to a trial of Ritalin (Copeland, et al. 1987). This process overlooks many common problems that can mimic ADHD, including depression, anxiety, medication side effects, abuse, lead COMMON MYTHS OF CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR Continued on page 44 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 39 Bertrand Russell and the Ideal of Critical Receptiveness Russell's rational and moderate skepticism entails an ideal of inquiry based on critical receptiveness which views the acquisition of knowledge as difficult but not impossible. WILLIAM HARE Bertrand Russell (1872\u20141970) enjoys a well-deserved place among the outstanding skeptics of the twenti\u00ad eth century.1 His work not only sets a powerful exam\u00ad ple of skepticism in practice, but also helps to clarify the nature and value of skepticism. Russell explicitly rejects what he calls a lazy skepticism and dogmatic doubt, where all inquiry is regarded as pointless and doomed to failure, argu\u00ad ing instead for a constructive skepticism which seeks approx\u00ad imate truth even though certainty is unattainable. He is anx\u00ad ious that his own position be seen as a form of rational doubt, which requires that beliefs be held with the degree of conviction warranted by the evidence. Tentative truth replaces cocksure certainty. 40 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Russell identifies two dispositions at the heart of the inquir\u00ad ing spirit, dispositions that to some extent tend in different directions but which need to co-exist in a dynamic tension and delicate equilibrium if either one is to serve its purpose in pro\u00ad moting the pursuit of truth. He strongly endorses a welcoming attitude toward new and controversial ideas, albeit infused with a definite reluctance and disinclination to give full assent to any idea before it has passed careful scrutiny. This is die complex, almost paradoxical, stance of critical receptiveness.1 Achieving an appropriate balance here is by no means easy, and we are always in danger of veering away from the ideal situ\u00ad ation where diese twin dispositions complement and support each other to a situation in which one begins to displace the other with unfortunate consequences. In harmony, however, they constitute an oudook that is fundamental to serious inquiry. The Spirit of Inquiry It is sometimes maintained that philosophers have traditionally regarded ideals such as truth, rationality, and impartiality, especially in the context of science, as relatively unproblematic notions; and that this simplistic view has only recently been discredited by postmodernist think\u00ad ing (Keller 1995, 11). Contrary to these sugges\u00ad tions, however, contemporary awareness of the deeply problematic nature of such ideas, and of related intellectual virtues such as open-mindedness and love of truth, is greatly indebted to philosophers of an earlier generation, such as Russell, who were under no illusions about the com\u00ad plexities in such ideals and who helped to reveal the dubiousness of naive confi\u00ad dence in them. Unlike many critics today, however, Russell sees clearly that truth, ratio\u00ad nality, and impartiality\u2014suitably qualified\u2014remain centrally important in science, education, and elsewhere.5 We find in his work a valuable account and defense of those intel\u00ad lectual virtues that sustain and promote Enlightenment ideals,' and are central to any serious understanding of what it means to be an educated person. Russell sets out to expose simplistic and overly optimistic views about the attainability of truth and rationality and he demonstrates effectively the need for caution. He points out that we can never be sure that our scientific laws are quite right, cit\u00ad ing Einstein's advance on Newton as a prime illustration of this point. He shows too that an immense amount of theory is implicated in what is thought of as pure observation, which means that the concept of evidence is inherently problematic. For Russell, a central task of philosophy is to show that what passes for knowledge is very often defective, and consequently he suggests that the demand for certainty is an intellectual vice. He frankly admits that no one can view the world with com\u00ad plete impartiality and advocates that philosophy should pro\u00ad mote \"a realization of human fallibility\" (Russell 1956, 167). Despite such limitations and qualifications, however, Russell remains adamant that ideals such as truth, impartiality, and ratio\u00ad nality (and corresponding intellectual virtues such as the wish to find out and a readiness to admit new evidence) remain indis\u00ad pensable to serious inquiry. He consistendy champions truth as an ideal toward which we can approximate even if we always fall short of complete certainty (Russell 1985, 149); and he main\u00ad tains that it is possible to make a continual approach toward impartiality. For Russell, truth and rationality, considered as ideals, remain unaffected by what were, and are, widely regarded as fatal defects (Russell 1985, 36). If such ideals are to be more than empty words, however, a certain outlook and temper of mind is necessary; his conception of the critically receptive out\u00ad look represents an attempt to capture something quite central to the spirit of inquiry. Russell looks first to science to inti\u00ad mate an appropriate standard for inquiry of any kind, and he regu\u00ad larly employs phrases such as the scientific outlook,'' the scientific temper, and a scientific habit of mind to convey a range of disposi\u00ad tions and attitudes characteristic not only of science but of all inquiry in an ideal form.1' These include a determination to suppress all other desires in the interests of a desire to know, a repudia\u00ad tion of infallible dogma, and a readiness to admit that present views are sure to require modification or outright rejection. For Russell, \"The scientific tem\u00ad per is cautious, tentative, and piecemeal; it does not imagine that it knows the whole truth, or even that its best knowledge is true\" (Russell 1961a, 245).\" This is the attitude Russell hoped to see reflected in philosophy, and in all forms of inquiry: \"Philosophy should be piecemeal and provi\u00ad sional like science; final truth belongs to heaven, not to this world\" (Russell 1927, 3). This scientific spirit encapsulates an ideal for inquiry of every kind, and Russell identifies certain key intellectual traits that char\u00ad acterize an individual genuinely committed to inquiry, in partic\u00ad ular (a) a strong desire to know, and (b) great caution in believing that one knows (Russell 1927, 3).8 The tension between these traits is palpable. A definite readiness to welcome and accept new ideas in the interests of acquiring knowledge is moderated, bal\u00ad anced, and held in check by a disposition to subject such new ideas to careful assessment before they are accepted. Conversely, excessive caution in accepting ideas is tempered by a great desire to add to one's store of knowledge. Critical receptiveness keeps alive the desire to increase one's knowledge while ensuring that the beliefs we eventually come to accept have passed scrutiny. William Hare is professor of education at Mount St. Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3N IY9, Canada. His books include Open-mindedness and Education (1979) and In Defence of Open-mindedness (1985). and his research interests focus on the intellectual virtues and their importance in the con\u00ad text of education. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 41 Russell thinks of science as the field where our greatest hopes for something close to genuine knowledge obtain, but even here an appropriate measure of doubt and tentative acceptance make clear the guarded nature of our beliefs; every scientific conclusion, says Russell, is capable of revision in the light of new evidence. At the same time, a strong desire to acquire funher knowledge serves to mitigate any tendency to be merely dismis\u00ad sive and contemptuous of new and controversial ideas, and encourages a willingness to look seriously at what can be said for them; and the absence of good evidence at the moment does not preclude entertaining the idea that such propositions might pos\u00ad sibly be true. In the case of claims concerning extrasensory perception, for example, Russell repudiates the prejudice many scientists display, and insists that we be \"guided solely by the evidence in coming to a conclusion\" (see Slater 1997, 439).g A person possessed of an inquiring spirit will, in Russell's words, love to know, and hate to be in error, in equal measure (Russell 1950, 46). Hating error suggests the need to cultivate the habit of weighing evidence as well as the various skills and abilities that complement that disposition. When Russell brings to mind how people have often been misled by vicious propa\u00ad ganda, he occasionally goes so far as to say that if, in exposing such bias, education were to foster cynical skepticism in children, at least that may make them immune to such propaganda in the future. It is more accurate, however, to diink of his general posi\u00ad tion as one supporting critical reflection rather than cynicism or extreme skepticism (see Slater 1997, 434).\"' Merely negative crit\u00ad icism and cynicism are transformed into constructive doubt if curiosity and receptivity to knowledge are encouraged. Receptiveness and a love of knowledge entail an openness to ideas especially when those ideas potentially challenge beliefs we already hold. Genuine openness, as Neil Cooper puts it, involves \"a readiness to connect the new with the old and to restructure, if necessary, the whole web of our belief\" (Cooper 1994, 464).\" It is considerably more dian a merely polite and superficial will\u00ad ingness to tolerate an opposing or novel point of view, behavior that may very well lack what Russell calls \"any inward readiness to give weight to the other side\" (Russell 1971, 106). True recep\u00ad tiveness thrives on what Russell calls \"the love of mental adven\u00ad ture, die sense of worlds to conquer by enterprise and boldness in thought\" (Russell 1971, 108). It also involves an openness to people that recognizes we have much to learn from others, not only from recognized experts, and it suggests a willingness to lis\u00ad ten in an open-minded spirit. As Russell puts it in one of his striking images, a person should not become a kind of hedgehog, \"all bristles to keep the world at a distance\" (Russell 1973a, 45). Receptiveness is not to be thought of as a disposition to remain undecided, if such a general disposition were even possi\u00ad ble, since openness to evidence will naturally lead to the forma\u00ad tion of beliefs.'-' Suspended judgment is certainly appropriate at times, especially when the experts are agreed that there is no ade\u00ad quate basis for a definite opinion, but Russell also points out tJiat it is necessary to learn to act upon the best hypothesis with\u00ad out dogmatically believing it. A sincere willingness to consider whatever may be said subsequendy against one's beliefs is indica\u00ad tive of one's ongoing receptiveness despite die fact tJiat tentative beliefs have been adopted. Nor does receptiveness demand a precipitate abandonment of presently held beliefs, in favor of a new view, at the first hint of possible counter-evidence; what is required instead is a genuine inner commitment to consider the merits of the newly emerging evidence.\" Being receptive to ideas without appropriate critical assess\u00ad ment leads to credulity, and the increasing ease with which misinformation can be spread leads Russell to view credulity as a greater evil than ever before. If completely unrestrained, receptiveness drifts inexorably in this direction, culminating in a willingness to accept an idea as true although no good rea\u00ad son is offered for it.\" Any such tendency needs to be offset by encouraging the development of a critical habit of mind (Russell 1973a, 156).\" Equally, however, a critical outlook devoid of any inward readiness to take new and contrary ideas seriously leads to incredulity, which effectively puts a halt to learning and inquiry and merely reinforces complacent dog\u00ad matism. Russell pinpoints the dilemma precisely in his obser\u00ad vation that \"it is not only that [people) are credulous where they should be sceptical; it is just as much that they are incred\u00ad ulous where they should be receptive\" (Russell 1973a, 41). The challenge is to find the balance. Openness to new ideas, then, must be accompanied by a critical assessment of those ideas if a person is to avoid becom\u00ad ing, in Paulo Freire's words, \"an 'empty' mind passively open to the reception of deposits of reality from the world outside\" (Freire 1993, 56). Such critical thinking involves a number of dispositions. It requires taking a close look at our beliefs, and at claims to knowledge advanced by others, in order to judge to what extent they are supported by reason and evidence, which Russell sometimes calls the habit of attempting to see things truly. In addition, critical thinking involves trying to turn the spotlight on assumptions, preconceptions, and those aspects of experience that are all around us but unnoticed.\"' It encompasses finding ways of resisting attempts by others to impose their ideas and deprive us of the ability to think for ourselves; here we can think of Russell's tireless condemnation of propaganda. In these various ways, an individual cries to employ critical judgment without compromising that recep\u00ad tiveness to ideas which prevents criticism from hardening into closed-mindedness. The need for the twin aspects of critical receptiveness is captured perfectly in Russell's reminder that \"submission to truth is as important as refusal to submit to the judgment of others\" (see Rempel 1995, 421). Critical receptiveness involves assessing the merits of ideas by looking careftdly but sympathetically at die reasons and evi\u00ad dence both in favor and against. Such sympathy can prevent criticism from degenerating into knee-jerk skepticism, which is destructive and ultimately cynical, where incredulity ultimately triumphs over receptiveness.'7 Russell suggests, for example, that it may be appropriate to put one's critical evaluation on hold temporarily to ensure that a fair hearing is given; he favors \"a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in [the] theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude\" (Russell, 1961b, 58).* That ultimate demand for evidence does not itself put one's 42 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER receptiveness in question; it is indeed an important aspect of being receptive, in this case to the possibility that evidence may indeed be at hand to support a view which at first seems incred\u00ad ible or to overturn a view one presently holds. Much depends, of course, on the spirit in which the demand is made; some\u00ad times it can indeed seem suspiciously as if nothing will ever count as sufficient evidence. In such cases, the demand merely disguises the fact that our minds are closed. Russell's account helps us to appreciate that it is a difficult matter of judgment to find the appropriate balance between receptiveness and criticism in practice, and also to recognize when we and others are giving each of diese dispositions their due. The matter is further complicated by the fact diat our sense of where the balance is at present shifts from one context, and one community, to another. If we think in terms of the general public and the influence of the media, we may conclude that a healthy dose of reflective skepticism is just what is required to counteract what Richard Dawkins calls \"the current epidemic of paranormal propaganda.\"\" Other contemporary scientists, however, thinking primarily of the attitudes of practicing scien\u00ad tists, believe that the scales are skewed very much in favor of negative criticism when it comes to unorthodox views or extra\u00ad ordinary claims that appear to threaten well-established scien\u00ad tific beliefs, and they argue for a greater degree of receptivity. Brian Josephson, for example, argues that the claims of \"hereti\u00ad cal scientists\" are dismissed as \"nonsense or impossible, generally without any serious attempt to look at the evidence\" (Josephson, 1994).\" The essence of his objection is not that the unorthodox claims he mentions are actually credible, but that their merits have not been seriously assessed in a genuine scientific inquiry. Josephson is himself somewhat skeptical, but he refuses to say a priori that something cannot be the case. He fears that various \"defense mechanisms\" spring into action to defend the \"purity\" of science, and that claim, if true, would clearly undermine the kind of receptiveness that calls for an impartial assessment of an unorthodox claim in the light of evidence.21 A fine contemporary statement embodying the attitude involved in critical receptiveness and acknowledging the prob\u00ad lem of satisfying both dimensions is found in the writings of the late Carl Sagan. Sagan warned against the danger of skep\u00ad tical criticism degenerating into a debunking of everything new and different: \".. . what is called for is an exquisite bal\u00ad ance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. . . . But if you are able to exercise only one of these modes, which ever one it is, you're in deep trouble\" (Sagan 1987, 41\u20142). Sagan thought of these needs as involving a seemingly self-contradictory mix of attitudes, but somehow justice had to be done to both aspects. Such conflicting demands seem likely to call for a \"tolerance for ambiguity\" in the individual if a finely tuned critical recep\u00ad tiveness is not to collapse into a one-sided emphasis on one aspect to the exclusion of die other. Sagan's perceptive com\u00ad ments offer some encouragement that Russell's insights have filtered through to our own day to help illuminate the com\u00ad plex nature of die inquiring spirit and skeptical outlook.

I believe that \"critical receptiveness\" captures everything essential to the idea; if the attitude is critical, it cannot be dogmatic. 3. Russell's views arc foreshadowed in die writings of Charles S. Peirce (1839-1914), who observed tion\" (1.137). Peirce to attain \"absolute certainty\" (1.141), proclaiming the tallibilist principle that \"we can never be absolutely sure of anything\" (1.141). Nevertheless, Peirce retained a conviction th.tt it was vital to be \"seized with a great desire to learn the truth (1.235). and insisted diat genuine inquiry is undertaken \"regardless of what die color of diat truth may be\" (7.605). References are to volume and para\u00ad graph in the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peine (Hartshorne. Weiss, and Burks eds. 1931-58). (Cited in subsequent notes as Peirce, Collected Papers.) I am primarily indebted to Susan Haack for her rich and illuminating account of Pcirce's remarks on intellectual virtue (Haack 1998). 4. This is not to say diat open-mindedness and critical dunking will guar\u00ad antee diat truth or objectivity will be achieved, nor that they are invariably desir\u00ad able, but that there is a presumption in favor of these traits for anyone who rakes the pursuit of trudi seriously (Hare 1985. 4). 5. Russell remarks elsewhere that die scientific oudook is the intellccruaJ counter- pan or \u00bbtui is. in the practical sphere, die oudook of liberalism (Russell 1950,28). 6. Here again, rhcre is an interesting parallel widi Peirce, who had spoken of the scientific spirit (Collected Papers 1.34, 1.55, 1.148), by which he meant to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 43 convey an attitude of mind that takes seriously a commitment 10 the pursuit of truth, a determination to root out error, and a readiness to discard faulty views. 7. \"Best knowledge\" here must be interpreted along such lines as that which appears to be most securely established as knowledge, to preserve the conceptual link l>ctwccn knowledge and truth. 8. Peirce, in a remarkably similar way, had proposed two qualifications for the true scientist: (a) having as the dominant passion in one's soul a determina\u00ad tion to find out the truth in some area, whatever the color of that truth may be; (b) a talent for severely critical thought. Peirce, Collected Papers 7.605. 9. Russell made this comment in 1953. and it is possible that his assessment would differ today in view of further experimentation since that lime, for exam\u00ad ple, he also considered the claims of astrology in the same context, and in that case his verdict was that there was so much evidence against astrology that it would be a waste of research funds to look further into the matter. At the same time, however, he conceded that if a private researcher were able to establish a prima facie case in favor of astrology, then the true scientific outlook would require thai a fresh examination of the evidence be undertaken. 10. When Russell defends the value of skepticism, he makes it clear that he rejects extreme forms of skepticism and defends a more moderate, rational form (Russell 1985.11). 11. For an excellent discussion of critical reccptiveness in the context of lit\u00ad erary studies, sec Alter (1998). 12. By contrast, as Herbert Feigl reminds us, the mind of the extreme skep\u00ad tic is \"open at bodi ends\"\u2014everything floats dirough and nothing sticks (Feigl 1976, 74). 13. Neil Cooper (1994. 462) points out the virtue of intellectual pertinac\u00ad ity. And Basil Mitchell similarly commends a \"principle of tenacity\" which allows a belief to be persevered with long enough for its potentiality to be prop\u00ad erly explored (Mitchell 1976, 107). 14. Scheffler's reminder that acceptance can also mean simply taking an idea seriously enough to look into it further is very useful in reconnecting receptive- COMMON MYTHS OF CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR from page 39 poisoning, hearing impairment, and more. True, ADHD isn't caused by bad parenting, but children from a chaotic home may never have learned to focus and pay attention. Making the diag\u00ad nosis based on a good response to Ritalin can be especially dan\u00ad gerous, since some of the disorders that mimic ADHD can be made worse (including tic disorders and anxiety disorders). In addition, since Ritalin is a stimulant, it can improve per\u00ad formance in anyone who takes it, and up to 30 percent of chil\u00ad dren properly diagnosed with ADHD do not have a positive response (Barkley 1998). The diagnosis of ADHD is as much a process of ruling everything else out as it is a process of identi\u00ad fying ADHD. We don't really know if there is a physical differ\u00ad ence in the brain wiring or chemical makeup of a child with ADHD; we just rule out every other possible cause of the inat\u00ad tention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. So if a child gets a diag\u00ad nosis of ADHD from a professional who has only seen the child briefly, or if a physician suggests trying Ritalin \"just to see if it works,\" or if a well-meaning teacher says that she \"knows\" a child has ADHD because she's seen it so many times, a parent should remain skeptical and request a comprehensive evalua\u00ad tion. And even if a full evaluation identifies a child as having ADHD, a rush to Ritalin isn't necessarily called for. The benefits of scientific thinking are not limited to ques\u00ad tions that seem scientific. Many aspects of parenting are intu\u00ad itive, but an awareness of what science says about children's behavior can still be helpful. In addition, the principles of sci\u00ad entific thinking illustrated in these examples may be useful elsewhere in daily life. Remembering regression to the mean ness with criticism: \"... the tentative acceptance of a relatively unsupported hypothesis is compatible with acknowledgement of controlling tests to which future experience will subject it\" (Scheffler 1967, 86). 15. For an account of Russell's views on critical thinking, see Hare (1999). 16. To enable us. in Peirce's words, \"to perceive what stares us in the face with a glare that, once noticed, becomes almost oppressive with its insistency\" (1.134). Russell (1973b, 91) speaks of going through life \"imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense.\" 17. Peirce also makes the point that a scientist will, lor the time being, enter\u00ad tain and respect a hypothesis which is \"wildly incredible,\" though in due course it will be \"cleared away\" if it fails to withstand scrutiny (1.120). 18. John Passmore (1994, 47) provides an interesting autobiographical example of the attitude Russell has in mind when he comments on his own reac\u00ad tion to generalizations about art: \"My first reaction when I encounter such a generalization ... is to welcome it with enthusiasm. It is a view I very much like. But then counterexamples pour into my mind... .\" 19. Dawkins (1998) believes that an interest in the paranormal reflects the same sense of wonder and appetite for mystery that is so important in science, but that audiences are not encouraged to be critical and demand \"a certain minimal standard ot evidence.\" Peirce was sympathetic to the \"wild play of the imagination\" in science, but this did not prevent him trom roundly con\u00ad demning \"rank charlatans\" who try to establish foregone conclusions without regard to evidence (1.235). 20. Josephson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973. 21. No doubt Josephson would agree that, in the absence of anything in the way of serious evidence, as in the claim that some people possess the ability to remotely-vicw Earth three hundred years in the future, rcceptiveness to such claims, in the sense of according them any probability whatever, is indistin\u00ad guishable from gullibility (sec Gardner, 1997).

CSICOP was founded at a conference at SUNY-Buffalo, April 30-May 1, 1976. The first issue of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (ini\u00ad tially called The Zetetic came out that fall (Fall/Winter 1976). To mark these anniversaries, over the next several issues, in addi\u00ad tion to our regular content, we plan to publish short twenty-fifth anniversary sections. The essays in these sections are by five persons close to CSICOP \u2014 four since day one. Each has an insider's view yet each offers a different, personal perspective. They are from the forthcoming book Skeptical Odysseys (Prometheus, 2001), a collection of original first-person accounts by the world's leading paranormal inquirers, edited by CSICOP founder Paul Kurtz in honor of CSICOP's twenty-fifth anniversary. We'll highlight some of Kurtz's reflections in a future section. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 45 25 Years of Science and Skepticism Kendrick Frazier First of two parts My introduction to the modern skeptical move\u00ad ment came in a letter dated April 15, 1976. I still have it. 1 was then editor of Science News, the week\u00ad ly newsmagazine of science, in Washington. The letter said the upcoming annual conference of the American Humanist Association, April 30-May 2, in Buffalo \"is attracting international attention and will surely produce ongoing interest and controversy.\" I could not have known dien how true that statement was. Nor how much my going there would change my professional life forever. For die next quarter century (and beyond, I hope), 1 would be happily caught up in a pan of what\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014we might call the international skeptical movement. I prefer to call it scientific skepticism. Kendrick Frazier has been Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER since 1977, one year after its inception. He is a CSICOP Fellow and a member of the Executive Council. From 1971\u20141977 he was Editor of Science News. Kendrick Frazier \"Coincident with the Conference,\" the letter went on, \"will be formal announcement of formation of a new interna\u00ad tional 'Committee to Scientifically Investigate Claims of Paranormal and Other Phenomena.' This committee is an outgrowth of 'Objections to Astrology,' which created worldwide attention when released in The Humanist magazine (Sept./Oct. 1975). The primary thrust of the Committee will be to '. . . examine openly, completely, objectively, and carefully . . .' questionable claims con\u00ad cerning the paranormal and related phenomena, and to publish results of such research. We earnestly invite your consideration to covering this impor\u00ad tant series of dialectic discussions.\" The letter said all the conference's Saturday sessions will center on \"The New Irrationalisms: Antiscience and Pseudoscience.\" It listed some of the participants and included a preprint of a formal announcement of the Committee and a copy of the \"Objections to Astrology\" statement, signed by 186 leading scientists, including eighteen Nobel laureates. I was very familiar with that statement. The previous fall, we had published it verbatim, in small type, in Science News (108:166, Sept. 13, 1975), together with a short news article, 46 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER \"Science vs. astrology: New battle, old war.\" The statement had immediately generated wide discussion and debate. Said our article, \"Unlike many public utterances by large groups of distinguished scientists, the attack on astrology pulls no punches. The statement says the belief that the stars can be used to foretell the future has 'no scientific foundation' and bluntly labels astrologers 'charlatans.'\" We spoke at die time with Bart J. Bok, a past president of die American Astro\u00ad nomical Society and lead author of the statement. He told Science News he had become disturbed at the increasing inter\u00ad est in astrology among his freshman students at the University of Arizona and confusion between it and astronomy. The statement had ignited immediate worldwide contro\u00ad versy. Our news article at the time concluded: Reaction has been mixed. Astrologers understandably were upset, claiming they had been misunderstood. A Washington Star editorial called the statement \"the most futile verbal broadside of recent memory,\" but con\u00ad cluded, \"we hope it made the scientists feel better.\" Bok says most of his mail has been favorable. Whether any minds have been changed remains to be seen. If astrology could survive per\u00ad secution by the Medieval Church, it is likely to outlive another scholarly blast. \u00a5*i s ht My years at Science News had made me interested in the flip side of sci\u00ad ence: pseudoscience. In more general terms I was interested in the wide\u00ad spread public interest in fringe-science ideas and the difficulties people have distinguishing what really is legitimate science, especially at its most specula\u00ad tive and fantastic, from equally specu\u00ad lative ideas not anchored in any kind of scientific knowledge or reality. All science editors get letters from readers with new dieories of the universe, ideas for new inventions that seem to contradict the laws of physics, and full commentaries on any new speculative ideas reported in science. Some of diese come from outright cranks and can be saved in die cranks file or tossed. But many others come from very intelligent people who have a lot of good ideas but don't quite know enough about how science works to con\u00ad nect diem to real science, to research and write them up prop\u00ad erly, and to get them tested and evaluated. In either case some evaluative function is needed. The problem is compounded by whatever seems popular and faddish at the time. In response to readers' requests we had published three articles in Science News in the mid 1970s that tried to examine in a balanced way some popular claims of die time, one on Transcendental Meditation, one on Uri Geller, one on Kirlian photography. But we weren't able to do a very good job at diem, I'm afraid. I got a letter from Martin I had traveled all over and even visited Antarctica and the South Pole. But nothing dealt with people's deepest interests and emotional passions and intellectual misperceptions as the topics\u2014the new irrationalisms\u2014 these scholars and experts were examining. Gardner, gendy complaining and wonder\u00ad ing if we had changed our policy of covering only genuine science. I knew who Martin Gardner was. A decade earlier a physicist friend had given me a copy of Gardners Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, and I had devoured it, fascinated with his keen and amusing insights into the underworld of pseu- doscientists and crank scientists. And of course he was famous as Scientific Americans Mathematical Games columnist. After getting his letter, I wrote back. I said we hadn't changed our policies, we were only trying to respond to readers' interests in finding out what science knew about the topics in question. But I told him that was difficult. Editors like me badly needed a central resource to go to\u2014a group of scientists and other experts interested in these issues but who, like him, had a critical bent and could help us evaluate fringe claims. The invitation from Buffalo seemed to announce that very thing. I flew up to Buffalo and covered this founding conference of what became the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). It was one of the most exhilarating times of my life. It was held on die dien- brand-new Amherst campus of die State University of New York at Buffalo. It was there I first met and talked with Paul Kurtz (then a SUNY- Buffalo philosophy professor, editor of The Humanist, and co-chairman with Marcello Truzzi of the fledgling committee), James Randi, Philip J. Klass, L. Sprague de Camp, Ray Hyman, Truzzi, philosopher Ernest Nagel, Larry Kusche, and several dozen other prominent participants. At Science News I had covered scien\u00ad tific meetings of many scientific organizations\u2014the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, Geological Society of America, American Meteorological Society, and others. I had traveled all over and even visited Antarctica and the South Pole. But nodiing dealt with people's deepest interests and emotional passions and intellectual misperceptions as the topics\u2014 the new irra\u00ad tionalisms\u2014these scholars and experts were examining. I recendy wrote about diis founding conference in some detail in my 8,000-word entry on \"CSICOP\" in the Encyclopedia of the Paranormal (Prometheus 1996), edited by the late Gordon Stein, so won't go into all the substance of it again here. I went back to Washington and eventually wrote a three-and-a-third-page Science News cover article, \"Science and the Parascience Cults,\" subtitled, \"How can the public sepa\u00ad rate fact from myth in the flood of occultism and mm1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 47 pseudoscientific theories on the scene today? Help is on die way.\" We had an artist do a neat cover illustration of a knight on horseback spearing a multiheaded dragon. The dragon's heads had symbols for psychic-spoonbending, UFOs, astrol\u00ad ogy, and the Bermuda Triangle. The cover type was \"Challeng\u00ad ing Pseudoscience.\" It was published May 29, 1976. Some of the conference participants familiar with the pas\u00ad sions these topics raise had warned me to expect a strong reaction to whatever I published, but I was not prepared for what happened. We received more letters to the editor than about any previous Science News article in memory. Most of the writers commented thoughtfully about the issues of sci\u00ad ence and pseudoscience. But some were upset, and some con\u00ad sidered the committee's effort an attempt by science to squelch mys\u00ad tery, imagination, intuition, and beauty (Paul Kurtz had effectively addressed that very issue at the con\u00ad ference). Two demanded their sub\u00ad scriptions be canceled. Other national publications, including The New York Times, which published an excellent two-column article, also had been there and cov\u00ad ered the conference. So like the Objections to Astrology statement itself, the found\u00ad ing of CSICOP, although most of the scientific community was supportive, aroused controversy and debate, botli thoughtful and heated, among the public and in the media. Much the same can be said about CSICOP's expanding activities ever since. In August 1977, CSICOP held a news conference in New York City in conjunction with a meeting of its executive council, the first since the organizing conference. Here too a pattern was established. The committee called the NBC television network to task for credulous pseudodocumentaries on the Bermuda Triangle, Noah's Ark, and UFOs. It criticized the Reader's Digest for articles on parapsychology that, said the committee, pre\u00ad sented as fact a number of assertions and anecdotes for which there was little or no documentation. The New York Times gave the session a full-column article, \"Panel Fears Vogue for the Paranormal\" (August 8, 1977). It noted that the com\u00ad mittee was appealing to the media of mass communications to provide more balanced and objective treatment of such subjects. It quoted an NBC spokesman about the programs criticized: \"They are done as entertainment, not as news. We're not presenting them as fact.\" (This was a response that would become familiar over the years.) The Reader's Digest could not be reached by die Times science reporter for com\u00ad ment, but later when I wrote an invited feature article for Smithsonian magazine on CSICOP and its battle against The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER draws upon those with knowledge, insight, and expertise on these issues whatever their formal backgrounds. It crosses disciplines, works both inside and outside of academia, draws upon investigative expertise wherever it may be found. It is a truly democratic, merit-based pseudoscience (\"UFOs, horoscopes, Bigfoot, psychics, and other nonsense,\" March 1978), the Reader's Digest quickly reprinted it in condensed form in all worldwide editions (July 1978). That August 1977 meeting had been pivotal for me as well. At it I was formally asked to become editor of CSICOP's jour\u00ad nal, then called The Zetetic and subsequently renamed the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, succeeding sociology professor Marcello Truzzi. In those first years it was published only twice a year, and I agreed. I have been editor ever since. We went quarterly with the first issue of volume 3, Fall 1978, and bimonthly (and to regular magazine format from the original digest size) with the January/February 1995 issue. Although the amount of material published annually and the workload have increased over the years, it has been a pleasure. I feel it a great privilege to be editor all these years of what has become the central international journal of scientific skepticism\u2014 the worldwide effort to promote scientific inquiry and critical think\u00ad ing, to evaluate paranormal and fringe-science claims of all sorts from a scientific viewpoint, and to serve as a forum for informed discussion of movement. all relevant issues. Psychologists, physicists, philoso\u00ad phers (the three leading disciplines represented), academics in all other areas of university life, science teach\u00ad ers, scientific or investigative journal\u00ad ists and communicators, and informed citizens from many walks of life concerned about all these issues together have formed a strong world\u00ad wide community. They may have a wide variety of backgrounds and diverse views and approaches, but this is where they find a com\u00ad mon bond, and an outlet for publication and discussion. From the small core group of Executive Council members and found\u00ad ing fellows who helped create the original committee, this effort has expanded multifold and worldwide over and over. In fact, the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER draws upon those with knowl\u00ad edge, insight, and expertise on these issues whatever their for\u00ad mal backgrounds, affiliations, memberships, and nationalities. It crosses disciplines, brings the physical and human-based sci\u00ad ences together, works both inside and outside of academia, draws upon investigative expertise wherever it may be found, and addresses issues of passionate concern to the public and of significance to science, education, and public policy. It is a truly democratic, merit-based movement. Its core unifying values are a respect for the creative and evaluative methods of science, rea\u00ad son and rationality, critical thinking and judgment, and free\u00ad dom of thought and inquiry, all applied to important issues that relate to scientific evidence or scientifically testable claims. 48 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER When CSICOP and the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER were founded 25 years ago here were four of the hot fringe-science topics that captivated public and media attention (in addition to the big- three perennials of psychics, UFOs, and astrology): Velikovsky, and his fantastic planetary-pinballs, worlds-in-collisions theo\u00ad ries to try to explain catastrophic events in biblical times; Erich von Daniken, and his best-selling chariots-of-die-gods theories that ancient astronauts from other worlds had built many of Earths ancient monuments; birthdate-based biorhythm theory; and the Bermuda Triangle. All these topics were touted in books that sold millions of copies. Notice something about all these latter issues. You don't hear much about them anymore. Is this a victory for reason and rationality? Did skepticism prevail? Not really. Look at some of the hot topics of today: Several scholars in prominent academic positions claim that \"intelli\u00ad gent design\" instead of die creative processes of evolution is responsible for the intricacies of life. Therapeutic Touch, a hands-waving therapy invok\u00ad ing invisible human energy fields unknown to science, is widely taught in nursing schools. Magnetic forces are assumed to influence health and human performance, so now \"magnet therapy\" has become a big business. Nineteenth-century spiritualism has been revived in best-selling books and TV programs as modern-day medi\u00ad ums contend diey can help you com\u00ad municate with your long-dead loved ones. Unproven medical remedies, under die attractive-sounding rubric of alternative medicine, have gained a proclaimed public respectability unheard of since die days of snake-oil salesmen. Modern-day numerologists profess to find hidden codes in computer analyses of biblical texts. And we may only now be emerging from a decade-long orgy of accusations and recriminations based on die dubious idea that accurate \"repressed memories\" of childhood sexual abuse or odier horrible past events can be revived through hypnosis and questionable kinds of dierapy. And we still have die big-diree: psychics, UFOs, and astrol\u00ad ogy. Widi UFOs, for instance, we went through a credulity explosion in the 1980s and early 1990s. Claims of people being abducted by aliens\u2014the hidden memories usually obtained through hypnosis conducted by UFO-abduction propo\u00ad nents\u2014gained widespread popular acceptance. And we simul\u00ad taneously went through an incredible period in which a series of books by UFO proponents and frequent credulous television programs all proclaimed a government cover-up of a crashed flying saucer near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. Some even claimed alien bodies had been found. These reports gained increasing visibility and credence in die media and public\u2014 While the specific topics come and go, the more general manifestations of fringe-science, pseudoscience, and the paranormal persevere. They arise, over and over again, in new guise, with new language, new clothing, and new proponents. becoming essentially a modern folk myth. That is, until die past few years when clear evidence was produced diat the recovered Roswell debris was actually from a lost assem\u00ad blage of balloons and instruments launched from Alamogordo, New Mexico, June 4, 1947. These New York University atmos\u00ad pheric sciences experiments were to develop constant-level bal\u00ad loons. These unclassified experiments were in turn pan of a top secret project to detect round-die-world acoustic effects of future Soviet nuclear tests. Once these facts were disclosed and confirmed, the responsible media began to back off from die crashed-saucer claim. Nevertheless, the folk myth of a crashed saucer at Roswell will survive. The point is that specific topics of pseudoscience, fringe-science, and die paranormal do come and go. This is especially die case widi diose having a strong, charismatic figure associated with them. As long as diat larger-dian- life personage (Velikovsky was one example, with his silver hair and Old Testament demeanor) is still around writing and promoting his cause, die issue stays alive. Once he or she is gone, it may noticeably diminish, leav\u00ad ing only lesser disciples fighting rear\u00ad guard actions for years to come to help keep the light alive. Odier topics have dieir run in the press and among die public, until boredom sets in and some other fad belief emerges. But while the specific topics come and go, the more general manifesta\u00ad tions of fringe-science, pseudo- science, and the paranormal perse\u00ad vere. They arise, over and over again, in new guise, with new language, new clothing, and new proponents. And it is only rational for scientists and skeptics to realize that. Any hope scientists and skeptics may have to abolish from public consciousness nonsense and irrationalisms in the name of science is doomed to failure. The positive appeal of such stories, the understandable human yearning for having the world die way we want it to be rather dian the way it is, die lure of easy cure-all remedies, the appeal of comforting ideas, the search for significance and meaning, the desire for some all-powerful presence to guide our lives or reward good and keep the forces of evil at bay, the childlike attraction to New Age magical dunking, the quest for mystery and the \"unknowable,\" die hope for everlasting life in some form\u2014all these powerful psychological forces and human needs ensure that new manifestations of paranormal and fringe-science ideas will always have a welcome reception in people's hearts and minds. Part 2 will appear in our next issue. LJ SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 49 Pseudoscience, Nonscience, and Nonsense Twenty-Five Years of CI James Alcock As the nineteenth century turned into the twentieth, men and women of science were confident that in the century to come, universal education and the growth of science would slowly but surely eradicate ignorance, supersti\u00ad tion, and irrational belief. How could they have foreseen that a century later, despite burgeoning enrollments in universities and almost unbelievable advances in science and technology, society would be awash in mysticism, psychic detectives, Creation Science, therapeutic touch, homeopathy, chiro\u00ad practic, channelling, UFOs, and remote viewing? Had these people a century ago been given a glimpse of die world to come, our world of today, what sense could they have made of it? Indeed, what sense can we make of it? Despite the central importance of science and technology in modern society, the public does not cry out for the testing of homeo\u00ad pathic remedies; instead, our trusted pharmaceutical chains promote them alongside the products of scientific research. James Alcock is professor of psychology at Glendon College, York University, Toronto. He is a Fellow, member of the Executive Council, and member of the Board of Directors of CSICOP. James Alcock The public is not concerned that the nursing profession\u2014long characterized by devoted caregivers who were trained in the methods of data-based medicine\u2014is embracing therapeutic touch, which involves no touching at all, but instead the supposed manipu\u00ad lation of magical energy fields. The public does not react with skepticism to the notion that refrigerator mag\u00ad nets, despite their extremely short range, can lessen pain and even heal the body. The public does not rise to challenge claims that psychics can and have solved crimes that baffled the police. The public does not wince when one celebrity after another talks of die importance of astrology or psy\u00ad chic readers or out-of-body experi\u00ad ences in his or her life. Whither science? The public cannot get enough of the ultimate products of science. We rush to stuff our snouts firmly in the trough of technology, expecting each new season to bring us quicker, better, more exciting technotoys. We want raster computers, more pervasive Internet links, sooner-rather-than-later cures for the ailments that plague us. And yet, rather than honoring science, the pub\u00ad lic is generally disdainful of both science and scientist, while welcoming to their bosom the purveyors of magic, shamanism. 50 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and supernaturalism. And yet science thrives. It thrives in a cul\u00ad ture of its own, to a considerable degree isolated from modern popular culture, the culture in which most people live. It is often perceived as too difficult, too arcane, too removed, to be of interest to most modern people. Whither parapsychology? How has parapsychology fared over the past twenty-five years? Ironically, this age of magical thought and paranormal belief has given very little more succor to parapsychology than it has to science. Formal parapsychol\u00ad ogy and science are both being pushed aside by an undiscern- ing public eager to embrace uncritically the next spiritual or paranormal fad, the next \"feels great\u2014must be good\" belief sys\u00ad tem. It is important to make a distinction between formal para\u00ad psychology and the psychic nonsense and superstition that often operates in its name. While we may \"tut tut\" the para- psychologists for their unending quest to put belief in the para\u00ad normal on a scientific basis, we need to recognize that we and they have much in common\u2014a shared belief that the scientific method, with its insistence on the careful testing of theory against experience, hypothesis against data, is the best path toward the true understanding of the world around us. We may differ in our assumptions about the underlying nature of real\u00ad ity, but we generally share a common desire to employ appro\u00ad priate methods to put our ideas to the test. While CSICOP members may be galled by the seemingly insatiable public appetite for psychic nonsense, it must be even more galling to parapsychologists, who have labored long and hard for recognition of their field, to be ignored by a gullible public that pursues a beeline to the purveyors of psychic pap. What is the state of parapsychological research? Eight years after CSICOP's founding, I reviewed what had happened in parapsychology during that interval: Despite the enthusiasm for the new \"quantum mechanical\" theories, nothing of substance has occurred in parapsychology in the past eight years. The same old reasons for skepticism\u2014 the lack of public replicability, the problems of defining just what it is that \"paranormal\" signifies, the circular reasoning inherent in explaining departures from chance in terms of a \"psi effect,\" the unfalsifiability that enters the picture whenever it is suggested that the experimenters own characteristics or even his/her own psi or lack thereof may prevent him/her from ever observing psi, the failure of a century of research to improve the evidence\u2014are as strong arguments against the psi position today as they were in the past. A new reason for skepticism is that, no matter how wild the hypothesis may seem, statistical evidence can be adduced that supports the claim; this suggests that artifacts rather than \"psi\" is the most probable explanation for die statistical deviations reported in parapsychological research.1 Sad as the situation must be for die parapsychologists, noth\u00ad ing has really changed in die intervening years that would lead me to revise this assessment. Parapsychology is no closer to its goal of establishing a scientific basis for paranormal phenom\u00ad ena than it was back then, or indeed, than it was even a century ago. Oh yes\u2014there are recurrent claims that new research is finally demonstrating the reality of extrasensory perception or precognition or psychokinesis, but that is nothing new. Throughout its history, parapsychology has been characterized by \"breakthroughs\" that subsequently prove to be illusion, and fall into desuetude. Just as Rhine claimed in the 1930s and 1940s to have established the reality of ESP, so too at the time of CSICOP's birth, Targ and Puthoff were laying claim to having proven the psychic powers of Uri Geller, Charles Honorton was persuaded that his Ganzfeld studies had finally provided the replicable and sound empirical evidence that had so long been sought after, and Robert Jahn's extensive studies at Princeton University were supposedly on target to provide con\u00ad vincing evidence of the paranormal. A quarter century later, nothing has changed. Wither parapsychology? \\s parapsychology going to wither? Indeed, some well-known parapsychology laboratories have closed, and one might expect that the paucity of results yielded by parapsychological research might lead parapsychologists to give up, to abandon the field. While this has not happened on a large scale, in recent years, parapsychology has lost many of its senior scholars\u2014to disillusionment in some cases, but more often to retirement, and to the shuffling off of this mortal coil. This is not unusual in any field, of course, and this is not to say that there are not still a number of bright, creative, and respectable scholars who are at the forefront\u2014among others, people such as Adrian Parker in Sweden, Jessica Utts and John Palmer in the United States, and Robert Morris in Scotland\u2014 but the ranks arc thinning. Moreover, parapsychology has not been blessed, in my view, with regard to replenishment of its key intellectual assets. There do not seem to be many young John Beloffs, or Susan Black mores, or Charles Honortons or John Palmers or Robert Morrises or Adrian Parkers growing up in the ranks. However, it is true that there are some signs of life in the field. For example: after more than three decades, the International Journal of Parapsychology will resume publication (by the Parapsychology Foundation). Some research laborato\u00ad ries\u2014in particular that at the University of Edinburgh\u2014are well established and active. Yet, to the outside observer, formal parapsychology appears moribund, although it is unlikely to die out any time soon. Its dedicated scholars seem no closer now than they were twenty-five years ago (or for that matter, a century ago) to establishing a scientific basis for their claimed phenomena. Whither CSICOP? What have we accomplished and where are we going? Have we made a difference? Sometimes this question must give one pause, for surely the world is even more open to the paranormal and supernatural than it was when we began. CSICOP has in fact flourished as an institu\u00ad tion. Having begun as litde more than a shared idea, it now boasts a permanent headquarters with all the accoutrements, including an extensive library, as well as satellite offices in sev\u00ad eral cities. Moreover, CSICOP has spawned scores of like- minded organizations in many countries of the world. The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER continues to grow in popularity. Regional skeptic groups have been growing in number throughout North America and in other parts of the world. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 51 Other skeptics organizations with their associated publications have also come into being\u2014the James Randi Educational Foundation and the Skeptics Society being the most notable. CSICOP created an environment that encouraged the estab\u00ad lishment of other such organizations. What has CSICOP accomplished? The world is quite a different place than it was twenty-five years ago when it comes to information about the paranormal. At that time, it was very difficult to find sources of information that pro\u00ad vided critical analysis of parapsychological/psychic claims. Given the burgeoning renewal of paranormal belief which began in the 1960s, even many people immersed in science had difficulty in gainsaying die claims of psychic researchers. CSICOP was founded because there was no voice in opposi\u00ad tion to the overwhelmingly pro-paranormal informational deluge presented by the media. Things were so bad in terms of one-sided information that I can recall some individual scientists telling me of the need for physics to develop a the\u00ad oretical accommodation for psychic abilities that had appar\u00ad ently been verified by parapsychologisrs! CSICOP and The Zetetic, which was to evolve into the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, began to change all that. For the first time in history, there was a publication and an organization dedicated to critical examination of claims of the paranormal. CSICOP has provided a powerful magnet for people who are interested in strange and bizarre phenomena. Before CSI\u00ad COP, the only avenue to pursue, if one was interested in such phenomena, was that offered by parapsychology. When I was nine or ten years old, having been fascinated in reading about psychic phenomena, I decided that I wanted to grow up to be a parapsychologist\u2014not surprising, since the only people who took any interest in actually researching such phenom\u00ad ena were parapsychologists. Now, when people are drawn to the paranormal, there is an abundance of information writ\u00ad ten from a skeptical perspective that can serve to satisfy their curiosity while at the same time promoting an interest in mainstream science. I daresay that some contemporary young researchers (I will not name names, but the astute reader may have an idea about to whom I refer) who approach the testing of paranormal claims from a skeptical starting point may well have become mainstream parapsy\u00ad chologists had not CSICOP begun to provide a source of critical information. So, I do believe that CSICOP has made an indelible mark on the world\u2014a modest mark, perhaps, but one that serves as a beacon to those who really want to understand the weird and wacky experiences that so many people report, without jump\u00ad ing to a supernatural/paranormal conclusion. Happy twenty-fifth, CSICOP. Thank you for the memories. And of course, what is the twenty-fifth anniversary wirJiout party favors and reminiscences? You'll have to go to Barry Karr lor any party favors that CSICOP may have to give away, but I can offer you some reminiscences. For diose of us who have been fortunate enough to be at or near the CSICOP front lines, there are many, many memories. Here are a few of mine. The joy of finding people who share your view. Before CSICOP was founded, I had already been involved in researching the growing belief in the paranormal. Such an interest was all but unheard of within psychology\u2014the vast majority of psychologists took no interest in ESP and other such phenomena, for most simply did not believe that they existed. I sought the company of other researchers who might share my interest. Parapsychologists aside, there were very few or them. Reading the sparse critical literature on the subject of parapsychology brought me into correspondence with Professor Marcello Truzzi, a sociologist at Eastern Michigan University. It was a very positive experience to find someone who shared my fascination about the attraction that the para\u00ad normal has for so many people. It was Professor Truzzi who invited me to a meeting at the University at Buffalo in 1976 that was to be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Humanist Society. This meeting was to bring together a number of people who a shared a concern about die unbridled proliferation of belief in the paranormal, a proliferation fueled by one-sided media cov\u00ad erage. This event turned out to be the founding meeting of CSI\u00ad COP. It was here that I first met the people who were to become the giants of CSICOP\u2014Paul Kurtz, Ray Hyman, Phil Klass, James Randi, and my idol from my undergraduate days as a physics student, Martin Gardner. For someone like myself, who had felt\u2014at least before coming into contact with Truzzi\u2014quite isolated and alone with regard to my skeptical interest in the paranormal, it was a heady experience to meet so many power\u00ad ful advocates of a viewpoint similar to my own. Of course, Paul Kurtz provided the energy and foresight and determination that made CSICOP what it is today. One cannot help but be impressed by the man's ability to turn aca\u00ad demic \"wouldn't it be great\" into reality. And almost as soon as I met him, I came to appreciate his almost legendary penchant for snap decisions\u2014as I followed behind Kurtz and Truzzi and some others as they strode down a hallway, Paul turned to me and asked me where I was from. When I said \"York University in Toronto,\" he replied, \"Great, we need international repre\u00ad sentation\u2014we'll make you a Fellow.\" And so a Fellow I became. Thus began my acquaintance with Paul Kurtz and with CSICOP. From diat first meeting in 1976, the Committee for die Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal emerged, its name a committee-produced appellation that has plagued us ever since. Worse, the name gave us the acronym CSICP, which was used officially for some time, but it was so hard to pronounce that the \"O\" of \"oP was inserted to produce CSI\u00ad COP. Unfortunately, this produced an unintentional homonym, \"PSI-COP,\" and to this day, some of our oppo\u00ad nents cannot be dissuaded from the belief that this was planned. Slowly, CSICP, or CSICOP, began its struggle to bring to die public a critical, science-based perspective on the paranormal. Through The Zetetic, edited by Marcello Truzzi, which became the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, edited by Ken Frazier, CSICOP began to make its presence felt. And just as I had been overwhelmed to meet so many like-minded people at 52 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER that founding meeting, so too were many of the early readers thrilled to realize that they were not alone in trying to bring rationality to the discussion of the paranormal. Rationalization in the defense of paranormal belief. At that same founding meeting, given my lifelong interest in con\u00ad juring, it was a thrill to watch a stage performance by James Randi. In those days, Uri Geller was in his heyday, and a good part of Randi's presentation was the duplication of Geller's tricks\u2014showing that the same effects could be produced by conjuring, without revealing how. Surpassing my considerable appreciation of Randi's legerdemain was my astonishment at the intervention made by a professor from the University of Buffalo, who shouted at Randi after he had performed yet another Geller \"miracle\" and accused Randi of being a fraud. Randi shot back with \"Yes indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery.\" The inter\u00ad locutor was not amused: he continued to shout at Randi, despite his wife's efforts to get him to sit down, and yelled, \"That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretend\u00ad ing to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.\" This was my introduction to the powerful process of rationalization that traps even well-educated people who feel the need to defend a deeply held belief in the paranormal. A trip to China. Our trip to China in 1988 was one of my per\u00ad sonal CSICOP highlights, of course. Along with Kurtz, Randi, Frazier, Klass, and Karr, I had the privilege of participating in both a lecture tour of Beijing, Xian, and Shanghai, and in the testing of children who could supposedly read with their armpits and buttocks, as well in the testing of some Qi Gong masters. This trip has already been well documented,-' but there are many stories that did not make it into the article. Some of die memories that come to mind that were not recorded in that account include: (1) Being in a shop with Randi, who showed a group of young children how to make a pencil wiggle so that it appears to be rubbery, and then the next day, while taking a stroll with him, hearing \"Landi, Landi\"\u2014and turning to see a couple of children smiling as each held up a pencil, wig\u00ad gling it just as Randi had shown them the day before. Ah, how fame spreads. (2) Talking, through a translator, with a psychologist who had not only observed the same psychic girls who we were going to test, but who had employed a hid\u00ad den videocamera that revealed their cheating. When I asked, \"In that case, why do you need us to test them?\" he asked. CSICOP was founded because there was no voice in opposition to the overwhelmingly pro-paranormal informational deluge presented by the media. \"Have you ever slopped pigs?\" He had spent four years on a pig farm during Mao's Cultural Revolution, and wasn't going to risk anything that might put him at odds with the powers that be, and thereby risk being sent back to the farm. Indeed, these girls were held in high esteem by some very high officials in China, including the head of the Atomic Energy commission, a renowned scientist, who opined that China had given four great gifts to the world\u2014 paper, gunpowder, the compass, and movable type\u2014and now they had a fifth gift to give, these psychic girls. Denying their powers might merit being sent back to the farm. When we tested the girls in their home\u00ad town of Xian, they were brought to join us at a banquet that had been organized for us. Following the meal, we were all taken to something that was very surprising in 1988, a Xian discotheque. The scene that developed was almost surreal: Drinking beer in a discotheque in the midst of traditional Xian as these demure \"psychic girls\" transformed before our eyes into ordinary young adolescents, reveling in and dancing to the loud Western music, while their decorous chaperones watched with apparent disdain. The power of personal experi\u00ad ence. Since the history of CSICOP is inextricably tied to Paul Kurtz, those who wish to study and understand CSICOP need to some extent study and understand Kurtz. Although opponents have often viewed him otherwise, Paul Kurtz has not been rigid and close-minded about the paranormal. Indeed, in the early days of CSICOP, on more than one occasion he was heard to tell a radio interviewer that, while there is no evidence for the vast majority of paranormal claims, there was one exception\u2014 telepathy, and tlien he would relate how he and his wife often knew what each other was about to say, and tiiat this might reflect ESP. Ray Hyman and I two or three times put on our psychology professor hats and explained to Paul how it is that normal psychological processes are likely, from time to time, to produce such experiences for all of us, without any involve\u00ad ment of ESP. Kurtz soon changed his expressed view, but this story is testimony both to die fact diat he did not approach the paranormal witli his mind rigidly made up a priori, and to the powerful impact of personal experience of seemingly paranor\u00ad mal events. The power of experience that violates our worldview. One day, during a CSICOP conference held in London in 1985, most of the members of the Executive Council were at SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 53 lunch in a private dining room, and Randi was amusing us with some impromptu table magic. The waiter, a man with a heavy Portuguese accent, began to pay close attention to Randi's performance, and at one point remarked to Randi, \"That is amazing.\" Randi beamed with pride at this com\u00ad mendation, and then the waiter added, \"There's only one man I've ever seen do anything more impressive than that.\" Randi, who appeared slightly annoyed by this qualification of praise, asked, \"And who might that be?\" to which the waiter replied, \"A Mr. Uri Geller, who stayed at this hotel last year.\" Oh boy! The gauntlet had been thrown down! Randi rolled up his sleeves, and magic enveloped us. Objects appeared from nowhere, minds were read, the hands of watches moved backward; the waiter was appropriately over\u00ad whelmed. However, that was not the end of the story. About an hour after lunch, I happened to pass through the lobby, when the hotel manager approached me and asked if I had been at the lunch where the magic was done. When I indi\u00ad cated that indeed I had been in attendance, he implored me to help him deal with one of his waiters. He led me to the kitchen, and there in a corner sat the Portuguese waiter, extremely distraught. The waiter told me that he had never seen such things happen, and that this must have involved tampering with spirits or even demons, and he was very, very frightened. Despite my training as a psychologist, I was unable to calm him down, or to dissuade him from his belief that he had witnessed supernatural dabblings. It was only when I began to praise Randi's virtues as a magician that he began to lighten up. But then, he wavered\u2014he had seen magicians before, and magicians \"can't do those things.\" Only when I heaped even more praise on Randi, telling him that Randi is no ordinary magician, but \"one of the best magicians in the world,\" did he really start to soften. Finally, he said, \"Well . . . maybe if he's one of the best magicians in the world, it could have just been trickery.\" He then calmed down, and the event was over. I had received a memorable lesson in the ability of inexplicable experience to produce powerful emotion. Pockets of irrationality. Another incident comes to mind that relates to our ability to sustain pockets of irrationality amongst our beliefs, while all the while persuading ourselves that we are rational people. This occurred during a CSICOP meeting in Mexico City in 1989. Professor Mario Bunge had just delivered an address in which he surveyed the subject of irrationality, moving from belief in the paranormal to such topics as psychoanalysis, which he argued is also pseudo- scientific in its nature. He was not aware that a substantial part of this university audience was made up of psychoana\u00ad lysts. After the talk was over, I recall listening to a heated dis\u00ad cussion in English at the back of the hall. Professor Bunge was surrounded by a number of psychoanalysts, all happy to applaud any attack on parapsychology, but all quite offended by the criticism of psychoanalysis. It was fascinating to see so clearly something that is no doubt true of all of us\u2014we can turn off our critical skepticism when dealing with some of our own favorite beliefs. The interchange ended on a humorous note. Professor Bunge asked them if they really believed that deep inside every man is an instinctive desire to murder his father. They did indeed agree, and then Professor Bunge turned to a young man at the edge of the circle, and asked, \"So, do you want to murder mc?\" To which the man replied with a smile, \"Yes indeed, sometimes!\" Professor Bunge then identified the man, a professor of physics at the University of Mexico, as his own son. I have many other happy memories of CSICOP: My first invitation to an Executive Council meeting at Phil Klass's apartment in Washington in 1978. Going for runs with Ray Hyman at just about every CSICOP meeting or conference\u2014and especially at the conference in St. Vincent, Italy, where nuns, dressed in traditional habits with formidable headgear\u2014laughed and laughed and pointed at us as we ran up the steep road past their convent, and they laughed just as hard when we came down again. They don't see many joggers in these parts! Sharing adjacent seats on a Chinese airliner with Phil Klass, at that time senior editor at Aviation Week, who explained that the airplane that we were on was a copy of a Boeing 737\u2014except that the Chinese didn't bother with all the duplication that Boeing builds in for backup safety. No backup circuits, he said. Thrilled to learn this at 30,000 feet, I asked him why he was willing to fly on an airplane that had no backups if any system failed. He smiled that impish smile of his and said, \"Well, this air\u00ad craft we're on has been flying for years, and it hasn't crashed yet, has it?\" The long rides from Vancouver to Eugene, Oregon, with Barry Beyerstein, and once there, the wonderful times I have had as one of the team, along with Barry, Jerry Andrus, Loren Pankratz, Wally Sampson, and others at Ray Hyman's annual Skeptics' Toolbox workshop. Being at a private lunch during a CSICOP conference\u2014 not lunch really, but hamburger and lots of magic\u2014with Hyman, Randi, Andrus, Penn and Teller. . . quite a thrill to watch magicians \"jam.\" The list goes on. . . . In fact, the greatest thing about having been fortunate enough to be deeply involved in CSICOP has been the won\u00ad derful people that it has brought into my life: Ray Hyman, Barry Beyerstein, Paul Kurtz, James Randi, Phil Klass, Ken Frazicr, Lee Nisbet, Barry Karr, Amardeo Sarma, Eugenie Scott, Joe Nickell, Bela Scheiber, and so many, many others. So, thanks CSICOP, and happy birthday, and here's to the next twenty-five! Notes 1. J.E. Alcock. 1984. \"Parapsychology* Past Lack-of-progrcss K. Frazier. B. P.J. Klass. J.

LILIENFELD The New Know-Nothings: The Political Foes of the Scientific Study of Human Nature. By Morton Hunt. Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1999. ISBN 0-7658-0497-2. 404 pp. Paperback, $29.95. The relationship between science and politics has long been an uneasy one. Although the Baconian view of scientists as detached and impartial observers of the natural world is taken seriously by few researchers today, most philosophers of science agree that science works best when investigators are free to pursue all questions in an unfettered fashion. Absolute scientific objectivity, although probably a myth, is a goal to which researchers should aspire. When outside considerations, such as political values and exigencies, intrude on the day-to\u00ad day operations of science, the capacity of investigators to openly investigate sci\u00ad entific questions is often hindered. In his provocative book The New Know-Nothings: The Political Foes of the Scientific Study of Human Nature, soci\u00ad ologist Morton Hunt argues that the last several decades have witnessed an increasing breach of the unsteady wall separating science from politics. Although Hunt's book bears implica\u00ad tions for all domains of science, his principal focus is on the social sciences of psychology, sociology, and anthro\u00ad pology. For it is these scientific domains that have most often yielded answers distasteful to those with cer\u00ad tain political views. The barrage of attacks on social sci\u00ad ence research have originated from both ends of the American political spectrum, and Hunt spares neither the extreme political left nor the extreme political right in his trenchant analysis. In some cases, Hunt maintains, these attacks have resulted in die suppression of good science, the promotion of bad science, THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS j 1 THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS ; | THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS: THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS I THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS I THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS \\ ^THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS _ THE NEW KNOW-NOTHINGS I or both. Although Hunt's book is not a disquisition on pseudoscience per se, it bears significant implications for the dissemination of questionable scientific findings. As Hunt points out, concerted efforts to place limits on the collection and analysis of controversial data may lead to incomplete or erroneous conclu\u00ad sions regarding human behavior. For example, vigorous efforts by some con\u00adservatives to halt research on adoles\u00ad cents' sexual activity may forestall the identification of behaviors that place individuals at heightened risk for human immunodeficiency virus infec\u00ad tion. Personal threats against Elizabeth Loftus, Harold Lief, and others who have expressed skepticism concerning the widespread existence of recovered memories of child abuse may discourage an open discussion of suggestive thera\u00ad peutic techniques that can elicit false recollections of early trauma. Among the diverse areas of research examined by Hunt are genetic influ\u00ad ences on intelligence and violence, sex differences in mathematical and spatial ability, the diagnostic validity of pre\u00ad menstrual syndrome, the existence of recovered memories of child abuse, the efficacy of controlled drinking as a treat\u00ad ment for alcoholism, the validity of the polygraph (\"lie detector\") test, and the success of needle exchange programs for intravenous drug abusers. In each of these cases, individuals with certain sociopolitical agendas have attempted to suppress research findings that are not to their liking. In a number of cases, research\u00ad ers' careers and livelihoods have been Scott O. Lilienfeld is an associate professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta and a SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Consulting Editor. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 59 BOOK REVIEWS threatened or damaged. For example, educational psychologist Arthur Jensen and personality psychologist J. Phillippe Rushton have been the repeated targets of intimidation for their research on the genetic basis of the black-white IQ dif\u00ad ference. Jensen has been heckled and even spat on by protestors, and has been forced to cancel several public appear\u00ad ances. Rushton nearly lost his tenured position at the University of Western Ontario despite his high level of schol\u00ad arly productivity and solid teaching record. Although Hunt acknowledges that the research of Jensen and Rushton is certainly not beyond scientific reproach, he argues persuasively that many of the attacks against them have been more personal than substantive. If their findings and conclusions are ques\u00ad tionable, Hunt maintains, they should be openly criticized in the high court of scientific peer review rather than cen\u00ad sored or suppressed. Psychologists Mark and Linda Sobell were the apparent victims of a pro\u00ad longed witch hunt following their pub\u00ad lication of alcoholism treatment find\u00ad ings that raised questions concerning prevailing dogma. The treatment of alcoholism in the United States has been influenced substantially by the tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous and similar organizations, which insist that absti\u00ad nence is the only feasible long-term goal of alcoholism treatment. After the Sobells published a study suggesting that some alcoholics can benefit from a treatment approach emphasizing con\u00ad trolled (moderate) drinking, they were accused by another investigative team of fabricating data. Although these allega\u00ad tions were categorically rejected by sev\u00ad eral independent panels, at least one researcher has continued to accuse the Sobells of academic misconduct despite compelling evidence to the contrary. Hunt traces the increasingly steady drumbeat of political assaults on social science research to several sources. First, Hunt contends that the precipi\u00ad tous increase in militant social activism over the past several decades has exacted a heavy price on social science research. A swelling minority of extreme liberals and conservatives have mounted attacks on research projects examining politically incendiary issues, such as the genetics of intelli\u00ad gence and the potential effects of day care on children's emotional adjust\u00ad ment. Second, the growth of congres\u00ad sional lobbies and special interest groups has encouraged groups with small but vocal constituencies to obstruct controversial research. Third, genetic engineering, nuclear power, and other technological developments that some perceive as dangerous have resulted in a growing mistrust of sci\u00ad ence and its applications. Fourth, Hunt argues that certain members of the extreme political right have acquired increasing power to place constraints on research that might be construed as undermining the sanc\u00ad tity of the American family. For exam\u00ad ple, Jesse Helmes and several other United States senators have success\u00ad fully obstructed federally funded research that involves asking adoles\u00ad cents about their sexual behaviors. If The New Know-Nothings has a sig\u00ad nificant shortcoming, it is Hunt's occa\u00ad sional tendency to paint with an overly broad brush. Although Hunt is typically careful to distinguish politically moti\u00ad vated attacks from legitimate scientific criticisms, he at times blurs this bound\u00ad ary. For example, Hunt takes issue with recent attacks on self-report integrity (\"honesty\") tests, which are used by thousands of U.S. companies to detect prospective employees at risk for antiso\u00ad cial behavior on the job. Hunt notes that integrity tests have been criticized by civil rights advocates and other social critics on the grounds of questionable validity and potential racial bias, and he attempts to rebut these claims by draw\u00ad ing on the relevant literature. Never- dieless. Hunt does not point out that diese tests have been shown in con\u00ad trolled studies to be markedly suscepti\u00ad ble to coaching effects, or that much of die evidence for dieir validity derives from unpublished studies conducted by the test publishers themselves. Nor does he note that some integrity test publish\u00ad ers have been less than cooperative with prospective researchers who wish to sub\u00ad ject their claims to close scrutiny (e.g., see Goldberg, Grenier, Guion, Sechrest, and Wing, 1991, Questionnaires used in the prediction of trustworthiness in pre- employment selection decisions: An A.P.A. Task Force Report, Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association). Hunt's discussion of the animal rights movement also lacks balance. Hunt correctly observes that some ani\u00ad mal rights advocates have disrupted research projects by subjecting researchers to personal threats and even physical assaults in some cases. Such attacks have been terribly damaging to researchers and their families, and have often been antithetical to scientific progress. For example, Marilyn Carroll of the University of Minnesota has been repeatedly harassed and threat\u00ad ened by protesters who object to her research on animal models of cocaine and nicotine addiction. Nevertheless, Hunt neglects to address a very different problem: In a number of academic departments it has become virtually taboo to raise ques\u00ad tions regarding the complex ethical dilemmas associated with invasive ani\u00ad mal research. Most dispassionate observers would agree that although invasive animal research can yield important scientific knowledge, one must thoughtfully weigh the ethical and pragmatic costs and benefits of such research before undertaking it. But relatively few academic depart\u00ad ments in which invasive animal research is conducted encourage an open discussion of these costs or offer course background in the ethics of ani\u00ad mal research. It is a shame ili.it Hunt's book appeared prior to the recent hue and cry in response to a quantitative literature review published by psychologist Bruce Rind and his colleagues in the journal Psychological Bulletin. This 1998 article 60 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER BOOK REVIEWS revealed that the correlation between child sexual abuse and later psy- chopathology may be considerably weaker than many researchers had sup\u00ad posed (see Berry and Berry, \"The Congressional Censure of a Research Paper,\" SI, January/February, 2000 and Hagen, \"Damaged Goods,\" SI, January/ February 2001). Following the publica\u00ad tion of this article. Rind and his collab\u00ad orators were harshly condemned by radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger and accused by several politicians of endorsing pedophilia, even though they were careful in their article to note that their findings could not be used to jus\u00ad tify child sexual abuse. In addition, their article and its conclusions were formally denounced by a 355 to 0 vote in the United States House of Representatives. The Rind affair bears disturbing implications for academic and scientific freedom and suggests that we can ignore Hunt's message only at our peril. A description of this lurid affair would make a fitting postscript to Hunt's book. Despite its imperfections, The New Know-Nothings makes for gripping and often disconcerting reading. Social sci\u00ad ence researchers, particularly those investigating potentially controversial or unpopular questions, should place it at the top of their reading lists. IIMIII tiHmnmi, nam in rttui mnicri MEAN GENES iitiiuiMiuMiira Self Help From Science DANIEL GRASSAM Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food: Taming Our Primal Instincts. By Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan. Perseus Publishing, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2000. ISBN 0-7382-0230-4. 263 pp. Hardcover, $24. Without opening a debate on mind/body dualism (or more specifically here mind/brain dualism), Mean Genes endeavors to help people understand why it is their brains seem to work against their desires. Why, for example, New Year's resolutions to eat more healthfully and save more money don't last any longer than the first offer of dessert or new car advertisement. \"Consider this book an owner's man\u00ad ual for your brain,\" assert the authors in the opening line of this self-help book from the scientifically minded. Authors Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan have put together a book for the general reader that is founded in the research efforts of Daniel Grassam writes from Denver, Colorado. hundreds of scientists across myriad dis\u00ad ciplines. The authors draw examples from their own lives, the animal king\u00ad dom, psychology, and pop culture and blend it with a friendly conversational tone and smatterings of humor. The result is both enjoyable and educational. Covering topics like greed, infidelity, relationships, food, and money, Burnham and Phelan approach each topic with the mantle of scientific inquiry. In the section \"Please Don't Feed the Humans\" the authors discuss the human predicament of obesity and point out that it was our ancient ances\u00ad tors' constant instinctual hunger that helped them to succeed in surviving and thus reproducing. Knowing that your ancestors also couldn't control their appetite may not offer comfort but it does bring understanding. The authors' stated goal is to help the reader build a pair of \"Mean Genes glasses\" through which to view their world. Thus empowered with understanding, we are better equipped to handle our battles with self-control. The book suggests self-control strategies, which the authors admit are to some extent common sense and commonplace. The improvement strategies in Mean Genes may not be original but the context in which they are given is. It is unfortunate that this book is shelved in the biology section of the bookstore instead of in self-help where it would get the attention it deserves. Mean Genes would make a welcome change to a section cluttered with shamanism and feng shui. In naming this book the authors do not presume that our genes harbor mal\u00ad ice and are actively working against us. Burnham and Phelan's \"mean gene\" is a literary device. Our genes are \"mean\" because they \"predispose us to certain failings.\" These failings, they note, are only failings in light of a modern world with automobiles and remote control television. Hunter-gatherers expend hundreds of calories acquiring their food whereas we need only dial our local pizza delivery service. The authors are also quick to point out a basic tenet of evolution, that each of our \"mean genes\" in one way or another helped humans to survive or else they would not be with us today. This raises die question about how much our genes are responsible for our psychological development. The authors recognize that genes are not die only influence on human behavior. Leaving the cultural and nurturing effects to odier works. Mean Genes focuses on the role played by our genes in determining our actions. Endnotes and citations are notice\u00ad ably missing from the text. They can be found on the Mean Genes Web site at www.meangenes.org. In leaving out citations and scientific jargon Burnham and Phelan have written a book with a foundation in science that does not read like a science textbook.

He views the prize as a \"bribe,\" a way to lure well-respected scientists toward the \"right- wing religious cause.\" Hoffrage, Ulrich, Samuel Lindsey, Ralph ARTICLES OF NOTE 62 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER ARTICLES OF NOTE Hertwig, and Gerd Gigerenzer. \"Com\u00ad municating Statistical Information.\" Science, 290: 2261-2262, December 22, 2000. A study was conducted at Harvard Medical School in which faculty, staff, and students were asked to find the probability of certain diseases. More questions were answered correctly when the statistics were given not in probabilities but in natural fre\u00ad quencies (e.g., \"of every 10,000 people 30 have colorectal cancer....\", etc.), which is how \"humans have experienced statistical information over most of their history.\" The authors conclude that \"leaching representa\u00ad tions rather than rules\u2014and expressing statis\u00ad tical information in natural frequencies where appropriate\u2014can help to foster the statistical reasoning needed to make sound decisions.\" Jaroff, Leon. \"Talking to the Dead.\" Time, March 5, 2001. p. 52. Skeptics question the powers of John Edward, the ever-popular psy\u00ad chic medium who claims the ability to \"con\u00ad nect with energies of people who have crossed over.\" Critics of Edward\u2014the likes of whom include magician James Randi\u2014accuse him of using well-known \"cold reading\" techniques. As Jaroff says, it is really just \"a sophisticated form of Twenty Questions.\" Jaroff provides evidence of outright chicanery in Edward's show, including aides striking up revealing conversations with audience members and asking them to fill out cards before the show begins and videotape of the sessions edited down so that wrong answers appear correct. On a subsequent Larry King Live show on CNN on March 6, Jaroff and CSICOP chair\u00ad man Paul Kurtz appeared with Edward and four others in challenges about such evidence (see News 8c Comment, this issue). Gawande, Atul. \"Investigations: Under Suspicion: The Fugitive Science of Criminal Justice.\" The New Yorker, January 8, 2001, pp. 50-53. \"The law has balked at submitting its methods to scientific inquiry,\" writes Gawande. Submitting the legal system to scientific scrutiny\u2014as was done with med\u00ad icine in the last century\u2014could completely transform it. In this article, he discusses cur\u00ad rent remedies in place that are meant to bring the criminal justice system into the scientific arena: yet, only a few police departments (most of them in Canada) have adopted these practices. So why is the legal system slow to change? According to Gawande, \"the legal system takes its methods for granted. Law enforcement ... is in thrall to a culture of precedent and convention, not of experi\u00ad ment and change. And science remains deeply mistrusted.\" Hutton, Ronald. \"Paganism and the Polemic: The Debate over the Origins of Modern Pagan Witchcraft.\" Folklore. 111(0:103-117. April 2000.

POSNER In my November/December 2000 cover article \"The Face Behind the 'Face' on Mars: A Skeptical Look at Richard C. Hoagland,\" the NASA pho\u00ad tos of the so-called \"Face\" were, regret\u00ad tably, not as enhanced as other available NASA images. The cover photo (also used on page 21) was the ubiquitous \"Face\" image from the 1976 Viking 1 mission\u2014the image most familiar to everyone. But an enhanced version of that photo, reveal\u00ad ing more of die shadowed side and elim\u00ad inating the black dots (missing data points) is available from NASA, and we are pleased to now present it (figure la). A second, less familiar photo of the face was also obtained by Viking 1, and is shown in figure lb. The 1998 Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) image used in the article was, for technical reasons (related to the way NASA's mapping was being carried out), somewhat \"stretched\" along the \"Face's\" vertical axis. I had previously seen both this image and NASA's stretch-reduced version, but never together, and not until a reader (George J. Haas of die Cydoniainstitutc.com Web site) com\u00ad plained did I appreciate the difference. Figures 2a and 2b show both the Jay Leno-ish version we used (left) and the one that more faithfully shows the \"Face's\" true proportions. Mea culpa. NASA has also published a \"light- Gary P. Posner, who practiced internal medicine for fifteen years before launching out into medical software, is founder and executive director of Tampa Bay Skeptics and a CSICOP Consultant. version to more closely simulate the Viking pho\u00ad tos' lighting conditions. Some have remarked that this version does indeed look a bit more like a head, though that of a lion radier than a humanoid. Mark Kelly, a graphic artist, has per\u00ad formed additional \"enhancements\" to diis image (e.g., slightly repositioning some features and adding shading around the \"eyes\"), dius exaggerating its humanoid qualities. Not surprisingly, Richard Hoagland's \"Enterprise Mission\" Web site refers to Kelly's creauon as the \"properly processed and ortho-rectified version\" of die photo, i.e., presumably showing die \"Face\" as it really looks. You compare and judge (see figures 3a and 3b). In my article's opening paragraph, I myopically referred to \"Cydonia\" as if it encompassed merely die few hundred square miles of terrain containing the \"Face\" and the other \"monuments.\" Cydonia is actually much vaster, and though the area around the \"Face\" was of no interest to NASA, the far northern portion of Cydonia was initially the pre\u00ad ferred landing site for Viking 2, being about as close as a lander could get (due Figure la. An enhanced version of the Viking 1 photo #35A72. to the mission's latitude constraints) to the edge of the North Polar Ice Cap, and dius to the possibility of encountering atmospheric water. Ultimately, however, the terrain appeared too rugged to risk a landing there. Hoagland associate Michael Bara, whose vitriolic response to my article is featured on the \"Enterprise Mission\" Web site, argues that the \"Face\" is situ\u00ad ated in what was likely an ancient Martian ocean, and is thus (contrary to my article's opening remarks) an excel\u00ad lent place to search for traces of past life. However, I understand the prevailing informed opinion (though not unani\u00ad mous) to have been, both at the time of the Viking mission and Mars Global Surveyor, that Cydonia was most likely never an ocean, and that its features are the result of erosion by other forces (e.g., wind) rather than water. Bara also says that Hoagland didn't write any of the words attributed to him in the promotional material for the Sierra Leone Mars stamp set\u2014diat \"the whole 'quote' was written Feinstein and used widiout Hoagland's permission.\" If so, I am happy Figure lb.

The \"stretched\" Mars Global Surveyor image (used in the original article). 2b. NASA's rectified/unstretched version. Figure 3a. NASA's \"light reversed\" the MGS photo. to clarify the record, rliough I wonder what pan of die quote Hoagland could possibly find disagreement with. And Bara decries my admittedly ridiculous \"earthlings\u2014from our own future\" reference (re: the possible archi\u00ad tects of the \"Face\") as a \"blatant attempt to put words in [Hoagland's] mouth.\" I didn't ascribe my nutty idea to Hoagland, but little did I know at the time (nor does Bara's complaint hint at) how close I had actually come to Hoagland's current view\u2014if only I had instead said \"our own past.\" The following is verbatim from Richard Hoagland's appearance on Mike Siegel's (Art Bell's) Coast to Coast A.M. radio program from the night/morning of November 17/18, 2000: The model thai I am most comfort\u00ad able with now is that the human race is a lot older\u2014a lot more extraordi\u00ad nary\u2014than we have ever been told. And the fact [is] that we once used to live all over die solar system\u2014that the extraterrestrials are our guys. We're the guys chat built the stuff on Mars ... Figure 3b. Graphic ortho-rectified ver\u00ad sion\" of the same image. and the stuff that we think we are now seeing on [our own Moon and onl the moons of Jupiter. . .. There is so much that we are now getting glim\u00ad mers of. ... [My next book] is going to be called The Heritage of Mars: Remembering Forever, because my thesis now, based on almost twenty years of doing this [research] ... is \"history is not as we've been told.\" . . . It has been carefully manipulated so we are not allowed to sec this breath\u00ad taking heritage, because it would not benefit a few who are in control . . . and who want us to live this dimin\u00ad ished existence not knowing who we really are because, frankly, it would threaten the power structure. Two additional clarifications: A reader has informed me that the split between Hoagland and Chuck Harder was not permanent, and that Hoagland has been a frequent guest on Harder's radio program during the past few years. I have also learned that NASA's Lewis Research Center was renamed some time ago in honor of John Glenn. (Zl occurred in 1955 when \"a white cow in the distance in the pitch darkness gave some onlookers a scare\" (\"Fisher's Ghost\" 1957). Clearly the story of Fisher's ghost has many of the elements that make a tale worth telling\u2014and retelling: an histori\u00ad cal basis, intrigue and murder, a quest for justice, and a spine-tingling resolu\u00ad tion. Not surprisingly, the \"ghost\" seems to have taken on a life of its own.

They are not. Among other claims, they arc if not the originators then at least the promoters of the idea of slimming while you sleep. You take certain amino acids and lo-and-bchold miraculously your fat changes overnight into muscle and you lose weight automati\u00ad cally. This in spite of the fact that lean mus\u00ad cle is heavier than fat. Nevertheless, this idea was used in 1998 and 1999 by an Austrian quack to advertise anonymously but aggressively in major Dutch newspapers with the slogan \"Slank terwijl u slaapt\" (Slim while you sleep). Similar advertisements had appeared in other European countries. They combined the amino acids with mate tea and a fruit- and-vegetablc juice and sold it for roughly ten times the normal retail price of the con\u00ad stituents. Efforts of the Dutch, German, and Austrian skeptics to do something against it resulted in an article in the June 2000 issue of the German magazine Skeptiker about the inefFectiveness of die laws of the countries involved. After complaints from the Dutch Advertising Practice Committee (a voluntary organization), the firm quit advertising this particular slimming program and shifted to advertising Pu-Erh tea as a slimming tea and after that they started advertising pyruvate (which they misspelled as pyrofat and then \"translated\" as fatburning). Since October 1999 we have not seen any more advertise\u00ad ments by this firm, but whether this was due to our efforts or because they had earned enough money in the Dutch market, we do noi know. Of course, Pearson and Shaw cannot be held responsible for die swindling practices of the Austrian firm, only for the Schlank im Schlaf idea. Marie P. Prins Oost-Souburg, Netherlands Regarding Barry Seidman's remark that herbal medicines arc not patentable: If so, how did we manage to patent aspirin, digi\u00ad talis and so many other drugs first found in herbs? It would seem to me that the process described in John Allen's article that follows Seidman's is indeed patentable. Can't patent the herb? Patent the extraction process! Each newly discovered beneficial herbal com\u00ad pound will require something in the process that others don't, correct? A slightly different solvent material, a modestly differing distil\u00ad lation procedure. . . . Is it not more nearly accurate to say that pharmaceutical companies may be reluc\u00ad tant to apply an expensive and difficult process of examination to each and every herbal preparation that's widely touted by a credulous lay public because it's so expen\u00ad sive and demanding a task? Given the wild variety of claims made for some of the cur\u00ad rently popular drugs, one can easily under\u00ad stand why scientific investigators would and should be cautious. Some of these herbs are said to cure everything from ataxia to zoophobia! (Now if someone'd just come up with an herb that really cures impotence when Viagra no longer works!) William D. (BUI) Mayers, RT. RN Canastota, New York The special issue on \"alternative medicine\" was long overdue and drew proper attention to the \"alternative\" nature of the movement which renders it incapable of being real med\u00ad icine. In particular, and as with all pseudo- science, it draws its strength from misunder\u00ad standings, wishful thinking, and outright deception. One of the prime examples of the last is the 1993 article by David Eisenberg, M.D., and his coauthors in the New England Journal of Medicine. Barry Seidman cited this report in his \"Medicine Wars\" and quoted Wallace Sampson, M.D., editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine (SRAM), as his source for Eisenberg's errors. But he neglected to refer readers to a fuller analysis of the Eisenberg report and the followup survey that appeared in the Fall/Winter 1999 issue (Volume 3, Number 2) of SRAM. This is now available, with some revisions, on the Web at www.hcrc.org/contrib/gorski/ eiscnb.html. Tim Gorski, M.D. Associate Editor, SRAM xenomed@dnamail.com Your article \"Medicine Wan\" reported, as usual, on the percentages of people who use alternative medicines and the potential dan\u00ad gers they pose, especially when the physician doesn't know about the patient's usage. In my experience, when the doctor or his/her nurse asks what medications I am taking, I try to enumerate the vitamins and herbs as well. However, they never record them and typically give sonic indication that that information is irrelevant. Where is the research on: the percentage of doctors asking the patient for this information; doctors' knowledge of the interactions of herbs and medicines; and doctors' informing patients of those interactions? Are the researchers writing articles in the medical journals urging doctors to inquire about the herbs and vitamins and to record and/or study possible interactions in their patients? Perhaps in the future we will have some guidance in these matters from the studies now being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health Alternative Medicine program. Jean M. Alberti, Ph.D. Lombard, Illinois Herbal Medicines John Allen's diatribe against herbal medi\u00ad cines suggests that all herbs, no matter what their history of use, should be presumed dangerous. He leaves the impression that no herb has ever been subjected to chemical, laboratory, or clinical study and found safe. In truth, many have been. By comparison, he would presume a pharmaceutical mar\u00ad keted for five years to be \"safer,\" although benefits arc now evaporating and risks emerging for such lucrative drugs as estrogen and calcium channel blockers. If we should shrink from chamomile tea because it contains \"large numbers of chemical compounds,\" logic would apply 68 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR the same fear to the tomato, which is con\u00ad sumed in far greater quantities. Ginger is consumed as a food, stir-fried, candied, or pickled, and nobody worries about it. Yet let a consumer take ginger capsules to alle\u00ad viate motion sickness or morning sickness, and anti-herb zealots wail that this is a \"risky health gamble.\" One would almost think that the expectation of benefit is a suspected carcinogen. When dietary supplements have been shown by science, rather than innuendo, to pose a serious risk of harm to normal indi\u00ad viduals, the FDA can and will prohibit their sale. Contrary to Allen's claim that toxic aristolochia \"can still be readily obtained,\" it has been banned, along with other species containing aristolochic acid and even plants that could be contami\u00ad nated with aristolochia. Wendy L. Applequist, Ph.D. Missouri Botanical Garden St. Louis, Missouri John Allen responds: My article \"Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: A Risky Health Gamble\" was intended to point out some potentially serious risks associated with the use of these products that proponents, understandably do not publi\u00ad cize. I specifically pointed out in my article that there is reputable scientific evidence that the use of some herbal medicines can provide valuable health benefits. However, ingesting herbal medicines and dietary supplements is risky because they are extremely heterogeneous: they may contain almost anything or essentially nothing at all. Ms. Applequist states, \"When dietary sup\u00ad plements have been shown by science rather than innuendo to pose a serious risk of harm to normal individuals, the FDA can and will prohibit their sale. \" According to this logic, consumers should take comfort in the knowl\u00ad edge that if enough of them swallow a toxic herb and are injured, the FDA will take action to prevent others from suffering the same injury Aristolochia is a perfect example and illustrates my point; it was banned only after it caused significant injury to a large enough number of consumers. Contrary to Ms. Applequist's assertions, this toxic herb is still available because of the demand for it by gullible consumers who reject the scientific evi\u00ad dence of its toxicity and embrace, instead, a New Age \"anything organic is good\" supersti\u00ad tion. In my view, swallowing substances whose composition and effects are unknown repre\u00ad sents behavior that is truly irrational Chiropractic Retired chiropractor Samuel Homola's arti\u00ad cle in the January/February 2001 issue con\u00ad firms several beliefs that 1 have held for years: the majority of chiropractors arc quacks who base their practices on a pscudoscientific belief system; a mere handful of them have abrogated quackery; and there isn't anything that even the scientifically oriented ones can do to help backaches that practitioners of a number of other modalities can't do. As Professor William Jarvis and odiers have often stated, the profession has existed for more than a century without having made a single contribution to the understanding or furthering of human health. Kurt Youngmann Northbrook, Illinois After reading about the misdeeds of chiro\u00ad practic practice in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, I, for one loathe these charlatans. Yes! Neck manipulation is dangerous! My friend used to go to a chiropractor and now he has a perma\u00ad nent discomfort along his vertebrae. From X- rays it appears that the vertebra is splintered and now he must get an operation to correct this injury that I believe the chiropractor made. Of course die chiropraaor denies all knowledge of this injury. It amazes me how they persuade people to come in on a lifelong basis for spinal adjustments. They try to con\u00ad vince you that your back hurts and it's all a psychological ploy to get money in their own wallets. I can say only one thing to the read\u00ad ers: don't fall victim to the shady chiropraaor! Paul Dale Roberts Department of Community Services & Development FJk Grove, California Your article on chiropraaic by S. Homola concentrates on only the most negative, sen\u00ad sational (but fortunately rare), dangers of manipulation. One wonders why someone who claims to have spent forty-three years in the field would be so negative about it. While he quotes dire statistics, it was Terrell who found that many of the reports alleging damage by chiropractors turned out to be provided by other practitioners and lay people. Just a few years back the LA Times reported a chiropractor caused a stroke in a 32-year-old screenwriter. Days later we found it was caused by a pediatrician. The New England Journal of Medicine reported 106,000 deaths per year from pre\u00ad scription drugs, equivalent to a fully loaded 747 going down every other day. Yet we seem to accept that as reasonable while detractors of chiropractic care like Homola try to convince the public the sky is falling. If chiropraaic care were as dangerous as he would have us believe, malpractice pre\u00ad mium costs would make practice prohibitive. My medical doctor friends are envious of my premium, less than $2,000 yearly for cover\u00ad age of one to three million dollars. That should settle the question of safety instantly, since premiums are based on actual experi\u00ad ence, not innuendo and rhetoric. The answer to the question in the article title is: \"Absolutely not, the good part of chi\u00ad ropractic outweigh any bad by many orders of magnitude.\" R. Dean Harman, DC Harman Chiropractic Center San Mateo, California After suffering from neck stiffness last year I decided to seek chiropractic treatment for fast relief. My extensive scaicli fui a \"good\" chiropractor yielded a professional with twenty years of experience and, I was told, an excellent medical praaice record. Two weeks into treatment my pain started to dissolve. And to ensure a healthy body he offered to perform, at no extra charge, a series of tests aimed at diagnosing and preventing serious illness that I may incur. His test was simple. Extend my arm forward and firmly resist his attempt to lower my arm using his right hand. During that process he gently applied pressure with the index finger of his left hand on my chest, abs, kidney, etc. If I failed to resist while his index finger is direaed at a specific organ, that particular organ is unhealthy. Curing that sick organ is even simpler! In my case I failed to resist when he applied pressure on my stomach. I had a severe ulcer (which I previously indicated on a form I was asked to fill regarding medical history). He then reached for a neatly organized kit filled with herbal supplements. After carefully selecting a herbal supplement (said to cure ulcer), he asked me to hold it in my left hand and in the meanwhile he would perform the same test again on my stomach. This time I resisted successfully. With confidence, he explained the befbre-and-aftcr event as a proof that his des\u00ad ignated herbal supplement when carried by the patient \"created a magnetic field that SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 69 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR surrounded the body and directed its power to cure the sick organ\"! He asked me to buy his expensive kit and when confronted with skepticism he tried to assure me of the integrity of his product! As a physicist I did not know whether to laugh or to cry! Mohammad Ghaffari Tucson, Arizona Psychotherapy Research Because it is likely that readers of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER are apt to be self- proclaimed skeptics (like me), authors who contribute to the magazine bear a special burden to research their facts and to present them in a balanced fashion. Surely such authors must realize that when they preach to a congregation of skeptics their words will be heard by habitually skeptical ears. Therefore I was amazed to read Margaret Hagen's revisionist history of psychotiierapy research, which she trumpets as a \"sterling example\" of a point she was trying to make about the use of meta-analysis in studying the effects of childhood sexual abuse (\"Damaged Goods?\" January/February 2001). Hagen tells us that before 1977 \"Decades of research failed to discern any reliable rela\u00ad tionship between psychotherapy and the wellbeing of countless patients\" (p. 58). She is simply wrong about this. In our widely cited book entitled Research in Psychotherapy (1970), Meltzoff and Kornreich reviewed 101 controlled studies on the outcome of psychotherapy. There was no such thing as meta-analysis of therapy studies at that time. We appraised each of these studies individu\u00ad ally and reported that 80 percent of them yielded positive results. In the ensuing years many more research studies were published, and supported our conclusions. Yet Hagen tells us that because of the lack of evidence \". . . mental health practitioners turned to meta-analysis to justify their livelihood and reassure their patients\" (p. 58). Here she was referring to die early paper by Smith and Glass (1977) on meta-analysis. Smith. Glass, and Millers (1980) defini\u00ad tive meta-analysis was published as a book. The Benefits of Psychotherapy. They analyzed the results of 475 controlled outcome studies diat contained 1,766 effect-size measures. The difference between groups treated by any method and untreated controls averaged 0.85 standard deviation units. This far exceeds the \"very small\" positive effects diat Hagen claims. To place the differences in perspective. Smith, Glass, and Miller (1980) cite studies that report \"The differences in achievement caused by decreasing the size of a school classroom from thirty to fifteen chil\u00ad dren is about 0.15 standard deviation units\" (p. 88), and \"In elementary school, the effects of nine months of instruction in read\u00ad ing achievement is about 0.67 standard devi\u00ad ation units\" (p. 88). In her zealous attack on the validity of meta-analysis as a research tool, Hagen leaves the reader with the uncorrected false impres\u00ad sion that psychofJicrapy is an unproved com\u00ad modity with trivial effects. In the 1940s and 1950s graduate students in psychology were smugly taught that with psychotherapy one- third got better, one-third got worse, and one-third remained die same. You can't fault the faculty of those years, because the research did not really begin until the mid- 1950s. By the 1970s and 1980s enough good data were available to change the nature of received wisdom on the issue. Today die studies number in the thousands, and informed scholars no longer question the benefits of psychotherapy. It is surprising, therefore, when so many years later, people continue to misrepresent the history of the saga, and to echo what people (who then had reason not to know any better) were saying nearly a half century ago. Old myths die hard! Julian Meltzoff, Ph.D. TV-Paranormal Links Questioned In \"Science Indicators 2000\" (January/ February 2001), the authors claim that \"... (studies suggest that) the way television pre\u00ad sents paranormal subjects does have an effect on what viewers believe.\" The examples pre\u00ad sented simply do not support this rather audacious claim. Iht audiors cite studies indicating that viewers of programs such as the ever-popular target The X-Files are more likely titan others to \"condone paranormal beliefs,\" mat such stories are more likely to be believed when not properly disclaimed, and that \"Some fans of The X-Files find the show's storylines 'highly plausible.'\" This emphatically does not prove that these viewers came by tlieir beliefs merely from watching these shows. People may simply prefer to watch shows mat reflect their own previously formed world views. In fairness, die audiors do admit this pos\u00adsibility way down in footnote #10. However, die footnote is rather carefully hedged: \"This result could simply mean that people who believe in the paranormal are more likely than others to watch these programs. However, the findings are consistent with the conclusions of earlier studies....\" In fact, despite the mis\u00ad leading findings\" dislodge the alternative explanation they present. Furthermore, we aren't told here whether viewers of other kinds of shows arc more or less likely to profess sympathy to paranormal beliefs. Would we turn our ire on, say, The News Hour with Jim Lehrer or even / Love Lucy if we found that viewers of these pro\u00ad grams were also more likely to hold paranor\u00ad mal beliefs (a possibility that is not strictly inconsistent with the studies cited above)? Focusing exclusively on a few \"standout\" pro\u00ad grams that some skeptics may find distasteful skews the results into near-poindessness. 1 submit that the article, as printed in SI, leads readers into a post-hoc fallacy. There's just nothing here to suggest that The X-Files or other \"paranormal\" shows inculcate para\u00ad normal beliefs among those who wouldn't otherwise subscribe to them. It might be fair to conclude that television caters to (or even panders to) viewers who've demonstrated paranormal inclinations, but unless we can produce a sizeable population who'd admit to getting their education on such matters exclusively from these shows, the authors simply don't have a case. Richard C. Conner Upper Marlboro, Maryland It was very disappointing to see that your extract from the National Science Board's report on \"Belief in the Paranormal or Pscudoscience\" itself incorporated one of the most common fallacies of pseudoscience\u2014 inferring causation from correlation. The fact that watchers of programs such as The X-Files are more likely to endorse paranormal beliefs tells us nothing about the role of the media in fostering such beliefs. It is just as (if not more) likely that people who endorse paranormal beliefs are more likely to want to watch such programs, as it is that such programs cause them to hold such beliefs. The proviso that these findings arc \"tenta\u00ad tive and require replication\" entirely misses the point. No amount of replication of simple cor\u00ad relations such as this will tell us anything. Bob Roshier Durham, England 70 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Driving Out Exorcisms I enjoyed reading Joe Nickell's excellent commentary on a case of alleged demonic possession and exorcism in 1949 (\"Exorcism: Driving Out the Nonsense,\" January/February 2001). Although Nickell presents strong and compelling arguments that attribute supposed supernatural phe\u00ad nomena to mental disturbances and simple trickery, I think his article would have been enriched by medical observations of more recent cases of alleged spirit possession. A 1980 report authored by two psychia\u00ad trists from Vanderbilt University Medical Center stated that some children who were supposedly possessed by demons exhibited such traits as poor relationships with peers, aggression and/or violent outbursts, sleeping difficulties, and auditory/visual hallucina\u00ad tions. The authors observed many of the same phenomena demonstrated by the sub\u00ad ject of the 1949 exorcism, but they attempted psychiatric intervention on dieir subjects instead of seeking assistance from Roman Catholic priests. While- Nickel) mentioned thai many early cases of possession were probably due to disorders such as epilepsy or Tourette's syndrome, pharmacology may also play an increasing role in treating alleged demoni\u00ad acs. I have found one case of alleged spirit possession from Great Britain where a young Indian male was treated with an anti-psychotic drug that apparently suc\u00ad ceeded in suppressing possession-related phenomena where repeated exorcism ses\u00ad sions failed. While the Roman Catholic Church has retooled its policies governing exorcism in the light of modern medical knowledge concerning psychiatric disturbances, I have been investigating an increase in possession claims and exorcisms among charismatic, evangelical Christians in the United States, Great Britain, and other nations. Pastors and counselors who perform such spirit expulsions (often referred to as \"deliver\u00ad ance\") do not answer to the Vatican, and they are often reluctant to consider medical explanations for what appear to be posses\u00ad sion-related phenomena. I'm concerned that many believers with undiagnosed mental disorders seeking inter\u00ad vention from these practitioners could run the risk of having their illnesses exacerbated, rather than alleviated, by rituals for deliver\u00ad ance or exorcism. It is for the relief of such individuals that skeptical analysis and med\u00ad ical advances should continue to hunt the \"demons\" diat plague them. Daniel R. Barnett Vice-President, North Texas Skeptics Dallas, Texas References Hale, A.S., and N.R. Pinninti. 1994. Exorcism- resistant ghost possession treated with clopcnthixol. British Journal of Psychiatry 165: 386-388. Schendel, E.. and R.C Kourany. 1980. Caco- demonomania and exorcism in children. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 41 (4): 119-123. The guidelines of 1614 regarding exorcisms were a great step forward out of the morass of magic and superstition which plagued the folklore and popular religion of the time. A good amount of diis is still around, and, of course, makes a ready storyline for many a TV program or Hollywood movie. Since that time, the Church has tried to distin\u00ad guish phenomena with a natural explanation from those which cannot be explained by die best science and medicine of the age. That this has not always been observed in practice, I will readily admit. Joe Nickell states that it was only in 1999 that the 1614 guidelines were updated. Consider the following: 1. \"In the first place, the exorcist should not believe too readily a person is obsessed by a demon, but should take note of those signs by which an obsessed person may be distinguished from those laboring under some illness, especially of a psychi\u00ad atric nature.\" From the Roman Ritual, 1952 edition, my translation. 2. \"(The exorcist) ought to ascertain the signs by which a persons possessed can be distinguished from one who is suffering from melancholy or some other ill\u00ad ness....\" Roman Ritual, 1925 edition, translation of Rev. Philip T. Weller. The word melancholy should be understood with the meaning it had in medicine in the early rwemieth century. 3. \"Possession is not lightly to be taken for granted. Each cases is to be carefully examined and great caution to be used in distinguishing genuine possession from certain forms of disease.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909 edition, article \"Exorcist\" by RT. Toner. This is Toners paraphrase of the pertinent material from the Roman Ritual of his day. Glossolalia is not the same thing as \"... the ability to speak with some facility in a strange tongue or to understand it when spo\u00ad ken by anodicr,\" which is one of the criteria in the Roman Ritual There is much hucksterism associated with many so-called exorcisms, but it does not do good service to enlightenment to muddle the facts. Rev. Martin Buote Saint Anne's Rectory New Bedford, Massachusetts Joe Nickell replies: I appreciate Mr. Barnett's praise and the useful comments he has provided. (Space constraints typically force me to focus primarily on the case at hand, allowing only minimal introductory and supplementary material) I also appreciate Rev. Buote's comments, but while he seems anxious to quibble I must do likewise. 1 didn't state that the \"only\" updating of the exorcism guidelines occurred in 1999; I was citing a revision that was significant enough for the Vatican to call attention to it. As the Associated Press reported \"The novelty appears largely in the cautions offered to exor\u00ad cists to take psychiatric medicine into account. \" And while the phrase \"strange tongue\" in the ritual is not necessarily the same as \"unknown tongue\" (glossalalia), it was not I but priests in the 1991 case who were impressed when the \"possessed\" girl chanted, \"Sanka dali. Booga, booga. \" 1 am often mind\u00ad ful of the biblical injunction (Matt. 23:24) not to \"strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel\" Kiki's Comment reading Martin Gardner's \"Facilitated Communication: A Cruel Farce\" (January/ February 2001), I conducted a highly scien\u00ad tific experiment, having been inspired by the sentence, \"The facilitator assists him in locating keys she is sure he intents to hit.\" (What could be more scientific?) With my characteristic modesty, I assumed the role of the \"facilitator\" and a readily available subject was Kiki, our jet- black cat. Eureka! The system worked! It was a \"seemingly miraculous breakthrough,\" to further quote from the article. Kiki expressed a liking for raw liver, and when asked to sum it up in one word her scholarly opinion of die Crosslcy-Bilden, etc. claims, Kiki unhesitatingly began to paw out: BULLS but unfortunately at this very moment power died and we will never know what Kiki was going to express, as she has lost interest in further tests. Patrick J. Leonard Braintree, Massachusetts SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2001 71 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (P.S.\u2014I would have Kiki sign but she is in the litter box.) Why Paranormal Beliefs? Jeffrey Victor's review of Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction by Erich Goode (January/February 2001) contained one slightly puzzling statement. Victor suggests that the book \"challenge[s] the preconcep\u00ad tions of some skeptics that paranormal beliefs persist due to ignorance, irrational thinking, and inadequate science education.\" Intrigued, we read further to find the real reasons, and learn that paranormal explanations \"are much more dramatic and entertaining than scien\u00ad tific explanations,\" that they \"embody very ancient and enduring symbolism and themes,\" and that they \"support anti-elitist sentiment against the dominance of scientists and scientific belief systems.\" To me, those all sound like irrational reasons for belief, so where exactly is the promised challenge? On the other hand, I reluctantly agree with both Victor and Goode that more science edu\u00ad cation by itself is unlikely to help much. Paul N. Hilfinger Associate Professor Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California Berkeley, California Pseudoscience is ... Fun! I have been a faithful reader of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER for over a decade and initially became interested because I, as an educated layperson with a background in philosophy, was irritated by many other laypersons who confused pseudoscience with real science and failed to understand the differences between them. But the excessive seriousness of the debunkers and my own experience with those who dabble in the pseudosciences has made me want to speak out just a little against the debunkers. Pseudoscientific activities such as palm\u00ad istry, graphology, Tarot cards, crystal ball gaz\u00ad ing, fortune-telling, psychic readings, astrol\u00ad ogy, reading horoscopes, and the like, may be viewed as comparable to playing board games like Monopoly, Clue, or checkers. They entail a certain playful relationship with the world, of the kind suggested by Herbert Marcuse in Eros and Civilization (1955) and by Theodore Roszack in The Making of a Counter Culture (1969). Pseudoscientific activities arc really (psychological) arts involving gamesmanship. And this kind of playfulness often seems lost to and forgotten by die hard-nosed scientific types, who take pseudoscience so seriously from being immersed in a strict, rigid skepti\u00ad cism that diey feel the need to go to excruci\u00ad ating lengths witli scientific methodology in order to debunk them. The people who enjoy these activities generally don't really care if they are true\" science or not. Pseudoscience is, for them, simply ... fun! Michael Wren Chicago, Illinois Entropy and Nature's Laws I believe that Professor Lambert (Letters, January/February 2001) protests a bit too much in his comments on Zoran Pazameta's earlier article, \"Laws of Nature: A Skeptics Guide.\" It is impossible to discuss the mat\u00ad ter, adequately in the compass of a short let\u00ad ter, but I offer the following, along with the admission that it is vastly oversimplified. Lambert states that entropy is simply an indicator or energy change. Even from the classical point of view tbis is an understate\u00ad ment. From the classical standpoint the over\u00ad all change in entropy accompanying a process may be taken as a measure of the capacity for spontaneous change that was lost in the occurrence of the process. In general it is not simply related to the energy change corre\u00ad sponding to real processes. The expansion of helium into a vacuum corresponds to a signif\u00ad icant change in entropy but to a trivial change in energy. The reverse can be true for mechan\u00ad ical changes in systems with low friction. Classical thermodynamics only permit\u00ad ted the evaluation of entropy changes and left open the matter of whether the concept of an absolute value of the entropy of a sys\u00ad tem had meaning. In the statistical approach, entropy\u2014the same entropy, changes in which are considered in the classical approach\u2014is a measure of the number of ways the constituent particles of a system may be distributed over available microstates without there being any perceptible differ\u00ad ence in the measurable macroscopic proper\u00ad ties of the system. These microstates may be energy levels or they may be positional. Given the inapplicability of statistical methods to macroscopic systems, it is true (hat associating entropy with die disorder of a room can be misleading. If done carefully, however, such an approach provides a useful analogy that can help die neophyte to under\u00ad stand the significance of the seemingly nebu\u00adlous concept of \"thermodynamic probability.\" L.F. Koons Tuskegee, Kepler Thaddeus M. Cowan's statement that \"the idea that images are an outward projection of the mind through the eyes of observer was first proposed by Johannes Kepler\" (Letters, January/February 2001) does Kepler an injustice. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, Kepler observed that every point on a luminous body in the field of vision emits rays of light in all directions, but only those rays enter the eye that impinge on die pupil. The rays are then refracted and meet again at a single point on the retina (15m Edition, vol. 22, page 506). Kepler thereby founded the modern study of vision. Don Keith Waterloo, Ontario Canada Objection Overruled! M.L. Howard (Letters, November/ December 2000) quibbles with my use of the tide \"lawyer\" in reference to Phillip Johnson (Conference Report on the New Paranatural Paradigm, July/August 2000, p. 13). Although he concedes that the tide is technically cor\u00ad rect, Howard identifies himself as an attorney and worries that he and others of his profes\u00ad sion might incur some guilt by association with Johnson. He complains that lawyers have been unfairly portrayed and that my use of the \"L\" word might in some way con\u00ad tribute to this. He suggests that Johnson be referred to as Professor of Law, as he is not currendy practicing law. My report did men\u00ad tion that Johnson was at UC-Berkeley. Since lawyers arc trained by law professors (who in many cases are former lawyers, like Johnson), would this change of labeling really provide the remedy Howard seeks? Donald Mainfort Minneapolis, Minnesota Women Skeptics: We're Out Here! I'm a newcomer to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and have recently read several back copies, some from 1999, some from 2000. I just 72 May/June 2001 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTE RS TO THE EDITOR finished the January 2001 issue. A gentle\u00ad man in one of the older issues 1 read wanted to know why there aren't more women skeptics \"out there.\" We're here, and in large numbers. There is the mistaken assumption, at least within the circle of learned readers and contribu\u00ad tors to SI whose letters and articles I sam\u00ad pled, that one must have a degree or three to be a \"skeptic.\" I'm a grocery checker in a conservative small town in Colorado. My friend \"K\" is a singer in California. \"D\" works in radio and television here in Colorado. \"B\" sells teal estate in Tucson. \"L\" upholsters furniture in Houston. We share ideas and trade articles regularly through mail and e-mail concern\u00ad ing the absurd, the \"New Age,\" and the trendy \"medical\" quackery. None of us has a degree, at least in science or psychology, etc. We are all atheists and skeptics. And we question. Anything and every\u00ad thing. Mostly, of course, we question the insistence of the \"masses\" to believe what so obviously is not (cannot be) true. But wc question other things as well. Are the toma\u00ad toes in that \"sundried\" tomato quiche really dried in the sun? Or are they dried indoors in dehydrators? Not that it really matters (especially since \"roasted\" garlic seems to be the big thing now). But if they're really dried in the sun, how is it done? How do they keep contaminants out? Why is \"Healing Touch Therapy\" called that if the \"expert\" doesn't really the client? Shouldn't it be called \"Hovering Hands Therapy?\" And what, exactly, is it supposed to \"heal?\" Why do so many continue to believe that the \"good old\" American diet is good for them? And why, after continuing to consume this diet for decades, do they then insist that their resulting poor health is the will of some unseen supreme being? Yes, we're out here. We're just vasdy out\u00ad numbered, that's all. And we tend to keep our opinions to ourselves unless we know we're in safe company. I personally question SKEPTICAL INQUIRERS seemingly unquestioned loyalty to die AMA (and its \"conventional wisdom\") and the FDA. While I'm no more a fan of some of the absurd \"alternative\" medical prac\u00ad tices out there than SI, I can at least sec that the interests of \"Conventional Medicine\" do not always lie in the health of die patient. Sorry, just being a skeptic. And the FDA? Sure, they always have our best interests at heart. ... In short, never assume that because more women don't hold lucrative positions in sci\u00ad ence and math departments at major univer\u00adsities that skeptical women aren't around. We're here, and we question. Trust me. Maggie Valentine Inskeep Pagosa Springs, Colorado Age-Dating Distortions I recently came across an article in \"Answers in Genesis,\" {AiG-U.S. Weekly News 20 January 2001), entitled \"Radioactive 'dating' failure,\" by Andrew Snelling, Ph.D., adjunct professor of geology at the Institute for Creation Research in San Diego. According to his online bio at the Answers in Genesis Web site, Snelling holds a B.S. in Applied Geology from the University of New South Wales in Australia. The bio doesn't mention where he received his Ph.D., and I can find no evidence on the Internet of where he might have received one. However, after reading his article, I real\u00ad ized that it was a classic example of how cre\u00ad ation \"scientists\" deceive the general public. In the article, Snelling laid out seemingly convincing evidence that the potassium- argon (K-Ar) dating method scientists use to measure the age of volcanic rock is flawed and wholly unreliable (no pun intended, but it is a good one). Snelling pointed out that the age of lava flows from several eruptions of New Zealand's Mt. Ngauruhoe were measured by a reputable laboratory, and found to date to 0.27 to 3.5 (\u00b1 0.2) million years. According to Snelling, these were the same lava flows that were observed to have been created by eruptions between twenty-five and fifty years ago. Now, to the uninitiated, this appears to be convincing evidence that scientists are claiming Earth and fossils to be far older than they really arc, thus lending evidence for a young Earth which, creationists would have us believe, suggests evidence for the truth of Genesis (illogic noted). But it was not the facts given in the article that deceives, but what was left out. Snelling never mentions the names of the \"researchers\" who took the samples. But this is only important to anyone wanting to investigate the scientific credibility and integrity of the team. Most of the time, if names are given, a short Internet search can satisfy the investigation. Snelling gave a rather simple explana\u00ad tion of how the K-Ar dating method works, but omitted two very important points. First, he failed to mention that the half-life of potassium-40 is known to be 1.300 mil\u00ad lion years. This fact alone should cause one to suspect its accuracy for dating material twenty-five to fifty years old. The second omission, and most impor\u00ad tant, was that the K-Ax dating method is known by scientists to be unreliable for dat\u00ad ing volcanic rock laid down less than 500,000 (five hundred thousand) years ago, and thus, paleontologists don't use it for dating recent flows, and certainly not flows only twenty-five to fifty years old because there would not be enough argon to measure reliably. Still, even if the samples did contain such an extraordinary amount of argon-40, it is probable that either the team actually took old samples, or the samples of fresh lava con\u00ad tained inherited argon-40 from the heating of older deposits lying beneath. This has been known to happen. But wc can't know any of this from the sketchy information in Snelling's article. For extraordinary claims, one should submit extraordinary evidence. Of course, Snelling knows that many in the general public, especially true be\u00ad lievers, will never think for themselves, but will rely on pseudoscicntific reports like his for their \"facts.\" This is the kind of \"science\" they want schools to teach our kids!
