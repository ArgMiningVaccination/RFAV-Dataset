(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced they have completed a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of a 10-\u00b5g booster dose of the companies' Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 years of age. The request for Emergency Use Authorization of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in this age group is supported by safety and immunogenicity data from the companies' bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted companies' Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine in their decision. An application to extend the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine marketing authorization to include children ages 5 through 11 years will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days. The companies have also initiated a Phase 1/2/3 study [NCT05543616](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05543616&esheet=52924231&newsitemid=20220923005307&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05543616&index=1&md5=9cd768024768f296e213b7f0cd59278f) (C4591048) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of and dosing regimens of the companies' Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months through 11 years of age. This pediatric study is consistent with regulatory guidance and follows a [previous](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-announce-updated-covid-19-vaccine-data&esheet=52924231&newsitemid=20220923005307&lan=en-US&anchor=previous&index=2&md5=249ecf825ac0f10cd9f913bc46a4893f) Phase 1/2/3 trial involving these age groups that demonstrated the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is well-tolerated and offers a high level of protection against COVID-19, measured at a time when the Omicron BA.2 strain was highly prevalent. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY\u00ae) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned. About the Study The Phase 1/2/3 pediatric clinical study will have four substudies examining different bivalent vaccine dosing regimens, dose levels and ages, including: - Substudy A (Ages 6 through 23 months who are COVID-19 vaccine-na\u00efve): Phase 1 dose-finding study will evaluate 3-\u00b5g, 6-\u00b5g, and 10-\u00b5g dose levels of the bivalent vaccine. Based on Phase 1, Participants in the Phase 2/3 will receive the selected dose as a three-dose primary series, followed by a booster dose. - Substudy B (Ages 6 months through 4 years who had previously received 2-3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Those who have received two doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine prior to enrollment will receive both a third and fourth 3-\u00b5g dose of the bivalent vaccine. Those who have previously received three doses of the original vaccine will receive a 3-\u00b5g booster (fourth) dose of the bivalent vaccine. - Substudy C (Ages 6 months through 4 years who had previously received 3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Phase 1 dose-finding study will evaluate 6-\u00b5g and 10-\u00b5g dose levels of the bivalent vaccine for a fourth dose. Based on Phase 1, Phase 2/3 will receive the selected dose as a fourth dose. - Substudy D (Ages 5 through 11 years who had previously received 2-3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Participants will receive the bivalent vaccine as either a third or fourth 10-\u00b5g booster dose.

Pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments. This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizer's efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine program, and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, also known as COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) (BNT162b2) (including an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including submissions to the FDA and EMA for an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate for children ages 5 through 11 years of age and a Phase 1/2/3 study in children aged 6 months through 11 years of age, qualitative assessments of available data, potential benefits, expectations for clinical trials, potential regulatory submissions, the anticipated timing of data readouts, regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals or authorizations and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply) involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data), including the data discussed in this release for BNT162b2, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program in any of our studies in pediatrics, adolescents, or adults or real world evidence, including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies, in real world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 in additional populations, for a potential booster dose for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccination), and/or other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, including a potential variant-based, higher dose, or bivalent vaccine, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorizations or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including any requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations), any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates (including the submissions to the FDA and EMA for an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate), or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine's efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist which may lead to reduced revenues or excess inventory; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine's formulation, dosing schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations or new variant-based or next generation vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccine, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods as previously indicated;
