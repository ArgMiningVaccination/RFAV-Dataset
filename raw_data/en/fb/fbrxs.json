Be proud of what you're a part of here at CHS.CEO message Wow, welcome to 2022! That wasn't the summer everyone was hoping for. Between COVID and the endless rain, summer failed to live up to our expectations, much like the Raiders' 2021 season and Ed Sheeran's new album. Despite the setbacks that COVID threw our way we've pulled together and continued the tradition of protecting and caring for our community during its time of need. It's a reputation that's strengthening. It's something we should be proud of. While Omicron may have dominated much of December, January and even February, there's heaps of other work going on this year, with some big-ticket items like accreditation and our new Digital Health Record on the agenda. Nurse/midwife ratios have also started rolling out in a phased approach. We'll also need to keep our eye on the prize when it comes to culture. We ended last year by sharing the organisation-wide results from our November survey. The results show an improvement but there are still some pretty challenging issues that we need to work through. A few other key areas of focus for me include the disconnect between the front line and senior decision makers, as well as recruitment issues and bullying and harassment. As I said earlier, this year we'll be assessed against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards during the accreditation process. It's important for us as a health service, but it's also a chance to show off the incredible care we provide each day. Towards the end of the year our new Digital Health Record (DHR) will go live and it is going to Be. A. Game. Changer. The Territory-wide project is going to bring health services kicking and screaming into the 21st Century. DHR will give us much faster access to information, which will improve care and reduce errors. It'll give us more time to focus on what's important\u2014the consumer\u2014with less time searching for info that's stored in a multitude of different places. I'll finish by adding my thank you for the work you've been doing. So many of you are carrying so much for your team, for our patients, and for our community. Thank you. Be proud of what you're a part of here at CHS. Dave Peffer Chief Executive Officer 2 Efforts to reduce blood wastage not in 'vein' Do you know your type? Blood type, we mean. Only 9% of Australians have 'O Negative' blood type. If you're one of those, you're a universal blood donor. This means that almost anyone can receive the red blood cells from your donations. Cool, huh?As a blood bank scientist, Kelly Sliwinski, analyses blood samples to work out a patient's blood group and whether they have any red cell antibodies that could be harmful during a blood transfusion or in pregnancy. 'I then use this information to make sure we give compatible blood and blood products to patients who are bleeding, undergoing treatments or who have diseases which prevents them from making their own blood cells,' says Kelly. 3 Pulse Canberra Health Services 0 Pictured left: Kelly Sliwinski, Senior Transfusion Scientist, ACT Pathology. Pictured above: The Hematology team members in the ACT Pathology laboratories. 'Blood is not just an off the shelf product. There are a total of 43 different human blood group systems and patients can have harmful reactions with any of them. There's a great myth that you can just \"give O Negative blood in an emergency\", but this is not always the case.' 'Unfortunately, there are times that we will have to say no to releasing emergency issue O Negative blood, but it's not without reason. There are some circumstances where emergency issue O Negative blood can be harmful.' In recent times, we've seen nation-wide critical shortages of O Negative blood. This has been made worse with an increase in demand and usage of O Negative blood and decreases in donations due to flu and COVID-19. To make sure this precious resource is available for those patients who genuinely need it, ACT Pathology, in collaboration with our Trauma and Anaesthetics teams and the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, has worked hard to reduce the usage of O Negative blood products issued across Canberra Health Services.As the Senior Transfusion Scientist at Canberra Health Services, Kelly says it's been a big effort by everyone to reduce O Negative blood usage, and the results are paying off. 'In 2020, O Negative blood use at Canberra Hospital averaged around 17%, but we've put in place a number of strategies and have reduce this to an average of 14% in 2021. This means almost 120 blood units were saved from being used - it's a great result.' 'We've promoted the appropriate use of blood products and have moved patients receiving O Negative emergency issue blood to their own blood group or O Positive blood, where possible. The Anaesthetics team promoting the use of red cell blood salvage, where the patient's own blood is collected, washed and returned back to them, has also helped.'4'We've also reduced our blood wastage by using a new red esky to replace the old Lifeblood shippers which were large and not fit for purpose within the hospital environment. We also incorporated a real time remote temperature data logger, which provided our labs with critical temperature storage data while the esky is out of the lab.' Another precious blood product that requires a management balancing act is platelets. Blood platelets last only seven days from the time of donation and if we hold too many at any one time, we risk not using them and they go to waste. But if we hold too little, we risk jeopardising patient care by not having them available when needed. In 2021, we reduced our platelet discard rate from 11.8% to 6.7%, meaning almost 76 less units expired. This is well below the acceptable discard rate of 17%, set by the National Blood Authority. Platelets are a precious resource that are always in high demand. It can take up to four donors to create a single unit of pooled platelets and they're mainly used for patients who are undergoing cancer treatments, have blood cancers or are critically bleeding. 'Canberra is unique in that we're classified as a regional hospital, yet we're a tertiary referral centre for the ACT and surrounding NSW region.' 'As the major blood depository for our region, we need to be prepared for incoming traumas, major surgical and obstetric bleeds and to help support our regional NSW hospitals by providing blood stock in emergencies.'+While Canberra has an Australian Red Cross Lifeblood centre that keeps some stock on hand, we can't rely on this stock alone. Blood is delivered from Sydney every day. Urgent deliveries to replace critical stock shortages can take up to six hours to arrive, with life threatening deliveries taking four hours. 'The large tertiary and trauma hospitals located in the Sydney and Melbourne metro areas don't need to do the same sort of fine balancing as we do here at CHS.' 'Bushfires, flooding and COVID-19 have also impacted on Lifeblood's ability to deliver blood to regional areas like Canberra and they've done an amazing job to ensure that blood deliveries get to where they're needed, when they're needed.' When asked what she's most proud of about working in Haematology, Kelly says it's being part of such an amazing team. 'Everyone within Haematology is passionate and cares so much about the work we do, the patients and the service we provide to CHS and the community.' 'Our doctors, nurses, scientists and technical officers all work together to provide the best outcomes we can for the patients, but we also look out for each other to make sure we're all well supported.'

Bloody legends at Canberra Health Services We've got some bloody legends here at Canberra Health Services, with the organisation recently taking out awards for the most donations, most plasma donations and most new donors signing up in the ACT Local Government Blood Challenge. Workforce Relations Advisor, Ben Flood, is one of the legends that helped make this happen by regularly donating blood for the last three years. 'I started donating blood so I could get over my fear of needles but on my first visit, I found out that I have a rare blood type. I made the decision there and then to donate more regularly.''Working in an administrative role within our health service, it's just one way I can contribute to the clinical efforts.' 'The team at Red Cross Lifeblood are always really friendly and welcoming. They even send you a text message when blood that you have donated is used and it's great to know that my donation has helped someone in their time of need.' 'Make sure to book in for a donation, your gift could help someone spend another year with the people they love most.' 5 Pulse Canberra Health ServicesBloody fun facts Around 40% of Australians have O+ blood type, making it the most popular. Like your eye colour and the shape of your nose, your blood type is inherited from your parents. At the other end of the scales, only 1% of Australians have type AB- blood type, making it the rarest. 1 in 3 people will need blood or blood products in their lifetime. To meet the demand for blood in Australia, we need more than 29,000 donations every week. Each year, 1 in every 30 people give blood (only around 3% of Australians). 6 Pictured: Dr Simon Jiang, Consultant A unique approach to kidney disease leads to breakthrough gene mutation discovery Canberra Health Services is one of the few places in the world using personalised medicine to develop specific treatments for kidney and autoimmune disease. It was this unique approach that led to the discovery of a gene mutation that accelerates kidney disease in some people. Canberra Health Services nephrologist and Australian National University researcher Dr Simon Jiang is part of a team of scientists who identified the mutation. Dr Jiang and his team were approached by a group of researchers from Queensland and the Northern Territory who have been trying to find out why Tiwi Islanders have the highest reported rate of kidney disease worldwide. They knew there was a strong genetic component to the high rates, but they didn't know why.When sequencing the genome of patients with autoimmune kidney disease and Indigenous Tiwi Islanders with extreme rates of kidney disease, Dr Jiang and his team identified a mutation in the gene VANGL1. Further testing also found that the gene helps prevent the immune system from attacking the kidney. 'People with this mutation will be significantly more likely to develop kidney disease,' says Dr Jiang.7 Pulse Canberra Health Services 'The study has major implications for Indigenous people with kidney disease, such as Tiwi Islanders, in whom the mutation occurs at much higher rates.' Located 80km north of Darwin, the Tiwi Islands have the highest recorded rate of kidney disease in the world, residents are four times more likely than mainland Indigenous Australians and 11 times more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to suffer from kidney disease. 'About 15 per cent of the population has the gene mutation, but when it's coupled with an inflammatory disease, it permits damage to the kidney.' 'When you have a systemic immune or inflammatory disease, the mutation allows the immune system to attack the kidney. The gene's natural function is to slow down the inflammatory process but for about 15 per cent of the population, a mutation in the gene can cause kidney disease,' Dr Jiang says. 'Previously we thought that immune diseases such as Lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis attack the kidneys by chance. What we've shown though, is that the kidney has its own way of resisting or stopping that attack.' The discovery has helped medical practitioners better understand autoimmune diseases and how to personalise treatment for each patient. 'The researchers from Queensland approached us and asked if we could use the same personalised medicine approach we use to help patients with kidney disease and adapt it to help determine what might be driving kidney disease in the Tiwi Islands. Through this, we were able to discover the VANGL1 gene mutation.' 'The reason why each person develops kidney disease is different. In personalised medicine, what we try to do is understand for each person at the cellular level what has happened to their immune system and why they have developed that disease. After we first see our patients in the clinic, there's years of laboratory work to discover and prove what their immune systems are doing before we can bring them back in for treatment,' Dr Jiang says. 'We use this work to try and develop treatments that are specific to each individual person, whether it's coming up with new therapies or using existing therapies in new ways to get results.''Being one of the only places in the world using this type of personalised medicine with our kidney patients, we have lots of scientists and clinicians approach us to try and adapt the work into different settings and diseases, not just for discovery but also to improve patient care.' 'It's a new way of doing medicine, where in the past if you go to your GP with a cough and a fever, they'd tell you that you have a chest infection and you would be treated the same regardless of your age, ethnicity or gender.' 'What we now do differently is that we say, while there are similar aspects to diseases, each person has their own genetics, behavioural and environmental impacts that can come together to mean a disease occurs in a very specific way to each person. And if you can understand that person, you can understand why they've developed that disease and can treat it much better.' 'We often get complex referrals for patients from Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland, so the more successes we have as a team, the more we're able to prove that this method works, and we can help people who were previously unable to be treated.' 8 A recent audit of 5S, a pilot program in two clinical areas of Canberra Hospital saw a massive jump in compliance and an overwhelming endorsement for the new program, used by staff.On a path to success with 5S The 5S principles are five practical steps to deliver sustainable, ongoing improvements on the business frontline. Typically, this system is applied in loading docks and warehouses but ultimately its aim is to make the hospital system safer and to improve patient care. 5S ensures a place for everything and everything in its place - and that we have a robust system to Sort, Set in Order, Shine and Check, Standardise and Sustain. It acts as a pillar for continuous improvement across our health service. The seven-month pilot project was rolled out in a new and an older hospital ward to see if the model helped to reduce: clutter which leads to an unsafe environment delays in timely care when patient equipment isnot where it should be inefficiencies or delays when equipment isin the wrong place or is organised differentlyacross areas.5 Sustain Pictured: 5S on display in Ward 11A, Canberra HospitalTo do this each ward was divided intozones and each zone got a baselinescore: Ward 11B had 56 zones which gavethem a baseline score of 25 out of280 (56 x 5); Paediatrics High Care Ward had 38zones giving them a baseline score of 18 out of 190 (38 x 5). During the pilot: Paediatrics High Care Ward 5Saudit compliance increased from14% to 47% bringing their score to 90 Ward 11B 5S audit complianceincreased from 10% to 90% bringtheir score to 2389 Pulse Canberra Health Services Pictured: CHS team members celebrating the rollout of 5S in Ward 5A and 5B. Pictured: 11B Ward staff crouching (left to right) are Suzie Gunning, Louise Powley, and Aleyamma Devasia. Staff standing (left to right) are Kate McCallum, Caitlin Tatham, Jaime Thomas, and Riya Chacko. Ward 11B's Clinical Nurse Consultant and Nurse Unit Manager, Mercy Lukose, said she was committed to making the appropriate changes from the start, but ultimately, the project's success was a team effort. 'For me I absolutely loved the project from the start - it was a dream to keep everything in its place and to keep a neat and tidy ward,' Mercy said. 'Simply putting things in the right place every time saved time, it increased our productivity and we felt more positive - it improved our confidence. The ward was decluttered, and it looked calm.'A neat and tidy ward is so much more welcoming for patients and for staff coming onto a shift. We are a busy, clinical area so we have to work to maintain it, but we have staff champions now so we can divide this among smaller teams which is working well.' Teams from Infrastructure and Health Support Services supported the pilot project including Facilities Management, Domestic and Environmental Services and Supply Services.

She is a proud Yorta Yorta woman with strong connections to the Gamilaroi and Weilwan Country of Coonamble, where she is from.11 Pulse Canberra Health ServicesAs a result of marrying and having a child with a non-Aboriginal man, Kristie's great-grandmother was forced to move, due to 'past practices and policies', from the Cummeragunja Mission to Central West NSW, Gamilaroi / Weilwan Country. 'A lot of the knowledge that I share is Gamilaroi / Weilwan knowledge because Yorta Yorta was taken from me. But, I am really proud that I am one of those people at the forefront. I always say that we are like activists, but just in a different way. We make sure we are keeping Aboriginal business and Aboriginal health on the table.' Kristie and her team are responsible for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients who enter a health facility are provided with 'holistic care' and that their personal and cultural needs are met. 'As soon as [an Aboriginal or Torres Islander] patient comes into our facility, a referral is made to our team. We work with the clinician team and become part of that treating team to support and heal our people together.' Kristie works closely with all clinical, allied health and integrated care teams to guarantee that patient-centred care is provided. One of her responsibilities is 'educating our non-Aboriginal colleagues around ensuring we have a culturally safe workplace and environment for our community members to come to. Making sure that their needs are being met and their voices are being heard.' The team see themselves as 'cultural translators' that bring their lived experience and cultural knowledge to the work they do. 'Some of our Elders have intergenerational trauma and some of their reactions to health care or the clinical settings can be a ripple effect from what they have experienced in the past. If we [ALO team] can explain that to clinicians and help them understand, it can help our old people and our mob on their healing and recovery journeys.'Kristie is incredibly proud of the work her and her colleagues are doing and not only sees the benefit for Aboriginal and Torres Islander people but for the broader community as well. 'It's a great opportunity to be in this space and make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is at the forefront, especially because statistically we are running behind. If we can help improve that and be involved with closing the gap, then that is an honour and a privilege.' She believes 'that education, awareness, and understanding' of Aboriginal and Torres Islander culture, spirituality, and the plight of her people 'goes a long way.' 'A lot of the background work that we have to do is tiring because we are retelling our story and reliving our trauma, but we keep doing it because we know there is a need and a reason. Our old people have taught us that we have to share our knowledge, not only with our own but with others. I hope that by doing this it can bring change. I see that we are in the right spot to bring that change and be that inspiration for others who might hopefully join our workforce. You are helping your mob and your community.' Pictured left: Kristie Simpson, Manager of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Wellbeing Team, standing in front of Natalie Bateman's artwork 'Acknowledgment of Country 2013', located in the main foyer of the Canberra Region Cancer Centre. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison Service operates from Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 5pm, excluding public holidays.

You're helping women understand the choices they have, and building a relationship with them from the beginning, by providing support during pregnancy and helping to plan for birth and postnatal care. It's such a privilege to be able to give back to the community in this way.' Meet Felicity - who joins a team of nursing and midwifery staff at our new public health facility now open in Coombs. A registered midwife for 15 years, Felicity started her nursing career in paediatrics and has always been interested in 'the incredible growth during pregnancy and the potential to bring another human into the world'. Since then Felicity estimates she has worked with up to 500 women in their journey from pregnancy to motherhood. She feels humbled that her role provides the opportunity to have a lasting positive impact on the families she cares for. 'As a midwife you use all your skills; it's extremely satisfying. You may be assessing a woman's pregnancy, looking after her in labour, and visiting her and her newborn in the early days at home. You work in partnership and this promotes a sense of trust, choice, and control for the woman.' 'Occasionally, you'll meet women with very troubled pregnancies and a whole range of challenges. We can refer women to other services as needed.' Canberra Health Services at Molonglo is co-located at the Molonglo Valley Medical Centre at 110 Woodberry Avenue in Coombs. Appointments are now available for pregnancy care, maternal and child health, women's health counselling and children's asthma services, with more services coming soon.Felicity said this new facility has plenty of space to expand services to meet the needs of the local Molonglo community. 'It makes it easier for women to access services they need in their local area. It accommodates a range of different health professionals, so there's a raft of services available under the same roof.'

We had a chat with Parika to find out more about the role, and the supports her and the team in Forensic Mental Health provide to members of the community in the justice system. Tell us about the role as a Court Liaison Officer? As a Court Liaison Officer, my role is to engage with people who may be experiencing mental health challenges and help them throughout their court proceedings. In our engagements with clients, we assess their need for immediate mental health treatment and provide recommendations to the courts on whether legal proceedings should be paused to help them recover. We also work with other teams to identify any prior history or ongoing treatment individuals may be undergoing. This helps us to make a comprehensive assessment and provide a well- informed recommendation. We also support the newly established drug and alcohol sentencing list, where drugs and alcohol related matters may have contributed towards a case. We engage with these individuals and determine their eligibility to participate in a drug and alcohol treatment order.We do sit in court from time to time to provide clarification or evidence. Sometimes we need to know the outcome of a matter so we can provide the best recommendations and referral pathways for an individual's mental health. How do you support people who may need additional care? Being at court might add to a person's distress, so we want to make sure our presence is felt. If they need our help or our support, we are always there. The court is a transient place, with lots of people coming and going every day for work. It's all about educating our internal stakeholders who we work with to ensure everyone knows our services exist. And of course, we have an open-door policy. We welcome people to come and have a chat with us to find out more about our scope of work and what we can provide. We are very proud to help the court make that informed decision in terms of how a person's mental health can form a part in how they're presented. Pictured: Parika Saini, Forensic Mental Health Services Court Liaison Officer, in front of the ACT Law Courts.15 Pulse Canberra Health ServicesHow do you juggle both justice and health? It is a balancing act, as we can't hinder court proceedings, but we also advise against anything which may not yield a fair result. Primarily, the court needs to know if a person requires treatment, and our overarching principle is to never let anything else influence our recommendation. It's the same as a physical health emergency. If someone is having a heart attack, you wouldn't make them go through court proceedings. If a person requires immediate mental health treatment, then we provide that recommendation. We want to make sure our clients, have the best health care possible, that's our focus. Communicating with the magistrates and the judges has been an amazing learning opportunity. I see the health system and the justice system come together to serve people in the best capacity. I have the privilege to be in the position of that conduit where I am the transmitter between these two services. The court is full of very compassionate people who only want the best outcome for the community. I've heard magistrates stop and say, \"I'm sorry you're in so much distress and we don't want to lose another member of our community, and I would like you to get treatment\". What do you love most about this role? I can't tell you how much I love this job. Engaging directly with members of our community, liaising with different teams, carrying out risk assessments, thinking on my feet, problem solving the list goes on. Honestly, this has been such an amazing position and place to learn and grow. Not just in terms of clinical work, but the engagement with the internal and external stakeholders - it's taken those skills to another level. It's not black and white in mental health, there's such a broad spectrum. No two presentations are the same. I love that I am able to see someone's full journey through court. You see people who are so unwell, you help them to get the treatment they need, and then they come back to court later when they're in a much better state for a fair trial. It's such a privilege to serve the community.16When small acts make a really big difference It was 9pm on a Sunday night when Sam arrived at our Emergency Department with her partner's son, Austin. To his misfortune, Austin had a piece of Lego stuck up his nostril. 'Poor Austin was distressed over the whole scenario: it was late, he doesn't like people touching him, he isn't a fan of doctors, and he was overtired. I was prepared for a rough time.' 'But rather than make us wait on arrival Rachel Tormey, the Registered Nurse on shift, checked us in before her handover began. The fact that she went out of her way to do this made the start of this journey a whole lot better and a whole lot quicker.' Later that night when Austin wanted to do some drawing, Administration Officer Jenny Wu hunted down some art materials for him. 'What might seem like a small act, makes a really big difference to me in that waiting room.' When Sam fumbled over some of Austin's details at the admin desk, Ben Kennedy comforted her. 'Rather than get annoyed or seem disinterested Ben made me feel like I was doing a good job, and even said 'Don't stress Sam, I am a step parent too, so I completely get it'.' Once in fast-track Dr Jon Gardner - a 'super smiley doctor with fantastic energy and a Batman lanyard' - helped them. 'Rather than ignore Austin or blatantly treat him like a child, Dr Jon asked him questions, told him everything that was going to happen and went out of his way to reassure Austin.''Not even 5 minutes after we had been called through - Dr Jon had retrieved the Lego, made Austin laugh, posed for an epic photo, and even given us a specimen jar for the Lego. With a big thanks, a fist bump, and our jar - we were out the door within two hours of arrival.' 'I cannot send enough gratitude to the ED staff there that night. I am proud that these are the people we have in our Canberra Hospital Emergency Department.' Pictured: Sam posing with Dr Jon Gardner in the emergency department at Canberra Hospital.17 Pulse Canberra Health Servicesnew & noteworthy Elephant in the room? See something, say something! At CHS, we pride ourselves on our exceptional health care; and all our consumers deserve to experience the professionalism and kindness we aspire to deliver. More than 60% of CHS staff have completed the Speaking Up For Safety (SUFS) training. This helps CHS team members to develop skills to respectfully and confidently communicate patient safety concerns to colleagues, and likewise, respectfully receive and acknowledge concerns raised with them. Since the training was made mandatory in late June 2021, registration to complete the course skyrocketed, and CHS received some fabulous feedback about the learning experience, including: \"\"[The training provides a] clear explanation of why clear and respectful communication of concerns is important.\" \"[This was a] great learning experience. I wish this had been around years ago!\" \"[The training] increased my confidence to speak up effectively if I am worried or concerned about a patient's safety.\" The training explains why it's important we speak up to prevent unintended patient harm, and it also addresses how to speak up, using the Safety CODE. Safety CODE is a simple acronym developed by the Cognitive Institute to assist in elevating levels of concern and has been designed to help team members speak up for patient safety in a respectful way. More than half of you are familiar with the Safety CODE and may be using it, but here's a quick re-cap for those who are unsure: checks (a simple enquiry) options (suggest a safer alternative) demands (balance concern and respect, and require a joint action) elevates (use the Safety CODE phrase and refer to a higher authority) If you haven't attended the training and aren't familiar with the code, don't fret - it's not too late. Check the new Learning Management System or email chs.wcl@act.gov.au for available session times.C O D E If you've 'spoken up', been 'spoken up to' or have seen the Safety CODE being used in your area, we'd love to hear about your experience.

Since we began surveying our team members with the help of our independent provider, Best Practice Australia Analytics in 2005 our culture has moved from a culture of 'blame', to a culture sitting comfortably in 'consolidation'. Between our June 2021 Pulse Survey and the Workplace Culture Survey in November 2021, our Engagement rating boosted by 6 per cent. More importantly though, it's more than doubled since 2005. This is our best result in 16 years, which is testament to everyone on Team CHS who has committed to making this a truly great place to work. We acknowledge we still have a long way to go. Some teams and team members are still struggling, and we continue to hear reports of unacceptable behaviours - so we're far from finished. Over the coming weeks, months and years, we are striving to make improvements to culture in those areas and the broader organisation as a whole. Culture change won't happen overnight, and this is something we will continue to work on as we aim to sit in a culture of 'success'. When we get there, our efforts won't stop.

Valentine's Day has come and gone, but here at CHS we like to spread the love in our organisation all year 'round. Since the COVID-19 pandemic really started affecting the 'Canberra bubble', shout-outs have been a glimmer of light to wrap up the more serious messaging. Feel-good stories, praise to teams and individuals, and just straight-up LOVE flowed in thick and fast for the daily forums and all-staff emails. All messages recognised the tremendous effort and commitment of CHS team members through what has been an unprecedented last couple of years. While we may well and truly be entering a new COVID normal, the love doesn't have to stop. Spread the CHS love and send through your shout outs to CHSComms@act.gov.au 20picks & flicks Podcasts to play... Murder with my husband Love true crime stories but don't have time for those podcasts that nut out every detail on one crime for six seasons? Well, this podcast is for you. Each episode is a new true crime story, wrapped up within 30-40 minutes. The podcast is hosted by Payton and Garrett Moreland, a married couple with one gripe - she loves true crime, and he hates it. Payton researches the darkest crime stories from across the globe and re-tells them to her husband (and their listeners) - you hear Garrett's genuine reactions as each story unfolds. Mr A+ After starring in the popular Netflix show 'Love on the Spectrum', 20-something year old Michael Theo (aka Mr A+) hosts this podcast which delves into life, love and the future. If you're wondering why it's called 'Mr A+', here's what the man himself had to say: \"When I first started Love on the Spectrum, I began saying, 'an A+ partner looks like me.' Then my mum started calling me Mr A+, and I actually liked it, it had a nice ring to it.\" Michael has a strictly 'no COVID chat' rule with his special guests, which helps to keep everyone in a positive mood and stick to the topic at hand. So, if you're up for something light- hearted, give this one a listen.
