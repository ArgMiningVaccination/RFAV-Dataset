The current lack of knowledge on proven treatments for long COVID has resulted in a surge in both demand and use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) treatments. This overview summarizes CIH therapies using the framework of the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, divided into nutritional, psychological, physical, and combinations of these categories. Representative therapies selected based on the availability of published and ongoing research for post-COVID conditions are of complementary and integrative medicine use in patients afflicted with COVID-19.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-2053897) BACKGROUND: Complementary and Integrative Medicine (CIM) is often taken up by individuals seeking relief from different diseases. This study investigates the prevalence and associated factors of CIM use in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this telephone-based, cross-sectional study, data on CIM usage were collected from COVID-19 patients from February till June 2020 in Fars province, Iran using a researcher-made checklist. Additionally, we asked about the patients' attitudes toward these treatments. RESULTS: Out of 453 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 400 (88.30%) responded to our calls and agreed to participate in the study. Among them, 276 patients reported using CIM to treat COVID-19 [prevalence: 69% (95% CI: 64.2 to 73.5)]. The most frequently used herbal medicine among COVID-19 patients was ginger (n = 273, 98.9%), thyme (n = 263, 95.3%), and black cumin (n = 205, 74.3%). Most of these patients were recommended to use herbal medicine by their families and friends (n = 96, 34.8%). Univariable logistic regression revealed that age under 50 years old, residency in urban areas (including the capital of the province and small cities), employment, academic education, and being an outpatient were statistically significant factors resulting in CIM usage. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that CIM use among outpatients was 3.65 times more than among inpatients. In addition, patients under 50 years old used CIM 85% more than older patients. Ultimately, only 9 (3.3%) patients consulted with their doctors regarding these medications. No side effects due to CIM use were reported. CONCLUSION: Many patients with COVID-19 used CIM, but few consulted with their physicians in this regard. Therefore, physicians should ask their patients about CIM usage, and patients should also report their use of CIM therapies during their medical visits. Furthermore, age and hospitalization status affected CIM use among patients with COVID-19. Early Stage COVID-19: A Single Center Retrospective Cohort Study From Gujarat, India.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1691167) The retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Ayurveda treatment exposure as an add-on to conventional care in early stage COVID-19 patients admitted at Samaras COVID care center, Ahmedabad, India. Conventional care included Vitamin-c, Azithromycin, and Paracetamol. Ayurveda formulations used as add-on Pathyadi decoctions along with Trikatu powder, Sanshamani tablet, AYUSH-64 tablet AND Yastimadhu Ghana tablet for oral administration. Considering Add-on Ayurveda medicines as exposure of interest, patients who received Add-on Ayurveda medicines at least for 7 days were included in the exposed group while those who received only conventional care in unexposed group. Data was collected through record review and telephonic interviews. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptoms, duration of symptomatic phase in those progressing to symptomatic stage and mortality. Total 762 participants were included-[541 (71%) in the exposed group and 221 (29%) in the unexposed. Progression to symptomatic phase did not differ significantly between groups [27.6% in exposed, 24.6% in unexposed, adjusted RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.6-1.2]. The total duration of symptomatic phase among those progressing to the symptomatic stage was significantly decreased in the exposed group (x\u00af = 3.66 \u00b1 1.55 days in exposed (n = 133); x\u00af = 5.34 \u00b1 3.35 days in unexposed (n = 61), p < 0.001). No mortality was observed in either of the groups. Ayurveda Treatment as adjunctive to conventional care reduced the duration of symptomatic phase in early stage COVID-19 as compared to standalone conventional care. Add-on Ayurveda treatment has promising potential for management of early stage COVID-19. - [Acetaminophen/therapeutic on interleukin-6 and in COVID-19 of a randomized multiple-arm pilot clinical study.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1432984) OBJECTIVE: In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of beta glucans derived from two strains AFO-202 and N-163 of a black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 24 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were recruited and randomly divided into three groups (Gr): Gr. 1 control (n = 8) - Standard treatment; Gr. 2: Standard treatment + AFO-202 beta glucan (n = 8); and Gr. 3, Standard treatment + combination of AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans (n = 8) for 30 days. RESULTS: There was no mortality or requirement of ventilation of the subjects in any of the groups. There was a decrease in D-Dimer values (751 ng/ml to 143.89 ng/ml) and IL-6 values (7.395-3.16 pg/ml) in Gr. 1 in 15 days but the levels increased to abnormal levels on day 30 (D-Dimer: 202.5 ng/ml; IL-6 55.37 pg/ml); which steadily decreased 2 (D-dimer: 560.99 ng/dl ESR. LCR and LeCR increased while NLR decreased significantly in Gr. 3. CD4 + and CD8 + T cell count showed relatively higher increase in Gr.3. There was no difference in CRP within the groups. CONCLUSION: As these beta glucans are well known food supplements with a track record for safety, larger multi-centric clinical studies are recommended to validate their use as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 and the ensuing long COVID-19 syndrome. - [Aureobasidium](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=ru&q=mh:\"Aureobasidium\"), [COVID-19 Drug have therapeutic value in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation of chronic pain patients. Evidence of such has been seen with the Whole Health Model at the (Veterans Affairs) VA Healthcare system. CIH therapies, including yoga, tai chi, mindfulness meditation, hypnosis, self-massage, and acupressure, are significantly effective for managing chronic pain with little to no negative effects, and can be easily incorporated into telemedicine care with great potential benefit. The future of wellness in telemedicine is evolving with great potential, and needs further attention to addressing barriers of care. - [Chronic Molecules Demonstrating Immunomodulation Activity as Potential Alternative Therapies for Viral Diseases Including COVID-19.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1247858) Plants have been extensively studied since ancient times and numerous important chemical constituents with tremendous therapeutic potential are identified. Attacks of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria can be counteracted with an efficient immune system and therefore, stimulation of body's defense mechanism against infections has been proven to be an effective approach. Polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and lactones are the important phytochemicals, reported to be primarily responsible for immunomodulation activity of the plants. These phytochemicals may act as lead molecules for the development of safe and effective immunomodulators as potential remedies for the prevention and cure of viral diseases. Natural products are known to primarily modulate the immune system in nonspecific ways. A number of plant-based principles have been identified and isolated with potential immunomodulation activity which justify their use in traditional folklore medicine and can form the basis of further specified research. The aim of the current review is to describe and highlight the immunomodulation potential of certain plants along with their bioactive chemical constituents. Relevant literatures of recent years were searched from commonly employed scientific databases on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Most of the plants displaying considerable immunomodulation activity are summarized along with their possible mechanisms. These discussions shall hopefully elicit the attention of researchers and encourage further studies on these plant-based immunomodulation products as potential therapy for the management of infectious diseases, including viral ones such as COVID-19. - [Biological prevalence of coronavirus and various treatment approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), there is still no definitive treatment for coronavirus. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CAM interventions on COVID-19 patients. CONTENT: Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE) were searched from the inception of databases until July 16, 2020. Keywords included complementary and alternative medicine therapies and Coronavirus. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Of the 1,137 studies searched, 14 studies performed on 972 COVID-19 patients entered the systematic review final stage. The results showed that different CAM interventions (acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM], relaxation, Qigong) significantly improved various psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (inflammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients. The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended. - the delivery of virtual integrative oncology interventions in clinical practice and research during the COVID-19 pandemic.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1152015) The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent need for disease transmission mitigation efforts have significantly altered the delivery of cancer care (e.g., rise of telemedicine), including within the field of integrative oncology. However, little has been described about how National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers have transformed integrative oncology care delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the delivery of integrative oncology clinical services and conduct of research at The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage. Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic. From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format. Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery. Overall, our clinical and research observations at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggest that the delivery of virtual integrative oncology treatments is feasible and appealing to patients. Trial [Neoplasms/rehabilitation](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=ru&q=mh:\"Neoplasms/rehabilitation\"), [Outcome Assessment, Health Care\"), [Peripheral Nervous System Nervous States/epidemiology](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=ru&q=mh:\"United States/epidemiology\") Traditional and complementary medicines are increasingly considered possible options for prevention and symptomatic treatment of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. With renewed attention on these therapies from researchers and policy makers alike, the well-documented challenges of evaluating their safety and efficacy are once again of global concern. Between 2005 and 2018, the World Health Organization conducted a series of surveys, in which 88 percent of responding member states confirmed that their biggest challenge in traditional medicine was the need for technical guidance on research and evaluation. As a first step in pursuing this need, our commentary summarizes thirteen international and regional guidance documents by three broad categories on evaluating safety, efficacy, and product quality for market-based approval and distribution of these treatments. We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on these subjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All available guidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conduct of such evaluations. Evidence suggests that improved evaluation methods on efficacy and effectiveness are crucial toward expanding future research into establishing the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, in the context of shifting acceptance, interest, and integration of traditional medicines into health systems, and as another step toward Universal Health Coverage. as Topic](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=ru&q=mh:\"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\"), [SARS-CoV-2](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=ru&q=mh:\"SARS-CoV-2\") [Effects of psychological stress on adverse pregnancy outcomes and nonpharmacologic approaches for reduction: an expert review.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1064757) Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit. online integrative oncology treatments during COVID-19.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-1064505) OBJECTIVE: We examined the qualitative impact of an online integrative oncology (IO) treatment program, designed in response to the restrictions created by the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients undergoing chemotherapy were seen by an integrative physician (IP), together co-designing an IO treatment program of 6 weekly treatments to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL). IO practitioners guided patients and their caregivers online in self-treatment with manual/touch, movement, and/or mind-body modalities. Narratives of both patients and IO practitioners were analyzed for systematic coding, identifying barriers and advantages of the online treatment program. RESULTS: Narratives obtained from 30 patients and eight IO-trained practitioners were examined. The patients had undergone 169 online IO sessions with a total of 327 IO interventions during the 3-month study period. Patient narratives included reflections on both non-specific effects (e.g., less of a \"sense of isolation\") and specific QoL-related outcomes with the online intervention. IO practitioner narratives focused on barriers to providing manual-movement and mind-body modalities, suggesting practical recommendations on how to address specific QoL-related outcomes using the online IO \"toolbox.\" CONCLUSIONS: Effective online IO practitioner-guided treatments are feasible and may induce both specific and non-specific QoL-related effects. Future research needs to explore online IO interventions for additional situations in which access to IO care is limited. complementary therapy in combat with COVID-19-A review of evidence-based research and clinical practice.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-917748) AIM: To examine the literature on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used in the treatment, prevention and supportive care in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: A narrative review was performed. DATA SOURCES: A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted on both Chinese and English electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO. Articles published from 1 December 2019 -1 April 2020 were included in this review. REVIEW METHODS: Studies reporting on the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 using TCM regardless of study designs were included. In addition, grey literatures, including media reports on Chinese government websites or official media websites and treatment guidelines were searched for TCM treatment and prevention on COVID-19. RESULTS: Limited research has been published on the use of TCM for COVID-19. We qualitatively described and synthesized the published research and current clinical practice on the use of TCM for COVID-19, and focused on the following areas: TCM treatment used in SARS, MERS, H1N1; TCM treatment plan for COVID-19; TCM in Prevention and Treatment at Early Stage of COVID-19; TCM emotional therapy; and personalized TCM treatment plan. CONCLUSION: The combination of western medicine and TCM in treatment, and treatment based on the local condition, isolation, personal protective measures are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Relevant laboratory research and clinical evaluation should be continued to collect scientific evidences on the efficacy of TCM. IMPACT: TCM has been used in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in China, and the clinical evidences indicated that TCM regulates immunity and exerts anti-viral effect simultaneously. This review provides practical recommendation for the policymakers in the selection process of the treatment and preventive measures for the global pandemic of COVID-19. - [Antiviral acid and its derivatives as potential alternative medicine to relieve symptoms in nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-763196) SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and infection by this virus results in COVID-19, manifesting predominantly symptoms in the lower respiratory system. Detection of viral genomic materials by RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis. Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms. These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment. Given the rapidly growing pandemic and the overwhelmed medical system, the number of self-quarantined patients is increasing. There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection. We report here a case of severe COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery. This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), a steroid-like molecule, in combination with vitamin C as alternative medicine. This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of DG as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms. - 2019 as complementary therapy: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-740189) BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine (CM) as complementary therapy in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The following databases will be searched: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wanfang database from October 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020. Randomized trials and quasi-randomized or prospective controlled clinical trials of CM that reported data on COVID-19 patients will be included. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and assessment of risk bias will be performed by 2 reviewers independently. Odds ratios and correlative 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to present the association between the CM and CWM using Review Manager version 5.3 when there is sufficient available data. RESULTS: The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication. CONCLUSION: This systematic review findings will summarize up-to-date evidence for that CM is more effective and safe as adjunctive treatment for patients with COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and patient consent are not required as this study is a systematic review based on published articles. PROSPERO therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-683654) BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder. While bringing psychologic pain to patients, it also damages their social function, which is a great threat to people's life and health. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have been used clinically to treat PTSD; however, the selection strategies of different CAM interventions in clinical practice is still uncertain, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of different CAM therapies using systematic review and network meta-analysis. METHODS: According to the strategy, the authors will retrieve a total of 7 electronic databases by June 2020. After a series of screening, the 2 researchers will use Aggregate Data Drug Information System and Stata software to analyze the data extracted from randomized controlled trials of CAM therapies for the PTSD. Finally, the evidence grade of the results will be evaluated. RESULTS: This study will provide a reliable evidence for the selection of CAM therapies for PTSD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study will provide references for evaluating the influence of different CAM therapies for PTSD, and provide decision-making references for clinical research. is a lot of discussion on COVID-19 control strategies from the mainstream approaches, but it is also necessary to examine the contributions of the Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Riga and Homeopathy (AYUSH) sector, which is now being brought into public health interventions nationally. Although the AYUSH sector had previously joined the management of dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in some Indian states, its participation has remained contentious and there is reluctance in mainstream public health discourses to seriously examine their interventions. This is a commentary on the efforts made by the Ministry of AYUSH, state AYUSH directorates, AYUSH research institutions, and public hospitals, based on official documents as well as official statements reported in the media, with the aim of bringing out concerns in the process of adapting traditional textual knowledge and practices to public health requirements of the current age.
