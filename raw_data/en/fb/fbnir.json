Classical vaccines comprising of live-attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines use an attenuated version of the original pathogen whereas inactivated vaccines use inactivated germs. Messenger RNA vaccines, on the other hand, utilize mRNA containing the code for antigens. With this, the aim is to make cells build the antigens themselves. When these two are compared, it is seen that mRNA vaccines are faster to produce due to technological improvements. They are more effective than classical vaccines owing to the advancements in delivery systems. Moreover, they do not possess the risk of degradation of DNA or instability again due to technological development. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines are harder to produce because of developing cultures. They are not as effective as mRNA vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Finally, live-attenuated vaccines have the probability of a reversion to the virulence of the natural germ. Thus, they cannot be given to people with weakened immunity. When all of these are considered, it has been concluded that mRNA vaccines have numerous advantages when compared to traditional vaccines. KEYWORDS: conventional; inactivated; live-attenuated; mRNA; vaccines. \u0084Introduction With the COVID-19 pandemic, all the attention of the sci - entists was drawn to a new type of vaccine: mRNA vaccines. This was a new approach to vaccination since conventional vaccines consisting of live-attenuated and inactivated (dead) vaccines have used entire pathogens that are either weak - ened (attenuated) or inactivated (killed) through physical and chemical processes for producing vaccines. However, the re - search on mRNA vaccines, in fact, dates back to the 1960s. During that period, mRNA vaccines had some deficiencies that needed to be improved. Owing to technological ad - vancement in recent years, this was made possible for mRNA vaccines, especially for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. This research paper will investigate the general properties of conventional vaccines and mRNA vaccines as well as compare the two vaccine types with respect to their production methods, efficiency for preventing diseases, and biosafety that they possess by focusing on SARS-CoV-2. The paper starts with an introduction of the two types of vaccines mentioning their properties and some of their benefits and disadvantages. The conventional vaccine classification was made according to the information taken from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The introduction continues with the comparison of the vaccine types in three main areas which are manufacturing, effectiveness, and safety including elaboration on some additional convenience and inconvenience of the vaccines. The paper is finished by showing mRNA vaccines have several advantages over conventional vaccines with respect to biosafety, efficacy, and production.\u0084Methods Conventional V accines: Conventional vaccines usually contain whole pathogens that are attenuated or inactivated so as to stimulate the immune system of the body against a pathogenic agent.\u00b9 The first type of traditional vaccine is the live or attenuated vaccine. Attenuated vaccines are comprised of the weakened version of a virus or bacterium that causes the disease so that the germs replicate themselves several times and create an immune response in the body.\u00b9 Most attenuated vaccines can create a strong and long-lasting immune response in the body against the disease with only one or two doses of the vaccine as the real pathogens and the pathogens utilized in this type of vaccine are very similar.\u00b2 The virulence of these disease-causing viruses or bacteria is usually reduced by repeated culturing.\u00b3 Since the pathogenic microorganism that is found in an attenuated vaccine is still a living organism even though it is weakened, live attenuated vaccines require refrigeration meaning that they need to be kept cool under low temperatures mostly between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F). However, there are a few exceptions such as live varicella (chickenpox) vaccine which must be stored frozen within a temperature range of -50\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F) in vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, shingles vaccine, and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are some of the other examples of live vaccines. The second type of traditional vaccine is the inactivated or dead vaccine. In order to produce inactivated vaccines either ijhighschoolresearch.org 23 DOI: 10.36838/v4i3.5entire pathogenic agents or microorganisms that are very similar to the germs are destroyed -or sometimes altered- through the agency of chemical agents, heat, or radiation after being grown in culture.\u00b3 The aim of the destruction or alteration of the disease-causing microorganisms is to prohibit the replication of the replication of the disease-causing microorganisms. A negative consequence of the destruction of germs is the decrease in the immunogenicity of inactivated viruses and bacteria provided by inactivated vaccines.\u00b3 It is said that the immunity obtained from inactivated vaccines is generally shorter and weaker than the immunity provided by live attenuated vaccines.\u00b3 Since the length and strength of the immune response of an inactivated vaccine are less, more doses of this kind of vaccine - generally two or three shots- are required to obtain a sufficient amount of antibodies in the body when compared to live-attenuated vaccines.\u00b3 Although this may be a disadvantage of inactivated vaccines over live attenuated ones, an advantage of inactivated vaccines is the fact that the refrigeration process is not essential for some inactivated vaccines such as lyophilized vaccines in which the water is removed and they are vacuumed since the pathogenic microorganisms are inactivated through chemical or physical processes. This eases the distribution of this type of vaccine around the globe as opposed to attenuated vaccines whose distribution is limited to the countries having refrigerators. However, as usual, there are exceptions. Some of them are inactivated vaccines that are in a liquid state that do not contain aluminum adjuvants. Additionally, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), hepatitis A vaccine, rabies vaccine, and polio vaccine can be given as other examples of inactivated vaccines that were developed until now. Messenger RNA V accines: Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines have been studied for decades dating back to the 1960s.\u00b9 Recent advancements in technology in addition to the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic have extremely increased the speed of the development of mRNA vaccine technology. Messenger RNA is therefore a novel technology utilized to generate an immune response in the body.\u00b9 Unlike classical vaccines, instead of entire pathogens, mRNA vaccines use mRNA in which the \"blueprint\" of a specific pathogen is encoded.\u00b9 This allows the cells themselves to produce antigens (disease-causing proteins) which are normally found in the pathogenic bacteria or viruses by translating the information encoded in the mRNA.\u00b9 Similar to live-attenuated vaccines, mRNA vaccines should be refrigerated. An exemplification of refrigeration can be given as the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer- BioNTech. Since the durability and stability tests of the vaccine started quite late in the developmental process, refrigeration was imposed by the biotechnology company. Likewise, another benefit of messenger RNA vaccines which is common to live-attenuated vaccines is their ability to generate strong immunogenicity, meaning that the body creates a strong immune response against the antigens that were produced by the body itself.\u00b9\u00b9 Yet, sometimes this immunogenicity might be exaggerated by the body causing the excess amount of cytokine which is a crucial and small protein used in cell signaling and produced by the innate immune system to appear in the body. However, there is no evidence supporting that \"mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or even non-mRNA vaccines would result in cytokine storms\".\u00b9\u00b2 Two types of mRNA are a 5' cap structure that contains a 7-methylguanosine cap (mG cap) that is connected to the first nucleotide by a triphosphate bridge, a 3' poly-A tail respectively from left to right as shown in Figure 1 (a).\u00b9\u00b3 On the other hand, self-replicating mRNA, different from non-replicating mRNA contains an RNA- polymerase (RDRP) complex between 5' UTR and immunogen code which is an enzyme catalyzing the replication of RNA -in this case, mRNA- in addition to the components found in the structure of non-replicating mRNA as also shown in Figure 1 (b).\u00b9\u00b3 In other words, the RDRP complex that is located in the self-amplifying mRNA enables the mRNA to multiplicate intracellularly as shown Figure 2.\u00b9\u00b3 The 5' mG cap and 3' poly-A tail are used in both conventional and self-amplifying mRNAs to prevent the breakage of the immunogen blueprint by the enzymes found in the cytoplasm of the cells in the body.\u00b9\u00b3 Production of Traditional and mRNA V accines: Traditional vaccines take a longer time to be developed compared to messenger RNA vaccines.\u00b9 In a nutshell, in order to produce live-attenuated vaccines first, wild bacteria or viruses are weakened under laboratory conditions.\u00b3 The attenuation process might be done through heat or light although repeated culturing is the most preferred method.\u00b3 Then, these viruses or bacteria are delivered to the body via live-attenuated vaccines. For inactivated vaccines, however, the methods such as using chemicals, radiation, or heat are used to destroy or kill the germs as can be seen in Figure 3.\u00b9 After the inactivation, the destroyed pathogens are delivered to the body through inactivated vaccines Figure 3.\u00b9 Figure 1: Non -replicating and self -replicating mRNA structures .13 Figure 2: Production of immunogens via non -replicating and self -replicating mRNA .13 ijhighschoolresearch.org 24 DOI: 10.36838/v4i4.5Even though the description of the manufacturing processes of attenuated and inactivated vaccines seem to be short, indeed they are longer than the manufacture time of mRNA vaccines.\u00b9 The average duration of vaccine development is measured to be 10 to 15 years.\u00b9 One reason for this might be the fact that vaccine development comprises several stages: discovery and development, pre-clinical trials, human trials, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution.\u00b9 To support this claim, the development times of several conventional vaccines from the discovery and development stage to the licensing stage (FDA approval stage) can be given. The vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 was developed in less than one year by breaking the fastest produced vaccine record.\u00b9 In the meantime, the developmental time for the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine was 28 years, for the flu vaccine was 27 years, for polio was 13 years, and for mumps was 4 years.\u00b9 Although the same vaccine development stages are applicable for mRNA vaccines as well, the time for the discovery and development stage is much shorter for them owing to the technological advancements in gene sequencing.\u00b9 Specifically for COVID-19, the human trial stage was shortened as well as the discovery and development stage.\u00b9 Another reason for the fact that traditional vaccines require a longer production time could be the culturing process in inactivated vaccines.\u00b9 Since producing numerous inactivated bacteria and viruses takes up plenty of time, the discovery and development stage is longer for inactivated vaccines specifically, elongating the overall manufacture time for this type of classical vaccine.\u00b9 Briefly, due to the differences in the manufacturing process, for the production of conventional vaccines, more time must be devoted. The Manufacture and W orking Processes of mRNA V accines: Compared to traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have a different way of production and working as depicted in Figure 4.\u00b9 First of all, the sequence of the pathogenic agent is identified via gene-sequencing.\u00b9 Secondly, vaccines containing small and harmless mRNA fragments in which the code for the specific antigen -for COVID-19 this specific antigen is called spike protein- is encoded are produced and given to people.\u00b9 Thirdly, mRNA fragments enter the body.\u00b9 Thus, the body starts the antigen expression itself.\u00b9 Simultaneously, the antigens are placed on the outer surface of the cells.\u00b9 Finally, the immune system recognizes the foreign substance and starts to produce a suitable antibody for the specific antigen.\u00b9 However, one disadvantage of using Figure 3: Production process of inactivated vaccines .14 this process is that mRNA can be broken down readily.\u00b2 Hence, it might be harder to produce enough antigens and subsequently enough antibodies to protect the body from the dreadful effects of pathogens. To reduce this disadvantage, two of the approved COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are made utilizing self-replicating mRNAs so that the number of mRNAs is increased as was depicted in Figure 2.\u00b9\u00b3 Efficacy of Traditional and mRNA V accines: In the early usage of mRNA in research for vaccination, mostly naked mRNA was used.\u00b2\u00b9 This was creating several problems. The most important one was the instability of the mRNA which decreased the efficacy of the vaccines containing mRNA.\u00b2\u00b9 The mRNA was not able to reach the target cells safely because of the presence of nucleases which are the enzyme type that can break the mRNA down in the body.\u00b2\u00b9 Additionally, to reach the cytoplasm of the cell, mRNA needs to pass from a negatively charged phospholipid bilayer.\u00b2\u00b9 Only particles smaller than 1,000 Da (atomic mass unit) can pass through this bilayer.\u00b2\u00b9 Since mRNA is a much larger and heavier molecule, it required a carrier with it so that it could pass through the negatively charged bilayer.\u00b2\u00b9 Briefly, the deficiency of a well-prepared delivery system was the root of the problems.\u00b2\u00b9 However, this problem is no longer the case for mRNA vaccination due to the technological advancements in the mRNA delivery systems. There are several novel delivery systems divided into two big groups: viral and non-viral vector delivery systems.\u00b9 Non-viral vector delivery systems can further be divided into two subgroups lipid and polymer delivery systems.\u00b2\u00b9 Some examples of lipid delivery systems are lipid nanoparticles and liposome complexes.\u00b2\u00b9 Some examples of polymer poly-beta amino-esters (PBAEs), and polyethyleneimine (PEI).\u00b2\u00b9 Some examples of viral vector delivery systems are electroporation, polymer delivery system (polylysine), and cationic liposome.\u00b2\u00b9 Some examples of viral vector delivery systems are hybrid adenoviral vectors and retroviral vectors.\u00b2\u00b2 In this article, the main focus is on the non-viral lipid delivery system of lipid nanoparticles since the Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines both used this type Figure 4: Working process of mRNA when it enters a cell .19 ijhighschoolresearch.org 25 DOI: 10.36838/v4i3.5that mRNA can be broken down readily.\u00b2 Hence, it might be harder to produce enough antigens and subsequently enough antibodies to protect the body from the dreadful effects of pathogens. To reduce this disadvantage, two of the approved COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are made utilizing self-replicating mRNAs so that the number of mRNAs is increased as was depicted in Figure 2.\u00b9\u00b3 In general, a rather popular method for solving optimization problems is Dynamic Programming (DP). DP is essentially a recursive solution with repeated method calls, storing the results of subproblems for the eventual solution. Compared to the aforementioned genetic algorithms, DP solutions usually use a lot of memory and have a longer running time. Even though genetic algorithms are typically harder to implement, efficiency in time and memory capacity are highly valuable assets for competitive programming which makes genetic algorithms more effective in Olympiad in Informatics. \u0084 Results and Discussion Genetic Algorithms can be considered systematic random search algorithms where the random search algorithm also considers the optimality of previous trials and evolves accord - ingly. Randomly initializing the individuals causes the proposed solutions to span the search space. With each generation, the solutions then attempt to converge at a global optimum. Mu - tations add genetic diversity to the gene pool and aim to ensure that the point the population converges is the global optimum. Knowing these it can still be inferred that a genetic algorithm may not be able to converge on the most optimal solution even with the best possible parameters as it is still a randomized and probabilistic algorithm. Although that may be the case, it could be expected that the final result of a genetic algorithm is close to the global optimum. For the set of runs that will be conduct - ed in this paper, it is assumed that the problem is solved if the value of the solution proposed by the algorithm is within 5% of the actual solution after 2000 generations. The percentage values of how close the solution is to the actual solution are calculated using the following formula: Another factor to consider is that genetic algorithms are intrinsically parallel compared to most algorithms which are serial. Serial algorithms only permit linear exploration that does not store every value reached by the algorithm's \"infer\" steps. On the contrary, genetic algorithms contain multiple offspring which allows multiple dimensional explorations. Depending on the accuracy of the offspring, some are eliminated, whereas some are pursued as promising solutions. Due to the parallel - ism, they can operate resembling a graph structure, evaluating multiple traceries at once. Thanks to their structure, particularly problems containing vast amounts of potential solutions are easier to solve which would take an immense amount of time with a simple search algorithm. Identifying the sections of a problem: First and foremost, it is essential to identify crucial sections of a problem task before analyzing any algorithms or writing code. In this problem titled IPL, a certain number of games (N) are given according to the user's input. Afterward, N number of games is expected from the user with each con - taining a particular fee awarded if played in the game. The problem calls for the maximum amount of money that could be earned for an individual (Nikhil) through the N games. However, there is a condition in which an individual is obli - gated to play at most 2 consecutive games. Herewith, a certain algorithm must be constructed which maximizes salary while taking at most 2 consecutive game conditions into account. Furthermore, a prediction about the complexity of a prob - lem could be made per the given test data constraints. A maximum of 2*10 number of games along with 10 for each game can be inputted by the user. An average computer is able to make approximately 2*10 calculations per second regard - less of the operating system. Thus, a brute force algorithm with time complexity of O(n 2) would be sufficient for a solution to pass this problem. The time complexity of O(n 2) signifies the worst solution possible for a problem which usually persists in iterating through every single value until the correct an - swer is reached. Nonetheless, a brute force solution wouldn't pass for this problem if the user could input 2*10 number of games. In a hypothetical case, a genetic algorithm would be one of the most ideal solution methods for this problem with the time complexity of O(gnm). Among the time complexi - ty of O(gnm), \"g\" stands for the number of generations, \"n\" stands for the population size, whereas \"m\" signifies the size of individuals.\u00b9 In brief, although in this particular case it's not imperative, a genetic algorithm solution would be a fast and viable solution to the problem among random search and brute force algorithms. Genetic Algorithms Implementation: The genetic algorithm is implemented via the programming language C# which is a general-purpose, object-oriented pro - gramming language developed by Microsoft. The following Figure 5: Fusion of lipid vehicle with the plasma membrane .24 Figure 6: Comparison of BNT 162b1 and CoronaVac vaccines antibody production and neutralization .29 ijhighschoolresearch.org 26 section breaks down the code into several sections - namely initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and termination. Before the function of the code is analyzed, its inner struc - ture must be understood.\u00b9\u00b9 First of all, the code starts with a class named Individual, which represents one individual in the entirety of the population. Each contains a set of genes that are of template type, a double fitness value, and a chromosome length which is common throughout the entire population. Its implementation is as follows: All of these instance variables are initialized with a construc - tor as each instance of the Individual class is created. Another structure within the algorithm is the Population class. The class contains an array of individuals, a generation number, a popu - lation size, a chromosome size, and various probability values for the genetic algorithm to work on. The implementation of its instance variables is as follows: As evident from the code snippet, the population class also contains two functions: GetRandomGene() and Calculate - Fitness() functions. These functions are provided by the client of these classes and are called within the population's various functions. GetRandomGene() is the function that returns a random gene to initialize the members. CalculateFitness() is a function that returns a double value according to the genes of the individual; the number returned signifies the fitness of that particular gene set or individual. As cognizant of solely the meaning and implementation of these values, it is possi typtype of delivery system in their SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\u00b2\u00b3 This new lipid nanoparticle technology used by both of the approved and the most used COVID-19 vaccines not only allows the messenger ribonucleic acid to travel safely inside the body but also eases the entrance of the large and heavy mRNA molecule into the cell from a negatively charged phospholipid bilayer.\u00b2\u00b9 Whilst mRNA is entering the target cell, the encapsulating lipid fuses with the plasma membrane as described in Figure 5 by a model.\u00b2\u00b9 Other than newly developed delivery systems, the effective - ness data of COVID-19 vaccines can be compared to show that the lipid nanoparticle delivery system has made the mRNA vaccines much more efficient than classical vaccines, specifi - cally inactivated vaccines. In a study conducted at 99 centers in the United States where 96% of 30,420 volunteers received two doses of intramuscular mRNA-1273 injections 28 days apart, the efficacy of two doses of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 including severe diseases in persons 18 years old or older was found to be 94.1%, and no safety concerns were identified.\u00b2 Yet, only transient local and systematic reactions were observed.\u00b2 In the meantime, in the phase three trial of the BNT162b1 COVID-19 vaccine where 43,000 volunteers from roughly 150 clinical trial sites in several countries including the United States, Turkey, and Argentina, the overall efficacy of the vaccine was found to be 95% and the effectiveness of persons over 65 years old was recorded as 94%.\u00b2 On the other hand, the efficiency data for the Coro - naVac (Sinovac) vaccine which is a type of inactivated vaccine is lower than the ones found in mRNA vaccines when both are compared to each other. In a study in Indonesia where 1,620 healthy adults within an age range of 18 to 59 were injected with two doses of CoronaVac (Sinovac) inactivated vaccine 14 days apart, the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent symp - tomatic COVID-19 was confirmed as 65.30%.\u00b2 In a similar study conducted in Turkey, the same inactivated vaccine's ef - ficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be 83.5%.\u00b2 In another similar study conducted in Brazil where 43,774 people being 70 years old or more were given two shots of CoronaVac inactivated vaccine, the adjusted vaccine effec - tiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was confirmed as 24.7% between days 0 and 13 meanwhile this value was found as 46.8% after the second dose.\u00b2 In another study where the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and inactivated vaccines against COVID-19 based on BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine and CoronaVac inactivated vaccine were compared, the resulting graphs showed that both the amount of antibody produced by the body and the neutralization amount is higher in the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine compared to CoronaVac inactivat - ed vaccine as can be seen from the graph in Figure 6.\u00b2 The relationship between antibody and antigen was measured by a method called \"ELISA\" as shown in graph A in Figure 6.\u00b2 The neutralizing antibodies, on the other hand, is measured via sVNT assay.\u00b2 The neutralizing antibodies are crucial since having more capacity for neutralization may prevent the en - trance of pathogens into the cells as well as stop the germs from changing their conformational shape.\u00b3 All in all, all the data provided shows that the efficacy rate for mRNA vaccines which are BNT162b1 and mRNA-1273 is higher than the efficacy rates for an inactivated vaccine which is in this case CoronaVac (Sinovac). At the moment, there are not any approved live-attenuated COVID-19 vaccines since they are still in the clinical trial pro - cess which makes it harder the comparison of live-attenuated vaccines to mRNA vaccines. However, logically, some reasoning for why live-attenuated vaccines cannot perform as effectively as mRNA vaccines on COVID-19 might be done. Most im - portantly, since live-attenuated vaccines contain the weakened version of a virus or a bacterium, they can only attack one spe - cific virus or bacterium type meaning that whenever there is a new pathogenic agent, a new purification and testing pro - cess is required to develop a new vaccine.\u00b9 On the other hand, mRNA vaccines can be standardized meaning that with mini - mal changes in the mRNA encoding different vaccines against different disease-causing microorganisms might be produced.\u00b9 Additionally, because of this reason, using mRNA vaccines will increase the speed of the vaccine development process which is very necessary for outbreaks such as COVID-19.\u00b9 Biosafety of Traditional and mRNA V accines: A final aspect that should be considered while comparing the advantages and disadvantages of traditional and mRNA vaccines is their biosafety. Most of the hesitance to getting in - jected with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine comes from three points: the degree of degradation of DNA of the person, insta - bility of mRNA, and side effects of the vaccine.\u00b2\u00b9 ,\u00b3\u00b9 To begin with, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cannot degrade the human genome (DNA) since mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cells where DNA is located in each person and instead remains in the cytosol which is in the cytoplasm that is found outside DOI: 10.36838/v4i4.5 ijhighschoolresearch.org 27 DOI: 10.36838/v4i4.5of the nucleus of the cells.\u00b2\u00b9 Moreover, mRNA is a molecule that breaks down readily in the human body that's the reason why self-amplifying mRNAs are used in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to increase the amount of mRNA in the cells which will also augment the amount of antigen and therefore anti - bodies.\u00b2 Secondly, the instability of mRNA is resolved due to the advancements in the delivery systems by using appro - priate carriers in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines which helps to increase the safety of the vaccines.\u00b2\u00b9 The most commonly used carriers, today, for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are lipid nanoparticles that belong to lipids which are one of the four organic compound types.\u00b2\u00b9 Therefore, they are biodegradable meaning that they are not harmful to human cells.\u00b2 Moreover, they fuse with the phospholipid bilayer of human cells once the mRNA encapsulated in the lipid vehicle arrives at the target cell as was shown in Figure 5.\u00b2 Lastly, the fear of side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. mRNA vaccines indeed have side effects such as swelling, pain, redness where the shot was ad - ministered, headache, and fever.\u00b3\u00b2 Yet, these side effects are also available from conventional vaccines including live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines. In live-attenuated vaccines, especially, people are given the weakened version of the pathogen which increases the possibility of side effects in live vaccines since the substance given by the vaccine is the closest to the actual pathogenic agent.\u00b3\u00b3 Furthermore, in live-attenuated vaccines, there is the potential for reversion to natural virulence creating a very similar effect to the actual dreadful pathogen as a result of a secondary mutation of the attenuated microorganism.\u00b9 Moreover, because of this reason, one important limitation of live-attenuated vaccines is that they cannot be injected into people with weak immune systems since the vaccine might produce the actual disease in the body.\u00b9 On the other hand, in - activated vaccines do not possess the possibility of turning back to natural virulence.\u00b9 Thus, people with weakened immune systems can get these vaccines.\u00b9 However, for this type of vac - cine, a minor fault in the bacteria culturing process might result in infections in the injected people.\u00b3 Hence, special laboratory facilities that are very clean are required.\u00b3 A final problematic situation with inactivated vaccines is that they might require adjuvants which is an ingredient used in vaccines to boost the vaccines such as aluminum hydrates.\u00b3 This is a disadvantage for dead vaccines because adjuvants can cause more local reac - tions such as swelling and pain and systematic reactions such as fever and chills.\u00b3 This means that inactivated vaccines in which adjuvants are present have more possibility of causing side effects compared to mRNA vaccines. \u0084 Conclusion In conclusion, several benefits of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines are observed when compared to con - ventional vaccines comprising of live-attenuated vaccines and inactivated (dead) vaccines in manufacturing, efficiency, and biological safety. The main advantage of mRNA vaccines in production is the less requirement of time as opposed to clas - sical vaccines which require more time due to the methods used in the discovery and development stage of the tradi - tional vaccine development. When it comes to the efficacy of mRNA vaccines, even though previously, the instability of na -ked mRNA vaccines was causing a decrease in the efficiency of mRNA vaccines, the novel advancement in the technology allowed amelioration in the delivery systems which highly ac - celerated the augmentation of the efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Finally, the properties of mRNA as well as the technological advancement made the point of view toward mRNA vac - cines more appealing. Based on these three-argument it can be concluded that mRNA vaccines provide multi-benefits over classical vaccines. \u0084 References 1.
