I will be continuing my senior year this fall and I plan to graduate next May with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health. One of the fundamental requirements of the environmental health program at ISU is to complete a nine -week ex ternship with an approved organization. My aim from the start was to find an ex ternship that would provide a mix of both autonomy and mentorship that would promote collaborative growth and independent function as an EH professional. Fortunately, the Director of ISU's Environmental H ealth program, CAPT George Byrns, USPHS (Ret) , introduced me to Indian Health Service (IHS) . He is a large reason why I switched from almost a decade in medicine to studying environmental health, so when he spoke passionately about the IHS an d USPHS opportunities I listened intently. It was no more than a week or two later that I was already working on my application packet for the JRCOSTEP . After a relatively short period of time I was informed I would be stationed in Rhinelander, WI with the Rhinelander District Office (RDO) . I had never been north of Tomahawk, WI so I was very pleased to see that the beauty of the Northwoods only became more pronounced the further north I went. The RDO is within the Bemidji Area IHS that covers all tribes throughout Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I was fortunate enough to work under the guidance of Barry Hugo, CDR William Crump, and alongside two new hires named Jeremy Blankenship and last year's JRCOSTEP , Garret Steiner. This office mostly covers the state of Wisconsin and the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan. I can honestly say that I developed more as an EH professional than I ever thought could be possible in such a short amount of time. I was exposed to situations in the field that, prior to the ex ternship, I had only learned about in a controlled scholastic environment. I was also fortunate enough to work in areas of EH that I did not realize were a function of public health focused professionals. Most of my time was spent traveling around RDO's t ribal regions conducting inspections of food service establishments, healthcare facilities, water treatment plants, and all other forms of buildings. I spent an extraordinary amount of time digging into the 2013 FDA Food Code, OSHA 1910 standards, and the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. I had dealt with building and fire code in the past but had not been introduced to the 2013 Food Code, so this was a very immersive and beneficial aspect of the summer for me. Through consistent exposure and application of these codes, I became comfortable enough to begin doing inspections autonomously. I obviously diverted any quest ions outside of my scope of practice to Mr. Hugo but otherwise worked independently as an EH specialist. Outside of routine inspections, I wa s able to help in various other ways through things like: creating plans for a code ad herent commercial kitchen ; providing training to food handlers ; inspecting temporary food vendors ; conducted respirator fit tests of medical staff; conduct ing tick survei llances ; and many other undertakings. In keeping with the inspection heavy aspect of my ex ternship, I was tasked with creating a guidance document and custom inspection forms for barbershops, salons, and spas. Th e guidance document i s meant to standardize environmental health and safety compliance in thes e facilities, define roles and scope of responsibilities for involved parties, and establish a framework for policy and procedure development in new facilities . This document is also versatile enough to be absorbed and customized to fit facilities outside of RDO's reach if desired. I feel fortunate that I was not only involved in meaningful work, with experienced professionals, but that I was also working for and alongside a vast number of different cultures. The only thing more diverse than work was the collection of people surrounding me. This was extremely important to me because this diversity acted as a catalyst for my point of view; it shifted my view of EH&S from a task specific focus to a large and integrative system that is meant to improve the lives of others. This further affirmed my decision to follow this profession in a passionate manner. My experience with the Indian Health Service was a remarkable one. I have felt welcomed, challenged, and appreciated during my time here. I am beyond thankful for the opportunity I was awarded this summer. I will absolutely be a proponent for this ex ternship and will take everything I have learned and e xperienced in this time and build on it to become an EH&S professional that embodies the attributes the Commissioned Corps aims to instill in all of its officers.
