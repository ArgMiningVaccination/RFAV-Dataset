This process starts when a U.S. citizen files a petition for alien relative, Form I -130. U.S. citizens can file for their husband or wife, parents, married or unmarried childre n of any age, and brothers and sisters. However a U.S. cit izen must be at least 21 years old to petition for his or her parents and for sisters and brothers. A U.S. citizen must f ile a separate petition for each of these relatives that they seek to sponsor . A U.S. citizen can only file a petition for those relatives listed on the Form I -130. When a U.S. citizen's family member immigrates, they may be able to bring his/her spouse and children under age 21 with them as dependents. When an I -130 is filed on be half of a qualifying relative, this establishes a qualifying relationship that then will allow the relative to immigrate to the Unite d States. Once a petition is approved by USCIS, this will allow the relative to apply for an immigrant visa or apply to adjust status to that of a permanent resident in the United States. However, certain relatives may have to wait in line for several years behind others already in line to immigrate. When your relative reaches the head of the li ne, the State Department wi ll contact them and invite them to apply for an immigrant visa. Sponsoring a relative involves accepting some financial responsibility and filing an affidavit of support when the time comes for your relative to immigrate .

FAQs about financial sponsorship FAQs about the USCIS Immigrant Fee Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 134 of 323 What does the petition do for my relative? Filing a relative petition and proving a qualifying relationship establishes the existence of a relationship between you and your relative and gives your relative a place in line with others waiting to immigrate from the same country or region based on the same type of relationship. When your relative reaches the front of the line, he or she may be eligible to immigrate after passing all requirements necessary to qualify for an immigrant visa or to adjust status. Your relative's place in line will be based on the date the petition is filed. Therefore, there is an advantage of filing as soon as possible. On the other hand, there i s no waiting period for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. That includes a U.S. citizen's spouse, parent, or unmarried child un der 21 years of age. Can I petition for other relatives? The law limits eligibility to the spouse, unmarried child(ren) under age 21, unmarried son(s) or daughter(s) age 21 or older, married child(ren), parent(s) and sibling(s) . We cannot approve a relative petition filed by a U.S. citizen on behalf of any other relatives. Which family members need a separate petition filed on his/her behalf? A separate petition must be filed on behalf of each eligible relative. According to the law, a spouse, unmarried child(ren) under age 21, unmarried son(s) or daughter(s) age 21 or older, married child(ren), parent(s) and sibling(s) are considered eligible relatives for whom a U.S. citizen can file a relative petition. Which family members can apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on the principle beneficiary's approved pe tition? Certain family members of non- immediate relatives may be able to apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on the principle beneficiary's approved petition. At the time your unmarried son or daughter age 21 or older, married son or daughter, or sibling becomes eligible to immigrate, their spouse and/or unmarried child(ren) under 21 years of age may apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on your relative's approved petit ion. If the child of your relative is married when the visa becomes available, he/she is no longer eligible to apply for an immi grant visa or adjustment of status based on the principle beneficiary's approved petition. If the child of your relative turns 21 years of age before the visa becomes available, he/she may no longer be able to apply for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on the principle beneficiary's approved petition. In certain cases, the Child Status Protection Act may apply. For more information, please see the FAQs regarding the Child Status Protection Act . Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 135 of 323 After I file, how long will it be before my relative can immigrate? The law gives special consideration to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, which includes a U.S. citizen's spouse, unmarried children under 21 years of age, and parents. The State Department will invite them to apply for an immigrant visa once we approve your petition. If they are already in the U.S . and entered legally, they may actually be able to file an application for permanent residence along with your relative petition. Other family members must wait until there is a visa number available before they can apply for an immigrant visa or adjus tment of status to a lawful permanent resident. Current wait times for visa categories are located under \"Visa Bulletins\" on the State Department's websi te at http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law -and-policy/bulletin.html . Can my relative wait in the U.S. until he or she can apply to become a permanent resident? If your relative is outside the United States, filing an I -130 does not allow your relative to live or work in the United States. An approved I -130 petition only verifies your relationship with your relative. Your relative should not enter the U.S. and should wait outside the United States to immigrate legally. If your husband or wife, unmarried child under 21 years, or parent is already in the United States after entering legally, they can apply for adjustment of status to permanent resident at the same time you file their Form I -130 on their behalf. Does filing a relative petition commit me to anything? Yes. Under the law, each person who immigrates based on a relative's petition must have a financial sponsor. If you choose to sponsor your relatives by filing Form I -130, when the time comes for your relative to immigrate to the United States, you must file Form I -864, Affidavit of Support, which verifies that you can financially support your relative, through your income or assets, when they arrive in t he US. If you do not meet the financial eligibility requirement, other individuals will then need to make this commitment with you. How do I file? Follow the I -130 relative petition instructions and check our website for any updates on instructions or fees. Make sure your petition is complete. You will need to submit evidence of your U.S. citizenship, and evidence proving your qualifying relationship to each person for whom y ou are filing. Where do I file? A petitioner residing in the United States or Canada should file Form I -130 in accordance with the instructions on the Form I -130. Note : Effective August 15, 2011, petitioners living abroad in a country without a USCIS office must file their petitions with the USCIS Chicago Lockbox, as noted in the instructions to Form I -130. Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 136 of 323 What happens after I file? If you file d by mail, we will mail you a receipt so you know we have your petition. If your petition is incomplete, we may have to reject it or ask you for more evidence or information, which will delay processing. Please carefully follow the I -130 instructions and send all required documents the first time to avoid delay. We will notify you in writing when we make a decision. If your relative is already in the United States, he or she may apply to adjust status to become a green card holder (permanent resident) after a visa number becom es available using Form I -485. If your relative is outside the United States, your petition will be sent to the National Visa Center (NVC). The NVC will for ward your petition to the appropriate U.S. consulate when a visa becomes available and your relative will be notified about how to proceed. You can get more information about immigrant visa processing from the State Department's website at www.travel.state.gov . Your family mem ber's preference category will determine how long he or she will have to wai t for an immigrant visa number. How long will it take USCIS to process my petition? Processing time depends on a number of factors and any estimate that USCIS provides to its cus tomers is only an estimate, not a guarantee. You can also check updated processing time estimates for an application or petition by visiting www.uscis.gov and selecting \"See Office Case Processing Times\" under the Tools tab. These estimates are updated monthly, typically after the 15th of the month. If you need assistance, please call our toll -free number at 1- 800-375-5283. What if I filed a petition for a relative when I was a permanent resident, but I am now a U.S. citizen? If you become a U.S. citizen while your relative is waiting for a visa, you can upgrade your relative's visa classification b y upgrading your petition. Spouse and unmarried childr en under age 21 and parents of U.S. citizens have visas immediately available to them. If you become a U.S. citizen after your petition is already approved and sent to the State Department, you should notify the NVC that you have become a U.S. citizen b y sending a copy of your naturalization certificate to the NVC. Please include a letter with information regarding your relative and a copy of the petition approval that you wish to upgrade. National Visa Center Attn: WC 31 Rochester Avenue, Suite 200 Portsmouth, NH 03801- 2915 You can find additional contact information and instructions for sending an inquiry to the NVC on the Department of State's website .

Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 137 of 323 How do I know if my relative and I qualify? While we cannot tell you whether you are eligible for a benefit and cannot advise you whether or not to file for a benefit, w e can ask you some questions to help you determine basic filing requirements. We can also give you some definitions in immigration law about certain relationships. Note : Which type of relative are you interested in helping to become a permanent resident : For help relate d to filing for a SPOUSE For help related to filing for an UNMARRIED CHILD UNDER AGE 21 For help related to filing for an UNMARRIED SON/DAUGHTER OVER AGE 21 For help related to filing for a MARRIED SON /DAUGHTER For help related to fil ing for a BROTHER/SISTER For help related to filing for a PARENT What is a Preference Category? Preference categories include family relationships t hat are not immediate relatives and have annual numerical limits. A visa becomes available to a preference category based on the priority date (the date the Form I -130 was filed). The follo wing are preference categories: First preference: Unmarried, adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (adult means 21 or older.) Second Preference (2A) : Spouses of green card holders, unmarried children (under 21) of permanent residents Second Preference (2B) : Unmarried adult sons and daughters of permanent residents Third Preference: Married sons and daughters (any age) of U.S. citizens Fourth Preference : Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens Your family member's preference category will determine h ow long he or she will have to wait for an immigrant visa number. Once you have filed a petition, you can check its progress on \"Check My Case Status\" on the USCIS website. Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 138 of 323 What are priority dates and how do they work? A priority date is the date that USCIS has received a properly filed visa petition. The priority date can be found on the top portion of a visa petition approval notice. A priority date, coupled with the preference category, determines when your relative will be eligible to i mmigrate to the United States. Priority dates are used to make sure that each eligible person within an immigrant category is consider ed in chronological order. In other words, a priority date is the person's place in line to immigrate. If your immigrant visa category is that of an immediate relative, then your case and priority date are automatically current. To determine whether a pri ority date is current for your relative, please refer to the Department of State Visa Bulletin . Beginning with the October 2015 visa bulletin , the Department of State will publish two charts: An \"Application Final Action Dates\" chart, which shows w hat priority dates are current for the purpose of issuing immigrant visas and when individuals may file their adjustment of status application, and A \"Dates for Filing Visa Applications\" chart, indicating when immigrant visa applicants should be notified to assemble and submit required documentation to the National Visa Center. If USCIS determines that there are more immigrant visas available for the fiscal year than there are known applicants for such visas, the \" Dates for Filing Visa Applications\" chart\" may be used to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with USCIS. What is the Child Status Protec tion Act (CSPA) and What Does it Mean for my Child? The CSPA chan ges who can be considered a \"child\" for the purpose of the issuance of visas by the Department of State and for the purpose of adjustment of status to that of permanent resident by USCIS. The Act provides that if you are a U.S. ci tizen and you file a Form I -130, Petition for Alien Relative , on behalf of your child before he or she turns 21, your child will continue to be considered a child for immigration purposes ev en if USCIS does not act on the petition before your child turns 21. Children of lawful permanent residents also benefit if a Form I -130 is filed on behalf of their children. Unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens What advantage(s) does the Child Status Protection Act provide to unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens that are eligible? What are the eligibility requirements unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens must meet in order to qualify for the Chi ld Status Protection Act? Unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents who later become U.S. citizens What benefit does the Child Status Protection Act have for the unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents who later become U.S. citizens? Why would the unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents who later become U.S. citizens elect not to have such a con version? Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 139 of 323 What advantage(s) does the Child Status Protection Act provide to unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens that are elig ible? The new law allows unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens to remain as the immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen rather than being converted to a first preference category, when they reach age 21. This may mean a shorter waiting time for your son or daughter to i mmigrate to the United States. They remain eligible immediate rela tives and do not \"age out\" or have to wait for a visa to become available in another preference category to apply for an immigrant visa or adjust status in the U.S. since they are not subject to visa availability. Therefore, they are eligible to apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa almost immediately upon approval of an immigrant petition, even though they reached age 21. What are the eligibility requirements unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens must meet in order to qualify for the Child Status Protection Act? In order to qualify for this benefit as unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, The U.S. citizen petitioner must: Be a U.S. citizen prior to the child's 21st birthday and Have filed an immigrant petition on behalf of the son or daughter before the son or daughter turned 21. In addition, the son or daughter must: Have been under 21 at the time the immigrant visa was filed, Have met the definition of a child at the time the immigrant visa petition was filed, and Remai n unmarried throughout the visa process. Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 140 of 323 What benefit does the Child Status Protection Act have for the unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents who later become U.S. citizens? The unmarried son or daughter of a permanent resident who later becomes a U.S. citizen may now elect not to have their preference category converted from second preference to first preference. If the son or daughter elects to do this, he or she will maintain the second pref erence category of an unmarried son or daughter of a permanent resident as long as they remain unmarried. If the son or daughter elects to remain in the second preference category, he or she needs to submit a written request to the appropriate USCIS Service Center if he or she will be adjusting status in the U.S. If they will be adjusting status abroad, then the written request needs to be submitt ed to the National Visa Center. Why would the unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents who later become U.S. citizens elect not to have such a con version? When a permanent resident parent becomes a U.S. citizen after the unmarried son or daughter turns 21 years of age, the son or daughter would automatically become the unmarried son or daughter, over age 21, of a U.S. citizen. The category of the son or daughter woul d automat ically be converted from second preference to that of first preference, accordingly. This may mean a longer wait f or a visa to become available.

In order to obtain immigration benefits available to a \"spouse\", there must be a valid and subsisting marriage between the parties. Generally, marriage is valid for immigration purpose if it is recognized by the law of the state or the country where it occurred.

Furthermore, any marriage considered contrary to public policy is not recognized by USCIS. What is the definition of \"child\" under immigration law? Immigration law defines a \"child\" as a person who is: 1. Unmarried, AND 2. Under age 21, AND 3.

Therefore, if the child meets the definition of a child, step- child, or adopted child of the U.S. citizen under immigration law, it would be beneficial to the child if the U.S. citizen parent/step -parent files a Form I -130 on the child's behalf since then the immigrant visa w ould be immediately avai lable.

Back to: Helping a Relative Immigrate U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 229 of 323 What is the purpose of the Affidavit of S upport? The affidavit of support helps ensure that new immigrants will not need to rely on public benefits such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. If a person for whom you file an affidavit of support becomes a permanent resident and is later given certain public benefits, the agency that gave the benefits can require that you repay that money. Who has to have an Affidavit of S upport in order to immigrate? Anyone applying to become a permanent resident through a family member must have a sponsor. A sponsor is also required for a family member coming to work for a relative, or for a company in which a relative owns 5 percent or more of the company. The pers on filing the petition sponsoring the person's immigration must file an affidavit of support. If he/she does not, then his or her sponsorship is not complete, and the person will not be given permission to imm igrate based on that petition. What are the financial qualifications for an Affidavit of Support? The law requires a sponsor to prove an income level at or above 125% of the federal poverty level. (For active duty military personnel, the income requirement is 100% of the poverty level when sponsori ng his/her husband, wife or children.) If your income does not meet the requirement, your assets, such as checking and savings accounts, stocks, bonds, or property, may be considered in determining your financial ability. F ederal poverty levels are updated each year. You can check the current poverty guidelines by downloading Form I -864P, Poverty Guidelines, from www.uscis.gov . I filed the Immigrant Petition for my relative , but I do not meet the minimum income requirem ent. Can anyone else be a financial sponsor? If you do not meet the financial qualifications, the income of certain other household members can be added to your income level if they sign a contract on Form I -864A , Affidavit of Support Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member , agreeing to make their income and/or assets available for the support of the relative applying for permanent residence. If you still cannot meet the financial qualifications, another person must complete a separate Form I -864, Affidavit of Support , to become a joint financial sponsor of the person's immigration. The joint sponsor must meet all sponsorship requirements separately, including the minim um income requirements for his/her household, and must be willing to assume, along with you, financial liability for the sponsored immigrant(s). All spons ors must be United States citizens or permanent residents, be at least 18, and be living in the U.S. (including territories and possessions) when they file the affidavit of support. Back to: Financially Sponsering an Immigrating Alien U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 230 of 323 Someone has asked me to be a financial sponsor because they don't meet the minimum income requirement. What can I do? Anyone applying to be a permanent resident through a family member must have a sponsor. A sponsor is also required for a fam ily member coming to work for a relative, or for a company in which a relative owns 5 percent or more of the company. If the petit ioner does not meet the financial qualifications, the income of certain other household members can be added into the income level of the petitioner if that household member signs a contract on Form I -864A , Affidavit of Support Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member , agreeing to make their income and/or assets available for the support of the petitioner's relative applying for permanent residence. If the petitioner still cannot meet the financial qualifications, another person will need to complete a separate Form I -864, Affidavit of Support, to become a joint financial sponsor of the petitioner's relative. If you choose to become the joint sponsor, you must meet all sponsorship requirements separately, including the minimum incom e requirements for your household, and must be willing to assume, along with the petitioner, financial liability for the sponsored immigrant. All sponsors must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, be at least 18, and be living in the United States (including terr itories and possessions) when they file the affidavit of support. When and how do I file the Affidavit of Support? You do not need to file it with your petition. When the person reaches the head of the line to immigrate based on your I -130 petition (which of ten will be years after the petition was filed), he or she will have to submit the affidavit of support with an application for an immigr ant visa or permanent residence . The National Visa Center will contact you regarding the fee associated with the v isa application and document collection . Do I need to notify USCIS if I move? If you financially sponsor someone, you are legally required to keep USCIS informed of your address until your financial responsibility ends. If you change your address, you will need to file a Form I -865 , Sponsor's Notice of Change of Address , within 30 days after the date you move. Please read the instructions on the form carefully. What if a person I financially sponsor only gets publ ic benefits after becoming a permanent resident? If a sponsor does not provide basic support to the immigrants they sponsor, the sponsored immigrants, or the Federal or State agency that gave the benefits to the family members, can seek reimbursement of the funds through legal action against the sponsor. Back to: Financially Sponsering an Immigrating Alien U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 231 of 323 When does my financial responsibility end? An Affidavit of Support is enforceable against the sponsor until the person they sponsored either: Becomes a U.S. citizen; Is credited with 40 quarters of work in the U.S. (usually 10 years); Leaves the United States permanently; or Passes away. Shoul d I file Form I- 864 or Form I -134? What is the difference? If the beneficiary is seeking admission or adjustment as a permanent resident based on immediate relative status, is another family -based immigrant, or is seeking admission based on certain categories of employment -based immigration, Form I -864 is the appropriate form to file. Form I -134 may be used in any case where the beneficiary is inadmissible on public charge grounds but is not required to have an I -864 filed on his/her behalf. Do NOT use Form I -134 if the person you are sponsoring is required to have form I -864 instead. Please refer to the instructions of the primary petition and carefully follow them. The instructions will make clear which form needs to be filed.

There are two inter -country adoption processes: the Orphan process and the Hague Adoption Convention process. Both programs include measures to determine the suitability of prospective adoptive parents, such as background and criminal checks, as well as a home study. Once your eligibility to adopt has been established, both the Orphan process and the H ague Adoption Convention process have specific procedures to determine whether the child is eligible for immigration to the U.S. To view a list of the countries that participate in the Hague Adoption Convention, please visit www.travel.state.gov .

This program has extensive protections to protect the orphan. These include background and criminal checks of every adult in your household, as well as a home study. If you are married, you and your husband or wife must go through the immigr ation and adoption process together. But once eligibility is established, it also has special procedures that let the child come to the U.S. much quicker. We have a special manual to help you through this complex process. There are two d ifferent applications. One is the I-600, which is the basic orphan petition. The other is an I -600A advance processing petition. If you have not identified a child, the I -600A lets you pre- qualify, so that when you identify a child our review will only have to focus on the child's situation and eligibility as an orphan. The manual and instructions to these two form packages explain the process, and how to file, in greater detail. You can read and print the M- 249 manual and theI -600 and I -600A form packages from our website at www.uscis.gov . If you don't have web access at home or work, check with your public library.

If you are married, and a U.S. citizen, you may file a petition for a foreign national orphan if you and your spouse have ado pted or will adopt the orphan. If you are a U.S. citizen, but you are not married, you must be at least age 24 when you file a For m I-600A and at least age 25 at the time of filing Form I-600. If you are married, you and your spouse must go through the immigration and adoption process together. Every adult member of your household will have to be fingerprinted, and we will conduct background and criminal checks. There will also have to be a home study, just as if you were adopting a child who is already living in the U.S. How do I apply under the special orphan adoption program? We know that once you identify an orphan you want t o get the process completed as soon as possible. Speed is important for both you and the orphan. However, a full review of eligibility, and of your fitness to adopt a child, is equally import ant to the orphan's welfare. To best balance these needs, we of fer you a choice of how to apply. If the child has not yet been identified , you can obtain a determination that you are suitable to be the adoptive parents of a foreign national orphan early so that you don't have to start from the beginning once a child is identified. Getting your home study completed, preparing the application, background and criminal checks , and our review of your eligibility are often the things that take the most time. Step one is filing a preliminary Form I -600A application for advance processing of orphan petition. The Form I -600A focuses on your qualifications, and, if you are married, those of your husband or wife. If you file the Form I -600A, with the hom e study and other required evidence, USCIS approval of your Form I-600A will mean that your suitability as an adoptive parent has already been established before an orphan is identified for you. When that happens , you take the second step, which is to file the Form I -600 orphan petition. But with your Form I -600A already approved, our review here will focus on the child's situation and eligibility as an orphan. Once we a pprove the Form I -600, we will notify the U.S. Consulate/Embassy so it can issue a visa to the child so s/he can come to the U.S. If you plan to travel abroad to find the orphan you wish to adopt, we strongly recommend you file your Form I - 600A and wait for it to be approved before you travel. Your second option is to wait until a child is identified for you. This sounds simpler because you only file the Form I -600, and do everything in one step. However, that means the procedures that often take the m ost time, such as the home study, background and criminal checks, and our review, will be done while the child waits overseas. Once we approve the Form I -600, we will notify the U.S. Consulate/ Embassy so it can issue a visa so the child can come to the U .S. What is an \"adoption service provider ?\" An \"adoption service provider\" can be an individual or an organization that must be authorized to provide adoption services i n connection with a non- Hague country. Effective July 14, 2014, any adoption service provider must be accredited or approved, or be a supervised or exempted provider in compliance with the Intercountry Adoption Act. For more information about the Intercountry Adoption Act, please see the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov . Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 246 of 323 What is the overall process for Orphan adoptions ? Generally speaking, the process is as follows: 1) The prospective adoptive parent(s) (PAPs) choose an adoption service provider (ASP); 2) The PAPs obtain a home study; 3) The PAPs apply to USCIS by filing Form I -600A, Application for Advance Processing of Orphan Petition, for a determinat ion of suitability and eligibility as adoptive parents which includes a review of the home study and background checks on all adult household member s; 4) The PAPs work with the ASP to be matched with a child; 5) The PAPs obtain an adoption decree or legal custody through the laws of the child's country of origin; 6) The PAPs petition USCIS by filing Form I -600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative, for a determination of the child's eligibility to immigrate, which includes a determination as to whether the child meets the legal definition of \"Orphan\"; 7) The PAPs apply to the U.S. Department of State for an immigrant visa for the child; and 8) The PAPs bring the child to the U.S. and the child is admitted. How old can an orphan, be and still be eligi ble under this program? In an orphan case, you must file your visa petition before the child's 16th birthday. The only exception to this is if the child being adopted is the birth brother or sister of a child who has already been adopted, or is in the process of being adopted or is soon be adopted. In this case, the visa petition for the birth sibling must be filed before the birth sibling's 18th birthday. A petition that was filed after the child's 16th birthday (or 18th birthday for a birth sibling) w ill be considered timely filed only if: both of these requirements are met: 1) The petitioner filed a Form I -600A that itself was filed after the child's 15th birthday but before the child's 16th birthday (or, if applicable, after the child's 17th birthday but before the child's 18th) birthday); AND 2) The Form I -600 is filed not more than 180 days after initial approval of the Form I -600A . What happens after the Form I -600 orphan petition is approved? Once the Form I -600 is approved, we will not ify the U.S. Consulate/Embassy . You can then apply for the proper visa so the child can enter the U.S. If you adopted the child abroad, and you (and your spouse, if you are married) saw the child before or during the adoption proceedin g, your child will receive an \"IR-3\" visa. If you have not yet adopted the child, and will do so in the United States, the child will receive an IR -4 visa. Once your child obtains an immigrant visa, you can bring your child to the United States for admission as an immigrant. Under section 320 of the Act, an orphan becomes a citizen if all of these requirements are met before the orphan's 18th birthday: (1) At least one parent of the child is a citizen of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization. (2) The child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence. Generally, an IR -3 orphan who is admitted before the age of 18 becomes a citizen upon admission, because all of the adoption requirements are met. An IR-4 orphan generally becomes a citizen under section 320 only if the child is adopted after admiss ion, and before the age of 18. Back to: Understanding the Immigrati on Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 247 of 323 How can a child I adopted outside the special orphan adoption program become a U.S. citizen? The \"orphan\" program, as its name indicates, applies only to adopted children who qualify as orphans, as defined under U.S. i mmigration law. A separate provision, section 101(b)(1)(E), applies to other adopted children. In a case under this provision, yo u must adopt the child before the child's 16th birthday (or 18th birthday, for birth siblings of other adopted children). And your child will not be eligible to immigrate until you have had legal custody of the child, and have lived with the child, for at least two years. However; once your adopted child qualifies as your child for immigration purposes, you can file a Form I -130 relative petition. If a child adopted under section 101(b)(1)(E) meets the requirements of section 320 before the child's 18th birthday, the adopted child will automatically become a U.S. citizen . If the child does not meet these requirements before turning 18, he/she can choose to apply for naturalization after he/she reaches 18 and has been a perm anent resident for five years . For more information, please see our guide , How do I immigrate an adopted or prospective adopted child or help my adopted child become a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resid ent? It is available on our website at www. uscis.gov . Many state and local government social service agencies also provide information and assistance for anyone interested in adopting a child. How long will it take USCIS to process the adoption petitions once they are properly filed ? The amount of time it takes to complete an intercountry adoption varies greatly by country, based on each country's adoption process and how many foreigners wish to adopt from a certain country. The target processing times for USCIS paperwork are as follows: Form I -600A, Application for Advance Processing of Orphan Petition, approximately 75 days; and Form I -600, Petition for Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative, approximately 75 da ys.

Why isn't the U.S. government acting quickly to bring Haitian orphans to the U.S.? The U.S. government is working with the Government of Haiti and the international communi ty to address the needs of all Haitians, especially the needs of vulnerable children. Before children can be offered for adoption, it must be clear that the child is indeed an orphan. Any process for adopting Haitian orphans must be consistent with both Haitian and American law, and must ensure that the children ar e truly eligible for adoption. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 248 of 323 I've heard about humanitarian parole. What does that mean? Humanitarian parole is an extraordinary discretionary authority that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security may employ in t his instance to bring children who are pending adoption to the United States to be united with their adoptive parents. When the children enter the country with humanitarian parole, they will then need to regularize their immigration status after arrival by completing the final adoption formalities. At this ti me, humanitari an parole is only available to children who had adoption cases pending before the earthquake.

We know that once you identify an orphan you want to get the process completed as soon as possible. Speed is important for both you and the orphan. Howeve r, a full review of eligibility and of your fitness to adopt an orphan is equally import ant to the orphan's welfare. Step one is filing a preliminary Form I -600A orphan petition. The Form I -600A focuses on your qualifications, and, if you are married, those of your husband or wife. If you obtain approval of a Form I -600A before an orphan is identified for you, you will be ready when an orphan is identified for you. When that happens, you take the second step, which is to file the Form I -600 orphan petition. If you are under age 25 and not married, but at least age 24, you MUST file Form I-600A in order to proceed with the orphan adoption program. Your second option is to wait until a n orphan is identified for you. This sounds simpler because you only file the Form I -600 and do everything in one step. However, that means the procedures that often take the most time, such as the home study, background and criminal checks, and our review , will be done while the orphan waits overseas. Once we approve the Form I-600, we will notify the U.S. Consulate/ E mbassy so i t can issue a visa for the orphan to come to the U.S. The USCIS webpage that explains the process of adopting orphans from abroad Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 266 of 323 By law, the orphan adoption program requires that you be at least 24 years old at the time you file the advanced processing application, Form I -600A , and at least 25 years old at the time y ou file the orphan petition, For m I-600.

The Convention is a multi -national treaty that provides uniform standards for inter -count ry adoptions and establishes international procedures and safeguards to protect the best interests of children, birth parents, and adoptive parents who are involved in inter -country adoptions. The Hague Adoption Convention affects several aspects of the a doption and immigration process. First, each country that has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention must have an officially designated \"Central Authority\" to ensure that the adoption process is safeguarded. In the U.S., the Central Authority is the U.S. Department of State. Second, in a Hague Convention adoption, prospective adoptive parent(s) must use the services of an authorized \"adoption service provider\". Third, USCIS has introduced two new forms for this program. Interest ed parties must submit F orm I - 800A to USCIS in order to establish their eligibility and suitability as prospective adoptive parents under the Hague Adoptio n Convention. If USCIS approves Form I -800A, then the prospective adoptive parents must submit Form I -800 to USCIS in order to determine the child's eligibility as a Convention adoptee.

Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Servic es Services for U.S. Citizens Page 276 of 323 What is the Hague Adoption Convention? The Hague Adoption Convention is an international treaty. The Convention provides uniform standards for adoptions between countries that have a treaty relationship under the Convention. The Convention establishes international procedures and safeguards to protect the best interests of the children, birth parents, and adoptive parents involved in adoptions between Convention countries. When does the Conventio n become effective for the United States? The Convention became effective for the U.S. on April 1, 2008. Does the Convention apply to all intercountry adoptions? For USCIS purposes, the Convention applies only if a child who is a habitual resident in one Convention country is going to i mmigrate to the United States as a result of an adoption by a U.S. citizen habitually residing in the United States. What is a Convention country? A Convention country is any country that is a party to the Hague Adoption Convention, unless the U.S. Department of St ate has determined that the Convention is not in force between the United States and that other country. A list of countries that are currently parties to the Convention can be seen at the following Department of State website . What is a \"Central Authority? \" Each country that is a party to the Convention has an officially designated \"Central Authority.\" The Central Authority in eac h country ensures t hat the Convention adoption process is followed and provides one authoritative source of information and point of contact. In the U. S., the Central Authority is the Department of State. USCIS has been delegated Central Authority functions to adjudicate H ague adoption applications and petitions. Information about the Central Authority for each Convention country is available at the \"Intercountry Adoption\" page at www.hcch.net . Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 277 of 323 What is an \"adoption service provider ?\" An \"adoption service provider\" can be an individual or an organizat ion that must be authorized to provide adoption services in connection with a Convention adoption. The adoption service provider must be accredited or approved or otherwise authorized under Department of State regulations. The Department of State maintai ns a list of authorized adoption service providers on its website at www.travel.state.gov What forms need to be filed with USCIS for a Convention adoption? As part of the Convention adoption process, two new USCIS forms have been introduced: Form I -800A , Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country , and Form I -800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative. Please follow the instructions to the forms. A prospective adoptive parent files Form I -800A to start the immigration process when the prospective adopti ve parent is a U.S. citizen who intends to adopt a child who resides in a Convention country. Form I -800A and supporting documentation are filed with USCIS to determine the eligibility and suitability of the prospective adoptive parent(s) to adopt a Conve ntion adoptee. After approval of Form I -800A and after an adoption placement has been proposed, the prospective adoptive parent files Form I -800. Form I -800 and supporting documentation are filed with USCIS to determine the eligibility of a specific chil d for a Convention adoption. How long will it take USCIS to process the adoption petitions once they are properly filed ? The amount of time it takes to complete an intercountry adoption varies greatly by country, based on each country's adoption process and how many foriegners wish to adopt from a certain country. The target processing times for USCIS paperwork are as follows: Form I -800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country, approximately 90 days; Form I-800A, Supplement 3, Request for Action on Approved Form I -800A, approximately 30 days; and Form I -800, Petition for Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, approximately 30 days. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 278 of 323 How will this new Convention adoption procedure be different from the current orphan adoption process? There are some similarities between the way Convent ion adoptions and orphan adoptions are processed. Both involve t wo basic determinations: 1) whether the U.S. citizen and spouse (if married) are suitable as adoptive parents, and 2) whether the child's adoption meets the eligibility requirements in order for the child to immigrate to the U.S. In an orphan adoption case, it is possible for the parents to adopt the child before USCI S makes either of these determinations. By contrast, in a Convention adoption case: USCIS must determine that the parents are eligible and suitable as adoptive parents before the Central Authority in the other country proposes the placement of a child with the prospective adoptive parent(s) for adoption. The Central Authority of the child's country must determine that intercount ry adoption is in the child's best interest, and that any necessary consents have been freely given. The Department of State as the U.S. Central Authority must certify, before the adoption can take place, that: 1) the parents have been found eligible and s uitable as adoptive parent(s), 2) certain counseling requirements have been met and 3) the child is able to permanently reside in the U.S. In a Convention adoption, prospective adoptive parent(s) must use the services of an authorized \"adoption service pr ovider.\" As part of the Convention adoption process, two new USCIS forms have been introduced: Form I -800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country , and Form I -800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative. Under the Hague Adoption Convention, an adoption may not be completed unless both countries agree that the adoption should take place and that the child will be able to immigrate to the U.S. What is the overall adoption process und er the Hague Adoption Convention? Generally speaking, the process is as follows: 1. The prospective adoptive parent(s) file Form I -800A with supporting documentation with USCIS, including a Home St udy, which has been recommended by an authorized adoption service provider. 2. Once Form I -800A is approved, the adoption service provider forwards the approval and same home study to the Central Authority of the chi ld's country. 3. The Central Authority of the child's c ountry, upon acceptance of the prospective adoptive parent(s), proposes a placement of a child for adoption. The Central Authority then sends a complete report on the child to the prospective adoptive parents. 4. The prospective adoptive parents file Form I -800 with supporting documentation to USCIS. 5. Form I -800 is \"provisionally approved\" if the child appears eligible as a Convention adoptee. 6. Once the U.S. Central Authority (Department of State) reviews the child's visa application and notifies the child's country that the adoption may proceed, the prospective adoptive parent(s) may then complete the adoption or obtain custody of the child in the child's country. 7. The adoptive parents (or someone working on their behalf) and the child attend the visa application interview at the Department of State consulate abroad with the adoption or custody order. 8. The Department of State issues the \"Hague Adoption/Custody Certificate\" and grants the final approval of Form I -800 and the visa application for the child to come t o the U.S. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 279 of 323 How can I get more information about Convention adoptions?

Also, please visit our adoption web page at www.uscis.gov/adoption . If I have already filed Form I -600A or Form I -600 with USCIS for an intercountry adoption, do the new Convention adoption rules apply to my case? If you filed Form I -600A or Form I -600 with U SCIS before April 1, 2008, the new Convention adoption rules do not apply to your case, provided the laws of the child's country allow for continuation under U.S. orphan regulations. However, some Convention countries may require processing under Hague Adoption Convention rules regardless of when the processing with USCIS was initiated. If I adopted a chil d before April 1, 2008, but have not filed Form I -600A or Form I -600, do the new Convention adoption rules apply to my case? No. Full and final adoptions completed before April 1, 2008 are not Convention adoptions. Therefore, parents who adopted a c hild before April 1, 2008, are still eligible to file under the orphan process, even if they did not file a Form I -600A or Form I -600 prior to April 1, 2008. For information on this process, click here. What happens if I am seeking to adopt a child from a non -Convention country? If the child to be adopted is from a non- Convention country, the Convention adoption process does not apply. Instead, you will follow the intercountry adoption process under existing orphan regulations. Information on the Orphan adoption process I obtained temporary or legal custody of a child in a Convention country before April 1, 2008 and I plan to adopt the child o n or after April 1, 2008. May I still seek a Convention adoption? The Hague Adoption Convention and the USCIS Hague interim Rule apply to any adoption, on or after April 1, 2008, of a child from a Convention country unless a Form I -600A or Form I -600 was filed before April 1, 2008. However, the Hague interim rule requires denial of a Form I -800 (Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative) if the prospective adoptive parents adopted the child, or acquired custody for purposes of adoption, before the provisional approval of the Form I -800. This provision, however, was not in force before April 1, 2008. Therefore, a prospective adoptive parent who obtained custody before this date would not have been under any obligat ion to defer the acquisition of custody. If it can be established that the prospective adoptive parents obtained custody for purposes of adoption before April 1, 2008, USCIS will not deny the Form I -800 based solely on the basis of legal custody which was obtained before a Form I -800 had been provisionally approved, since the Hague Convention was not in force at the time of the grant of custody. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 280 of 323 I obtained legal custody of a child in a Convention country after April 1, 2008, but before the provisional approval of Form I -800. May I still seek a Convention adoption? The Hague Adoption Convention and USCIS Hague interim rule provides that a Form I -800 cannot generally be provisionally approved if the prospective adoptive parents adopted a child or obtained custody for purposes of emigration and adoption before the prov isional approval of a Form I -800. In these circumstances, for prospective adoptive parents to file Form I -800 and be eligible for a provisional approval, they will typically need to show that a legal custody order was voided, vacated, annulled, or otherwi se terminated. The Form I -800 may generally be approved only if a new adoption or custody order is granted after the first custody order was voided, annulled, or otherwise terminated, and after USCIS has provisionally approved Form I -800. I adopted or ob tained custody of a child after April 1, 2008, but before the provisional approval of Form I -800, and I cannot void or vacate the adoption or custody order. May I still seek a Convention adoption? The prospective adoptive parent should make every effort, under the law of the sending country, to have the premature adoption or custody order voided, vacated, annulled, or otherwise terminated, before filing the Form I -800. If the prospective adoptive parent presents evidence from the Central Authority of the country of the child's habitual residence establishing that the law of that country does not permit the adoption to be voided , vacated, annulled, or otherwise terminated, USCIS will notify the prospective adoptive parent of any additional evidence that ma y need to be presented in order to support provisional approval of the Form I -800. Prospective adoptive parents should keep in mind that, in at least some cases, adopting the child before provisional approval of the Form I -800 may require USCIS to determi ne that the adoption does not comply with the Convention and, consequently, cannot be the basis for approval of a Form I -800. Adopting or obtaining custody of a child before provisional approval of a Form I -800 is not consistent with the principles of the Hague Adoption Convention, and may complicate the adjudication of the child's Form I -800. The child's eligibility to immigrate to the prospective adoptive parent's country should be resolved before completion of the proposed adoption. This minimizes the risk that a child will not be able to join his or her prospective adoptive family in their home country. As clearly stated in the instructions to Forms I -800A and Form I -800, prospective adoptive parents are cautioned not to accept a proposed adoption pl acement, or complete an adoption that is subject to the Convention, until after USCIS has provisionally approved Form I -800 and the Department of State has issued the article 5 notice. Back to: Understanding the I mmigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 281 of 323 May I foster a child from a Convention country prior to the approval of Form I -800A? Typically, accepting a foster care arrangement before completing the Convention adoption process would not be consistent with the general purpose of the Convention, which promotes placing the child in the care of prospective adoptive parents only if both the sending country and the receiving country have determined that an intercountr y adoption is permitted. Whether a foster care arrangement would actually be contrary to the Hague Adoption Convention and regulations, however, will have to be reviewed on a case- by-case basis. Note that, even if a foster care arrangement is not \"custod y for purposes of emigration and adopti on,\" the steps taken to obtain a foster care arrangement may well involve \"contact\" with the child's birth parent(s) or other caregiver. The Convention restricts the ability to have contact with the birth parent(s) or other caregivers. USCIS strongly recommends that prospective adoptive parent(s) apply for intercountry adoption through the Hague Adoption Conv ention process by using Forms I -800A and I -800, and obtaining approval of their Form I -800A, and a provision al approval of their Form I -800, before assuming responsibility for providing foster care for a child. Carefully following the Hague Adoption Convention process serves the child's best interest by ensuring that all of the steps designed for protection of t he child are completed before placement. If there is an emergency that appears to warrant taking responsibility for a child before the filing and approval of Forms I -800A and I -800, the prospective adoptive parent(s) should work through the Central Authority of the sending country to arrange foster care, to ensure that any contact with the child, the birth parent(s), or other caregivers that occurs in this process, is permissible under the Hague Adoption Convention and the USCIS Hague interim rule. May a prospective adoptive parent with an approved (grandfathered) Form I -600A indicating that they intend to adopt from a non -Convention country change to a Convention country and still continue an orphan adoption ? Yes. The Hague interim rule allows prospective adoptive parent(s) who filed an I -600A or I -600 prior to April 1, 2008, to be grandfathered under U.S. law. Included in this grandfathering provision is the ability for a prospective adoptive parent to change his/her Form I -600A approval from a non- Convent ion country to a Convention country, as long as the Form I -600A was filed prior to April 1, 2008, and continues to be valid at the time the request for change of overseas site notification is submitted. For a prospective adoptive parent who f iled Form I -600A before April 1, 2008, but did not designate a specific country at the time of filing Form I -600A, he/she may designate a Convention country at a later time. Note : It is important that families who filed an I -600A prior to April 1, 2008 and desire to change to a Convention country understand that while their case is grandfathered under U.S. law, this does not mean that the other Convention country must permit the adoption to take place under U.S. orphan regulations. The other country coul d require that the case proceed as a Hague adoption, which would require the filing of Forms I -800A and I -800. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citiz en Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 282 of 323 May a prospective adoptive parent with an approved Form I -600A who filed after April 1, 2008 indicating that they intend to adopt from a non - Convention country, change to a Convention country and still continue with an orphan adoption? No. A prospective adoptive parent with an approved I -600A, who filed after April 1, 2008 indicating that they i ntend to adopt from a non- Convention country may not change to a Convention country. If the prospective adoptive par ent wants to adopt from a C onvention country, forms I -800A and I -800 must be filed. My Form I -600A was filed before April 1, 2008. Is it possible to extend the I -600A approval? Yes. An approved I -600A is valid for 18 months. A prospective adoptive parent may request a one- time, no-charge extension of your I -600A. To request this extension, submit a request in writing for an extension of your approved I -600A to the USCIS office that approved your I -600A. There is no specific form to fill out - simply submit a written request for a one- time, no- charge extension of your valid, approved Form I -600A. An updated or amended home study must accompany this request. Apply prior to 90 days before the expiration of the I -600A. If your request for extension is approved, your I -600A approv al will be extended 18 months from the expiration date of the original I -600A. After this one- time, no charge extension, it is also possible to file a new Form I -600A before the one- time extension expires. A prospective adoptive parent who has filed Form I-600A before April 1, 2008, and who has received the one- time, no charge extension, may file one additional Form I -600A and continue to proceed with their intercountry adoption through the orphan process. The new Form I -600A must be filed before the cur rent approval expires and only if the prospective adoptive parent has not yet filed the corresponding Form I -600. If Form I -600A is no longer valid, the prospective adoptive parent must file Form I -800A. If my request for an extension of Form I -600A appr oval is granted, what will be the start date of the new extension? The new approval will be effective as of the expiration date of the original approval, rather than the date of the decision t o extend the approval. For example, if the original approval expired January 1, 2008, the extens ion will expire July 1, 2009. What will the immigrant visa classification be for Convention Adoptees? Upon final approval of the I -800 petition, a child may be issued an IH -3, IH -4, or B-2 visa. An IH -3 is a Convention Child adopted abroad and who automatically acquires U.S. citizenship upon entry to the U.S. An IH -4 is a Convention Child coming to be adopted in the U.S. IH -4 children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship, but are lawful permanent resi dents until the adoption is full and final. If the child will be residing with the cit izen parent s abroad, rather than in the United States, the child may obtain a B-2 nonimmigrant visa. Upon admission as a B -2 temporary visitor for pleasure, the child m ay obtain naturalization under Section 322 of the Act and then r eturn abroad with the parents. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 283 of 323 Will USCIS provide me with documentation of my child's citizenship (IH -3)? Yes. The USCIS Buffalo office reviews all IH -3 admissions. If USCIS Buffalo finds that the requirements of section 320 were met when the child was admitted, USCIS will issue a Cer tificate of Citizenship within 45 days of receipt of the visa packet. If the requirements of section 320 were not met (for example, the child was admitted after his or her 18th birthday ), the child will receive a permanent resident card. Will USCIS provi de me with proof of my child's lawful permanent resident status (IH -4)? Yes. USCIS will issue a lawful permanent resident card, Form I -551 within days of receipt of the visa packet. Which USCIS office adjudicates and approves Forms I -800A and I -800? The National Benefits Center ( NBC ) is the only USCIS office that fully adjudicates forms I -800A and I -800 to completion. How long does it take for a USCIS field office to send Forms I -800A, I -800, and other required documents to NBC? You must file Form I -800A and Form I -800 as specified on the Forms instructions. USCIS field offices will return to the petitioner or application any Form I - 800A or I -800 received after October 27, 2008. Are Forms I -800A being forwarded from NBC to the N ational Visa Center (NVC), or are I -800As going directly from NBC to an overseas Embassy/Consulate? Approved I -800A applications are sent from the NBC to the NVC. What is the NBC's timeframe for processing Form I -800A applications? Cases are targeted for completion within 90 days of receipt. Cases that are properly filed and submitted with complete home studies may be process ed without delay. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 284 of 323 What is the NBC's intended timeframe for processing Form I-800 petitions? All cases are targeted for completion within 90 days of receipt. Cases that are properly filed and submitted with a complete Hague Convention Article 16 report on the child may be processed without delay. What is the procedure for expeditious processing of special needs children? At this time, a significant majority of all pending cases are for special needs children. While there is no procedure for expeditious processing, all cases are targeted for completion within 90 days of receipt. Cases that are properly filed and submitted with complete home studies may be processed without delay. If the home study agency/preparer is conducting two home studies at the same time, does this have to be stated in the home study? Yes. In this situation we may consider the additional home study as a prior home study. Consistent with regulatory requirements the home study preparer should: 1) Identify the agency involved in each prior or terminated home study 2) State when the prior home study process began 3) Include the date the prior home study was completed 4) Explain whether the prior home study recommended for or against finding the applicant or additional adult member of the household suitable for adoption, foster care, or other custodial care of a child. If a prior home study was terminated without completion, the current home study must indicate when the prior home study began, the date of termi nation, and the reason for the termination. If the other home study has not yet been completed, please note that in the home study. If I receive a raise at work, am I required to submit a home study amendment? No. However, if your income decreases a home study amendment is required. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 285 of 323 How much time can lapse between the visit to the home and the completion of the home study? At least one home visit must be completed during the course of the home study process. The home study must not be more than 6 months old at the time it is submitted to USCIS. There is no requirement regarding the timeliness of when, during the home study proc ess, the home visit must occur. What if the home study preparer is not able to determine whether a foreign country has a child abuse registry ? The process ensures that USCIS has access to any readily available evidence that may relate to the applicant's suitability as an adoptive parent. There is no obligation, of course, to provide information that simply is not available. If a country does not have a child abus e registry, it is enough for the home study preparer to make this fact clear in the home study. USCIS has sought to determine which countries, other than the United States, maintain \"child abuse registries\" . As this information becomes available with respect to a particular country, USCIS will make the information available. Until such time as USCIS is able to verify that a particular country does have such a child abuse registry, USCIS will find that a home study complies with the regulation if the home study preparer states in the home study that the home study preparer has consulted the Central Authority of the foreign country (if i t is a Convention country) or other competent authority (for a count ry that is not a Convention country) and has determined, based on this consultation, that the foreign country does not have a child abuse registry. Are home study preparers required to list each state in which a child abuse registry was checked, or should the documented ch ecks be included in the home study? The home study preparer must ensure that a check of the applicant and of each additional adult household member has been made with available child abuse registries in any State or foreign country that the applicant, or any additional adult member of the household, has resided in since that person's 18th birthday. The home study must include results of the checks conducted, including when no record was found to exist, that the State or foreign country will not release information to the home study preparer or anyone in the household, or that the State or foreign country does not have a child abuse registry. Regarding the definition of an \"adult member of the household\", when must a home study preparer include an assessment of a ho usehold member who has not yet reached his or her 18th birthday or an assessment of someo ne who does not actually live in the home but whose presence is relevant to the issue of suitability to adopt? The home study preparer is not required to include an assessment of these persons as an adult member of the household unless USCIS specifically asks the home study preparer to do so. As a matter of practice, the home study preparer needs only to assess the prospective adoptive parents and any other adult members of the household unless USCIS asks f or this additional evaluation. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 286 of 323 If a child from a Convention country is already in the U.S., can the child be deemed to be \"habitually resident\" in the U.S. so that the child can be adopted without complying with the Convention and USCIS interim rule? A child who is present in the United States, but whose habitual residence was in a Con vention country other than the United States immediately before the child came to the United States, is still deemed to be habitua lly resident in the other Convention country for purposes of the filing and approval of a visa petition based on the child's adoption by a citizen who is habitually resident in the United States. Thus, USCIS will presume that the child's adoption and immigration are governed by the Convention . Since a child is still deemed to be habitua lly resident in the other Convention count ry, a U.S. citizen who is habitually resident in the United States and who want s to adopt a child from a Convention country must, gener ally, follow the Convention adoption process, even if the child is already in the United States. Form s I-800A and I-800 can be filed, even if the child is in the United States , if the other Convention country is willing to complete the Convention adoption process with respect to the child. USCIS regulations provide the principles for determining whether the child is habitually resident in a country other than the country of citizenship. This regulation does not explicitly apply to children in the United States, but USCIS has determined that it can be interpreted to perm it a finding that a child who is presumed to be habit ually resident in another Convention country can be found to no longer be habitually resident in that country, but to be habitually resident, now, in the United States. USCIS will determine that regulations no longer preclude approval of a Form I -130 if the adoption order that is submitted with the Form I -130 expressly states that the Central Authority of the other Convention country has filed with the court a written statement indicating that the Central Authority is aware of the child's presence in the Un ited States, and of the proposed adoption, and that the Central Authority has determined that the child is not habitually resident in that country. A copy of the written statement from the Central Authority must also be submitted with the Form I-130 and t he adoption order. If the adoption order shows that the Central Authority of the other Convention country had determined that the child was no longer habitual ly resident in that other Convention country, USCIS will accept that determination and, if all the other requirements are met, the Form I -130 may be approved. What is a \" grandfathered \" Form I -600A? Department of Homeland Security regulations allow only one extension of the approval of a Form I -600A. If that extension is also scheduled to expire, the only alternative is to file a new Form I -600A, with a new filing fee. Generally, a Form I -600A may not be filed after April 1, 2008, for the adoption of a child from a Hague Convention country. However, a case may continue as an orphan case if a Form I-600A was filed before April 1, 2008. USCIS interprets this provision as permitting prospective adoptive parents whose Form I -600A approval is still in effect, but is about to expire, to file a new Form I -600A, as long as they file the new Form I -600A before the current approval expires. A new Form I -600A that is filed after April 1, 2008, will be considered grandfathered only if the following criteria apply: the new Form I -600A is filed before expiration of a previous period of approval of the extensi on of Form I -600A; AND the previous extension of approval of Form I -600A, that is about to expire was for a Form I -600A which itself was filed before April 1, 2008; AND no Form I -600 has been filed on the bas is of the previous Form I -600A. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 287 of 323 When can I file my \" grandfathered \" Form I -600A? USCIS must receive the properly filed application no more t han 90 days before the expiration date of the approval of the one- time, no fee \"extension\" of the original, approved Form I -600A, but before the approval expires. For example, if the \"extension\" approval is valid until December 31, a grandfathered applicat ion may be filed from October 2 until December 31. If the application is filed after December 31, a Form I -800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country , must be filed and the case must be processed through the Hague Adoption Convention procedures. What does \"properly filed\" mean? The term \"properly filed\" means that the application is submitted to USCIS with the proper signature(s) and fee(s) as required by the instructions of the Form I -600A. At the tim e of filing, the applicant must also submit all required documentation, and evidence that his/her application meets the requirements for grandfathering an application. It is also necessary for the applicant to submit a written statement, signed under penal ty of perjury, attesting that a Form I -600 has not been filed on the application. Where original approval of Form I -600A (filed prior to April 1, 2008) has been issued for more than one child, the prospective adoptive parent would attest that the corresponding number of Form s I-600 had not yet been filed. What about filing the home study? A home study may be submitted up to one year after the date of the filing of a Form I -600A. No action can be taken on a Form I -600A, however, until the home study is f iled. If the applicant does not file a home study with the new Form I -600A, the new Form I -600A will still be grandfathered, if the applicant files the new Form I -600A before the approval of the prior Form I -600A expires. The new Form I -600A will not be a pproved, however, until after USCIS has received and reviewed the home study. To avoid delays, the applicant should always submit the new home study with the new Form I -600A. The applicant may, of course, submit a copy of the original home study, so long as it has been updated or amended so that it is current (not more than six months old) when it is submitted. When does the approval validity date start? Because the intent of grandfathering the Form I -600A is to maintain validity of an approval in order to continue a transitional case that is already in progress for an adoption, the validity period is not governed by when the home study is submitted to USC IS. The 18 month validity period will begin on the date of expiration of the approval of the original Form I -600A extension. Since the new 18- month approval period will extend from the date the earlier approval expired, and not from the date of the decisio n approving the new Form I-600A, applicants are encouraged to submit all the necessary evidence, including the home study, with the new Form I -600A. Even if the decision is delayed because the home study or other evidence has not yet been submitted, the a pproval period will still expire 18 months after the earlier approval period. For example, if a Form I -600A approval will expire on Nov. 30, 2008, and an applicant files a new Form I -600A on Sept. 30, 2008, but does not submit the home study until September 30, 2009, the new approval w ill still expire May 30, 2010. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 288 of 323 Where can I file a \"grandfathered\" Form I -600A? Grandfathered Forms I -600A are filed at the field office having jurisdiction over the applicant's current residence. If the applicant has moved to the jurisdiction of a new USCIS office since the approval of the extension of the original application, it is helpful if he/she notifies the previous office of the move. The two offices may then coordinate the transfer of any necessary information concerning the case. If I moved after approval of the Form I -600A and the extension is about to expire, where s hould I file the \"grandfathered\" Form I -600A? Grandfathered Forms I -600A are filed at the field office having jurisdiction over the applicant's current residence. If the field office jurisdict ion has changed, it is best to let the previous office know that there has been a change of address because this will save time consolidating the information from both offices. Can I use a Form I -600A approved for one child to apply for the adoption o f a second or third child? If the appr oval of the original I -600A was for more than one child, then a new Form I -600A will be \" grandfathered\" only for the total number of children for which the original Form I -600A was approved, minus the number of children for whom a Form I -600 has already be en filed. For example, if the original Form I-600A was approved for three children, and two Forms I -600 have been filed, the new Form I -600A will be grandfathered only for one additional child. If you ask to be approved for more children than the number approved with the original Form I -600A, and the request is granted, any additional children will have to be from non- Hague countries. The only exception to this limit is if the applicant seeks to adopt a birth sibling of a child who the applicant has alr eady adopted, and seeks to adopt the birth sibling at the same time as the adoption of a child whose Form I -600A is grandfathered. If a birth sibling is located after the total number of children on the grandfathered Forms I -600A have actually immigrated, the birth sibling's immigration would be governed by the Hague Adoption Convention. Does the new home study need to be compliant with the Hague Adoption Convention? No. Because the application is \" grandfathered\" into the Orphan Process, it is also \" grandfathered\" into all regulations relating to that process. This includes all parts of the Orphan Process. In other words, the home study should comply with the Orphan regulations which can be found in the Code of Feder al Regulations at 8 CFR 204.3. Will I be able to use a one -time, no fee extension on this \"grandfathered\" Form I -600A? Yes. To request an extension, prospective adoptive parent(s) must submit a written request to USCIS. The written request must explicitly request a one- time, no fee extens ion to the current approved Form I -600A. Applicants must also submit an amended/updated home study and any other supporting documentation of any changes in the household. The home study must also address any changes to answers submitted with the initial F orm I -600A and must say whether approval is still recommended. Back to: Understanding the Immigration Process When Adopting U.S. Citizen Services Services for U.S. Citizens Page 289 of 323 Can the number of childre n authorized increase when the \"grandfathered\" Form I -600A is filed? You may ask for and receive an increase of the number of children that you are approved for. As stated previously, however, the total number of adoptions to which \"grandfathering\" will apply cannot be increased after April 1, 2008. A new Form I -600A will be grandfathered only for the number of children specified in the original Form I -600A, minus the number of children for which a Form I -600 has already been filed. The only exception, as noted earlier, is for birth siblings who are adopted at the same time as a child whose case is grandfathered. For example, if you were approved for two children before April 1, 2008, and you are approved for five children under a new Form I -600A, and hav e not filed any Form I -600, the Form I -600A will be grandfathered for two children, but not grandfathered for the other three. The result is that you will be able to file up to two Forms I -600 for children from a Hague Convention country (plus any birth siblings adopted at the same time), but any additional Forms I -600 will have to be for children from a non-Hague Convention country. Does this policy affect the rules of other countries? No. This guidance pertains only to the United States transition case rules. It does not address what the country of the prospective adoptive child's origin may consider to be an appropriate application for its own intercountry adoption processes. Prospective adoptive parents remain subject to the requirements of the child's country of origin, should that country require that the intercountry adoption be completed under the Hague Adoption C onvention.

The first option is to use the fianc\u00e9 visa to bring your fianc\u00e9 to the U.S. The fianc\u00e9 visa is used if your fianc\u00e9(e) is currently overseas and you intend to get married in the U.S. This visa acts as a bridge to permanent residence for your fianc\u00e9(e) - it lets him or her enter the U.S. for 90 days so your marriage ceremony can take place here. Once you ar e married, s/he can apply for permanent residence and remain in the U.S. while we process an application for adjustment of status. If you choose this option, you will need to file a Form I -129F fianc\u00e9(e) petition. Form I -129F is available on our website at www.uscis.gov/forms. If you choose this option and if USCIS approves the I -129F, USCIS will send it to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate nearest your relative's foreign place of residence. The Consulate will th en invite your fianc\u00e9(e) to apply for the actual fianc\u00e9(e) visa. The second option is to file an immigrant petition, Form I -130, for your spouse after you have married each other overseas. If you choose this option, when the petition is approved your new husband or wife will be processed for an immigrant visa by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate, and will then enter the U.S. as a permanent resident.

Can I now sponsor my spouse for a family -based immigrant visa? Yes, you can file the petition. You may file a Form I -130 (and any applicable accompanying application). Your eligibility to petition for your spouse, and your spouse's admissibility as an immigrant at the immigration visa application or adjustment of status stage, will be determined according to applicable immigration law and will not be denied as a result of the same- sex nature of your marriage.

What should I do? USCIS will reopen those petitions or applications that were denied solely because of DOMA section 3. If such a case is known to us or brought to our attention, USCIS will reconsider its prior decision, as well as reopen associated applications to the extent they were also denied as a result of the denial of the Form I -130 (such as concurrently filed Forms I -485). Once your I -130 petition is reopened, it will be considered anew \u2014without regard to DOMA section 3 \u2014based upon the information previously submitted and any new information provided. USCIS will also concurrently reopen associated applications as may be necessary to the extent t hey also were denied as a result of the denial of the I -130 petition (such as concurrently filed Form I -485 applications). Additionally, if your work authorization was denied or revoked based upon the denial of the Form I -485, the denial or revocation will be concurrently reconsidered, and a new Employment Authorization Document issued, to the extent necessary. If a decision c annot be rendered immediately on a reopened adjustment of status application, USCIS will either (1) immediately process any pending or denied application for employment authorization or (2) reopen and approve any previously revoked application for employment authorization. If USCIS has already obtained the applicant's biometric information at an Application Support Center (ASC), a new Employment Authorization Document (EAD) will be produced and delivered without any further action by the applicant. In cases where USCIS has not yet obtained the required biometric information, the applicant will be scheduled for an ASC appointment. No fee will be required to request USCIS to consider reopening your petition or application pursuant to this procedure. In the a lternative to this procedure, you may file a new petition or application to the extent provided by law and according to the form instructions including pay ment of applicable fees as directed. What about immigration benefits other than for immediate relati ves, family -preference immigrants, and fianc\u00e9s or fianc\u00e9es? In cases where the immigration laws condition the benefit on the existence of a \"marriage\" or on one's status as a \"spouse,\" will same -sex marriages qualify as marriages for purposes of these ben efits? Yes. Under the U.S. immigration laws, eligibility for a wide range of benefits depends on the meanings of the terms \"marriage\" or \"spouse.\" Examples include (but are not limited to) an alien who seeks to qualify as a spouse accompanying or follow ing to join a family -sponsored immigrant, an employment - based immigrant, certain subcategories of nonimmigrants, or an alien who has been granted refugee status or asylum. In all of these cases, a same- sex marriage will be treated exactly the same as an opposite- sex marriage. If I am seeking admission under a program that requires me to be a \"child,\" a \"son or daughter,\" a \"parent,\" or a \"brother or sister\" of a U.S. citizen or of a lawful permanent resident alien, could a same -sex marriage affect my elig ibility ? There are some situations in which either the individual's own marriage, or that of his or her parents, can affect whether t he individual will qualify as a \"child,\" a \"son or daughter,\" a \"parent,\" or a \"brother or sister\" of a U.S. citizen or of a lawful permanent resident. In these cases, same- sex marriages will be treated exactly the same as opposite- sex marriages.

Yes. As a general matter, naturalization requires five years of residence in the United States following admission as a lawf ul permanent resident. But, according to the immigration laws, naturalization is available after a required residence period of three years, if during that three year period you have been living in \"marital union\" with a U.S. citizen \"spouse\" and your spouse has been a United States citizen. For this purpose, same- sex marriages will be treated exactly the same as opposite- sex marriages. I know that the immigration laws allow discretionary waivers of certain inadmissibility grounds under certain circumstance s. For some of those waivers, the person has to be the \"spouse\" or other family member of a U.S. citizen or of a lawful permanent resident. In ca ses where the required family relationship depends on whether the individual or the individual's parents meet the definition of \"spouse,\" will same -sex marriages count for that purpose ? Yes. Whenever the immigration laws condition eligibility for a waiver on the existence of a \"marriage\" or status as a \"spouse,\" same -sex marriages will be treated exactly the same as opposite- sex marriages.

The primary purpose of the passport is to facilitate travel t o foreign countries by establishing U.S. citizenship and acting as a vehicle to display any appropriate visas and/or entry/exit stamps that may be necessary. Passports are also very reliable documents that may be used within the United States to establish citizenship, identity, and employment authorization. NOTE: There are approximately 15 different versions of the U.S. passport that are presently valid and vary from the 1998 illustration above.
