The balance provides many resources which much of the player base relies on. These include beginner and advanced job guides, as well as compiling encounter resources mostly made by other people within the community. I lurk the encounter-general as well as several job-lounge chats and sometimes contribute if I know the answer to someone's question. I often ask questions too if I don't see my answer within the pins of the channels - usually early on after an encounter is released. (Mostly optimization related stuff). I can't help but notice but a few select terminally online \"mentors\" in that discord are often very aggressive and toxic in how they answer innocent questions. I understand that many people who play this game are raiding every single day/night when content releases and repetitive answers can get frustrating, but most people do not lurk in these discord channels all day. The majority of the users seeking information in the balance are sHC/casual, and they are often met with rude and elitist responses to their question. A common example I can think of is some people have a general question - \"hi I'm not sure why I'm dying to X\" and they are asked to link a log. Then these mentors tend to shit on people included in that log for unrelated issues regarding optimal gameplay. \"Lol ur scholar needs to learn how to heal\" \"unrelated but your rpr isn't pressing buttons\" stuff like that goes unchecked quite often. Anyway not sure of the exact purpose of this post, but I just wanted to point out that one of the most helpful communities of this game has an unchecked elitist/toxic aspect to it. "}
