I'd like to use this letter to send a huge shout-out to the people who bring this magazine to life. The team, many of whom have been involved since its inception over a decade ago, use their creativity, their skills and their devotion to produce a fabulous issue each time. Thank you! Together we produce one of the best HIV magazines anywhere. I trust you'll agree that this issue's cover, featuring cellist Robert Bardston from Medicine Hat, Alberta, is particularly powerful. Equally powerful is his story. Don't miss it. The inspiring stories continue with our profile of Doris Peltier and our feature article on three people with HIV who started their own successful businesses. All of this issue's contribu-tors break new ground and prove that people with HIV walk all the paths of life. The magazine continues with health pieces on thyroid problems, anxiety, intimacy, supplements, superfoods and screening tests for people over 50. And it all starts off with a snapshot of the epidemic that highlights how the virus is affecting people in different parts of the country, and how communities are responding to it. For me, this mix of articles reveals the resilience, divers- ity and creativity that live within Canada's HIV community. And I feel honoured and proud to be able to share those stories. CATIE is committed to ensuring that the voices of people with HIV\u2014the voices that are at the organization's origins and core\u2014are always heard and respected. Surveys of our readers consistently state that one of the things they like most about the magazine is that it provides a sense of connection to other people living with the virus. Your voices are truly at the heart of our success. So, I encourage you to check out Chatty CATIE (page 6) and Visual AIDS (page 30) to find out how you can con- tribute your story (or photo) to the magazine. We need YOU!

In Canada's westernmost province, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men ( MSM) comprise the greatest number of new HIV diagnoses fol- lowed by people who acquire HIV through heterosexual contact. BC is the only province in Canada to adopt a comprehensive \"treat-ment as prevention\" strategy, aimed at detecting HIV infections early, improving the lives of people living with HIV and preventing HIV trans- mission. Similar strategies have since been adopted in other jurisdic- tions around the world. In the Yukon, only one case was reported in 2012 (56 cases have been reported since the start of the epidemic). However, like others who live in the North, many people travel outside the territory for health ser - vices and may have been tested and diagnosed elsewhere. 4 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014 The Prairies (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) & Northwest Territories Due to the dramatic rise in the rate of HIV infections diagnosed since 2003, Saskatchewan now has the highest rate of new HIV infections in the coun- try. Its rate (17 per 100,000 people) is almost triple the national average (5.9). The epidemic affects Saskatch- ewan's Aboriginal people in dispro-portionate numbers: 81% of all newly diagnosed individuals are Aboriginal. And the vast majority of new infec- tions are associated with injection drug use. A quick glance at the num-bers can give us some sense of what's happening but it's the dedicated com- munity of people working in the field who really help to shine a light on the challenges and successes in this province. Saskatchwan's comprehen- sive HIV strategy, released in 2010, has made great strides in promoting awareness, increasing the availability of testing and improving the quality of life for people living with HIV. Neighbouring Manitoba has seen a steady increase in new HIV diag- noses with a decrease since 2010. Most services for people living with HIV have traditionally been situated in Winnipeg. To address this gap, the Manitoba HIV Program aims to ensure that everyone in the province is con-nected to the care they need, regard- less of where they live. In both Manitoba and Alberta, the main mode of transmission is heterosexual contact, followed by men having sex with men. Recent years have seen an expansion of Alberta's HIV services into rural and remote areas like Grand Prairie and Fort McMurray, to address the sharp population increases there driven by people from elsewhere in the country travelling to the Tar Sands for work. In the Northwest Territories, the rate of new infections is relatively low (2.3 per 100,000 people).FROM THE FRONT LINESWhat's happening across Canada A Snapshot of the Epidemic \"Know your epidemic, know your response.\" This UNAIDS rallying cry reflects the fact that there is not one single global HIV epidemic, but many, and that no one response will stop the spread of HIV. The same can be said for the epidemic in Canada: The number of people diagnosed each year and the communities most affected varies from region to region, as do frontline responses. So we've decided to take a snapshot of the HIV landscape across the country's provinces and territories.The Atlantic Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI, Newfoundland & Labrador) In Atlantic Canada, the main mode of HIV transmission is men having sex with men, followed by hetero-sexual contact. While the rate of new HIV diagnoses is low in these prov- inces compared to other parts of the country (0.5 in New Brunswick, 1.7 in PEI and Nova Scotia, and 1.8 in Newfoundland & Labrador), Atlan- tic Canada continues to face unique challenges. Many ASOs in the Atlantic provinces are so strapped for resour - ces that they are run by only a few part-time staff and volunteers, and services are, for many living with HIV (and people looking to get tested) hard to come by. Because a sizeable portion of people in these provinces lives in rural areas, accessing what resources do exist can be that much more difficult. For example, for people in PEI, the nearest HIV clinic is in Moncton, New Brunswick! 5 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEQuebec The rate of new HIV diagnoses in Quebec (5.6 per 100,000 people) is slightly below the national rate (of 5.9). MSM account for a large major - ity of diagnoses, followed by people from regions where HIV is endemic, such as countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. Recent years have been marked by the launch of innovative HIV testing programs in the province's urban centres. For example, in Montreal's gay village, ASOs now offer MSM the chance to get free HIV tests in a relaxed environment tailored to their needs. By reach- ing out to communities \"where they are,\" such initiatives allow people to get tested in a comfortable and fam-iliar environment, hence reducing their worries and the fear of judg- ment that can prevent people from connecting with services in the first place. Ontario & Nunavut In 2012, as in previous years, Ontario was home to the largest number of people diagnosed with HIV in Can- ada. Most of these infections were acquired through men having sex with men. The provincial rate of new diagnoses (6.2 per 100,000 people) was slightly higher than the national rate (5.9). Ontario is also one of the best serviced provinces in the coun- try for HIV. This does not mean, however, that everyone has easy access to the services they need. More remote communities, particu- larly in northern Ontario, remain underserved. (In fly-in commun-ities, HIV care is often provided by a single nurse.) In various parts of the province, AIDS service organiza- tions ( ASOs) geared to specific ethno- racial populations have emerged to offer culturally sensitive services and improve access to services. In Nunavut, only three cases of HIV have ever been reported, and none have been reported since 2006.Number of people diagnosed with HIV, 1985-2012 Rate of HIV diagnoses (per 100,000 people) in 2012 These bars represent the number of HIV diagnoses reported in each province and territory between 1985 and 2012. (This includes people living with HIV and people who have died since 1985.)These bars represent the number of people per 100,000 who tested positive for HIV in 2012.BC YukonAlberta Northwest TerritoriesSaskatchewanManitobaOntario Nunavut Quebec IRIS BUDD , 67 Guelph, Ontario HIV+: 8 years Volunteer at AIDS Committee of Guelph and Wellington County I am a firm believer in supple- ments and I know they work for me because of the positive effects they have on my overall health.

If I'm in a rush, I always make sure to take the multivitamin \u2014Centrum 50+. I also take glucosamine and calcium to protect my bones, as well as vitamin C (I use Ester-C). I carry a list on me at all times of all the meds and supplements I take. On the list I also have the names and contact info of all my doctors\u2014my family physician, my heart doctor and my other specialists. I keep the list in my wallet, so I don't have to remember the names of all the pills I take.

Interv Iews by ronn ILyn Pust IL7 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEI'm used to writing notes to myself so I don't forget things. I also always have some pills and vitamins on me when I go out, no matter where I am. RON ROSENES , 66 Toronto HIV+: 32 years Independent consultant for ASO s I take K-Pax , a very potent multivita- min. I first heard about it five years ago when Dr. Jon Kaiser came to Toronto to talk about this formulation that he had created specifically for people with HIV and other immune deficien- cies. We put together a group with Dr. Bill Cameron in Ottawa to do a study of K-Pax in people who were diag- nosed with HIV but had not yet started on treatment. That trial is ongoing and we'll have the results soon. When I started taking K-Pax in 2008, it was recommended that I take the highest dose to achieve a bounce in my CD4 count, which I did. My CD4 counts had been static at about 300 for several years after I started triple combination therapy in 1997. (Before starting combination therapy, my CD4 count was 0.) After three months on K-Pax, my CD4 count went from 300 to the 500s. Nothing had been changed in my antiretroviral regimen, which I've been on since 2002. This is the kind of result we're hoping to see in the clinical study. Over the last few years, on a day- to-day basis, I've felt like I have a lot of energy considering my age and stage of life and I've generally had fewer infections, colds and flus. There are other contributing factors\u2014including vitamin\u2014it's needed for healthy bones and some studies suggest that it may help improve your mood and enhance immune system function. PurKrill, a krill oil supplement, is a source of omega-3 fatty acids. I think that it has helped to reduce my bad cholesterol ( LDL) and increase the good cholesterol ( HDL). Before using PurKrill I talked to my doctor about it. He looked at the information and said he didn't see any problem with it. After I started taking it, I saw an even greater increase in my CD4 counts. At this point, I'm using more sup- plements than medication. I don't have any side effects whatsoever on anything. My count is up to around 650 cells. My viral load is less than 40 copies/ml and has been for quite some time. But, more importantly for me, my energy level has gone up and I feel good. My CD4 count fluctuates, but really it's all about how you feel. Who is your AID s icon, and why?

K-Pax is available from a vita- min and supplement store in Vancouver (Body Energy) or you can get it from the U.S. The only drawback is that it's expensive: I spend $120 a month on a main-tenance dose of K-Pax. But it covers all my needs for vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Now I'm taking fewer supplements because K-Pax contains many ingredients I used to buy sep - arately \u2014including NAC, L-gluta- mic acid, alpha-lipoic acid and acetyl-L-carnitine. So, on top of the health benefits, I don't have to take as many pills. GARY M. , 60 Montreal HIV+: 12 years Consultant in the marine and offshore industry I started HIV medication in 2002 and then found out I was co-infected with hepatitis C. In 2003 I was suc- cessfully treated for hep C, and in January 2004 I switched my HIV meds to atazanavir (Reyataz) and Truvada. My CD4 count went up to around 300 and remained there. In 2008 I started to read up on antioxidants and supplements that stimulate the immune system. My CD4 count was stagnant and I wanted to increase it. I didn't want to introduce too many supplements at the same time, so I started with a multivitamin , then added vitamin C , then vitamin D 3 and then PurKrill . I wanted to see what the effects were of each supplement, so I took one for a while before intro- ducing the next one. After I started taking a vitamin C complex and vitamin D 3, I saw my CD4 count gradually go up. I read that vitamin C would stimulate my immune system, and I haven't had the flu or any flu shots since I started taking it. I take 2,500 IU of vitamin D 3 per day in the morning. It's the sunshine suPPlement safely ! Many people with HIV use supple - ments to compensate for a nutri - tional deficiency, reduce symptoms or alleviate the side effects of medications. Supplements can, how - ever, interact with both prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Before you take any vitamin, mineral, homeopathic medicine or other supplement, talk to your healthcare team (your doctor, pharmacist, nurse and natural health practitioner), so they can help you avoid interactions and side effects. Some supplements can weaken the effect of medicines used to treat HIV, hepatitis C and other conditions and some cause new side effects. People with HIV should avoid herbs such as St. John's wort, echinacea, goldenseal and milk thistle.

Today, I am in a good place, but it hasn't been easy getting here. At one time, I was more than willing to speak about what I call the trajec- tory of life events that led to my joining the increasing numbers of Aboriginal women receiving positive HIV test results. In the dictionary, trajectory is defined as \"the path followed by a pro- jectile flying or an object moving under the action of given forces.\" In my tra-jectory, childhood trauma and being a victim of unfortunate circumstances beyond my power lay the path for me to make poor choices, which I believe were the \"given forces\" in my collision course with HIV. And when HIV hit, the initial shock caused much devastation in my life and family\u2014much like the rippling effect HIV had on our com- munities, and much like the harmful impacts of colonization. Yet amidst this devastation, I remembered a teaching from our elders that states: \"Adversity is our greatest teacher.\" I have come to recognize that HIV is now a guiding force in my life. M y First Nations community is Wikwemikong, on Manitoulin Island in the Great Lakes region in Ontario. I am the youngest of eight children from my father's first marriage; and if truth be told, alcohol wreaked havoc on our family life, leaving us kids to essen-tially raise ourselves. When I was a little over two years old, I witnessed my older siblings being taken away to residential schools upon the death of our mother. As a result, I struggled with major abandonment issues from an early age. Because I was too young to be taken, I was left behind with my father and grandmother. As I look back now, these were the first of many trau-matic events in my formative years, including childhood sexual abuse, which shaped my own dysfunction. As a runaway, I migrated to Toronto when I was 11\u2014fleeing from these experiences of childhood sexual abuse and hoping to leave all the painful memories behind. I ran with no sense of direction, and ultimately running only fuelled my total disconnect from family, community, culture and trad- itions. The spiritual part of me had shut down, and I had no way of know-ing how that would impact my future. My clan is the Deer Clan. We are recognized as natural leaders. As a young person, I took on the attributes and characteristics of my clan but also felt like a small lost deer, with fear and tentativeness always just beneath the surface. Out of my element, especially in cities, where I lived on the street as a teenager and at times had to protect myself from sexually aggressive men, my heart would often race in fear while I fought the impulse to bolt. It was during those teenage years that I met my husband-to-be. I recall him telling me that he had been to residential school for 14 years. If I had known then what I know now about the residential school legacy\u2014the profound trauma that affects many former students throughout their lives\u2014I probably would have bolted. We married and had two beautiful children, a son and a daughter. We left Toronto to live with my husband's community in Northwestern Ontario, a remote community with no hydro and only a couple of radio phones. Getting there required flying in and landing on a patch of ice in winter and in the water the rest of the year. At first, our marriage was OK for the most part, but problems slowly began to emerge, primarily related to his alcohol use. When violence reared its ugly head a few years later, it became evident that our marriage would not survive. It was during this difficult period in my life that my talent for storytelling first emerged: I discovered my own style of storytelling, a skill that I had observed from the natural-born storytellers in my community, primarily the Elders. My memory of their mind-blowing stories had stayed with me from my childhood, providing a starting place for me to hone my own skills. I used to imitate an old aunt of mine playing cards and having a conversation with 10 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014history of Aboriginal peoples. One day, after three weeks at this centre, I was told that a very special ceremony had been organized for me. The ceremony was to take place in the centre's trad-itional lodge. Our traditional lodges are considered sacred spaces where ceremonies have been conducted from time immemorial. A female Elder escorted me out to the lodge and what I saw is some-thing I will never forget. People were lined up on either side of the eastern doorway, creating a pathway for me to walk into the lodge. An Elder spoke about how many of our people have lost their connection to who they are, to culture and traditions, to family and community, and more importantly, to the Creator. As I listened, I felt a real sense of something lifting away from me and tears began pouring down my face. The Elder then declared that I had come home, and that the people who were present wanted to welcome me home. I walked into the lodge and was greeted and hugged by everyone as I entered. In that moment, for the first time in my whole life, my heart began to feel peace and belonging. This welcoming home has stayed in my heart to this day and was the beginning of my healing journey. If you, the reader, are thinking that spiritual awakening is that easy, I have to tell you that it was not, because shortly after this ceremony, I left the healing centre and went back to my addictions. But I believe now that a spiritual seed was planted in my heart through the \"coming home\" ceremony. The ceremony allowed me to begin addressing my cultural dis- connection on so many levels. Over time I reconnected with my culture and my language, Odawa. Just a few years later, when I was diagnosed with HIV, I reconnected with the Creator. My diagnosis made it clear to me that I had a choice: I could continue doing drugs and living the way I had been living or I could change my life. The journey continues, but today I am in a much more balanced place. In my heart and spirit, I am truly home. With what turned out to be my helper, HIV, my heart is home! someone you couldn't see. At our com-munity gatherings, people would ask me to do one of my \"little old lady from Manitoulin Island\" skits, and then crack up watching me do it. I do not usually blow my own horn, so I don't often speak of this, but I was one of the pioneers of Native theatre (plays by and about Native people) in Canada\u2014working alongside the likes of Tomson Highway, Gary Farmer, Monique Mojica, Daniel David Moses, Graham Greene and the awesomely talented Elder women of Spiderwoman Theater from New York. I learned about the physicality of storytelling by studying with some of the best talents in the world; this became my niche for honing my own skills through dance, physical theatre and the per - forming arts. For 25 years, beginning in the late '70s, I worked as a professional actor, director and later as a dramaturge with new and upcoming writers and performers. For me, the work was a lifeline during the years that I strug- gled to keep my marriage together. But in the end, when my son was nine and my daughter six, my married life came to a close, and my little family joined the ranks of many broken homes in our communities. For years, I felt guilty about my newfound passion for theatre and storytelling, because I worried that it came at the cost of my family. While I began to realize that I had the capacity to excel in my professional work, my personal life continued to be in a state of disrepair, and I continued to struggle with my own demons, the biggest one being addiction. Finding solace in acting out other people's stories brought me a kind of release. M any years later, in 1995, through the course of my intensifying struggles with drug addiction, I had the oppor - tunity to go to an Aboriginal healing centre to finally try to deal with my trauma. It was a place in downtown Toronto that took a holistic approach to healing, offering one-on-one coun- selling, support groups and educa-tional sessions that taught us about the Wellness N' ginaajiw My spirit is beautiful Culture Strength Ajichaak Spirit Resilience Mashkoziiwin Strength Connection Zaagi'idizon Love yourself VOICE Miigwechiwendamo Grateful Identity Dibaadendizowin Humility Healing Naadamaagan Helper Laughter Aakwa' ode' ewin Courage Spirituality Sisters Naagadawenim g'jichaag Be gentle to your inner being Too often what's reported about Aboriginal people focuses on our deficits. To stop perpetuating the oppression of our people, this nar - rative must change. In my personal and professional life, while acknow - ledging the trauma we have lived through, I try to work from a place of strength. These are some English and Odawa words that describe my personal strengths.11 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEBone density scan Both aging and HIV can cause our bones to eventually become less dense. Some anti- HIV drugs (notably, tenofovir [Viread, also in Truvada, Atripla, Stribild and Complera]) can also cause a loss of bone density. If you are a post- menopausal woman or a man over 50, speak to your doc-tor about getting a bone density scan to establish your baseline. After that, your doctor can advise you about how often you will need one to measure the density of your bones. Blood-pressure monitoring A blood-pressure monitor meas- ures the force of blood against the walls of your arteries and can help indicate your risk of developing heart disease. Blood glucose test This blood test measures your blood sugar level and your risk for diabetes. It is recommended that you have one every three to six months. Kidney function tests Because kidney function declines with age and certain HIV drugs (such as tenofovir, ata za navir [Reyataz] and indinavir [Crixivan]) are processed by the kidneys, doctors often rec- ommend that you periodically have blood and urine tests to check your kidney function. Lipid tests People with abnormal lipid levels (sometimes called \"high cholesterol\") are at higher risk for heart disease. Simple blood tests can measure your Speak to your doctor about how often you should have this test. Pap test A doctor collects cells from the cervix, which are then examined under a microscope. A Pap test is used to look for cell changes that indicate the presence of cancer or changes that could lead to cancer. You should have a Pap test every year if you're HIV posi- tive and sexually active. Pelvic exam A pelvic exam is a physical exam of the internal and external pelvic organs. It is usually combined with a Pap test every year. if you 're a man or trans woman ... Prostate exam It is recommended that you have a manual digital exam once a year after the age of 40. Your doc- tor may also order a PSA blood test, which screens for prostate cancer. ( PSA screening tests are free in most but not all parts of the country. Check with your doctor to find out if you are eligible for one.) If this checklist looks daunting, you'll be relieved to know that most of these tests are simple and cause little or no discomfort.

Your doctor will recommend that you have these tests once a year or more, depending on your previous measurements and other risk factors for heart disease. Tests to screen for colorectal cancer A few tests can detect cancer of the colon and rectum. These include a stool test, a digital rectal exam (where a doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum to feel for abnormalities) or a scope inserted into the rectum. Your doctor will let you know how often you should be screened. Anal pap test Many HIV-positive people have HPV (human papilloma virus), which can cause anal cancer. To prevent this, speak to your doctor about a clinic in your region that provides screening for anal cancer. if you 're a woman (cis or trans ) or a trans man ... Breast exam To detect possible early signs of breast cancer, your doctor will check for lumps or other abnormalities in your breasts and armpits. It is recom- mended that you have a breast exam once a year. Mammogram A mammogram uses a low- dose X-ray to look for different types of tumours and cysts in the breasts. 50 Sense Being pricked and prodded can be tiresome, but these screening tests may well be worth your while. People with HIV are living longer and better than ever before. But, unfortunately, they are also more likely to develop a host of health conditions\u2014thinner bones, heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, even cancer. Thankfully, there are screening tests that can help flag a problem early on and potentially even save a life. If you're HIV positive, chances are that you already see a gp or HIV specialist who tracks your viral load and CD4 counts. If you're over 50, your doctor may also recommend some of the following tests to help you stay ahead of the curve:12 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014Whey protein powder Whey is derived from milk during the cheese-making process. If you're not getting enough protein, whey pow-der can provide an excellent source of easily digestible protein. Studies have shown that, when coupled with resistance training, whey can help to preserve muscle. It can also help people maintain a healthy weight. Whey may also help increase levels of glutathione, an anti- oxidant that is low in many people with HIV. Choose brands that are free of artificial colours, flavours and sweeteners; opt instead for plain or naturally flavoured ver - sions. The easiest way to use whey is in smoothies or protein shakes. Make sure you don't overdo it though because it can strain the kidneys and cause diarrhea. Fermented foods There's a lot of talk about the pros of probiotics, but not all foods that claim to have them deliver on their promise. Probiotics\u2014live bacteria that support the health of your intestines\u2014have been part of the human diet for centuries. You'll find them in fermented foods, such as kefir (a yogurt-like dairy product), sauerkraut or Korean kimchi (spicy pickled cabbage). These foods can help reduce constipation, gas, bloating and food intolerances. Since roughly 70 percent of the immune system is in the gut, a healthy gut means more robust immunity. Quinoa and teff While quinoa, the protein-packed grain-like food, has in recent years become popular in North America, teff remains largely unknown. Teff is a tiny North African grain, with a nutty, earthy flavour, that's been around for thousands of years. It can be cooked in water (three parts water to one part teff, for 15 to 20 minutes) or teff flour can be used to make pancakes and baked goods. Both quinoa and teff are rich in vitamins and minerals, including calcium as well as magnesium, an essential nutrient with far- reaching health benefits that many people living with HIV are deficient in. Magnesium also plays a role in maintaining heart health, bone health and nerve function. In addi-tion, it may reduce risk for diabetes, migraines and colon cancer. Both quinoa and teff are good gluten-free options. Brazil nuts Why Brazil nuts? In a word, selenium. This mighty min-eral and antioxidant, while needed only in small amounts, carries a lot of clout. And it can be especially beneficial for people with HIV. The body uses selenium to produce enzymes and hormones, to prevent damage to cells and tissues, and to strengthen the immune system. Brazil nuts are also a great source of magnesium and other minerals. But keep in mind: You don't want to take too much selenium and nuts are calorie-dense. A small handful should suffice. Superfoods Wondering which foods to put in your pantry? Dietitian Doug Cook picks his top 8. 13 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEDark leafy greens Kale, spinach, collard greens, Swiss chard, dandelions and beet greens may look unassuming, but they are nutritional powerhouses. They pack a lot of potassium, which, along with reducing sodium, can lower your blood pressure. These greens are also rich in anti-cancer polyphenols, vitamins B, C and K, and are one of the best sources of lutein, sometimes called \"the eye vitamin\" because it may help prevent various eye diseases. Lutein also shows promise in reducing the risk for heart disease. It is best absorbed when these vege- tables are cooked and eaten with a little fat, like butter or olive oil. Dark chocolate The star ingredient is cocoa polyphenols. Poly-phenols\u2014compounds found in different plant foods, such as apples, grapes, green tea and olive oil\u2014are abundant in dark chocolate. These polyphenols protect the cardiovascular system by reducing damage to the lining of the blood vessels via their antioxidant properties. Several large studies have shown that eating dark choco- late may improve your lipid levels and lower your risk of heart disease. All that and it tastes fantastic! Doug Cook is a registered dietitian and holistic nutrition - ist, and co-author of Nutrition for Canadians for Dummies. www.dougcookrd.comFatty fish Salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring and trout have an impressive amount of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. These omega-3s can reduce a person's risk of heart disease by lowering inflammation, blood pressure and triglyceride levels (a blood fat that can become ele- vated as a result of taking some HIV medications, such as certain protease inhibitors and older nukes like d4T and probably AZT and ddI). Fatty fish also have plenty of calcium, magnesium, vitamin A, choline (a B vita- min) and a decent amount of vitamin D. On top of all that, fatty fish may also be good for your mind and your mood\u2014some studies suggest that omega-3s may help combat stress and ease depression. Two servings of fatty fish a week should be enough to help you reap the benefits. Eggs Yes, eggs. After years of getting bad press because of their cholesterol content, eggs are now taking their rightful place as a nutri-ent-dense food. It turns out that the cholesterol in food has little impact on blood cholesterol, and the Harvard School of Public Health has given the green light to having an egg a day if desired (have fewer if you have heart disease or diabetes). Eggs are a great source of protein, folate, zinc, vitamins A, B 2, B12, and choline. To avoid Salmonella, steer clear of foods that contain raw eggs, such as holland-aise sauce and some Caesar salad dressings.So what is a superfood, anyway? While there's no standard definition, the general consensus is that a superfood provides an extraordinary amount of nutritional bang for the buck. It's not just plant foods that qualify (kale, anyone?); there are many nutritious animal foods, too. Nutrient-dense foods are one of the building blocks of good health. The body requires a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals for repair and maintenance, to fight HIV and other infections, and to prevent various diseases. Many people with HIV experience a nutritional challenge at some point, as a result of either HIV infection or antiretroviral medications. The best way to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need is to eat a wide variety of healthy foods every day. But there are a few superstars that deserve our extra attention. Here are 8 that are especially beneficial to people living with HIV. 14 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014 15 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEStart Me Up! 3 inspired startups: by PHAs, for PHAs by DIAne Peters pHOtOgrApHS by KAmIl bIAlOUS , JOHN pHIllIpS AND DApHN\u00e9 CArON Be your own boss, set your own hours, empower yourself and make a difference on your own terms: These are some of the reasons people start their own enterprises. For people living with HIV, those reasons may be even more powerful, as entrepreneurship can also offer a way to participate in the workforce while still being able to take care of yourself. Meet three individuals living with HIV who started their own successful organizations and changed a corner of the world because of their vision, community spirit, drive and hard work. Valerie Nicholson Co-founder of Harvest Organic Co-op After Valerie Nicholson got clean and off the streets of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside a few years ago, she relied on food banks. But even after she landed a job as a community-based researcher and could afford the healthier choices at grocery stores, she kept going back for the same old canned foods, ter - rified to let go of the food banks. \"There's a fear that the rug's going to be pulled out from under you.\" As someone who advocated for food security, she knew there had to be a better option for people liv- ing with HIV. Nicholson came up with the idea of a fruit and vegetable co-op that would give people liv-ing with HIV, hepatitis C and other chronic illnesses access to fresh organic produce on a regular basis. She signed up for a six-month program at Simon Fraser University, designed to help participants create an HIV-related community project. There, she partnered up with Mikey Arzadon, who shared a similar vision, to cook up a plan for an organic food co-op. The two found a source for produce with Discovery Organics (which gave them advice on how to start and offered them a discount on deliveries) and secured space at AIDS Vancouver, where once a month they take orders and distribute food. Interests: Aboriginal drumming, nature, story - telling, volunteering at Charlie's (pet) Foodbank, playing with my grandchildren and seeing the world through their eyes.

Although he was already busy doing volunteer work with the Canadian Treatment Action Council ( CTAC), Finch found the time to teach himself how to create web content. With the help of a web designer and a tiny chunk of fund- ing, he launched PositiveLite in early December 2009. Finch was soon busy covering events and staying up late to upload videos, write, edit and deal with a myriad of technical challen- ges. His hard work paid off: The site quickly became popular, averaging about 22,000 hits a month after just a year and a half. Over time, audience feedback encour - aged Finch to adjust his editorial stance: \"We found that people wanted more in-depth stories on serious topics,\" he says. Now the site offers everything from hard-hitting essays on barebacking and interviews with top HIV researchers to theatre reviews, travel stories and recipes. Toward the end of 2012, Finch began to worry about the site's future: He didn't have the energy to run it alone anymore. Fortunately, he'd been able to attract some advertisers, so the site was starting to break even (he'd put a lot of his own money into it in the early years) and had an estab-lished roster of contributors. Among those was experienced blogger and AIDS activist In February 2012, Harvest Organic Co-op was launched. People hand over money\u2014orders start at $5\u2014in advance for a bag of organic produce. When the food comes in a bulk shipment a week later, Nicholson, Arzadon and a volunteer sort the lettuce, potatoes, beets and the like into individual orders. \"We use math and charts,\" says Nicholson. \"We've got it down to a science.\" Clients\u2014and AIDS Vancouver staff\u2014love the earthy smell of the produce, which signals that it's food pickup day. One woman who uses drugs regularly gives Nicholson $20 and asks for a $5 bag of produce once a month until her deposit is gone, realizing that other - wise she'll probably spend it elsewhere. Another client orders $40 worth and gives most of the food away to other people with HIV in the neighbourhood because he loves to share the wealth when he can. Within a year of the launch, Harvest was able to expand to a second location (Vancouver's Mole Hill Community Housing). The bigger goal is to incorporate as a nonprofit and attract funding for new projects, such as buying bikes to deliver orders to those who are too unwell to get out. Nicholson still has plenty of energy for Harvest and offering fresh food to a community used to few choices. \"I've seen a change in myself through healthy living and eating,\" she says. \"This is my way of giving back.\" Brian Finch Founder of PositiveLite.com Brian Finch has always believed that there's more to life than just your HIV status. That's why he wasn't happy with many of the online publications out there for people living with HIV. \"It's just always about HIV,\" says the Torontonian. Interests: Comedic storytelling, globe-trotting, pushing the envelope and being an unapologetic HIV-positive performer who lets people know we're not defined by our status. Also: watching American Horror Story and following mayor Rob Ford scandals. Past gigs: Phone counsellor for Manitoba HIV/S tD line, make-up artist, coordinator of pWA Speakers Bureau, treat - ment advocate and standup comic.

PHOTO: JOHN PHILLIPS17 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEWith the help of his volunteers, he soon put together a huge portal of online resources containing comprehen- sive treatment and support information and links to HIV organizations across the province. (Today, the site connects Quebecers to 10,000 resources and gets hundreds of hits each week.) After turning his newly honed administrative skills to writing grant proposals, Lemay scored funding to hire a full-time information coordinator, produced videos for the site and created what became the immensely popular guide L'essentiel du VIH-sida [ HIV: What You Need to Know]. He also forged partnerships with healthcare professionals and other HIV organizations. More recently, he developed the mobile app Sexposer (for youth to learn about preventing HIV and sexually transmitted infections), which further established a name for the organization. After five-and-a-half years with Portail, the pressures of constant multitasking caught up with him earlier this year. \"I was exhausted. I needed to do something else.\" After helping Portail VIH-sida du Qu\u00e9bec move to a new office and hiring a new executive director, Pierre-Henri Minot, Lemay left in August (he now coordinates a prov- incial hepatitis C mentorship program for healthcare pro- viders). \"As director, you start from scratch, you bring it to term, and you watch it grow\u2014it's my baby,\" he says of the project he's just left behind. \"I'm proud of what I've done and I'm leaving it in capable hands.\" Diane Peters is a Toronto-based freelance writer and teacher. She writes about health, business, parenting and other issues.Bob Leahy, who agreed to step up as editor. And retired social worker and CATIE board member John McCullagh took over as publisher. \"I think it says a lot about the site when other folks want to be on board and do all this work to keep it going,\" Finch says. Finch remains on the PositiveLite board and con- tinues to write regularly for the publication, while tak- ing time for himself and perusing other interests and projects, including a one-man comedy show. He can now step back knowing that PositiveLite is having a real impact. People with HIV across Canada\u2014and around the world\u2014have told him about the difference his mixture of fun and serious stories has made in their lives. \"I feel like I've done something,\" he says. \"This is my little legacy project. This is what I'll leave behind as my contribution to the movement.\" Bruno Lemay Portail VIH-sida du Qu\u00e9bec Bruno Lemay had no idea his many years of develop-ing treatment information for AIDS service organizations (ASOs) would eventually lead to him founding and running a successful nonprofit. He had worked for organizations like CATIE and the Comit\u00e9 when Maison du Parc, a shelter for people with HIV in Montreal, asked him to develop an online directory of resources for people with HIV across Quebec, including those in rural areas with little access to services. Anticipating that the ambitious project would need ser - ious funding to stay afloat, Lemay approached pharmaceut-ical companies, using contacts he'd forged at CPAVIH . In May 2008, Portail VIH-sida du Qu\u00e9bec was registered as a nonprofit, with Lemay at its helm. Although he had experi-ence working with ASOs, he had never run an organization before, and he'd certainly never started one from scratch. But he did it: gathering volunteers to help build the site and recruiting a board of directors. He wrote bylaws and policies, created an accounting system and promoted the new pro-ject\u2014all while taking courses in healthcare and social servi-ces management at the University of Montreal.

PHOTO: DAPHN\u00c9 CARON18 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014 19 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDErom the hug that comforts a crying child to the hand that steadies the shoulder of an anxious friend, touch can be a powerful tonic. As a long-term survivor of 24 years and counting, I am constantly exploring ways to enhance my physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. And what I've found is that touch and physical intimacy can be powerful remedies. What many of us feel, or know, intuitively about the bene- fits of touch is also backed up by science. Research shows us that these benefits begin as soon as we leave the delivery room. One of the most remarkable studies looked at the effects of physical touch on premature infants. A group of premature babies who were gently touched and massaged three times a day were compared to a group of preemies of similar size who shared similar life conditions but were not touched and massaged every day. The researchers found that the infants from the first group were more alert, more active and more responsive. They slept more deeply. And they gained weight 47 percent more rapidly. The babies who were touched regularly also left the hospital six days sooner. These findings were nothing short of astonishing. We know that physical touch is more than skin deep. As many as 5 million touch receptors in our skin (more than 3,000 in a single fingertip) send messages along our spinal cord to the brain. A simple touch can reduce our heart rate and lower our blood pressure. Caring, nurturing touch can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and some stud-ies suggest it may enhance a person's immune function. It can also stimulate the brain to produce endorphins, our body's natural pain and stress suppressor\u2014which is why a mother's hug of a child who has skinned her knee can literally \"make it all better.\" But we in North America are a relatively non-tactile soci- ety. Compared to people in many parts of the world, we tend to be a little touchy, so to speak, about being touched. Touch Gordon Waselnuk gets a feel for how nurturing touch can melt stress, take the edge off pain and work wonders for the mind and body. IllUStrAtION by CArOl-ANNE pEDNEAU lt Healing 20 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014We may know subconsciously that touch can enhance our well-being and quality of life, but how do we show affection and physical intimacy in a society in which indi- viduals seem to be more and more socially isolated? I'm hardly the first to notice that people seem to stare at their phones and computers more often than at each other. Our affluence and technological advances seem to have led to more social isolation. Many of us sit in our homes watching our flat-screen TVs or spend hours surfing the Net. This isolation can lead to sadness, and, unfortunately, that sad-ness can become pathologized\u2014often seen as depression that needs to be medicated. What is really needed is more intimacy with others. For those of us with HIV, the challenge of getting close to others may be further complicated. Sexologist and psychotherapist Chantal Turcotte sees diverse clients in her Montreal-based private practice and at Clinique Opus, an infectious disease, addictions and mental health clinic. She notes that each person is unique and their challenges depend on where they are in their journey with HIV, but people living with HIV often struggle with navigating dis- closure (when and how should I tell the other person that I'm HIV positive, and how will they react?), practicing safer sex and, for some of us, dealing with health conditions. She notes that feelings of shame are also common, particularly among heterosexual women and men. Our own concerns aside, we also sometimes need to con- tend with the fears of others. For gay men looking to meet people online, be it on Manhunt, Grindr or even Craigslist, it seems like every second personal ad wants someone who is \" DDF\" (drug- and disease-free) or \"clean.\" Many say \"HIV negative and wanting same.\" The not-so-subtle message is: If you have HIV, don't contact me. And, of course, this dynamic plays out in the thou- sand and one other places where people (gay, straight and everything in between) meet each other, too. No wonder people living with HIV have a higher incidence of depression and isolation. riend and fellow long-term survivor Rebekka Valian, who volunteered teach- ing yoga for years, primarily in the HIV community, offers massage at places like Vancouver Friends for Life, a non-profit that provides complementary and alternative health and support services to people living with serious illnesses. \"The need can be so overwhelming,\" she confides, \"that at times I need to retreat and nurture myself.\" AIDS service organizations ( ASOs) in various parts of the country have stepped up to try to meet this need. Montreal's One need only walk down the streets of Cairo, Buenos Aires, Bangkok or Rome to witness more open displays of affection and realize that this is the case. Of course, physical intimacy comes in different shapes and sizes: There's the kind you build with loved ones\u2014romantic and platonic, the kind you find in various thera-peutic-style settings and the more casual sexual kind. While the nature of each of these differs dramatically, all can offer varying degrees of pleasure and balm. Of course, touch can also be unwelcome and far from comforting; it can take the ugly shape of all-too-common physical or sexual violence, too. For many of us, the ideal may be the kind of physical intimacy\u2014sexual and otherwise\u2014found in a loving long- term relationship. But in the absence of that\u2014or to com- plement it\u2014there are many possibilities, some of which are surprisingly creative. n the late '80s and early '90s my friends and lovers were sick and wasting, eventually dying in hospital beds and at home. I call this period the Dark Ages. I lost my lover of 12 years and then, over three years, four close friends. This was fairly common, especially in the gay community. The irony is that when my lover and my friends died was pre-cisely when I needed them the most for support\u2014 someone to hold me in their arms, where I could let go and grieve. One thing I've noticed since being single is that anonym- ous sex is easy to find, at least in a big city, but safe, nurturing touch is much more elusive. It can be hard to meet people, let alone hit it off with them. Then there's the fact that many people shy away from intimacy, as it can bring up repressed memories, emotions and trust issues, especially if they have experienced sexual abuse or been in violent relationships. But no matter our personal experiences, touch is something most of us crave, especially when we're deprived of it. I FTouch is something most of us crave, especially when we're deprived of it.21 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDEworkshops and used to co-host a monthly group in my stu- dio. Many participants are HIV-positive guys, some with obvious symptoms of AIDS. It is a powerful experience to nurture and care for people regardless of their health status or sex appeal. y contact with these groups has encour - aged me to continue down this path in search of touch and intimacy. Thanks to Joseph Kramer and Sequoia, who both became mentors to me, I have embarked on a second career as a massage practi- tioner and for more than 10 years have taught and practiced Thai yoga massage (a therapeutic technique that combines assisted moving, stretching and relaxation) in my studio and in schools. I also offer free massages at a few ASOs in Vancouver. This has allowed me to provide touch and intimacy to clients in a quiet, nurturing environment. New clients may be reluctant or nervous about touch. I emphasize that everyone involved needs to proceed with mindfulness and caring, slowly getting to know each other and building trust. To make services available to people on low incomes, many practitioners, including myself, offer a sliding scale. And some massage therapists who provide services to people living with HIV charge no fee at all. If you feel touch deprived, I'd encourage you to seek out opportunities for closeness. Something as simple as making eye contact or sharing a smile, even with strangers, can make a difference. Or try hugging friends more often, even if it feels awkward at first. Another idea to consider is ask- ing someone to come over and cuddle while watching a movie\u2014with no expectation of sex. That sounds like a great evening in my books. Pleasant and non-threatening. Intim-ate contact, after all, eases life's blows and helps us feel better physically, emotionally and spiritually. Turcotte tells her clients that it can take time to get over the shock of an HIV diagnosis and to build up their self-con- fidence, but no matter where a person is in their journey, \"every person has the right to be accepted for who they are. Every person has a right to physical intimacy, as well as a healthy and enjoyable sex life.\" Gordon Waselnuk is a long-term survivor who lives in Vancouver. He has been involved with the HIV community in various capaci - ties for over 20 years, focusing mainly on treatment information and health promotion. Gordon also works as a massage practi - tioner. Visit his website at www.thai-yoga-massage.caMaison Plein Coeur, for instance, offers women and men living with HIV free massages, provided by volunteer mas- seurs who have been trained to work specifically with people living with HIV. And the Toronto People with AIDS Foundation ( PWA) offers a wide array of touch therapies\u2014 including Reiki, acupuncture, massage and therapeutic touch treatments. People receiving these ther - apies report numerous physical and psych-ological benefits. These treatments can reduce stress, anxiety, depression and stress-related conditions, stimulate circulation and possibly boost the immune system. Another friend, Joel Nim Cho Leung, who lives on a small budget, goes for massages regularly as a preventive measure. \"I feel less depressed and more relaxed and nurtured,\" he says. \"The only prob-lem is that there are often waiting lists at my local ASO. This shows that there is a real need among people living with HIV.\" There are also people who have seen a need and formed groups that offer creative solu- tions in the form of workshops. After my partner died, I was fortunate to find one such group in Vancouver, called Men in Touch. A friend had recommended the retreat\u2014a safe, nurturing environ-ment where I did not have to be sexual or look my best. A man named Sequoia started the group in the late '80s, bringing men together at retreats in the city to nurture each other through dialogue, movement, breath and sensual but not sexual massage. In the '80s and early '90s, many of the participants were living with HIV, in various stages of disease. There was a lot of laugh- ter and tears at those memorable retreats. Today Sequoia has opened his practice to women and also works one on one with people who are dealing with sexuality and intim- acy challenges. Similar groups and workshops are available to women and men in various cities. One of the first was The Body Elec- tric, created in the early '80s by Joseph Kramer, a teacher in the San Francisco Bay area. He developed it after noticing that people were shutting down emotionally and sexually, especially during the height of the AIDS epidemic. People were overwhelmed and frightened about losing friends and becoming infected and dying. The workshop, now delivered in the United States, Canada and Australia, brings people together to honour each other (there are groups for people of all gender identities and sexual orientations). Over the course of a weekend, participants gradually work toward experiencing intimacy and sensual erotic tantric massage in a safe, caring environment.

How to hwart a hyroid roblem An untreated condition of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland can have a significant impact on your body and daily life. Find out how to spot the signs and what you can do about it. by M ICheLLe FoIsy 22 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014A thyroid problem can be so unobtrusive that you don't even notice it, or it can affect the way you look, feel and act. When the small gland at the base of the neck doesn't func- tion properly, it can contribute to fertility problems, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and many other health problems. It can also affect your mood: An overactive thyroid can make you anxious and irritable, while an underactive thyroid can drag you down, making you feel tired and depressed. It seems that people with HIV are slightly more likely than the general population to develop a thyroid problem, though most will never experience a thyroid problem of any kind. All the same, it's one of those things that's worth being aware of because treatments exist to manage such conditions effectively. The better equipped you are to detect signs of imbalance, the sooner you can have it checked out and, if need be, take steps to redress the imbalance. Here are two stories that highlight thyroid problems that can affect people living with HIV. Selena's hypothyroid- ism is more common and Patrick's Graves' disease, rela- tively uncommon. Selena, 32, was first diagnosed with HIV five years ago and started taking antiretroviral therapy ( ART) within a few months of her diagnosis. During her as Graves' disease, likely triggered by the strong immune response he had to his HIV treatment. Patrick was prescribed an anti-thyroid medica - tion and another drug to slow his heart rate and decrease the tremor. After a couple of months on these meds, his thyroid levels stabilized and he felt much more like his old self again. OW IT ORKS The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland that sits in the front of the neck, just below the Adam's apple and above the collarbone. It produces the thyroid hormones thy- roxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which affect a per - son's metabolism. They control how our bodies store and use energy and they help regulate our mood and weight. The release of thyroid hormones into the bloodstream is a complex process, controlled by several glands and hormones in the body. One of these hormones\u2014thyroid stimulating hormone (or TSH), produced by the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the base of our brains\u2014regulates the amount of hormones the thyroid releases into the bloodstream. When a person does not produce enough thyroid hor - mone and their metabolism slows down as a result, as Selena's did, they are said to have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can be tricky to rec- ognize because many of the symptoms are not specific to How to hwart a hyroid roblem An untreated condition of the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland can have a significant impact on your body and daily life. Find out how to spot the signs and what you can do about it. by M ICheLLe FoIsy last visit to the HIV clinic, she reported feeling fatigued and sluggish and had gained 10 pounds over the past several months despite a stable diet. Blood tests confirmed that she had an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), which may have been due to HIV or to the HIV medications she was taking. To treat the condition, her doctor prescribed a thyroid hormone supplement. After two months, Selena felt more energetic and had even started working out. Her subsequent blood tests showed that her thyroid had stabilized. When Patrick, 40, was diagnosed with HIV, his immune system was very suppressed. He had a CD4 count of 50, so he started HIV treatment immedi - ately. He responded extremely well to treatment and his CD4 count rapidly increased to 300 within a year. However, 19 months later, he was experi - encing new symptoms: He felt hot all the time and was \"sweating like a machine.\" He was irritable and shaky and, despite drinking no coffee, his heart was racing like he was \"on a bad caffeine trip.\" Over the past year he had made great strides to gain weight but more recently had been shedding pounds despite eating all the time. Based on Patrick's description of his symptoms and the results of a blood test, his doctor diagnosed him with a type of overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) known 23 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDE24 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014with an enlarged thyroid and can cause a rapid heart rate, weight loss, tremor, anxiety and increased appetite. Other symptoms include bulging eyes, heat intolerance, warm moist skin, excessive sweating, heart palpitations, muscle weakness and frequent bowel movements. HO GETS HYROID DISEASE Anybody can develop a thyroid problem, but women are much more likely than men and older adults are more likely than young people to develop one. People with HIV may also have somewhat higher rates of thyroid abnormalities than the general population, due to changes to the immune sys- tem caused by HIV or due to certain infections and can- cers. Antiretrovirals and medications used to treat certain illnesses that are more common among people living with HIV, such as hepatitis C and tuberculosis, can also affect a person's thyroid function (see \"Medications that Can Affect the Thyroid\" for a list of some meds to watch for). Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Stephen Shafran, from Edmonton's University of Alberta Hospital, says, \"Overall, thyroid disease is not very common in people living with HIV, perhaps because thyroid disease is much more com- mon in women than men, and in Canada the ratio of HIV infection for males to females is approximately 3:1.\" He also notes that in his HIV practice, he sees more hypothyroidism than hyperthyroidism. CAUSE AND FFECT The most common cause of hypothyroidism is called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that involves the body's own immune cells damaging the thy- roid. Iodine deficiency, thyroid surgery, radiation therapy to treat cancers of the head and neck, and other endo-crine disorders are usually considered in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. For people who have more advanced HIV, doctors might also check for infections or cancers that can invade the thyroid. Although uncommon, people with HIV can develop a form of hyperthyroidism called Graves' disease one to three years after starting ART due to a strong immune response. As a result of starting HIV treatment, Patrick's immune sys- tem improved, but because his response to the medication was so strong, he also produced antibodies that caused his thyroid to become overactive and produce too much thy- roid hormone. A number of medications can also affect the thyroid, which is yet one more reason for people to talk to their doctors and pharmacists about all the drugs they're taking. INPOINTING THE ROBLEM Diagnosing a thyroid problem is key to feeling better and preventing other problems from ensuing. Had Selena's hypothyroidism gone undiagnosed, her lack of energy and weight gain would have likely continued to take a toll on thyroid disease and can be caused by other conditions that people living with HIV may have. The most common symptoms of hypothyroidism, which generally develop slowly over time, are fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and hair on the head that is dry, thinning or falls out easily. Other symptoms include feeling cold easily, a slow heart rate, brittle fingernails, a hoarse voice, numbing or tingling of the hands and/or feet (a pins and needles sen- sation), constipation, a decreased ability to sweat, depres- sion and memory problems. Some people also develop a visibly enlarged thyroid, called a goiter. On the other end of the spectrum, some people, like Patrick, produce too much thyroid hormone due to an overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism. Instead of slowing down as it does with hypothyroidism, the body's metab-olism speeds up.

As for Patrick, if his Graves' disease had gone undiagnosed and untreated, he could have developed more serious complications, such as heart disease and bone loss, down the road. Luckily for both of them, the diagnosis of thyroid disease is generally based simply on symptoms, a physical exam and blood tests. Blood tests that reveal a low level of thy- roxine and a high level of TSH indicate hypothyroidism. And blood tests that reveal high levels of thyroxine and low lev- els of TSH indicate an overactive thyroid. (To sort out more complex cases, other tests such as a thyroid scan or a thy-roid biopsy may be ordered.) OFFSETTING HE IMBALANCE Dr. Shafran notes that treating an underactive thyroid tends to be more straightforward than treating an over - active one: \"Hypothyroidism is easy to manage with the drug levothyroxine [Synthroid, Eltroxin], which is avail- able in many strengths.\" On the other hand, he says, \"man-aging hyperthyroidism tends to be more complex and patients should be treated by an endocrinologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in treating hormone problems.\" In cases of hyperthyroidism, two types of medicine are usually prescribed: an anti-thyroid drug and a heart drug called a beta-blocker, to control uncomfortable symptoms like a rapid or irregular heartbeat and shakiness. Sometimes, radioactive iodine is prescribed to destroy the overactive thyroid gland. Most patients who receive radioactive iod-ine subsequently become hypothyroid and then require levothyroxine therapy. To treat hypothyroidism, levothyroxine is the most com- monly prescribed medication (see \"Tips for Levothyroxine Users,\" opposite). To ensure that your treatment is working well, your healthcare team will monitor its effects to make sure your symptoms improve and your hormone levels return to normal. A person's TSH level will usually normal- ize after several weeks of treatment. If it remains elevated, this indicates that the dose of levothyroxine is too low. The dose may then need to be increased gradually until the TSH normalizes. Patience is needed as it can take several weeks or months to get you on the right dose and for your symp- toms to resolve. After your treatment is stabilized, your doc- tor will probably recommend that you continue taking this dose and that your levels be monitored regularly. The good news is that thyroid disease is a manageable condition that is fairly simple to diagnose and treat. In terms of prevention, the best thing a person can do to stay healthy is report any unusual symptoms to their healthcare team. For people on ART, there is only a small chance that the thyroid will be affected\u2014most people do just fine. If you have suspicious symptoms or several risk factors, your doc- tor may screen you for thyroid disease to detect it early. Michelle Foisy, PharmD, is a clinical pharmacist with the Northern Alberta Program in Edmonton and a clinical consult - ant in HIV.Tips for Levothyroxine Users Take your dose daily: Take your dose as prescribed every day and avoid missing any. If you do miss one, let your healthcare team know. If you are not taking enough medication, your symptoms may not fully improve; how - ever, if you take too much, this can swing the balance and lead to an overactive thyroid. How to take your medication: Try to take levothyroxine at around the same time each day. Unless your doctor or pharmacist suggests otherwise, it is best to take it first thing in the morning with a full glass of water on an empty stomach (about 30 to 60 minutes before eating). If a morning dose is not convenient, try taking it at bedtime instead. Discuss the best way to take all of your medicines with your doctor and pharmacist to avoid any interactions with foods or other medicines. Keep an eye out for side effects and drug interactions: Levothyroxine usually causes few or no side effects provided you are on the correct dose and your healthcare team is monitoring you regularly. If you experience any symptoms\u2014such as heart palpitations, excessive sweat - ing, rapid weight loss or restlessness\u2014be sure to let your healthcare team know, as this may indicate that your dose is too high. To prevent drug interactions, make sure your healthcare team has a complete list of all of the medicines you take, including vitamins, herbs and complementary therapies as well as other prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Levothyroxine should be taken at least four hours before or four hours after taking other drugs that interfere with how well it gets into the bloodstream. These include cholestyramine, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts (found in antacids and supplements), iron supplements, sucralfate (Sulcrate) and dietary fibre supplements. The scoop on ritonavir: The HIV medication ritonavir (Norvir)\u2014used to boost other protease inhibitors and also found in Kaletra\u2014can speed up the clearance of levothy - roxine from your body. To offset this interaction, higher doses of levothyroxine may be required. Your doctor and pharmacist can ensure that you are on the correct dose of levothyroxine based on the way you respond to thyroid treatment. Pregnancy planning: If you are planning to become pregnant or you are pregnant, your doctor should mon - itor your thyroid hormone levels more closely. He or she may recommend adjusting your dosage. A word of caution: Although there is a lot of hype about the use of levothyroxine to speed up metabolism and help you lose weight, this is not recommended and can be dangerous. Too much thyroid hormone can cause heart palpitations and lead to bone loss.26 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014 GABOR MAT\u00c9 Physician, Vancouver Anxiety manifests itself in any number of ways. It can manifest as panic\u2014feeling terror or a loss of control. It can manifest as anger\u2014toward fate, the medical profession, a partner or oneself. Anxiety can also show up as physical feelings\u2014a rapid heart rate, dry mouth and abdominal upset. Some people address it head-on, but most of us try to soothe, suppress, escape or sedate it. To avoid feeling anxious, some people might drink alcohol or do drugs. It's well known that stress has a big impact on the immune system and can increase a person's susceptibility to illnesses, so it's important to deal with anxiety and what lies behind it. Being diagnosed with HIV is a huge deal, so why wouldn't someone with HIV be anxious and scared? Stigma can add to this, and some HIV medi- cations can cause anxiety. The natural dynamic is to think that all of our anx- ieties are due to HIV. However, when you ask people, \"When in your life were you not anxious?\" many will say that they've always been anxious. So the sources of anxiety for people with HIV are many, and you need to tease them out. For example, if you're using drugs, what are the drugs doing for you? A person might say, \"The drug makes me feel better\u2014it helps me escape or it takes away my bad thoughts.\" Then the next question is: \"Why do you have bad thoughts? Why do you have a need to escape?\" When exploring these ques-tions, people realize that their anx-iety is the result of emotional baggage they've carried from a young age. It's important to talk about your anxiety, so you're not alone with it. Spend time with people who have gone through similar experiences. Support groups, where you can talk to people at different stages in their rela-tionship to HIV and their anxiety, are really valuable. They allow you to see your issues from a different angle and that it's possible to come to a better place. See a private therapist if you can afford it or see one in the public health system if that's an option. In the right hands, cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT) can probably be helpful, too. The real issue is not so much which tech-nique you use as how comfortable you feel with the therapist and how much you can really be yourself and be lis-tened to. And, of course, yoga, medi-tation, any mindfulness practice can be wonderful. Seeing your healthcare provider is an OK place to begin, as long as the doctor is open-minded and can listen to you. Medical training often gives psychology short shrift, so many doc- tors are not well-equipped to handle these issues. If you don't get help within the medical system, don't think you're alone. Just keep looking. As far as anti-anxiety medications go, they can deal with the symptoms but not the causes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't deal with the symptom, too. (If you broke your leg and were in severe pain, it would be important to relieve your pain and deal with the broken leg.) So, in principle, I'm not against anti-anxiety meds, but they're overused. They are very difficult to get off when you've been on them for a long time and they can give the impression that you've dealt with an issue when you haven't. Two classes of drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety are benzodi- azepines and antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Benzodiazepines should only be for very short-term use, in the case of extreme difficulty functioning. If somebody's going through a terrible panic attack, a short course of SSRIs is better, but they don't solve the under - lying problem either. They can calm you and help you cope so you can deal with the unresolved issues. [Note: These two classes of drugs interact with many antiretrovirals, especially protease inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, non-nukes. A lower dosage of anxiety medication is usually pre-scribed for people on these HIV meds.] Dr. Mat\u00e9 is the author of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, When the Body Says No and other bestselling books.

Another tip for keeping anxiety at bay is to avoid foods that you have been diagnosed as having a sensitiv-ity to, as some food intolerances may affect mood. It's also important to get enough magnesium (magnesium defi- ciencies are common among people living with HIV), which the body needs to produce serotonin, among many other things. Foods that are natural sources of magnesium include wild halibut, leafy greens, black beans, and pumpkin and squash seeds, but it isn't always easy to get enough from our diet. The most easily absorbed and best tolerated magnesium supplement is magnesium glycinate. I recommend taking 300 to 600 mg a day at bed-time, along with a B-complex vitamin. [Because magnesium can interact with some antiretroviral drugs, (Reyataz), elvi tegravir (in Stribild) and dolutegravir (Tivicay), as well as many antibiotics, talk to your pharmacist and doctor before taking these supplements.] If you find your anxiety to be more related to the change of season, you may be low in vitamin D, in which case it's important to have your vitamin D levels monitored and to supplement if necessary. Fish oil may also have a positive effect on your mood and help lower your anxiety levels. Make sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about any vitamins and supplements you take. And, of course, it's important to control life stressors as much as possible. Stress increases one's cor - tisol level, decreasing levels of sero- tonin and another neurotransmitter, dopamine, which in turn raises anx-iety levels. Unfortunately, we tend to run ourselves ragged on the stress front, to the point where even getting good-quality sleep can be challenging. Physical activity helps metabolize stress hormones. In my view, simply walking or doing a gentle yoga class is better than extreme body-blasting workouts. Over-exercising can add to your stress by increasing corti-sol levels, and it can also be hard on your body. think logically and remind myself why I'm feeling this way, that this feeling will pass, that I'm going to be OK. Another helpful tool for me is deep breathing \u2014taking slow, meas- ured breaths instead of short, shallow ones. When doing these exercises, it's important to use the diaphragm and to let your chest and tummy move in and out. Meditation also helps relieve my anxiety. I have a 10-minute recorded meditation exercise saved on my phone that I listen to. It's all about emptying your mind of thoughts and worries and stresses. One thing I plan to get back to doing during my time off work is a regu-lar exercise routine. Physical activity boosts those all-important endorphins (the brain's \"feel-good\" chemicals) and makes me feel rested and at ease. I've also noticed a big difference in the last few weeks (since my leave started) as a result of being in my own comfortable surroundings, taking long walks, get- ting a lot of rest and meditating on my rooftop surrounded by nature. TASLEEM KASSAM Naturopathic doctor, Calgary Although being HIV positive can understandably set you up for feeling anxious, the flip side is that it might force you to take good care of your - self, which can go a long way toward relieving stress and anxiety. A cornerstone of mental health is proper digestion, as well as good over - all health. There's a strong connection between the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract and the nervous system, which prob-ably explains the terms \"gut feeling\" and \"having butterflies in your stom- ach.\" About 95 percent of the \"feel-good\" hormone serotonin is made in the gut, but our natural gut flora is constantly being challenged by the processed and genetically modified foods we eat. To help replenish good gut microbes, I recommend probiotics, such as lactobacillus (Acidophilus). Look for Good Manufacturing Prac- tice ( GMP) certification to ensure the highest-quality probiotic supplements.

But I didn't start having anxiety until my depres-sion worsened a few years ago. Now, my anxiety and depression seem to go hand in hand. To really tackle these issues, I've taken a leave from my job providing support to women living with HIV in prisons. As with anyone, I think that stress is at the root of my anxiety. I tend to catastrophize things. For example, if something happens that shouldn't really be a big deal, I make a huge issue of it and I become anxious about everything. When I feel rushed, I get over - whelmed. My most stressful times are in the morning when getting ready for work. If I know I have to be some-where at a certain time, I get the sweats. Some of my anxiety has to do with being around people or having to socialize. And part of my anxiety relates to worrying about my son, who is 20 years old and is now dealing with his own life issues. But I've developed some tools to manage my anxiety. Using these strat-egies has really helped me hold things together over the last two years. If I start to feel anxious, I take a few moments to \"talk myself down.\" I try to Support groups allow you to see your issues from a different angle and that it's possible to come to a better place.28 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014W earing a traditional African gown and hat, professional cellist Robert Bardston walks the audience through the chapters of his fascinating life story, stopping to play Bach's Suites for Solo Cello or to sing Negro spirituals that reflect his outlook at the time. Bardston, 63, spent three months reliving his life to create \"Music and Musings from the Life of a 27-Year Survivor,\" a mix of music and personal anecdotes that he first performed at the 2012 Inter - national AIDS Conference in Washing- ton, D.C., and then later at venues in Canadian cities. Looking back on his life opened wounds but also relieved pain and boosted his self-image. \"It was cathartic and it made me grow up,\" Bardston says. \"And the audience reaction made me realize how special my life has been.\" Born in 1950 in the projects of Louisville, Kentucky, Bardston's life began amid tragedy. When he was nine months old, his father, a baker and amateur musician, was shot to death in an alley after a night of gam-bling at a local bar. In an obvious act of racism, police chose not to investi- gate. The family's financial troubles became worse after his father's mur - der. \"We were very poor\u2014and besides, entertainment venues were restricted to whites only\u2014so we had to learn how to entertain ourselves at home.\" Bardston says. \"I sang spirituals con-stantly. It was my world.\" By the time he was six, Bardston sang solo as the opening act for trav-elling gospel quartets. By age nine, he was conducting his church's male choir. And at 18, he became the first ART POSI +IVESharing the experience of living with HIV through creative works black member of a professional sym- phony orchestra in the southern United States. Bardston's passion for music led him to Montreal in 1970, where a Canadian professor offered him a full scholarship to McGill University after watching him audition in Louisville. This profes- sor became Bardston's men tor, pair - ing him with a talented pianist for a whirlwind of concerts that lasted until Bardston completed the first of his five degrees (including a doctorate) in cello performance and won a fellowship to study anywhere he wanted in Europe. Bardston chose to study under master cellist Andr\u00e9 Navarra in Germany. Life in Europe was mesmerizing, Bards-ton recalls\u2014\"like diving into a cultural pond that I didn't know existed.\" It was also a catastrophe. He felt completely ill-prepared to compete against a group of world-class cellists in a class led by one of the world's greatest cello pedagogues, where lessons were often taught in Navarra's native French and all the other stu-dents spoke several languages (a skill Bardston has since acquired\u2014he is now fluent in French and German and speaks Italian as well). Although he didn't realize it at the time, he was also subconsciously stripping himself of all African-American traits in an effort to fit into the whiter-than-white classical music community. On top of all this, he was constantly subjected to racism in Germany, and, perhaps even more significantly, he was battling untreated schizophre- nia, a cruel disease that preyed on his insecurity. \"The most horrifying experience is to play a concert and hear a voice constantly saying: 'You're stupid. No one wants to hear you any-way. They're all making fun of you. Why are you such a fool to think you could play a classical instrument?'\" After suffering a confidence breakdown, Bardston left Germany 18 months into his fellowship and returned briefly to Montreal before following a high school crush on a whim to a hippie commune in Wash-ington, D.C. The people there gave him what he desperately needed: accept- ance, empathy and understanding. \"It was pure therapy for me\" he says. \"It changed my life. It set me on the road to finding myself and finding out what I could offer the world.\" It also gave him the confidence to return to music. One night in Washington, he attended a performance of his former teacher, Andr\u00e9 Navarra, who told him that he really should be in Germany. \"With that one line, everything changed,\" Bardston says. \"I packed my clothes and went back.\" This time, he practised vehemently until he reached the level of Navarra's class. Suddenly, accolades began to come his way and he performed live on CBC television and radio in 1980. Bardston was recognized for his lyrical approach and his detailed knowledge of the cultural and historical context of the music he played. Bardston credits his older sister Lois for his pursuit of perfection. \"It all started at a little red table at home,\" he recalls, \"where we played school, long before I ever went to school.\" Lois, the \"teacher,\" taught Bardston and his two cousins about striving for excel- lence. \"She was a tough taskmaster,\" he laughs. \"We called her the Warden. She was a benevolent controller who insisted on being your best at all times. Her high standards influenced my music and other facets of my life, too.\" Upon completing his fellowship with Navarra he returned to Montreal where he met and fell in love with the young ambitious filmmaker Claude Lavoie, on Valentine's Day in 1985. (Lavoie even-tually made fils The Bard's The Music Man Virtuoso cellist Robert Bardston, a long-term survivor in more ways than one, hits a high note. by Jenn IFer M CPhee 29 Winter 2014 THE POSITIVE SIDESon).) The same year, Bardston won an artist-in-residence post at Medicine Hat College, in Alberta. Unfortunately, it was also the year that Bardston and Lavoie were diagnosed with HIV. \"I completely rejected the doctor tell-ing me that I was going to die in five years,\" Bardston says. \"I thought he was crazy. A gay disease? Whoever heard of a disease that attacked only one part of the population?\" Bardston, in a classic state of denial, immersed himself in his music to keep it that way: \"I had the perfect distrac-tion from HIV. I was living the life I had always wanted: I had a position at a post-secondary institution. I was play- ing around the country as a soloist. My students were winning major compe-titions, so I felt like I had really offered he found himself in one of the most artistically productive periods of his life, he sank into severe depression and self-destructive patterns. Twice, he attempted suicide. After the second attempt in 2010, Bardston spent five months in the hospital, at which point he began taking antidepressants and other mood stabilizers. A friend, Dr. Hank Hak, began coming to the hos- pital for music lessons, which helped bring Bardston back to life. \"That was a (re)turning point in my life,\" he says. \"Music made the difference.\" After his recovery, Bardston made a conscious decision to use his time and talents to advocate for others living with HIV and mental health issues. He created Music and Musings and was recently invited to perform at a confer - ence in Edmonton hosted by several HIV groups. On weekends, he leads discussion groups in Medicine Hat that give people a chance to talk openly about living with mental health issues. And he is co-chair of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Black, African and Caribbean Network, made up of organizations dedicated to ending the AIDS epidemic among African, Caribbean and Black populations in Canada. Whenever possible, Bardston speaks out about the older generation of people living with HIV who survived the horrific predictions of the '80s only to find themselves dealing with painful exclusion and the loss of loved ones as they age. \"There is an intrin-sic penchant for hopelessness in this age group that requires, and is only relieved by, the empathy of the entire PHA community,\" he says. \"This gener - ation of long-term survivors needs the acceptance and protection of society to accept and protect itself.\" More than anything, he wants survivors like him-self to realize they aren't alone. \"My job as an advocate?\" he says during Music and Musings. \"Simply to share my mantra: I'm here and I'm staying for a while.\" Jennifer McPhee is a freelance writer who contributes regularly to The Positive Side.

And, on the domestic side, I had a partner who loved me and I loved him to the nth degree.\" All this changed when Lavoie grew sick and passed away in 1999. Although they had separated by then, they were still close. In fact, days before his death, Lavoie tried to give Bardston a book of photographs of their years together, but Bardston brushed him off in anger. \"I have enor - mous regrets,\" Bardston says. \"I regret that when he was trying to make that final loving statement of his life to me, I was too afraid to think of him dying to return that generosity.\" After Lavoie's death, Bardston's own health, both physical and emo-tional, began to fail and so did a promising new relationship. Though PHOTO: COLIN WAY30 THE POSITIVE SIDE Winter 2014 Birds of a FeatherW hen I take pictures of birds, I try to capture something a little different\u2014not just a bird sitting on a branch, but their movement and personality. I took this shot while walking through the Arbor - etum in Guelph, Ontario. I caught these two dark-eyed Juncos in the split second that they were fighting for a position on the bird house. When taking pictures, I'm not thinking of HIV. For me, photography is an escape from thinking about HIV. I am online most of my day, writing about it and shar - ing information as a social media coordin - ator for PositiveLite.com. Taking pictures is my \"me\" time\u2014my time for self-care, exercise and sometimes socializing. After an episode of stress several years ago that caused my CD4 count to drop, I had to leave my job and start treatment. I needed something to do, a hobby. I hadn't picked up a camera for many years but had always liked photo-graphy. So I bought myself a good cam - era and started hiking the trails around Guelph, snapping everything that caught my eye. Photography gets me out of the house and keeps me grounded, giving me a place in this world. HIV could have made me live in isolation, but taking pictures has become a social activity. I meet other photographers, as well as people who are just curious about what I'm photo - graphing. Most days I head out for one of my hikes, it's five to seven hours before I return, with more than 200 photos on the camera to keep me busy sifting through them and editing them the rest of the night.
