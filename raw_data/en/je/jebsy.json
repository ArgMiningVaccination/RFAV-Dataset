Caring for people with multiple, frequentlytransient and often undifferentiated problems over along period of time in a range of settings is what familyphysicians do. A patient may experience illness in any ofthe organ systems. The job of the family physician iskeep that patient well as a whole person. A number of organizational and clinical issues may be remembered as representative in family medicine in1997. Rural medicine continues to move forward politi-cally and in its research base. The restructuring of ourhealth care system and the distribution of physicians stillpreoccupy us. The promotion of evidence-based medi-cine and the consequent development of clinical practiceguidelines continue to charm some and worry others. Al-ternative or complementary medicine is always lookingover the clinician's shoulder as an option for patients.The physician-patient interaction continues to be stud-ied. And, on a very practical front, we finally seem tohave a logical, evidence-based approach to the manage-ment of a common presenting problem: sore throat. The Canadian Journal of Rural Medicine , a peer-reviewed scientific journal and the voice of the Society of RuralPhysicians of Canada, has completed its first full year inpublication. The lack of a clear, quantitative definition of\"rural\" has made comparisons of findings from researchstudies difficult and has hindered the development of ruralhealth policy. However, we may take heart in the fact thatLeduc 1has developed a General Practice Rurality Index (GPRI) for Canada. The index incorporates 6 variables:remoteness from the closest advanced referral centre; re-moteness from the closest basic referral centre; drawingpopulation; number of general practitioners; number ofspecialists; and the presence of an acute care hospital. Thisprovides, for the first time, a means of mapping the wholeof Canada according to quantitative scores (out of 100).Maps similar to contour or population distribution mapscould be developed on the basis of these scores and used tofacilitate rural health care planning and research.A Canada-wide survey by Hayward and colleagues 2as- sessed physicians' attitudes toward and confidence in clinicalpractice guidelines. Survey respondents were generally posi-tive about guidelines if they were issued by physician organi-zations but were wary of those issued by ministries of healthor health insurance plans. Most respondents felt they were auseful source of information but actually used them onlyabout once a month \u2014 much less frequently than more tra-ditional sources of information such as books and journals. Itseems that \u2014 with some caution and a little concern aboutlosing autonomy \u2014 physicians agree that clinical practiceguidelines are good and potentially useful, but have not yetreally incorporated them into their practice. The develop-ment and dissemination of guidelines are going well, but their actual implementation will take more time. Alternative therapies are on the rise, running the gamut from \"reasonable changes in lifestyle and relaxation meth-ods to patently absurd practices such as iridology, crystalhealing, and colonic irrigation.\" 3Millar4analysed data from 17 626 respondents to the 1994-95 National Popula-tion Health Survey related to the use of alternative healthcare practitioners, including chiropractors, by CanadiansFamily medicine14835 December 15/97 157 (12) 1667 \u00a9 1997 Canadian Medical AssociationA practical foundation Marshall S.

Absence of cough? History of fever over 38 \u00b0C (101\u00b0F)? Tonsillar exudate? Swollen, tender anterior cervical nodes?over 15 years of age. Fifteen percent received some form of alternative health care in the year preceding the survey.Use of alternative health care services was most prevalentamong women, people aged 45 to 64 years and those inhigher income groups. Although only 9% of people free ofchronic disease consulted alternative health care providers,26% of people with 3 or more chronic conditions did.Family physicians are faced daily with patients who havesought help from alternative practitioners or are seekingadvice on whether they should. Medical training does notdeal with alternative paradigms or ways of thinking of ourbody and the healing process. Should they be addressed inmedical school? Should we accept them or insist on evi-dence? After all, we expect evidence from researchers andpractitioners in our own field! Of course, much of what wedo in medicine lacks clear evidence \u2014 but it at least makessense to us, from within our own frame of reference. For years the approach to sore throats in family practice has been controversial. Some clinicians felt that they coulddiagnose streptococcal pharyngitis clinically in a high per-centage of cases. Others did studies that showed thatphysicians' judgements were about as accurate as flipping acoin. There really is just 1 question: \"Is it strep throat?\" Ifnot, it's likely a virus and grandmother's remedy is as goodas ours. If it isstrep throat, then penicillin is needed to de- crease the patient's likelihood of acquiring rheumatic heartdisease. Should we take a throat swab from everyone andwait for the results? Should we give everyone antibiotics?Should we take swabs periodically to get a sense of what iscirculating in the community? Should we take the \"bestguess\" approach, treating patients that we think have strepthroat and ignoring or taking swabs from the rest? After adetailed review of the literature and a survey of physicians'practice patterns, McIsaac and colleagues 5-7have come up with a scheme that is reasonably evidence based, and thatseems to be acceptable to most physicians (see table). Theyhave developed a means of assigning a sore throat score tothe patient; on the basis of this score, the likelihood thatthe patient has strep throat can be determined. They alsosuggest what course of action to take on the basis of thescore. This model should become the standard by whichwe approach sore throats in family practice. Once again it has been shown that we should avoid episiotomies if at all possible. This is particularly true formedian episiotomies. Labrecque and colleagues 8demon- strated in a retrospective cohort study that median epi-siotomies were strongly associated with third- andfourth-degree perineal lacerations in primiparous wo-men. An episiotomy should be done primarily to facil-itate the birth of a baby in distress; even then, mediolat-eral, not median, episiotomy should be performed. McWhinney 9and others have been discussing and studying the concept of the patient-centred approach tothe physician-patient encounter for a number of years now. The patient-centred approach is taught in most res-idency programs and is accepted as a core concept by theCollege of Family Physicians of Canada, which bases thescoring of oral exams largely upon it. But the most con-vincing proof that the patient-centred approach gets tothe very essence of how family medicine should be con-ducted is the fact that a group of general practitioners inEurope have come up with a nearly identical model. Al-though the language used is slightly different, it is essen-tially the same concept. It has 9 steps that can be remem-bered by the mnemonic P-R-A-C-T-I-C-A-L. 10The letters stand for Prior to the visit, Relationship, Anxieties,Common language, T ranslating, Interaction, Converting,Agreement check and Leave. An explanation of each ofthese terms is beyond the scope of this brief review, butsuffice it to say that it involves a step-by-step model forconducting the patient interview in general practice. The research and philosophical basis of family medi- cine is evolving with each passing year. Information fromthe Insitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Ontario 11 shows that family physicians account for 41% of OHIP(Ontario Health Insurance Plan) expenditure on physi-cians and for over 50% of all physician-patient encoun-ters. Nevertheless, only about 5% to 10% of articles pub-lished in 1996 in general medical journals were related toprimary care or family medicine. The challenge for thefuture is for family physicians to increase their researchand publication output to strengthen the evidence-basedfoundation on which family medicine is built. References 1.
