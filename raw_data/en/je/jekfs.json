Summarize this article for a 10 years old Alternative cancer treatment describes any [cancer](/en/Cancer) treatment or practice that is not part of the conventional standard of cancer care. [[2]](#cite_note-2) These include special diets and exercises, chemicals, [herbs](/en/Herb), devices, and manual procedures. Most alternative cancer treatments do not have high-quality evidence supporting their use and many have been described as fundamentally [pseudoscientific](/en/Pseudoscience). [[3]](#cite_note-pseudoscientific-3) [[4]](#cite_note-Vickers_2008-4) [[5]](#cite_note-Grimes2022-5) [[6]](#cite_note-Ernst2001-6) Concerns have been raised about the safety of some purported treatments and some have been found unsafe in clinical trials. Despite this, many [untested and disproven treatments](/en/List_of_unproven_and_disproven_cancer_treatments) are used around the world. Promoting or marketing such treatments is illegal in most of the developed world.[ [citation needed](/en/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Alternative cancer treatments are typically contrasted with [experimental cancer treatments](/en/Experimental_cancer_treatment) - science-based treatment methods - and complementary treatments, which are non-invasive practices used in combination with conventional treatment. All approved [chemotherapy](/en/Chemotherapeutic) medications were considered experimental treatments before completing safety and efficacy testing.[ [citation needed](/en/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Since the late 19th century, medical researchers have established modern cancer care through the [development of chemotherapy](/en/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy), [radiation therapy](/en/Radiation_therapy), only 32.9% of cancer patients in the [United States](/en/United_States) died within five years of their diagnosis. [[7]](#cite_note-7) Despite their effectiveness, many conventional treatments are accompanied by a wide range of side effects, including pain, fatigue, and nausea. [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) Some side effects can even be life-threatening.[ [citation needed](/en/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Many supporters of alternative treatments claim increased effectiveness and decreased side effects when compared to conventional treatments. However, one retrospective cohort study showed that patients using alternative treatments instead of conventional treatments were 2.5 times more likely to die within five years. [[10]](#cite_note-:4-10) Most alternative cancer treatments have not been tested in proper clinical trials. Among studies that have been published, the quality is often poor. A 2006 review of 196 clinical trials that studied unconventional cancer treatments found a lack of early-phase testing, little rationale for dosing regimens, and poor statistical analyses.
