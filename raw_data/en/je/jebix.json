UHD is the second largest public university in Houston and it has been recognized as a leader in community service by being named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for the past six years by the Corporation for National Community Service.

UHD also offers classes at Lone Star College -CyFair, Lone Star Coll ege-Atascocita Center, Lone Star College -Kingwood, and UHD Northwest at Lone Star College -University Park. UHD's weekend and evening classes are also available. The nature of the UHD student population prepares individuals to thrive in the multicultural workplace of the 21st century. UHD students are diverse in every sense of the word - ethnicity, age, financial background and life situation. UHD's campus has grown considerably since the institution was founded in 1974. The campus includes the historic O ne Main Building, the Academic Buildin g, the Commerce Street Building, the Shea Street Building, the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Building, and the restored Willow Street Pump Station. UHD's History and Future on the Bayou UHD is creating an exciting futur e based on a fascinating past. The University's history began in 1974, when the assets of the private South Texas Junior College were transferred to the University of Houston. By 1979, the Texas Legislature approved the new institution as a separate entity within the University of Houston System. In 1983, the name was changed to the University of Houston -Downtown. Today, UHD is the second largest institution in the Univer sity of Houston System, which includes four dis tinct univer sities: the 8 University o f Houston, University of Houston -Clear Lake, the University of Houston -Downtown, and the University of Houston - Victoria. All four institutions are gov erned by the University of Houston System Board of Regents. The chief adminis trative officer at each u niversity is its president. The history of the University's campus goes back even farther. The campus' One Main Building was constructed in 1929 on the banks of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. Then known as the Merchants and Manufacturers Building, the building served the city for decades as a center for commerce and man ufacturing. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. UHD's facilities have continued to change since the University's incep tion. In the late 1990s, UHD added the Acad emic Building - with more than 40 classrooms and lecture halls, the Technology Teaching and Learning Center, the Wilhelmina Cullen Robertson Auditorium and a food court. While the Academic Building was taking shape, so was the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Ce nter, a state -of-the-art facility devoted to student health, rec reation and fitness. In 2004, the University opened the Commerce Street Building, which houses the College of Public Service, classrooms, academic labs, computer labs, meeting spaces and fac ulty offices. In fall 2007, the University opened yet another showcase facility, the Shea Street Building at the corner of Main and Shea St reets. The new home for UHD's College of Business features a glass -enclosed entrance that provides stunning views o f Houston's downtown skyline. Adjoining this award -winning new building is a multi -story parking facility. UHD students enjoy the excitement of the nation's fourth largest city, including being just minutes away from Minute Maid Par k, the Toyota Center, world -class museums and art galleries, and a wide assortment of restaurants and sidewalk cafes. Getting to and around campus is easy for students with UHD's free shuttle bus, the city's light rail line that stops at the University's fro nt door, and easy ac cess from two interstate highways. UHD's wireless campus provides faculty, staff and students with optimum service and flexibility. In addition to applying for admission and registering for classes online, students can handle much of the \"business\" of goin g to college from laptops or desktops while at home or at school. And connectivity makes it easy to meet online with other students for group projects and classes. Since its founding, the University of Houston -Downtown has continued to grow and provide deg rees, programs and facilities to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff. It is all part of UHD's commitment to providing access and opportunity to higher ed ucation.

Method of Payment Students shall be provided with two alternative methods of pay ment of tuition and mandatory fees for each semester for which they are enrolled. Full payment of all tuition and mandator y fees prior to the beginning of the semester, or Installment Plan Fall and Spring semesters - Up to seven equal payments with the first payment plus a $24 or $16 installment fee (depending on plan option) to be made in advance of the beginning of the se mester , the remaining payments to be made monthly , and the final payment to be made before the last day of the semester. There will be a $10 late fee added for each install ment payment not received by the due date and a $50 default fee added for any rem aining balance at the end of the semester . Summer semesters - Up to three equal payments with the first payment plus a $24 or $16 installment fee (depending on plan option) to be made in advance of the beginning of the summer term and the final payment t o be made before the last day of the term. There will be a $10 late fee added for each install ment payment not received by the due date. May/Winter Mini semesters - Up to two equal payments w ith the first payment plus a $16 installment fee to be made in advanc e of the beginning of the term and the final payment to be made before the last day of the term . There will be a $10 late fee added for each install ment payment not received by the due date. Installment pay ment plans are available at the Cashier' s Office or online through Student e -Services under the My Payment option . Enrollment in an installment payment plan is equivalent to acknowledgement of financial responsibility for 37 the semester. Students are only eligible for one installment plan option p er semester. Once the installment plan is executed for the semester, it cannot be altered. Any charges incurred after the execution of the installment plan are due immediately, Additional charges that are incurred and not paid in full with the next install ment are subject to being assessed a $10 late fee. Payment may be made by cash, check or credit card. Payment may be made in person, by mail, online (credit/debit card or eche ck) or through the payment drop box located in the hall next to the cashier's o ffice on the third floor of the One Main Building . Credit card payment (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover) may be made over the web via UHD's Student e -services (www.uhd.edu ) or by fax to 713 -223-7437 (authorization form available at (https://www.uhd.edu/student - resources/cashiers/Pages/cashiers -forms.aspx ). Please remember tha t mailed payments must be received by the posted payment deadlines to avoid having classes dropped or late fees assessed. UHD does not receive mail on Saturday, so payments must be received by Friday for Saturday deadlines. The University of Houston Syst em charges a processing fee on all credit card transactions. The processing fee is assessed on all credit card brands. The processing fee imposed is not greater than the University's applicable merchant discount rate for cre dit card transactions. The cred it card processing fee is assessed to Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Gift Cards, PrePaid Cards, and Check Cards. This fee is assessed on all credit card transactions that occur online or in person at the Cashier's Office. Health Insurance fees shall be paid p rior to the beginning of the semester. Most financial aid awards will be credited to your account automatically once processing is completed and you are registered for the same number of hours for which you are awarded. It is the student's responsibilit y to check their account statement to ensure that their funds have been posted to their account before the payment deadline. If financial aid has not been posted, the student must make the payment or other arrangements with the Cashier's Office or online by the deadline to avoid losing their classes. Student account statements can be viewed through UHD's Student e -services (www.uhd.edu ), My Payment option. Students receiving financial aid equal to, or in excess of, the total amount of tuition and fees prior to the beginning of th e semester may not participate in the installment plan. The full payment of tuition and fees for the semester in which they are enrolled must be made upon issuance of that semester's financial aid funds before any excess amounts will be refunded. Withdrawal from the university, for whatever reason, will not cancel the obligation to pay the full amount of the installment plan. If the amount of tuition and fees credited as a result of withdrawal is less than the remaining balance of an installment plan, the balance remaining is still the obligation of the student. If the credited a mount is more than the balance of an installment plan, the remaining credit will be refunded to the student. Any student who has elected to pay tuition and fees by installment, and who is delinquent in making payment by the final inst allment due date, is barred from registering at any institution in the University of Houston System until full payment, including delin quent charges, has been made. Each university maintains records and informs other institutions about the status of payments should the stude nt attempt to register for courses or pursue a degree at any other component of the University of Houston System. An additional default fee of $50 is collected from any student who fails to make all installment payments by the end of the s emester. This f ee, in addition to all other amounts due, must be paid prior to the student's registering for courses during a subsequent semester. Financial Responsibility Students are required to meet all financial responsibilities to the university . An outstanding deb t at any university within the University of Houston System (UH, UH -Clear Lake, UH -Downtown or UH -Victoria) will prohibit a student from enrolling in or the release of an official transcript or diploma from all Univ ersity of Houston System Institutions . Establishing a payment agreement with the University does not satisfy the conditions necessary to receive credit for courses completed or for the release of an off icial transcript or diploma. Students are required to complete an electronic Financial Responsi bility Agreement each semester upon registration. This statement outlines the terms and conditions of the financial responsibilities and obligations associated w ith attending the university 38 Returned Checks Students who write checks to the university on ac counts with insuffi cient funds are assessed a $20 service charge for each such check, regardless of the amount , and may be referred to law enforcement authorities and/or credit bureaus . If a check is returned as a result of bank error, the student must contact their bank for reimburse ment of the $20 returned check charge paid to the university. If such a check is presented in payment of tuition and fees, the payment will be reversed from the student account and the st udent will be subject to all applicabl e late fee and drop dates. Failure to make a valid payment by the drop date WILL result in loss of registration and a reinstatement charge may be required before reenrollment is approved. Financial Hold Removal Students must clear financial holds with all University of Houston System Institutions before credit can be granted for coursework completed and an official transcript or diploma released. There is a minimum 15 -day hold on all personal check/electronic check payments which will prevent the releas e of an official transcript or diploma. Cross -campus financial hold removal can take 2 -24 hours to be updated across all UH System Campuses. It is the student's responsibility to contact the UHD -Cashier's Office to request financial hold removal after paym ent has been submitted. Collections A student who does not meet financial responsibilities to the uni versity may be subject to withdrawal from classes and may be referred to an outside collection agency. . Once an account is referred to a collection age ncy, the student is responsible for payment of additional collection fees. The student agrees to reimburse the university the fees of any collection agency, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33.3% of the debt, and all costs and expenses, i ncluding reasonable attorney's fees, the university incurs in such collection efforts Refunds All refunds are processed through HigherOne, the issuer of your HigherOne Card.

The programs include scholar ships, grants, loans and part-time employment, which may be awarded in various combinations and amounts to meet individual student needs. Because funds are limited in many programs, it is importan t to begin the application process early and complete the necessary applications pro perly and on time. To receive priority consideration for Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant and all state and institutional grant funds, all necessary applications must be on f ile in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by April 1 of each year. M ost federal and state aid is awarded on the basis of proven financial need rather than academic achievement. Most scholar ships are awarded on the basis of academic achievement, talents and special skills rather than proven financial need. Financial Aid Programs http://www.uhd.edu/financial/ University of Houston -Downtown participates in the following federal, state and institutional programs. Most programs have limited funds so early application is encouraged . 40 Grants Federal Pell Grant. A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or a professional degree. The maximum can change each award year and depends on program funding. The amount awarded, though, will depend not only on the student's financial need, but also on their costs to attend school, status as a full -time or part -time student, and plans to attend school for a full academic year or less. Federa l Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program is for undergraduates with exceptional financial need. Pell Grant recipients with the lowest Estimated Family Contributions will be considered fi rst for a FSEOG. Just like Pell Grants, the FSEOG does not have to be repaid TEXAS Grant .

Other forms or documentation may be required to determine eligibility for state and/or federal programs. When completing the FAFSA, students should list UHD's school code (003612) in St ep Six. Once a student has begun the application process, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify the student of missing forms and/or doc umentation by e -mail. Students will also be e -mailed an award letter to their gator mail account when their eligibility for aid has been finalized. Students may also access their financial aid information online at www.uhd.edu/eservices . Certain categories of foreign -born and immigrant students in the state of Texas can meet state requirements for residency. Such students are able to pay the resident tuition rate while attending public institutions of higher education in Texas. If a stu dent falls into 41 this category he/she will need to complete the Texas Applicat ion for State Aid (TASFA). The form is available online at http://www.uhd.edu/financial/documents/1516/1516_tasfa.pdf. Direct Lending Procedures Getting Started: 1. Important: You will need your Department of Education issued PIN (the same PIN used for the FAFSA) in order to complete and electronically sign your electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) under the Direct Loan Program. If you have forgotten your PIN or do not yet have one, please go to www.pin.ed.gov to have your PIN sent to you. 2. Have your social security number, date of birth, and driver's license number accessible. 3. You will also be required to provide two personal references (full name, address, and telephone number) whom you have known for at least thr ee years. Each reference provided must reside at a different U.S. address as well as different from the student's address. Complete an Electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) To complete your eMPN, you will need to go to https://www.uhd.edu/financial/Doc uments/1516_tasfa.pdf and click on \"Complete New MPN for Student Loans\". Remember that you will need your Department of Education issued PIN to begin the process. An eMPN can be completed in 9 steps. We estimate that it will take 30 minutes to complete th e eMPN process. Make sure you allow enough time to complete the entire process in a single session. If you exit the web site before submitting your signed MPN in Step 8 and return later, you'll have to start over beginning with Step 1. Step 1. PIN Registration Step 2. Disclosure and Consent Step 3. Provide Name and School Step 4. Complete MPN Step 5. Review/Read Draft MPN Step 6. Sign Your MPN Step 7. Review signed MPN/Enter Confirmation Code Step 8. Confirm Acceptance of MPN Terms and Submit MPN Step 9. Success! Now Print Your MPN Once you complete the eMPN process correctly, UHD will receive notification electronically that you have completed your MPN. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement authorization process. Complete a Loan Entrance Counseling (LEC) To complete your LEC, you will need to go to https://www.uhd.edu/financial/Documents/1516_tasfa.pdf and click on \"Complete Loan Entrance Counseling\". Remember that you will need your Department of Education issued PIN to begin the process. Your LEC includes information ab out all of your past student loans as well as helps you to see the amount you will owe based on that previous total. This is required every academic year that you borrow loans. Once you complete the LEC process correctly, UHD will receive notification elec tronically that you have completed your LEC. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement authorization process. Direct Lending Disbursement Requirements Federal regulations require that all Direct Loans (su bsidized, unsubsidized and PLUS) must be disbursed in two disbursements based on your enrollment period. Direct Loans that are processed for a single semester will be paid in two installments, one at the beginning of the semester and the remaining payment at the midpoint of the semester. The first disbursement for first -time, first -year borrowers will be 30 days after the beginning of the first semester enrolled at least half -time. 42 Other Eligibility Requirements UHD Degree -Seeking Student Requirement In order to receive financial aid, students must make progress toward their degree as defined by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. There are three components to academic progress: Grade Point Requirement Undergraduate students must achieve and ma intain at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average on all course work attempted at UHD. Graduate students must achieve and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion Requirement Students must complete at least 73% of all course work attempted. Time Frame Requirement Students may attempt up to 170 hours without earning a degree. Students who have earned their first bachelor's degree are all owed 150% of the hours remaining to complete their program. A complete copy of the Satisfactory Academic Progre ss Policy is available upon request. Please read this policy to see how progress will be monitored. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid is required to review students' entire academic records (regardless of the age of the record or whether or not aid was received) to determine compliance. Students found not to be in compliance will be notified in writing of any denial/suspension and the appropriate appeal procedure. Dropping Classes Students' final eligibility for aid will be based on the number of hours for which they are enrolled on the Official Day of Record listed in the Class Schedule . If they register and then drop classes prior to that date, their eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED on the remaining hours as of the Official Day of Reco rd. Since financial aid is released prior to the Official Day of Record, stu dents who receive a financial aid payment based on more hours than those remaining as of the Official Day of Record may be responsible for repaying a portion of any financial aid received. Dropping classes may affect students' eligibility for future aid. Students should consult the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy to determine if dropping classes will affect their eligibility for aid. Total Withdrawal from School For student s who register and then totally withdraw from all classes, eli gibility for aid will be RECALCULATED based on the number of days they attended class. If they totally withdraw from all classes prior to the first class day, they must repay any and all financ ial aid received. If they withdraw on or after the first class day, they may have to repay a portion of any financial aid receive d. Students who have failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes are considered to have totally withdrawn from sch ool and may have to repay a portion of any financial aid received. See Return of Title IV Funds below. Students who totally withdraw should consult the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress to deter mine if their withdrawal will affect their eligib ility for future aid. Administrative Drops For students who have been administratively dropped from classes for non -attendance, eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED based on the number of hours for which enrollment remains. If student is dropped from all courses, ALL aid will be removed from student's account resulting in a balance to the university. Return of Title IV Funds The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 changed the for mula for calculating the amount of aid a student and school can retain when the student totally withdraws from all classes or fails to earn a passing grade in any of the current semester's classes. Students who withdraw from all classes prior to completing 60% of the semester will have their eligibility for aid recalculat ed bas ed on the percent of the semester completed. For example, a student who withdraws completing only 30% of the term will have \"earned\" only 30% of any Title IV aid received. The remaining 70% must be returned by the school and/or the stu dent. A student who fails to earn a passing grade in any of his/her courses will have their eligibility recalculated based on the midpoint of the semester or the last date of participation in an academically related activity. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid enco urages you to obtain a complete copy of this policy from the office and read it carefully. If you are thinking about withdraw ing 43 from all classes PRIOR to completing 60% of the semester, you should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to see how your withdrawal will affect your financial aid. Academic Scholarships Academic scholarships at UHD are intended to recog nize and reward outstanding achievement and community involvement. Applicants for most scholarships, therefore, do not need to s how evidence of financial need to apply. The applica tion deadline for most UHD scholarships is April 1 of each academic year. However, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid may accept applications at other times during the year if scholarship funds are available. Interested students should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as soon as they decide to apply for admission at UHD to find out what scholarships are availab le. Many academic departments at UHD also award scholarships. Stud ents are encouraged to contact the department of their major to find out what depart mental scholarships are available. Tuition and Fee Exemptions Hazlewood Act for Veterans State law provides that a veteran who is a legal Texas resident is exempted from tuition and certain required fees, but not from deposits. The veteran must meet the following criteria: resides in Texas for a period of not less than 12 months prior to the date of registration; served in the armed forces or in certain auxiliary service s for more than 180 days; was a bona fide legal Texas resident at the time of entering such service; was honorably discharged (except those who were dis charged because of being over the age of 38 or because of personal request); exhausted all veteran's educational benefits; is not eligible for federal grants, including federally sponsored grants provided for veterans by the US government; and is not in default on any federal or state student loans. To obtain this exemption, the veteran must submit a n application with attached evidence to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the Official Day of Record of the term for which the veteran is applying for the Hazlewood benefits. Hazlewood applica tions must be renewed each year. Financial Aid Dis bursements The dollar amounts listed on your award letter are generally based on full -time enrollment. The amount of aid authorized for disbursement to your student account will be based on your actual credit hour enrollment. With the exception of Federal or State Work -Study, financial aid processed by the Financial Aid Office will automatically be disbursed to your student account given you have completed the Terms and Conditions requirement. The Student Accounting and Cashiers Office will deduct incurred costs (tuition, fees, and other authorized charges) from the financial aid that is credited to your account. Any remaining financia l aid is refunded to you by the Student Accounting and Cashiers Office. The Financial Aid Office will authorize disbursement no earlier than 10 days prior to the start of classes for the semester. 44 Academic Policies Courses and Course Credit Course Load Maximum course loads are established to encourage students to think carefully about the amount of time they will need to de vote to each class. The following policies are in place so that students are better able to meet their course obligations successful ly. A standard undergraduate course load during the fall and spring terms is 15 to 16 semester credit hours, or five cours es. Twelve semester credit hours are considered the minimum full -time load. Students who are employed 40 hours per week should take no more than two courses, or six credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in 20 credit hours or more in a fall or spring t erm must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. The standard load for one summer session is six to eight credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in nine hours or more in a single summer ses sion or in two overlapping s ummer sessions must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. For information on the graduate course load, consult specific master's degree coordinator. Part-of-Term (PoT ) Effective Fall 2011, UHD began utilizing shorte r sessions, termed \"Part -of Term\" (PoT) within full terms. For more information about these offerings, please review the posted academic calendars on the UHD website (uhd.edu). Schedule Changes Schedule changes are made online, and may require approval b y an academic advisor. Registration instructions for Schedule Changes are found in on the UHD Registrar's Office website and the dates for Schedule Changes are found in the online Academic Calendar . Discontinued (Cancelled) Classes The university reserve s the right to discontinue classes or other wise alter the class schedule. Whenever possible, enrollment in an alternate course is completed through an administrative change form initiated by the department responsible for discon tinuing the class. Classi fication Undergraduate classification is determined by the number of credit hours which have been completed: 0 -29 hours: junior; and 90 semester hours and above: senior. Graduate classification is determined by admission status. Class Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions. The responsi bility for dropping a course lies with the student. Department s and faculty members may have additional attendance policies for their courses. Transfer Credit -Undergraduate Acceptance of Transfer Credit Transfer students must submit official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended as a part of the admission proc ess. Transfer credit evaluations will be perform ed during the admission process to the university. Course work transferred or accepted for credit toward an undergradu ate degree must be accredited by a recognized regional accrediting association and represent collegiate course work relevant to the degr ee, with course content and level of instruction resulting in student competencies at least equivalent to those of students enrolled in the institution's own undergraduate degree program. Workforce Education course work, both vocational and technical, m ay be accepted by some programs, depending on the specific program, provided these courses are from an accredited institution that is recognized by THECB. 45 Transfer courses determined to be substantially equivalent to a UHD course will be transferred as th e UHD course equivalent. Courses taken at other colleges that do not correspond to cours es offered by UHD may transfer as elective credit. The number of hours credited for a transferred course will be calculated as UHD equivalent hours. In the case that the number of transferred hours for a course is less than the number of hours required by UHD, the missing hours must be fulfilled under th e electives area of the degree plan . With the consent of the appropriate dean, the chair of the depart ment in whic h a student is majoring will make the decision concerning application of transfer credit to the degree program. Therefore declared majors should obtain approval from their degree - granting college before taking courses from a community or junior college whi ch they wish to transfer to UHD. In general, UHD does not award transfer credit for vocational courses that are not considered part of a standard col lege curriculum. Students may petition the academic dean of the college in which they are seeking their d egree, who may agree to award credit for such courses in exceptional circumstances. Students should direct questions concerning transfer credit to their academic advisor or degree program coordinator. Evaluation of Transfer Credit Transcripts will be evaluated for institutional transfer credit upon completion of the admission application process . For a course taken more than once, the highest grade will be transferred. Courses that have an F or W will not be accepted fo r transfer. Grades from the tran sfer institution, including any other university in the UH System, do not count toward the student's UHD GPA. Developmental courses do not transfer for credit but may allow the student to move forward. Transfer work will be further evaluated for applicabi lity to the student's chosen degree plan by the degree -granting college once the student has been accepted into the college as a declared major. Students who apply to UHD while they are attending another institution must submit two official transcripts. Th e first should be sent at the time of application and should reflect the student's current enrollment. A second must be sent as soon as grades are a vailable for those classes. Transferring Credits from Other Countries Students applying for admission with college credits from other countries must submit an evaluated transcript from a credential evaluation service recognized by the university. Credits will be granted based on the recommendations of the evaluating serv ice with respect to University of Housto n-Downtown degree requirements at the time of enrollment. Information and brochures from evaluating service agencies are avail able at the Office of Admissions and online at www.uhd.edu/admissions . Transfer Cr edit Dispute Resolution Procedures Students who receive written notification from Office of Admissions that a lower -level course taken at another Texas public institution of higher education has not been accepted may challenge denial of credit by UHD. To initiate a dispute action, a Transfer Dispute Resolution form must be completed. The form and instruc tions for its completion are available on the Office of Admission website. Credit by Examination UHD accepts up to 24 hours of credit by examination. Cr edit by examination may be obtained on the basis of several types of examinations. Nationally recognized standardized examinations such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP ), the College Board's Advanced Placement program , and International Bacca laureate (IB) may be used. Examinations widely used within a professional field and locally designed examinations also may be used. Students planning to take CLEP exams should do so before their final semester. Nationally standardized examinations are admi nistered through Testing Services; all other examinations are administered through the responsible department. 46 If credit is not awarded, a period of six months must elapse before application for re -examination will be considered. Appropriate fees are char ged for each examination. No student may attempt the exam for a particular course more than twice. Credit may be granted for professional certification and training received from armed forces and service schools. With consen t of the appropriate dean, the chair of the department in which the student is majoring will make the decision concerning the applicability of such courses to the degree program. Credit received by examination does not fulfill residency requirements for graduation. No grade is awarded for courses for which credit has been obtained by exam, nor are hours received for such courses included in the calculation of grade point average for graduation.

Credit for military courses an d/or credit is available to all admitted undergraduates. Either elective or direct course credit will be awarded based on ACE recommendations. Credit for Military Service (HB 269) HB 269 makes military veterans who enroll in Texas universities and who mee t certain requirements eligible to receive undergraduate college credit for the time they spent in the service. Eligible veterans receive college credit for all the req uired physical education courses needed for their degree and up to an additional 12 seme ster hours of elective coursework. To be eligible to receive credit under HB 269, veterans must have: Graduated from a public or private high school accredited by a generally recognized accrediting organization or from a high school operated by the United States Department of Defense . Completed at least two years of service in the armed forces (or discharged because of a disability) Been honorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces . Credit awarded under HB 269 is awarded for having served, not for colleg e-level courses that might have been taken while in the military. Acceptable forms of documentation include: AARTS Transcript (Army ACE Registry Transcript) CCAF Transcript (Community College of the Air Force Transcript) SMART Transcript (Sailor/Marine A CE Registry Transcript) Elective credit Directed Studies Courses A directed studies course allows students to work directly with a faculty member on an individual basis. This type of study i s intended to expand the curriculum and may not duplicate an or ganized course. A directed studies course requires a term paper, research study or comparable project. The student must be in good academic standing Students wishing to enroll in a directed studies course must be in good academic standing, must have inst ructor approval to enroll in the course. The academic department of the course or college may have additional prerequisites or requirements for enrollment in a directed studies course . Procedures for enrolling in directed studies courses are available in UHD Policy Statement 03.A.17 - Directed Studies. Degree requirements may limit the number of hours of directed studies that may be applied. Auditing Courses To audit a course is to enroll in a course on a noncredit basis. Audit students pay the regular tuition and all other applicable fees as set for the current academic year. Senior citizens 65 years or over may audit for free on a space -available basis. A change to credit status may not be made after the student has registered to audit a course. Change s from credit status to audit status in a course must be made prior to the end of the business day of the Official Day of Record. A Request for Audit form must be processed i n the Registrar's Office by the Official Day of Record for the appropriate term al ong with Instructor approval. Students wishing to audit courses should contact the Registrar's Office for further details http://www.uhd.edu/registrar/documents/audit_form.pdf . 50 Grading S ystem and Standards Academic Honesty The Academic Honesty Code is embraced by all members of the University of Houston -Downtown academic community and is an essential element of the institution's academic credibility. The Honesty Code states \"We will be honest in all our academic activities and will not tolerate dishonesty.\" The purpose of the Academic Honesty Policy is to deal with alleged violations of the Hones ty Code in a fair and consistent manner. The policy is administered jointly by students and faculty. It is each student's responsibility to read and understand the Academic Honesty Policy. It may be found in the Student Handbook (www.uhd.edu/student - resources/handbook ). Grading System The following grades are included in the calculation of gra de point averages: Grade Grade Points A Superior ................................ ................................ .............. 4.0 F Failure ................................ ................................ ................. 0.0 The following grades are not included in the calcu lation of grade ................................ ........................... Credit Awarded I (Incomplete) An incomplete grade is g iven only when an unforeseen emer gency prevents a student from completing the course work and only with the instructor's approval. A grade of I will be changed to a passing grade if the missing work is completed satisfactori ly by the deadline set by the instructor but no later than the end of the long semester immediately following the term in which the grade was received. An incomplete grade that is not removed by this deadline becomes an F. Repetition of a course for which an incomple te grade was receiv ed does not affect resolution of the original grade. An incomplete grade earned in a student's graduating semester is computed as an F in determining grade point average. IP (In Progress) The grade of IP may be given in some developmental courses. In the calculation of grade point average, a grade of IP is treated as a W. To receive credit for a course in which an IP was assigned, a student must register for the course again and earn a pass ing grade. AU ('Audit) In accordance with PS 03.A.03 - Audit ing Courses, a grade of AU may be assigned only in those courses officially approved for such designation. Grades of AU are not included in calculating the GPA. 51 S (Satisfactory) The grade of S may be earned in field experience courses and cer tain othe r courses. Credit received with a grade of S is not part of the grade point average calculation. W (Withdrawal from Courses) Students will not receive a grade for a course if they drop the course by the Official Day of Record (see Academic Calendar).S tudents automatically receive a grade of W for any course they drop after the Official Day of Record up to the drop/withdrawal deadline as listed in the online Academic Calendar. Official Day of Record and drop/withdrawal deadlines are published in the Un iversity Calendar online at www.uhd.edu/AcademicCalendars . Class days are defined as days on which the university normally has one or more classes scheduled; not the days for which an individual studen t is scheduled for his/her particular classes. For purposes of determining academic calendar dates, class days during the Fall, Spring, May and Winter terms are Monday through Friday while class days during a summer term are Monday through Thursday. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is a measure of a student's academic achievement. Grade point averages are computed by multiply ing the grade point value by the number of credit hours in each course, and then dividing the sum of all grade po ints obtained by the total number of hours attempted. The following formula represents the method of computing grade point average: Total Number of Grade Points Earned Total Number of Semester Hours = Grade Point Average The number of grade poi nts earned for each course equals the hour credit value of the course multiplied by the points awarded for grades received. Grades of I, S, U, IP, CA, AU and grades marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above are not counted in t he cal - culation of the g rade point average. Grades of I will be calculated as F grades in determining grade point average for graduation. In calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA) to determine honors for students who have earned all their credits at UHD, the U HD GPA, as it ap pears in the student record system, is used. For students who have completed some portion of their college work at other institutions, the UHD GPA is combined proportionately with the Transfer GPA earned at those other institutions to deter mine eligibility for honors. Undergraduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 2.0 grade point average calculated on all grades earne d at UHD. Some departments may specify more stringent requirements, such as a 2.5 grade point average in the major or a 2.5 grade point average in all upper -level courses. Graduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 3.0 grade point average. Appeal of Grades If a student believes a course grade to be in error (i.e., if it appears to be a miscalcu lation, or if it appears that grade was not calculated and/or evaluated according to the course instructor's stated procedure) a student may file an appeal by proceeding in the following sequence: (1) appeal first to the course instructor, (2) if the appea l is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, then appeal to the appropriate department chair, (3) the final level of appeal would be to the appropriate dean. If a student does not appeal a grade within one calendar year after the close of the semester in which the grade was received, the grade is final and no appeal will be heard. The responsible party at each level has 14 academic calendar days to respond to students in writing with their decision regar ding the appeal, unless granted an exception by the Dean of the college in which the original grade was awarded. 52 Appeals must be submitted in writing. Students bear the responsibility for providing documentation related to the grade appea l. If the appeal reaches the chair or dean and it is determined that there is evidence of a grading error, the chair or dean will consult with the course instructor before making a final decision. Final decisions must be communicated in writing to all concerned parties. When the appealed grade is from a course that is housed in a multidisciplinary or multi -college program, all appeals will be handled within the course's \"home\" department and college. A student may file an appeal by proceeding in the following sequence: (1) appeal first to the course instructor, (2) if the appeal is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, then appeal to the chair of the department in which that course is housed (for courses in programs that do not have a department chair, the appeal is initiat ed with the program director), (3) th e final level of appeal would be to the dean of the college in which that course is housed. An instructor may appeal the chair's decision to the Office of the Dean. Dean's List The Dean's List recognizes students who have achieved superior academic pe rformance during the fall or spring semester. To be included on the Dean's List for a specific semester, a student must, during that semester, complete at least nine semester ho urs of college -level work, earn at least a 3.5 grade point average, and receive no grade of I or F. The Dean's List is published by each college at the end of each fall and spring semester. Grades for Repeated Courses When a UHD course is repeated at UHD, only the highest grade will be used in computing the UHD grade point average . If a course taken initially at UHD is repeated later at another institution for credit, only the UHD grade is included in the UHD grade p oint average. However, the course with higher grade will be used to complete degree requirements. Academic Probat ion and Suspension Probation Academic probation is a warning to the student that his or her aca demic record has been unsatisfactory. A student who is not making satisfactory progress toward meeting graduation requirements may be placed on academic susp ension if this record does not improve. A student is placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which his or her cumulative UHD GPA falls below 2.0. The cumulative UHD GPA for aca demic probation is computed on grades earned at UHD. Grades o f I, IP, S or W are not counted. See the Grading System and Standards section of the catalog for additional details on grades that count toward the UHD GPA. All students on probation must consult with an academic advisor before registration to discuss th eir plans, academic progress and GPA repair, and available academic support. Students on probation must maintain a UHD term GPA of 2.0 or above in each term in which they are enrolled until their cumula tive UHD GPA reaches 2.0 or above. Students on acade mic probation will be placed on continued probation at the end of any term in which they fail to earn a minimum term GPA of 2.0. Failure to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or above while on continued probation status will result in academic suspension . Only course s taken at UHD will remediate the cumulative UHD GPA. A student returns to regular academic standing after his/her cumulative UHD GPA reaches 2.0 or higher. Suspension and Dismissal Suspension means that a student is ineligible to register or remain in classes. Students on continued probation status will be suspended at the end of any term in which their cumulative GPA falls below the specified mini mum cumulative UHD GPA unless they earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 in that term. Any registered coursework for the next term will be administratively dropped by the Records Office. A student's suspension is in effect for that term, pending readmission. The student may appeal the suspension to the student's academic dean or the dean's designated representative. For an appeal, students must provide clear and compelling evidence of potential academic success, for example, academic success at other institutions. The final decision for readmission rests with the academic dean or dean's designated representative. 53 If a student's appeal is approved, the student will be placed on extended probation. The student must meet with a dean's representative or designated advisor to discuss how to improve their academic performance and make satisfactory academic progress. The stu dent may be required to agree to a contract of actions likely to result in improved academic performance. Students must maintain a term GPA of 2.0 or above in each term they register until achieve a cumulative UHD GPA of 2.0. Failure to maintain a term GP A of 2.0 will result in academic dismissal from the university. This academic dismissal will be permanent unless the student appeals to their academic dean or dean's designated representative for readmission or re admits under Academic Amnesty. *Academic probation and suspension will be noted on the student's official undergraduate transcript. Academic Amnesty A student returning to UHD after a minimum of a two -year absence may petition for application of the academic amnesty policy. To be eligible, t he student must not have attended UHD for the two -year period immediately preceding his/her return to UHD. The student must also complete 24 semester credit hours with a minimum grade point average of 2.5 following readmission to UHD. If academic amnesty i s granted, all courses with grades of F or D earned prior to readmission are ignored in applying credit toward fulfillment of degree requirements and in future computations of the student's grade point average. The amnesty provision applies only to the app lication of credit toward a degree and computation of the student's grade point average. No grades on the student's permanent record are altered or deleted. Student Records Transcript s Requests for official UHD transcripts are made online through the MyUHD portal via Student eServices and are processed by the Registrar's Office. All requests for official UHD transcripts will be processed within 2 -3 business days, with the exception of transcripts that include coursework completed at South Texas Junior College, which may take up to 10 business days for processing. Effective September 1, 2013, a transcript fee of $10 will be charged for each printed official transcript.

Electronic transcripts (EDI or PDF): no additional cost Printed transcripts (mail or pick -up): $10.00 per transcript (non -refundable ) Official transcripts from other institutions which are submitted to the Office of Admissions as part of the admissions proces s become the property of UHD and will not be rereleased to the student unless the request is covered under the Family E ducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Additionally, UHD does not include completed transfer coursework on the official UHD transcript. Unofficial transcripts, also known as the online grade history, are available through the MyUHD Portal, under the My Transcript & Grades option in Student eServices. NOTE: Grades for Part of Term (PoT) courses ending prior to the close of the full term will be available online on the dates listed in the Academic Calendar. Part of Term (PoT) official grades will be d isplayed on the official transcript when grades for the full term are made available. See the Academic Calendar for grade posting dates at www.uhd.edu/academic/calendar.htm. Bacterial Meningitis Vaccination Requirement Effective October 1, 2013 , Texas Senate Bill 1107 has been amended by Senate Bill 62 and requires all students (under age 22 ) entering an institution of higher education (public and private) and enrolling into courses which meet face -to-face on campus to either receive a vaccination agai nst bacterial meningitis or meet certain criteria for declining such a vaccination before classes start. For additional time -sensitive information about this requirement, please visit: uhd.edu/meningitis . Release of Student Records UHD has a policy in conformity with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) covering the release of student 54 records. Student rights include the following: Students have the right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the univ ersity receives the request. Students have the right to request amendment of their educa tion records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading. Students have the right to consent to the disclosure of person ally identifiable information in their ed ucation records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. Students have the right to file a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Directory Information At its discretion the University of Houston -Downtown may provide directory information to the general public without student consent. Directory information is defined by University of Houston -Downtown (within the guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) as follows: Student's name Mailing Address Primary Telephone number University Assigned e -mail address Classification Enrollment Status Major and minor fields of study Degrees, certificates, awards and honors received Dates of attendance Graduation Date Expected graduation date The most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of mem bers of athletic teams Students may request that directory information be withheld from the public by contacting the Registrar's Office at any time during the semester. Such requests must be made in writing and will remain in place until the student dire cts the office in writing that it is to be removed. The Confidentiality Request Form is available online, visit the Registrar's Office website for more information. Disclosure of Education Records In accordance with FERPA and at its discretion, UHD wil l disclose information from a student's education records without the written consent of the student to school officials who have a legitimate educational or administrative interest in the records. A school official is defined as a person employed by the University who holds an administrative, supervisory, academic, or support staff position (including the University's police department and health care staff); a person or company with whom the University has contra cted (such as an attorney, auditor, or col lection agent); a person serving on the Board of Regents; or a person assisting another school official in performing his or her official duties. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official ne eds to review an educational record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities Custodian of Records The following individuals are designated by the University as custodians of records: Registrar's Office, Room N330; Director of Scholarships and Financial Aid, Room S330; D irector of the Career Development Center, Room S402; Director of Counseling and Health Services, Room S445; Dean of Students, Room S380; Dean of each College . Procedure for Inspecting Education Records A student has the right to inspect his or her educa tion records and challenge the contents. To review records, a student must make a request in writing to the Registrar's Office. The request must clearly and specifically identify the record or records he o r she wishes to inspect plus the purpose of the req uest. The request must be signed and dated by the student. The University will respond to the student's request within a reasonable time. A request to inspect (review) education records is not considered the same as a r equest 55 for copies of the records. Procedure for Amending Education Records If a student believes the information in his or her education record contains information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy, the student should submit a writ ten and signed request for amendment to the Registrar's Office. The written request should clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed and specify why it is inaccurate , misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy. The Uni versity will notify the student within a reasonable time regarding whether or not the record will be amended. If the university denies the student's request for amendment of his or her record, the student has the right to a hearing regarding the requested amendment. This procedure does not govern grade appeals. Change of Name and Address An official change in name must be reported to the Registrar's Office and when applicable to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Original legal documentation m ust be presented along with a copy of the Social Security card when requesting a name change or correction (e.g. marriage certificate, divorce decree, naturalization certificate, etc.) A copy of your state issued driver's license or government issued phot o ID will also be required.

Graduation Requirements General Degree Requirements for Graduation A bachelor's degree contains a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. For degree completion, at least 25% of the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. In addition to completion of specific degree requirements, all students must meet the requirements described below. At least 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at the University of Houston -Downtown ; 18 hours must be at the upper level and be approved by the student's major department. Only the appropriate academic dean may waive any portion of these requirements and only upon petition by a student who has extraordinary reasons. The University of Houston Downtown limits academic residency to no more than twenty -five percent of the degree requirements for all degree s for active -duty service members. Academic residency can be completed at any time while active -duty service members are enrolled. Reservist and National Guardsmen on active -duty are covered in the same manner. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 calcul ated on all grades earned at UHD is required for graduation. In addi tion, a grade point average of 2.0 is required for all courses taken at UHD that apply toward the degree. Students enrolled in any degree program at UHD who wish to take courses at anot her college or university, including any other university in the UH System, and apply the credits earned toward his degree, must have prior approval of the appropriate offi cer of the student's degree program. Courses taken without such approval may not be counted toward the fulfillment of degree requirements. A student taking courses under these provisions is responsible for having his official transcript from the seco nd institution, including any other university in the UH System forwarded to the registrar 's office at UHD and for requesting that an official evaluation of this transcript be made and reported to the appropriate officer of the student's degree program Double Majors and Dual Degrees A student can earn two different degrees by simultaneously co mpleting the requirements for two academic programs of study that award different Bachelor's Degrees, such as a Bachelor of Arts (BA), a Bachelor of Science (BS), a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) or a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technolog y (BSET). With each degree, students will also select a major and, thus, will graduate with two majors as well as two degrees. However, the fact that each major is awarded with a d ifferent degree establishes students on this path as students seeking a \" dual degree.\" A UHD GPA of 2.5 is required to declare a dual degree or double major, and the declaration must be made before students submi t 56 any applications for graduation. Students may not pursue more than two degrees or majors simultaneously. A student can earn a double major by simultaneously completing two academic programs, both of which award the same degree. Examples of majors include English, History, Chemistry, Criminal Justice, and Computer Science. The majors may or may not be housed in different colleges. Double m ajors awarded under the same degree (e.g. Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts) establishes students as seeking a \"double major ,\" except for major pairings offered in the College of Business , which qualify as dual degree pro grams . A bachelor's degree contains a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. Students in a dual degree program must complete all courses required for each degree. Each degree must consist of at least 30 unique hours taken in residency at the University of Houston -Downtown, with a minimum of 18 of the unique hours in each program being upper -level and applicable to the upper -level requirements of the degree. Students seeking a double major must complete at least 18 upper -level hours in residency at the University of Houston -Downtown for each major. These 18 hours must be unique to each major and must be applicable to the upper -level requirements of each major. Students should be aware that the state has imposed a limit of 120 hours for all degrees. Students who attempt more than 30 hours above this enrollment cap may be charged out -of-state tuition for the excess hours. If students declare both degrees or majors at the same time, they must indicate which will be the primary degree or major and which will be the secondary degree or major. The college housing the primary degree or major is the academic home of record. If the second degree or major is declared after the student has already been accepted into one program, the first degree or m ajor is considered primary. Students wishing to have the second declaration considered the primary degree or major must seek permission from the dean of the college housing the new primary degree or major. Students deciding not to continue pursuing a dual degre e or double major may opt out of one degree or major by notifying in writing the dean of the college housing that degree or major before graduation is certified. Students who will not be able to meet all of the requirements of one of the degrees or major s by the time of certification will be notified by the dean's representative in their home college. At that point, such students have three options and must state the preferred option in writing to that representative: to get certified in only the complet ed degree or major to change the uncompleted degree program or major into a minor, if a minor in that area exists to delay any certification until both degrees or majors are completed Honors of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude will be calc ulated by an official in the college of the primary degree for dual degrees and the primary major for double majors. The college of the primary degree is responsible for forwarding th e needed documentation to determine honors in the secondary degree to th e college responsible for the secondary degree plan. College Honors will be determined by an official in the college of the primary degree for dual degrees or the primary major f or double majors. The college of the primary degree is responsible for forw arding the needed documentation to determine honors in the secondary degree to the college responsible for the secondary degree plan. Students who successfully complete a dual degree will receive two diplomas, and both degrees and any majors within those degrees will be noted on their transcripts. The transcripts of students who successfully complete a double major will indica te both majors. Additional Bachelor's Degree To qualify for a second UHD bachelor's degree after having been already certified in one bachelor's degree, a candidate must meet the general and specific requirements for each degree. take at least 30 unique hours, including 18 hours needed for the major, in residency for each degree at the University of Houston -Downtown, with a minimum of 18 of the unique hours in each program being upper -level and applicable to the upper -level requirements of the degree. 57 Graduation under a Specific Catalog A student usually graduates under the degree provisions of the catalog in effect at the time of his or her first completed term of enrollment or any subsequent catalog. Exceptions: No catalog more than ten years old may be used. The program of students whose enrollment is interrupted for more than two consecutive long semesters for reasons other than military service shall normally be governed by the catalog in effect at the time of the students' reenrollment in the university. Students have the option of graduating under the provisions of this catalog or any subsequent catalog. A student whose enrollment is interrupted by military service must reenroll within one year from date of separation from the service and no more than five years from the beginning of military service in order to remain under the provisions of the catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment at the university. Students forced to withdraw for adequate cause before the completion of the degree may, upon readmission, petition the appropriate academic dean to graduate under the catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment. The program of students who change their major shall be governed by the catalog in effect at the time of the change of major. Application for Graduation All degree candidates must file an application for graduation with their college and p ay the $50 graduation fee by the Official Day of Record for the term of intended graduation. The graduation fee covers the costs of processing the graduation application, pri nting the diploma and mailing it to the graduate, and other costs associated with the commencement ceremony. If students fail to complete all degree requirements during the term in which they applied for graduation and paid the graduation fee, then they must apply for graduation and pay the graduation fee again when they become eligible to graduate. Candidates must also place a diploma order, which specifies how they want their name to appear on the diploma, with the Registrar's Office. Commencement Exercises To participate in commencement exercises, students must be enrolled in the courses needed to complete all degree requirements and must file an application for graduation with their college, and pay the graduation fee by the second Monday after the last day to drop a course without a grade (the Official Day of Record) for the ter m of intended graduation. The final decision on eli gibility for graduation and participation in commencement exercises rests with the appropriate academic dean. Commencement participants with honors are so designated in the commencement program and wear special insignia with their academic regalia. As commencement occurs prior to the posting of final grades, the designation of honors for May and December commencement participants reflects only grades earned prior to the final semester. Designation of fin al honors on the transcript and diploma, however, is based on all work attempted. Arrangements for obtaining academic regalia may be made through the university bookstore. Deadlines for ordering and paying f or regalia are announced for each commencement. Graduation with Honors Current Policy effective until Graduation Candidates for Summer 2017 Students who complete bachelor's degree requirements with exceptionally high grade point averages receive degrees with honors. a cumulative grade point averag e of 3.75 -4.00 graduate summa cum laude , a cumulative grade point average of 3.50 -3.74 is required for magna cum laude . a grade point average of 3.25 -3.49 is needed to graduate cum laude . In the computation of this average, both the cumulative UHD grad e point average and the grade point average over all college level work will be computed; the lower of the two averages will be used as the basis for determining honors. 58 Students not eligible for cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude honors may be eligible for College Honors. Students who have earned a GPA of 3.50 or greater in their last 60 hours attempted at UHD, including at least 30 upper -level hours, are eligible to receive the designation, \"College Honors.\" Effective for Graduation C andidates in Fall 2017 and beyond Students who complete bachelor's degree requirements with exceptionally high grade point averages receive degrees with honors. University honors will appear on the student transcript and diploma. To qualify for University ho nors consideration students must have earned 42 credit hours or more at UHD of which 24 credit hours must be upper level course work. In accordance with the Grading System Standards, all UHD credit hours are used in the GPA calculation. Only credit hours at UHD are considered; transfer credits are not used in the GPA calculation for university honors. For consideration of university honors, the university will look at two different UHD GPA calculations: the UHD GPA calculated from the student's last 42 credi t hours taken at UHD and the UHD GPA calculated from all courses taken at UHD. The higher of the two UHD GPAs will be considered for university honors categories below: a cumulative grade point average of 3.80 -4.00 is required for summa cum laude . a cumulative grade point average of 3.60 -3.79 is required for magna cum laude . a grade point average of 3.40 -3.59 is required for cum laude . Designation of university honors in the commencement program for graduates will reflect only grades earned prior to the final semester. University honors also will be calculated after final semester grades post and final honor status is reflected on t he transcript. Students not eligible for cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude honors may be eligible for Colleg e Honors. Each college will set its own GPA requirements for College Honors. College honors will be calculated after final semester grades p ost. College honors will be reflected only on the student's final transcript. 59 Undergraduate Academic Programs Gener al Education The granting of a college degree signifies having reached a level of intellectual development that merits formal recognition. Intellectual development can be measured both in terms of depth and breadth of knowledge, and a college degree shoul d signify growth in both dimensions. In most college programs, students demonstrate depth of knowledge by completing cours es required in the major field of study. Breadth of knowledge is demonstrated by satisfying a group of general education requiremen ts that are shared by students in all majors. Whereas the aim of the major field of study is to provide experiences defining membership in a disciplinary com munity, the aim of the general education program is to provide experiences that define what it mea ns to be a college -educated person. The centerpiece of the general education program is called the \"core curriculum\" because these courses comprise the core of the college experience. The core curriculum specifically addresses the following outcomes: Think creatively and to innovate Conduct inquiry and analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information Effectively develop, express and interpret ideas through written communication Effectively develop, express and interpret ideas through oral communication Effect ively develop, express and interpret ideas through visual communication Manipulate and analyze data or observable facts, resulting in an informed conclusion Consider different points of view Work effectively with others to support a shared purpose or goal Demonstrate i ntercultural competence Articulate knowledge of civic responsibility Engage effectively in regional, national, and global communities Connect choices, actions and consequences to ethical decision -making In addition to the specific outcomes fo r the core curriculum, UH -Downtown's general education program as a whole identifies the following outcomes for university graduates: The ability to view events from a variety of perspectives, especially including different historical and cultural perspec tives. An awareness of the different ways of pursuing knowledge, including the methods of scientists and of those engaged in the arts and humanities; Knowledge of, and sensitivity to, ethical and moral standards; Knowledge of, and a degree of skill with, new technologies; The ability to communicate clearly and effectively and to use various media to transmit and process information; In order to achieve these goals, the general education compo nent of all degrees earned at UH -Downtown consists of three parts: courses satisfying the common core requirements, appli cation course requirements, and enhancement course requirements. Each of these com ponents is described below: Common Core Requirements Students in all UH -Downtown undergraduate degree programs must complete a common core of courses consisting of 42 semester credit hours. The following table lists the Foundational Component Area s of the core, the number of semester credit hours (SCHs) required in each area, and the UH -Downtown courses that may be used to fulfill these requirements. Departments often suggest certain courses that they prefer their majors to take to fulfill some of the core requirements, so students should carefully study the degree plans that interest them. Degree plans may be found in the sec tions of this catalog describing the departments' programs and in degree program brochures available in departmental offices. A student transferring to UHD who has completed the common core requirements at another Texas institution of higher educa tion will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfied all of UHD's com mon core requirements. 60 A student transferring to UHD who has completed some, but not all, of the common core requiremen ts at another Texas institution of higher education will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfi ed the corresponding common core requirements at UHD. The student must still satisfy any remaining UHD common core requirements. Students concurrently enrolled at more than one institution of higher education should follow the core curriculum require ments in effect for the institution where they are classified as degree -seeking students. FOUNDATION AL COMPONENT AREA S SCHs UHD COURSE OPTIONS Communication 6 ENG 1301, 1302 Mathematics 3 MATH 1301, MATH 1310, STAT 1312 or any course for which one of these courses is a prerequisite Life and Physical Sciences 6 *In the first semester of attendance at UHD, if a student has not completed the 6 hours of the Component Area option requirement at a Texas college or university, the student will take either a course numbered UHD 1301 -1308 1301 -1308 is intended for student s who have : earned fewer than 30 SCHs of college work or not passed ENG 1301, regardless of the number of SCHs earned . UHD 2301 -2308 is intended for student s who have : earned at least 30 SCHs of college work and passed ENG 1301 . Time Frame for Completing Common Core Requirements The common core of the general education program is designed to provide students with the academic skills and knowledge tha t constitute the foundation of a baccalaureate education. The spe cialized course work taken in the major field of study builds upon this foundation , so it is necessary for students to complete core requirements early in their course of study. Writing and computational skills are especially critical for future academic success. Therefore , In the first semester in which they are eligible to do so, students should enroll in a course that will satisfy the Communication requirement (ENG 1301 or ENG 1302), and a course that will satisfy the Mathematics requirement (MATH 1301, 1310 or STAT 1312), and students should continue to enroll in these courses until they have completed the core's Communication and Mathematics requirements. 61 Students are encouraged to compl ete all other common core requirements before enrolling in any upper -division (3000 -level and 4000 -level) courses. Application Course Requirements The application course requirements are intended to ensure that the communication and analytical skills lear ned in common core courses are applied and further developed. Application courses are required in the following two areas: Writing Skills In addition to the common core requirements that address writing skills, including English Composition, students m ust take two upper -division courses that include substantial written assignments. These courses, designated as \"W courses\" in degree programs, assure students of opportunities to use and further refine their writing skills within the context of the major f ield of study. Nonverbal Analytical Skills In addition to the common core requirement s that invoke non -verbal tools for analysis and problem -solving, including mathematics, students must take one course that makes use of the skills learned in the core curriculum to solve problems related to the major field of study. These courses are designated as \"S courses\" in degree programs. Enhancement Course Requirements Enhancement courses represent another way in which certain objectives of the general educat ion program are embedded in courses beyond those in the common core. Each degree pro gram includes certain courses that (1) give significant emphasis to ethical and moral issues, and (2) engender in students a greater appreciation of their membership in a world community marked by vast diversities of every type. 62 Undergraduate Programs University College B. Christiana Birchak , PhD, Dean William Waller , PhD, Associate Charlie Finch , PhD, Assistant Dean S655, 713 -221-8007 University College (UC) sup ports learning across multiple disciplines and from a variety of perspectives, thus fostering the versatility and creativity essential t o success in the 21st Century.

Transient students who need to take one or more business classes at UHD to complete their degree at another university must obtain prior written approval from their dean to enroll in specific courses which will be used to satisfy graduation requirem ents. Satisfaction of Prerequisites Prere quisites are NOT optional; prerequisites ARE requirements or courses that must be completed PRIOR to taking a course. The prerequisites for a course are described in the catalog course descriptions. It is the student's responsibility to insure tha t he/she meets the prerequisites prior to enrollment in a course. If the student enrolls and does not meet the prerequisites, he/she m ay be administratively withdrawn from the course at any time. Any variance in prerequisite requirements or this policy must be obta ined in writing from the department chair prior to enrollment in the course.

A student who is unsuccessful in a required course after three attempts will be dismissed from the College of Business for fa ilure to make progress. College of Business interprets a required course as any course in the Business Core or Major Requirements. Finally, the College of Business will interpret failure to progress as not moving forward in a degree plan. Therefore, in som e majors a \"D\" in a course will be considered unsuccess ful if the degree sequence requires a \"C\" or better. An attempt is registered when the student receives either a grade or \"W\" for the course. If a student subsequently seeks readmission to the College of Business, she/he must reapply and meet the College of Business standards of admission in force at the time of reapplication. 74 COB Student Services Carmen Cuevas, J.D., Assistant Dean, B -101 (713) 221 COB Brett Hobby, M.Ed., Career Center Director Maxine Todd, M.B.A., Career Counselor Tina R.

Before consulting with a college advisor to register for coursework, students should review the requirements for their academ ic degree described in this catalog, select potential courses to fulfill degr ee requirements, and prepare a tentative course schedule. Courses, course status (open or closed), and class times for each academic semester are available online in MyUHD. Although majors in good academic standing are given access to priority registrati on and may self -advise and register online via MyUHD, students are strongly encouraged to consult with an advisor before the semester begins. Majors on academic probation who wish to register for next semester courses must meet with a college advisor and then see the Associate Dean or the Assistant Dean for course approval. CHSS majors on academic suspension who have not attended UHD for the preceding long semester must apply for readmission to the university and then must consult with the Assistant or Ass ociate Dean at least one week prior to the first day of class. With the Associate or Assistant Dean's authorization, the student wi ll be placed on academic probation and permitted to take a limited number of approved classes.

It is encouraged that a major meet with a CHSS Advisor before applying and submitting their graduation request online to ensure that all requirements will be met. Students are responsible for completing all steps described within the online ap plication system. Deadlines for applications for graduation can be found on the academic calendar for a given term. The deadlines for students planning to graduate in a Winter or May term are the same as Fall or Spring term, respectively. Students who do not complete the requirements in the anticipated term must reapply for graduation and repay the graduation fee. The CHSS Advising Center and Dean's Office will communicate any information about students' applications for graduation throu gh GatorMail, so students who have submitted an application for graduation should begin checking their GatorMail a week after the posted deadline. Requirements for Minors Students seeking minors in CHSS must maintain a g rade point average for all courses taken at UH -Downtown of at le ast 2.0, receive a grade of C or better in all courses applied toward the minor, and must meet all requirements of the chosen minor, i ncluding prerequisites for courses taken toward the minor.

All minor programs in CHSS, with the exception of a minor in art, require at leas t 9 hours upper -level course work in residence at UHD. The Art minor requires only 6 hours of upper -level cour sework (see full description under the Arts and Humanities section). To declare a minor, students with majors in CHSS must file a Minor Declaration Form with a CHSS advisor. Students with major s in other colleges who select a minor in CHSS should file t he Minor Declaration Form with an advisor in their home college. In both cases, CHSS advisors fill out a form which lists the requirements for the minor, indicating which courses already taken apply toward the minor. This record is thereafter maintained by the home college advisors and the minor is certified by the Associate or Assistant Dean of the home college. Retroactive Foreign -Language Credit by Exam and Coursework UHD's Spanish program administers a free placement exam to all incoming students w ith prior knowledge of Spanish if they are interested in studying the language at UHD. Currently the placement exam is offered daily in N950, the Foreign Language Lab (please check door for schedule). If a student is placed by the exam into a course beyo nd SPAN 1401 and s/he earns an A or B after taking it at UHD, the student will receive a maximum of eight (8) semester credit hours with a grade of 'S,' depending on the number of courses bypassed. These retroactive credits may be used as electives or as p art of a student's major or minor degree requirements. The option for earning retroactive credits from UHD is only available to students who have never taken college -level Spanish anywhere before coming to UHD. UHD's retroactive credit may not be combined with any other means of earning free college credits in Spanish, such as through AP Spanish programs in High School (see description of earning AP credits in Span ish at UHD).

The faculty teach courses and conduct research in seven academic areas: anthropology, geography, history, phi losophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. In addi tion to classes in these disciplines, we offer interdisciplinary classes in the social sciences. Currently, seven undergr aduate degrees may be taken in our department: History (BA), Philosophy (BA), Political Science (BS), Psychology (BS), Sociology (BS), Social Sciences (BA o r BS). We also offer a Master of Arts in Non -Profit Management. Please come visit us, or call, and talk with us about your interests and plans. The department's educational philosophy is holistic, emphasizing the importance of educational and professional growth both i nside and outside of the classroom. Our degree programs prepare students in a numbe r of ways: students are provided with job skills relevant to their career aspirations, a readiness for graduate or professional school, and a strong, broad -based background in the liberal arts which is important in the ever -changing social and economic env ironment. The essential components of the department's mission are community -based research and public service, and these also constitute integral parts of the department's educational program. All of the department's degree programs are designed to deve lop skills in research and analysis. Students are also encouraged to engage in internships, volunteer service activities, and other degree -related work experiences. The study and practice of the social sciences provide the means for students to unify thei r learning, since the social sciences, in attempting to understand human individuals and institutions, employ both the methodologies of the linguistically -oriented humanistic disciplines and the empirically -based natural sciences. Thus our unique contribut ion to the intellectual life of the university is to provide the arena in which all viewpoints can meet and exchanged.

Phil Bossert , Commander The Air Force Reserve Officer Training (ROTC) program prepares men and women of character, commitment, and courage to assume leadership positions as commissioned officers in the active duty United States Air Force. Upon completion of the curriculum, students will have a thorough understanding of the core values, leadership, teamwork, and other requirements to be an effective offic er in the US Air Force. All courses and physical training sessions take place at the University of Houston. Flight orientation occurs at airports in the Houston metro area. Course Credit ROTC classes may be taken for elective cre dit toward any degree plan at the University of Houston -Downtown. Freshman and sophomore level classes are open to all students. No military obligation is incurred as a result of enrollment in these cours es. Junior and senior level courses are more restric tive and do require a mil itary obligation. ROTC scholarship students also incur a military obligation. Four -Year Program The General Military Course (GMC) is the first half of the four -year ROTC program and is taken during the freshman and sophomore years . This program allows the student to experience Air Force ROTC without obligation (unless the student is on an Air Force ROTC scholarship). Each semester of the GMC consists of one classroom hour of instruction as well as Leadership Laboratory each week. During the first two years, the student will learn about the Air Force and the historical development of aerospace power. During the sum mer preceding the junior year, the student will compete for the opportunity to attend a four -week Field Training Unit. S uccessful completion of field training is mandatory for entrance into the Professional Officer Course (POC), the junior and senior year s of the four-year program. As a junior, the student will study the core values, leadership, teamwork, and management to ols required to become an effective Air Force officer. During the senior year students study the national security policy process, regional and cultural studies, and complete final requirements for commissioning as second lieutenants. Enrollment in the P OC is open to graduate students if they have four semesters of school remaining. Each semester of the POC consists of three classroom hours of instruction as well as Leadershi p Laboratory each week. Leadership Laboratory As an Air Force ROTC cadet, each s tudent is required to attend an additional two -hour class known as Leadership Laboratory. Although not part of the academic class requirement, it is an essential element of officer training. Leadership Laboratory is an intensive, military training program in which students gain invaluable leadership and managerial experience while learning about the Air Force way of life. Students have numero us opportunities to hear guest speakers and panel discussions, participate in field trips, and experience practical l eadership exercises. 146 AFROTC Scholarship Opportunities Air Force ROTC offers various scholarship opportunities for students at the University of Houston -Downtown: In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP) \u2014is a highly competitive scholarship program aimed pri marily at college freshmen and sophomores in any major (students with a bachelor's degree can compete to earn a master's degree).

The degree programs in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics provide students with an education responsive to the expanding uses of mathematical and statistical techniques in business, government and industr y. In addition, they provide the foundation for those students interested in pursuing graduate degrees, as well as those students interested in pursuing caree rs in education. Thus, they are designed to permit students to select courses suited to a variety of interests and career goals. In achieving these objectives, advising plays an important role and consequently each student is assigned an advisor to assist w ith the student's schedule and career planning. The departmental Academic Screening Committee per iodically evaluates academic progress by departmental majors and students are advised appropriately. Undergraduate training in the mathematical sciences has undergone substantial change during the past decade. This change has been driven by advances and d evelopments in the information technology and its applications in business, government and industry. Growing demands exist for professional mathematical scientists. These individuals should have a solid background in basic mathematics, an understanding of advanced mathematics and statistics software, and a mastery of important techniques in mathematics and statistics such as operations research and data analytics. Virtually all industrial, health science, business and governmental environments need individu als with these qualifications. Those whose interests lie in the administrative or managerial sciences are especially valuable in market forecasting, account ing systems, industrial control, management training programs and long -range planning decisions. Th ose with an interest in statistics are valuable to firms that deal with large amounts of data, such as banking and insurance companies, which need personnel to develop and maintain the associated software. 172 General Requirements for Graduation All degree c andidates must have a 2.0 GPA average and a grade of \"C\" or better in all mathematics and statistics course work.

One semester credit hour is normally equivalent to one hour of class work, or from one to six hours of laboratory work per week for a semester. All courses are identified by discipline and number. The first digit of a course number indicates the academic level. Courses in the 1000 series are generally for freshmen, 2000 for sopho mores, 3000 for juniors and 4000 for seniors. The 5000 and 6000 series courses are graduate courses. Undergraduates are not allowed to enroll in graduate c ourses without permission of the academic department which offers the courses. The second digit indicates the number of semester credit hours that the course carries. The third and fourth digits specify a particular course within its discipline. The thre e numbers in parentheses after each course title indicate the number of semester credit hours, the number of class hours per week, and the number of additional laboratory or activity hours per week. Texas Common Course Numbering System The University of Houston -Downtown is a participant in the Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS). This sys tem ensures that if a student takes a course bearing a common course number at another college or university, UH -Downtown will accept the course in transfer as equivalent to the correspon ding UH -Downtown course. Common course numbers have a four -letter prefix followed by a four -digit number. The four -letter prefix identifies the subject area. For example, ENGL is the common prefix for English courses, and COSC is the common prefix for computer science courses. The four-digit number following the prefix identifies a specific course with the subject area. Each digit in the four -digit sequence gives additional informa tion about the course. The first digit ident ifies the course as either freshman level (1) or sophomore level (2). The second digit identifies the number of credit hours students earn upon completi ng the course. The final two digits indicate the sequence in which courses are generally taken. Thus, Fr ench I (FREN 1311) is taken before French II (FREN 1312). In this Catalog, for courses corresponding to those in the TCCNS, the common course number is indicated in parentheses at the end of the course description. The preceding page lists all UH -Downtow n courses for which a common course number exists. More information about the Texas Common Course Numbering System is available from the Office of Admissions (Room 326 - South; 713 -221-8533).
