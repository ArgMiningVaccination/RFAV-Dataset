Upcoming COVID -19 Crucial Conversations Webinars in Spanish and English 7 Registrate aqu\u00ed Register hereCDPH Changes to Existing COVID -19 Guidance 8Masking in High -risk and Health Care Settings Beginning April 3, masks will no longer be required in indoor high -risk and health care settings . This includes health care, long -term care, and correctional facilities as well as homeless, emergency, and warming and cooling centers. This change takes effect on Monday, April 3 to allow local health departments and individual health care facilities to develop and implement plans customized to their needs and l ocal conditions to continue to protect Californians through the end of the winter virus season. CDPH's recommendations for the use of face masks for individuals remain unchanged. See masking guidance . Vaccine Requirements for Health Care Workers Beginning April 3, with federal rules continuing to ensure that most health care workers remain vaccinated for COVID -19, the sta te will no longer require vaccination for health care workers including those in adult care, direct care, correctional facilities, and detention centers. This change takes effect on Monday, April 3 to allow local health departments and facilities to develop and implement plans c ustomized to their needs and local conditions to continue to protect Californians through the end of the winter virus season. Reduced Isolation Time After Positive COVID -19 Test Beginning March 13, a COVID -19 positive person may end isolation after five days if they feel well, have improving symptoms, and are fever - free for 24 hours, with less emphasis on testing negative. This change aligns with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and takes effect on Monday, March 13. CDPH Changes to Existing COVID -19 Guidance 9Disease Control and Prevention Order The state public health officer order formerly known as Beyond the Blueprint is being updated to align with CDPH's isolation and quarantine recommendations above and includes an updated definition for a confirmed COVID -19 case. The updated order , which will take effect March 13, provides prevention and mitigation strategies for slowing the spread of COVID -19 in homes, workplaces, and communities. Hospital Surge Order On April 3, CDPH will rescind an order that required hospitals statewide to accept transfer patients from facilities with limited ICU capacity as needed. ICU capacity has not been limited during recent COVID -19 surges after the broad use of vaccines and treatments. Vaccine Data Collection Also being rescinded on April 3 is an order that required providers to ask patients for their email addresses and/or mobile phone numbers when receiving a COVID -19 vaccine. New legislation requires that California healthcare providers who administer vaccines to enter information about patients, including telephone numbers and race and ethnicity. Resources Remain Available: Access to Vaccines, Testing and Treatment COVID -19 vaccines, testing, and treatment continue to be available through providers and some pharmacies and at some sites withi n local communities. Visit MyTurn to find services in your area. Treatment is available through providers and some pharmacies.

This is a good idea even if you have a generator! Do not open the storage unit unless you are packing the vaccines for transport! Continue to monitor the temperatures of the storage unit Record room temperature (if possible) and the temperature inside the unit as soon as the power goes out. Record minimum and maximum temperatures reached inside the unit during the outage. Transporting COVID -19 V accine Job Aid COVID -19 V accine Transport LogEquipment for Power Outages 32Make sure you have extra qualified vaccine transport containers and digital data loggers on -hand to store or transport the vaccine in the event of a power outage. Just as importantly, make sure the components of your transport containers are frozen and ready to go! See CDC's instructions on using frozen water bottles to pack vaccines (for emergencies only) Make sure you have other items to pack vaccine, like bubble wrap, cardboard, etc. Storage units must be equipped with a digital data logger; devices with a buffered probe provide more accurate readings. For ultra-cold storage units, device must use an air -probe or a probe designed for ultra -low temperatures. Keep a backup device on hand for vac cine transports and should primary devices fail. Devices must have a current and valid Certificates of Calibration Testing. Refer to CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit for device specifications and calibration. COVID -19 V accine Provider Operations ManualAfter a Power Outage Report any temperature excursions and contact vaccine manufacturer for next steps. Discuss what happened with staff. Make any necessary changes to your plans. 33 Report Temperature Excursions WorksheetAncillary Kit Supplies Expiry Dates If you started vaccinating in early 2021, it is possible that some of your old ancillary kit supplies may have expiration dates coming up soon! Make sure to check the expiration dates on your diluent, needles, syringes, etc. as you are doing supply inventory, and discard any expired products. 34 Comirnaty Labeling 35EUA Labeling Comirnaty Labeling Communication: EUA Labeled Pfizer Gray Cap) Transitions to Pfizer Comirnaty Monovalent (12+ Years, Gray Cap) on March 10Vaccine Shelf -Life Updates All Moderna adult (12+) and pediatric (6 -11) monovalent COVID -19 vaccines will reach their expiry in early April.

My Turn Clinic Best Practices: Creating Multi -Vaccine Clinics 47 Best Practice How To 1. Set clinic duration for four to six months to avoid having defunct clinics listed on the public site. Clinic Managers (CMs) can create clinics before making them visible to the public using the 'Clinic Visibility' settings. Set an appropriate \"Available Date\" that you'd like the public to begin booking appointments. 2. Create one clinic per location that supports multiple vaccines and brands to simplify management and updates. CMs may create clinics that offer all available vaccine product using the Clinic Setup Wizard . CMs should ensure that their vaccine supply is accurate for each vaccine, as that will determine appointment availability. If a CM would like to offer different vaccine product at different times of day (e.g., offer MPX appointments only in the morning and COVID -19 vaccines only in the afternoon), create separate clinics for each vaccine product. Export Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data within 4 weeks.

Mostly vaccinated, at least primary series Thirty (64%) patients in the cohort had clinical characteristics in addition to pregnancy that increased their risk of progressing to severe COVID -19. The patients tolerated ritonavir - boosted nirmatrelvir well, with no serious adverse effects noted in either the pregnant patients or the neonates during the study period. Higher rate of cesarean deliveries 84National Institute of Health (NIH) National Library of MedicineTwo descriptive case series evaluated outcomes among pregnant patients with COVID -19 who received ritonavir -boosted nirmatrelvir:Update on Paxlovid Use in Pregnancy, Continued Case Series 2: 7 patients with a mean gestational age of 26.4 weeks who had had COVID -19 symptoms for approximately 2 days at the time of ritonavir - boosted nirmatrelvir initiation. One patient developed dysgeusia and stopped treatment, but the remaining 6 patients completed 5 days of treatment. Six of the patients were fully vaccinated, and 4 of these patients had also received a booster dose. All the patients reported resolution of their COVID -19 symptoms, and no fetal or neonatal adverse effects were observed during the study period. 85 National Institute of Health (NIH) National Library of MedicineTakeaways TheSociety for Maternal -Fetal Medicine states it \"supports the use of Paxlovid for treatment of pregnant patients with COVID -19 who meet clinical qualifications.\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states pregnancy is \"among the conditions that put individuals at high risk for clinical progression [to severe COVID].
