RICHARD WISEMAN 31 More Hazards: Hypnosis, Airplanes, and Strongly Held Beliefs After a single-case history was reported in the psychological literature, I made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain any documents of the case.

So it's understandable that much of human culture is devoted to encouraging the former and dis\u00ad couraging the latter. To the degree that such efforts are based on magical ritu\u00ad als and bizarre behaviors, the lack of success poses no surprises. But, in fact, people can and do make their own luck. And some of this can be studied and demonstrated scientifically. Psychologist Richard Wiseman's article \"The Luck Factor\" in this issue, based on his new book of the same title, describes his 10-year Luck Project, a scientific investigation into the concept of luck. The goal was to find why some people \"seem to live charmed lives full of lucky breaks and chance encounters, while other experience one disaster after another.\" His research revealed four basic principles by which people tend to generate their own good fortune. (One: \"Lucky\" people are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportuni\u00ad ties.) He carried out experiments to test the differences between such people and their less lucky brethren. Ever constructive, he even devised a \"luck school,\" a series of experiments examining whether people's luck can be enhanced by getting them to think and behave in a more positive way. The answer is yes. Wiseman heads the Perrott-Warrick Research Unit in the Department of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, north of London, where he has established an international reputation for his research into deception and parapsychology and for his efforts on behalf of the public understanding of science. A CSICOP Fellow, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER consulting editor, and former magician, he's an innovative, energetic researcher wirh a popular touch. A survey by The Times Higher Education Supplement found that he was the psy\u00ad chologist most frequently quoted by the British media. The New Yorker, writing about his widely publicized project last year to identify the world's fun\u00ad niest joke, called him \"Britain's most recognizable psychologist.\" This is his sixth SI article. We've expanded our reviews section in this issue to accommodate discus\u00ad sions of some important new books, plus a museum exhibit. We note with sadness the death of Marcello Truzzi (see page 9). Marcello was the first editor of this journal. He edited the first two bi-annual issues, when it was called The Zetetic; I succeeded him in August 1977. We renamed it die SKEPTICAL INQUIRER but kept \"The Zetetic\" as a subtitle for several more issues. Marcello went on to publish his own informal journal. The Zetetic Scholar, at irregular intervals for some years thereafter. Always provocative, and with a sociologist's perspective, Marcello was as likely to find fault with skep\u00ad tics as with paranormalists, but his goal always was to facilitate constructive debate between the two camps.

SOHO is a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA, launched in December 1995 to study die Sun. Daily images of die Sun in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, and of the extended solar atmosphere (corona) in visible light, are made available to the general public through SOHO's Web page at http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov. However, almost since day one, there have been claims diat these images show more dian the solar features that SOHO was designed to study, and that diere is a NASA conspiracy to hide these facts from die public. Occasionally these claims cen\u00ad ter around previously unknown planets in the solar system (\"Planet X\"), but die most common claim is of extraterrestrial crafts, i.e., UFOs. Recently, one group of UFO proponents, EUROSETI, decided to hold a conference on the subject, which was held at die National Space Center in Leicester, England. Over die years, die SOHO team had become used to fielding questions from die public about UFOs in their images, but once die EUROSETI conference was announced, die team started receiving so many requests for information from both journalists and the general public diat dicy decided to post a response. The SOHO team started widi a purported UFO image diat was published in an Australian newspaper reporting on die conference, and found the original SOHO image diat it was based upon. In their article, the)' outline die series of steps needed to take an innocuous flaw produced by a cosmic ray hitting a few detector pixels, and process and stretch it until one ends up widi somediing that looks like a UFO. Tided \"How to Make Your Own UFO,\" and augmented widi a detailed explanation of die various image artifacts diat have led to UFO claims SOHO EXPLORING THE SUN in the past, die article is available at http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/hot- shots/2003_01_17/. William Thompson is a solar astronomer, and SOHO/CDS co-investigator, working at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland Psychics Fail Toronto Skeptics' $1,000 Challenge In a direct public challenge to self- proclaimed psychics, Toronto-area skep\u00ad tics put up Si,000 in prize money for anyone who could identify three com\u00ad mon items in sealed boxes. The $1,000 Psychic Challenge was held November 2, 2002, as part of the Psychic UnFair hosted by the Ontario Skeptics Society for Critical Inquiry (OSSCI). OSSCI organizes the UnFair each year to counter the psychic fairs and expositions held frequently in Toronto, as in other major North American cities, presenting mediums, astrologers, tea-leaf readers, aura painters, herb hawkers, and other para\u00ad normal practitioners to the public. With so many local people professing psychic powers in die Toronto area, it might have seemed a sure thing that at least one of diem would be able to claim die prize money. However, at the end of die day, when die boxes were opened, it was found that no one had identified die diree items. Neither did anyone identify two of the diree items in the correct boxes, which would have won them die $100 second prize. Nor did anyone identify even one item in the correct box. Ihe cardboard boxes were displayed in plain sight on a table behind a rope barrier, with a guard watching over them to ensure no one tried to touch them. People were able to view the boxes from six feet away and take their time to visu\u00ad alize the objects in them. They were told the objects were common items that could be easily identified by most adults or adolescents. Their answers were sub\u00ad mitted in writing on a form. There was no charge for participating. At the end of the UnFair, the boxes containing the mystery items were opened before a crowd of hopeful onlookers. The items were found to be a tangerine, a glove, and a roll of toilet paper. A review of the submitted entries showed no one who had taken the chal\u00ad lenge that day would win any of the skeptics' money. No close matches\u2014such as calling die tangerine an orange, for example\u2014were found either, although these would have been honored as correct identifications, according to the published rules of the challenge. The Psychic UnFair was held at the University of Toronto for the second year in a row, with an exhibit hall of exhibits and two presentation theatres. Exhibits included displays showing skeptical expla\u00ad nations of paranormal claims such as UFOs, the purported moon landing hoax, cryptozoology, and astrology. \"Madame Liz\" gave mind-reading demonstrations, after each of which she revealed to her amazed customers how the readings were done without paranormal powers. At another booth a skeptic explained how he successfully acted as an online psychic by using cold-reading and warm-reading techniques. Game boodis tested skeptical skills and knowledge. Emily Rosa's experi\u00ad ment testing Therapeutic Touch was repli\u00ad cated at another booth. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 5 NEWS AND COMMENT Guest speakers throughout the day included psychologist and CSICOP fellow and Executive Council member James Alcock, who spoke on belief sys\u00ad tems; magician and CSICOP fellow Henry Gordon, who related his lifetime of experiences debunking the paranormal; philosopher Fred Wilson, who has written and taught on science and pseudoscience; and biochemist Larry Moran, who has been prominent in defending evolution against creationism in Canada. OSSCI is now working on developing a more extensive Psychic Challenge with a larger cash award\u2014$ 10,000\u2014as a greater incentive for psychics to take the test. After the initial challenge, Toronto-area skeptics are confident their money will be safe even if they increase the stake tenfold. \u2014Eric McMillan Eric McMillan is Chair of the Ontario Skeptics Society for Critical Inquiry. Inorganic Oil: Much Ado about Nothing? Geoscientists are cringing as news reports dredge up what they have long consid\u00ad ered a preposterous assertion about the origin of oil: That none of the fossil fuels found on this planet come from fossils. The idea, heavily debated in Russia dur\u00ad ing the 1950s and 1960s, holds that the world's oil is not made of decomposed biological organisms; rather, it forms inorganically at near-mantle depths then migrates up to the crust. The newest incarnation comes from J.F. Kenney, a self-proclaimed oil and gas driller from Houston, Texas, who worked with three Russian scientists, including Vladimir Kurcherov of the Russian State University of Oil and Gas. Their paper on inorganic hydrocarbon formation, pub\u00ad lished in the August 20, 2002, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), has generated coverage in Nature, The Economist, and New Scientist and led Kenney to an interview on National Public Radio (NPR). PNAS published the paper at the request of Academy member Howard Reiss, a chemical physicist at the University of California at Los Angeles. As per the PNAS guidelines for members communicating papers, Reiss obtained reviews of the paper from at least two ref\u00ad erees from different institutions (not affili\u00ad ated with the authors) and shepherded the report through revisions. The paper examined thermodynamic arguments that say methane is the only organic hydrocarbon to exist within Earth's crust. The report also discussed the hypothesis that high pressures of 25 to 50 kilobar or more are needed for establishing natural petroleum hydrocarbon mole\u00ad cules. The authors also included a descrip\u00ad tion of laboratory experiments in Moscow that created petroleum products from marble, water, and iron oxide under 50 kilobar of pressure and 1,500-degree Celsius temperatures. But the news stories, Kenney says, are written on the premise that \"I have 'devel\u00ad oped a thermodynamic argument that demonstrates that the hydrocarbon mole\u00ad cules of natural petroleum cannot evolve spontaneously at the low pressures and temperatures of the near-surface crust of the Earth.' Such is absolute nonsense.\" Many geologists would agree. But, Kenney adds, \"The fact that the hydrocar\u00ad bon molecules which comprise natural petroleum cannot evolve spontaneously at the low pressures and temperatures of the near-surface crust of the Earth has been known by competent physicists, chemists, and chemical engineers for over a century. In my article, I only reviewed this knowl\u00ad edge briefly, using the efficient formalism of modern thermodynamics.\" Kenney's slap in the face to the compe\u00ad tence of modern geologists is not winning him any converts. Even astrophysicist Thomas Gold of Cornell University, who wrote two books on the subject of inor\u00ad ganic oil on Earth, is surprised by the media's response. \"There is nothing new about any mix of hydrogen and carbon at pressures of 40 kilobar or so, and temper\u00ad atures of greater than 800 degrees Celsius, forming oil.\" Most commercial drilling occurs in sedimentary rock where source material temperatures range between 75 and 200 degrees Celsius. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Gold spearheaded a project, which he says also involved Kenney, to illustrate the prospects of abiogenic oil and gas by drilling into crystalline rock in Sweden. But the granite did not yield an economi\u00ad cally viable result. Still, Kenney appears undaunted. During the interview on NPR, he said he found, while working with Kutcherov over the last ten years, inor\u00ad ganic oil and gas fields in the northern flank of the Dnepro-Donetsk basin in the Ukraine that arc greater than the entire reserves in Alaska. Kenney and his Russian colleagues' paper in PNAS is \"an excellent and rigor\u00ad ous treatment of the theoretical and exper\u00ad imental aspects for abiotic hydrocarbon formation deep in the Earth,\" says organic geochemist Scott Imbus of Chevron- Texaco Corp. \"Unfortunately, it has little or nothing to do with the origins of com\u00ad mercial fossil fuel deposits.\" While geologists agree that crude oil can come from inorganic means, the majority of commercially recovered petro\u00ad leum, they say, is organic. And they are frustrated with advocates of this alternative theory who dismiss evidence of a biologi\u00ad cal origin or interpret organics in crude oil as contaminants. Such an idea is anathema to the well-established understanding that biomarkers in petroleum are a result of liv\u00ad ing organisms transforming the complex molecules, dying, and then being sub\u00ad jected to burial processes that turn the bio\u00ad markers into petroleum products. The idea of finding an abundance of crude oil ready for the tap at depths cur\u00ad rently unreachable is tantalizing. But, says geochemist Alexei Milkov of the Deep Ocean Exploration Institute at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a graduate of Saint-Petersburg State University in Russia, \"I've never met an industry geologist that uses abiogenic the\u00ad ory to find oil and gas fields, and that includes Russian industry geologists. These guys pay money for mistakes and can't afford using wrong theories to con\u00ad tinue exploration.\" A key factor in decid\u00ad ing whether to put money in exploration 6 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT of a frontier basin is the potential quality and extension of source rock, Milkov adds. \"This strategy apparently works for them so far.\" That's a pity, says Roger Sassen, deputy director of Resource Geosciences, a geo- chemical and environmental research group of Texas A&M University. \"The potential that inorganic hydro\u00ad carbons, especially methane and a few other gases, might exist at enormous depth in the crust is an idea that could use a little more discussion. However, not from people who take theories to the point of absurdity,\" he says. \"This is an idea that needs to be looked into at some point as we start running out of energy. But no one who is objective discusses the issue at this time.\" \u2014Christina Reed Christina Reed is associate editor of Geotimes, a publication of the American Geological Institute, where this story origi\u00ad nally appeared.

PBS Evolution Series Wins Science Writers Science-in-Society Award The science documentary series Evo\u00ad lution, shown on public television in the U.S. in 2001, has been honored with the 2002 Science-in-Society award from the National Association of Science Writers (NASW). In announcing the award January 8, 2003. NASW offered this description: \"If there had been a science-in-society prize in Darwin's days, evolution would have been a real contender, and it obvi\u00ad ously still is. In the television category, Richard Hutton, executive producer, WGBH/NOVA Science Unit, is hon\u00ad ored for Evolution (broadcast September 24-27, 2001). Credit goes to die pro\u00ad ducers of this landmark series for recog\u00ad nizing the impact the science of evolu\u00ad tion has had on society for well over 100 years. This captivating series took view\u00ad ers from jungles to islands to classrooms to highlight the continuing scientific dis\u00adcoveries and political struggles over one of the most basic topics in all of science.\" NASW holds the independent com\u00ad petition annually to honor outstanding investigative and interpretive reporting about the sciences and their impact on society for good or ill. The 67-year-old organization aims to recognize and encourage critical, probing works in six categories\u2014newspaper, magazine, tele\u00ad vision, radio, Web, and book\u2014without subsidy from any professional or com\u00ad mercial interest. Penn & Teller Series Exposes Paranormal B.S. and Gains Audience The raucous and irreverent magicians Penn Jillette and Teller are already well known for their in-your-face showman\u00ad ship and implacable hatred of flim-flam. The duo has applied their signature talents to a new half-hour television program on the cable channel Showtime, tided \"Penn & Teller Bullshit.\" The show, which pre\u00ad miered on January 24, directs pointed crit\u00ad icisms onto a different paranormal or pseudoscientific topic each week, backed up by a merciless barrage of aspersions fired from Penn Jillette's bellowing how\u00ad itzer of a mouth. This is the only program on U.S. television where viewers will hear mediums, creationists, and conspiracy- dic- orists publicly\u2014and repeatedly\u2014called \"assholes.\" I have seen two of the past nine episodes broadcast so far. Each oudines claims and skeptical arguments in a suc\u00ad cinct, yet sufficient manner given the 30- minute format. \"Bullshit\" has already cov\u00ad ered a broad range of topics, including alien abductions, the Apocalypse, alterna\u00ad tive medicine, and feng-shui. The premier episode focused on the psychic medium business. There was a nice expose of Rosemary Altea during a taped readings arranged by Showtime. Viewers got a clear picture of how she worked the small group of people present for readings prior to the taping in order to glean information for later use. They also learned how her publicist seeded the group wifii people whose biographies were already known to Altea in order to boost her on-camera success. CSICOP's Joe Nickell appeared on the show to discuss techniques of cold reading and the Barnum effect. CFI-West executive direc\u00ad tor Jim Underdown and LA New Times reporter Tony Ortega were also inter\u00ad viewed. They reported on observations made during the undercover investi\u00ad gation of one of James Van Praagh's show. Underdown displayed an extensive and intimidating non-disclosure contract that Van Praagh's audience participants had to sign to keep them quiet. The March 14 episode on creationism was also well done. Penn & Teller took viewers into die August 2002 hearings in Marietta, Georgia, where the Cobb County School Board heard arguments from creationist cranks and concerned cit\u00ad izens on the merits of \"equal time\" for Intelligent Design. The camera showed die live debate and protest, warts and all, from an agitated man in die lobby pro\u00ad claiming, \"If God is the God of creation, this whole place is doomed to hell,\" to otherwise normal parents and children who saw a \"war between two different world views\" and \"two different kinds of people.\" The producers and writers did an excellent job of laying out die fundamen\u00ad tal arguments and interviewing influential creationists such as Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) and defenders of science education, such as Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/iune 2003 7 NEWS AND COMMENT By all accounts, \"Bullshit\" is doing quite well in the ratings. According to Showtime, ratings are up 14 percent overall in the show's time slot, and a whopping 40 percent in the male 35-49 demographic. Showtime's publicist for the series confirmed that the network was \"pleased with the performance.\" Com\u00ad mercially successful and skeptical? If Penn & Teller actually pull this off (and they seem to be doing just that), then they will have a guaranteed spot in any magician's hall of fame, and any skeptic's hall of fame for that matter. Any demon\u00ad stration to the media that skepticism sells will certainly help our cause. \u2014Kevin Christopher Kevin Christopher is Public Relations Director for CSICOP. Journal Editors Criticize MDMA Study as Nonscientific, Unethical The editors of two journals that provide objective scientific investigations of con\u00ad troversial and largely untested medical and mental health practices have criticized pro\u00ad posed research using the drug MDMA (ecstasy) as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. The study, \"MDMA- Assisted Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,\" is await\u00ad ing final MDMA licensing approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Proponents from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) claim that it will prove that MDMA has strong potential as a psy\u00ad chotherapeutic drug. The president of MAPS, Rick Doblin, is a longtime propo\u00ad nent of recreational and spiritual use of both LSD and ecstasy. The protocol was developed in the Charleston, South Carolina, area with die assistance of MAPS. The proposed study subjects would be twenty victims of violent assault who have been given diagnoses of post\u00ad traumatic stress disorder. MDMA has recendy received national attention because of research published in the journal Science, implicating MDMA in damage to dopamine receptors in mam\u00ad malian brains. Reductions in dopamine are associated with Parkinson's disease. Although the precise neurological effects of ecstasy remain controversial in the sci\u00ad entific community, there is a widespread consensus that this drug has the potential to do harm in at least certain cases. Editors Scott Lilienfeld of the Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice and Wallace Sampson of die Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine (SRAM), based on detailed investigations by health advocate E. Patrick Curry, note that die research was approved by die Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2001 and by the independent Western Institutional Review Board in July 2002. In light of reports of damaging effects of MDMA, die editors found die research to be poten\u00ad tially dangerous and possibly in violation of human subjects research ethical stan\u00ad dards. They also note that evidence for effectiveness that would justify such research was lacking. According to Lilienfeld, an associate professor of psychology at Emory University and president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology, the study itself is scientifically questionable at best and meaningless at worst, because the treatment will not be compared with a meaningful and properly blinded con\u00ad trol group consisting of either no therapy or a comparison treatment of known effectiveness. \"One of the most disturbing things about this study,\" Sampson said, \"is that it appears to be the exclusive project of believers in psychedelic mysticism, and based on work of Dr. Stanislav Grof, an early LSD self-experimenter and psyche\u00ad delic psychotherapist. After was declared illegal, Grof developed Holotropic Breathwork, a potentially dangerous form of severe hyperventilation, as a legal mediod of invoking hallucinations. Grof was a long-time fellow of the Esalen Institute, widely considered to be a birthplace of the New Age movement. Both therapists involved in the research, principal investigator Michael Mithoefer and his wife, Ann Mithoefer, a psychiatric nurse, are trained practi\u00ad tioners of Grofs Holotropic Breath- work. The investigators' background, although not bearing directly on the methodological quality of the study, raises troubling questions concerning their capacity to conduct the research and to evaluate the data impartially without strong a priori allegiances. Sampson and Lilienfeld question how such an experiment was approved by the FDA and an Institutional Review Board. Efforts by MAPS and the principal inves\u00ad tigator. Dr. Mithoeffer, to win IRB sup\u00ad port from the Medical University of South Carolina were rebuffed earlier this year. The project was approved within weeks when submitted to the independent IRB. Sampson and Lilienfeld concur diat comments in the popular press presenting this Charleston study as a possible \"tie\u00ad breaker\" in die debate over the effects of MDMA are misplaced. Lilienfeld states: \"It is disturbing that scientifically flawed and potentially dangerous research like this could pass muster widi die FDA, an IRB, and popular journalism.\" New Center for Inquiry-Metro New York Office Opens As of February 2003, the General Electric Building at Rockefeller Center is home to The Center for Inquiry-Metro New York office.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER readers are familiar with die use of magnets for several pro\u00ad posed therapies, including pain relief by wearing magnet-insoled shoes and purifi\u00ad cation of water and fuels by magnetic treatment. But a new one has popped up on the skeptic's radar screen\u2014the improvement of fine wines using magnets. \"Age your wine in minutes,\" pro\u00ad claims die Web site that is promoting the Perfect Sommolier (www.cellarnot.com) for $49.95. The site even quotes Anthony Dias Blue, wine critic for Bon Apitit magazine, as saying, \"The skeptic is convinced . . . Don't ask me how it works, but it works!\" A short blurb in the December 2002 issue of Bon ApMt also trumpets this product. What is the Perfect Sommolier? It's a set of magnets, one acting as a \"magnetic base\" for a wine bottle and the other a \"magnetic stopper\" to cork the bottle. According to the promotional informa\u00adtion, you simply \"wait 30 minutes. The wine will show softer tannins and rounder fruit, as if it had been aged for several years.\" By what mechanism does this product work? No explanation is given, nor are any stria tests reported. Everything is promoted by testimonial. Thankfully, many serious wine drinkers have a healdiy dose of skepticism\u2014die only opinion they accept regarding the quality of a fine wine is their own! Unfortunately, unpre\u00ad pared wine appreciators may fall for the testimonials, which come from many one-named wine drinkers, distributors, and restaurant owners. The only other unambiguously identifiable people pro\u00ad viding testimonials (besides our afore\u00ad are Les Kincaid, listed as a \"Master Sommeliet\" who does a radio show through CRN, a cable radio network, out of Las Vegas; and Fritz Sonnenschmidt, listed as the National Chair of the American Academy of Chefs. Mehopes Chef Sonnenschmidt is a better chef man skeptic.... Some wines benefit from \"breath\u00ad ing\"\u2014opening the bottle and letting some atmospheric oxygen dissolve in the wine. (Decanting also helps widi that as well.) It would be like the difference between aerated and nonaerated water; nonaerated water tastes \"flat\" to us. But a magnetic field? By what mecha\u00ad nism would the magnetic field change the tannin structure of a wine, or even decrease die acid level of the wine, as Chef Sonnenschmidt states? We get no clue. Given die inability of magnetotherapy supporters to find hard evidence for their previous claims, the ability of the Perfect Sommolier to \"age\" a wine may be equally impossible to substantiate. My wine advice? Spend the $50 on a nice bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Or a vintage pon. And my friend Arnie at Markko Vineyards makes a very nice reserve cabernet.... \u2014David W Ball David W. Ball is an amateur wine snob and professor of chemistry at Cleveland State Marcello Truzzi (1935-2003) sngtime skeptic Marcello Truzzi died from cancer on February 2 at age 67. There are all too few skeptics in the world; Marcello was surely one of the most colorful and provocative: the skeptic's skeptic. He urged us not only to doubt claims that are ill- founded, but he was skeptical of skeptics who made up their minds prior to investigation. Truzzi befriended psychic Uri Geller and astrobiologist Michel Gauquelin\u2014 both of whom were meticulously investigated over the years by skepti\u00ad cal inquirers. I am especially grateful that Marcello was involved in die early days of CSICOP. When I decided in 1975 to organize a conference on die growth of irrational cults and to cre\u00ad ate a committee to investigate them in 1976,1 invited as many skeptics as I could locate. Sociologist Marcello Truzzi was on the list, for he was editing a small newsletter dealing with examinations of paranormal claims called The Zetetic, at Eastern Michigan University. He came from a family of circus performers and enlivened meetings in which he par\u00ad ticipated. He was so engaging that 1 invited him to co-chair our new Committee. He immediately ac\u00ad cepted my invitation and edited The Zetetic in a new format under our auspices. But he resigned a year later (1977) after receiving a vote of no confidence from CSICOP's Execu\u00ad tive Council. He wished our new Committee and its magazine to include both \"believers\" and \"unbe\u00ad lievers,\" but the Council thought that there were literally hundre magazines and groups worldwide devoted to die pro-paranormal view\u00ad point, while almost none were inter\u00ad ested in exploring a skeptical scien\u00ad tific agenda. In any case. The Zetetic was soon afterwards retitled the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER under the editorship of Kendrick Frazier, and it has grown rapidly ever since. We were sorry to lose Marcello (who then created a Center for Scientific Anomalies Research in Ypsilanti, Michigan), and also to sec that the new journal he founded. The Zetetic Scholar, was eventually discontinued. We should always be grateful to Marcello Truzzi as die skeptical gadfly. \u2014Paul Kurtz.

It is an episode of \"NHK Special,\" die most influential TV docu\u00ad mentary series in Japan, with an audience of 14 million. In the program, a speech\u00ad less boy with severe brain damage \"devel\u00ad oped\" his intelligence by means of the Doman method (described below), \"read\" 2,000 books including philosophy, physics, and astronomy, and \"communi\u00ad cated\" with people via Facilitated Communication (FC). According to the narrator, the souls of many people are being healed by the boy's poems and essays, which were \"written\" with the aid of a letter board and his mother. This pro\u00ad gram, however, stunned a lot of sensible viewers in disbelief, because his mother grabbed his hand, pushed it to the paper letter board, and read die \"selected'' let\u00ad ters. Most amazingly, die modier contin\u00ad ued to move the boy's hand even when he was yawning and after he fell asleep! She Sadahiko Nakajima, Ph.D., is associate professor of psychology at Kwansei Gakuin University Japan. He is a member of the board of directors of the Japan Skeptics and chair of its psychology committee. He also serves on the committee of Japanese and international psychology societies, and is author or coauthor of several textbooks on psychology of learning. Address: Depart\u00ad ment of Psychology, Kwansei Gakuin University, E-mail: nakajima@kwansei.ac.jp. seemed to believe her son's literacy was real. (A portion of the program is available online at http://lunavideo.hp.infoseek. co.jp/index_e.html, and the letterboard pointing at www.geocities.co.jp/Tech- nopolis/9822/test.swf.) The Doman method is based upon incorrect knowledge of die brain and the unverified assumption diat people with brain damage can be cured by continuous exercise and stimulation termed \"pattern\u00ad ing.\" In the framework of this method, all sorts of different brain damages yield a blockage of brain development, which can be eliminated by the patterning train\u00ad ing. The Doman method has been criti\u00ad cized not only by skeptics (e.g., Hines 1988, 1995, 2001; Novella 1996) but also by academic societies (see the policy statement of die American Academy of Pediatrics, www.aap.org/policy/re9752 .html, for example) due to lack of empir\u00ad ical and theoretical validation. This mediod gives parents of disabled children die illusion that their child may one day live without disabilities and requires a lot of emotional and economic resources. Facilitated Communication is also a harmful and unscientific communicative procedure (see, for example, Dillon 1993; Gardner 2001; Green 1994, 1995; Shane 1994; and Spitz 1997) and policy statements against the use of FC have been issued by several academic societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association. However, rhe TV program did nor men\u00ad tion any of this. Furthermore, it did not provide any comments by specialists such as neurologists, psychologists, physicians, physiotherapists, or special education teachers. (In marked contrast to the situa\u00ad tion in North America, FC is unknown to the public in Japan, and only a handful of psychologists are conversant with its con\u00ad troversial history.) Sensible viewers began to voice their doubts on Web pages immediately after the program, and continuing discussions lasted for several mondis. More rJian 2,000 phone calls, fax messages, and e- mails were sent to NHK within a week. Because NHK is funded by public money, it is legally prohibited from pro\u00ad moting specific products from private enterprises. However, the program appears to have links with a major com\u00ad pany mat published that boy's book, Rules In Which Nobody is Denied (in Japanese), offered for sale immediately after the broadcast. Weekly and rnondily maga\u00ad zines carried stories against NHK. Newspapers, however, took a wait-and- see attitude and gave generally neutral accounts, though some papers printed comments by informed people who criti\u00ad cized NHK. Conventionally, the episodes of \"NHK Special\" are rebroadcast in Japan, and diey are also broadcast in some cities of the North America via cable networks. NHK decided not to do so widi die pro\u00ad gram Miracle Poet. Nevertheless, NHK did not accept die criticisms and broad\u00ad cast a brief explanation on May 11. According to NHK's explanation, its TV crew believes diat die boy's ability is gen\u00ad uine, and anonymous specialists are said to support this belief. They seemed not to 12 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER have considered the possibility of the Ouija (or ideomotor) effect. These reac\u00ad tions made sensible viewers so angry that the viewers began campaigns against NHK by creating badges, sticker seals, bookmarks, paper fans, and T-shirts in protest. Furthermore, a large number of Web sites were set up by volunteers against NHK's behavior. Among them is a site where academic and critical papers or. the Doman method and F(~ are Trans\u00ad lated into Japanese. On June 28, die book Objection to Miracle Poet (in Japanese), was published, and about 10,000 copies have been printed dirough the end of the year. The book was edited by Taro Takimoto, a lawyer working against cult groups such as Aum Shinrikyo, and by Ken-ichiro Ishii, a journalist. The book's main argument against NHK is diat die program may have given false hope to a lot of people with disabled family members. As a board member of the Japan Skeptics and die chair of its psychology committee, I sent a letter of complaint to NHK in the beginning of May and called an urgent conference on June 8 for hear\u00ad ing citizens' voices. Based upon my report on the conference, die Japan Skeptics issued a presidential comment in August, which pointed out two problems widi the program (Anzai 2002). First, diere is no evidence diat die boy's \"expression\" came from himself Second, ihe program vio\u00ad lates the Japanese Law of Broadcasting, which says \"any program must provide varied views if die topic is controversial.\" The statement concludes that unscientific behavior such as NHK's may yield a biased view of handicapped people. The Japan Skeptics also carried my reports on the case of Miracle Poet (Nakajima 2002a, 2002b, and 2002c). There were also movements in acade\u00ad mic and professional societies. The Japanese Society of Child Neurology sent a letter of inquiry to NHK at die end of October, and die Japan Pediatric Society, which is the parent organization of JSCN, issued a statement on die official Web site on November 20 that supports the policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics concerning die Doman method. The Japanese Spcech\u00ac Language-Hearing Association published a critical opinion of FC in its journal in February, 2003. On November 14, a member of die House of Representatives of die Japanese Diet called a managing director of die NHK to a committee of die House, where the NHK was accused of improper programming. In addition, an officer of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare presented a statement that die Doman method is not proper treatment for brain-damaged people. However, the Nakajima book criticizing NHK and the Doman method. NHK director escaped rebuke by claim\u00ad ing that die program was not intended to disseminate the Doman method. The chairperson of NHK, Katsuji Ebisawa, is still claiming there were no problems in the program. Volunteer groups are still working to spread word of NHK's irre\u00ad sponsible behavior and to disseminate correct information on the Doman method and FC to the general public.

D SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 13 INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL Dowsing Mysterious Sites I'm not an archaeologist but, as some\u00ad thing of a jack of all trades, I have participated in some archaeological investigations and digs, including a forensic one thai unearthed hidden skeletal remains and a bullet (Reno\u00ad vation 1981). In short, I know enough to appreciate what a boon psychic power would provide to the field\u2014if such power were actually to exist. Psychic Archaeology Certainly, there arc many who believe in \"psychic archaeology\"\u2014the supposed \"application of clairvoyance and other psychic skills to die field of archaeology, especially in the location of dig sites and the identification of artifacts.\" It may involve psychometry (in which an object is used to obtain psychic \"impressions\"), dowsing (divination with a device such as a rod or pendulum to locate hidden things from a site or map), automatic writing (in which spirits of the dead or other sources supposedly guide the hand to produce messages), or some other alleged psychic mode (Guiley 1991). What has been termed \"perhaps the first, best-known case of deliberate psy\u00ad chic archaeology\" was launched in 1907 by Frederick Bligh Bond in excavations at England's Glastonbury Abbey. Unknown to the Church of England officials who Joe Nickell is CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow and author of numerous inves\u00ad tigative books. appointed him. Bond was an occultist who turned to a friend's automatic writ\u00ad ing for help in locating the ruins of two chapels. Soon \"Gulielmus Monachus\" (\"William the Monk\") and other spirits, including \"watchers from die other side,\" were tapping the \"Universal Memory\" to provide die necessary site information. Bond's excavations were successful, but when he eventually revealed his mediods in 1917 die Church was embarrassed and he was forced out, ending the work in 1922 (Guiley 1991). Archaeologist, skeptic, and CSICOP fellow Kenneth L. Feder\u2014in his Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries (1996, 198)\u2014points out the problem of possible prior knowl\u00ad edge in such cases. \"Bond was an expert on medieval churches,\" notes Feder, \"and we know that he had access to and had examined many of the documents, maps, plans, and drawings of the abbey before initiating field research.\" Moreover, \"Al\u00ad though much of the abbey was a ruin, some walls and foundations were visible at the surface.\" The locations of the chapels, supposedly identified for Bond by spirits, were already generally identi\u00ad fied in old documents, and previous searches had gready narrowed die areas to be searched. Feder observes drat Bond simply \"searched for and found die chapels in die only reasonable places left for them to be\" (Feder 1996). Scientific tests have not proved die efficacy of psychic archaeology (Feder 1980; 1995). Such tests \"either are not conducted or are conducted so poorly as to render the results meaningless\" (Feder 1996). Some defenders of dowsing would object to its being categorized with psy\u00ad chic claims, suggesting it may have a nat\u00ad ural explanation. Dowsers have often attributed die movement of the rods or pendulums to \"eardi force fields,\" which supposedly send out \"vibrations\" such as electromagnetic or other radiations. Yet many dowsers work from maps, far from the actual locations, and some claim to receive images\u2014including those of the past and future\u2014like clairvoyants (Guiley 1991, 155-156). Dowsers have claimed success in locating hidden objects, even missing persons (Nickell 1994). Unfortunately, dowsers actually fare poorly in properly controlled tests of their abilities, as James Randi (1982; 1991) has repeatedly demonstrated. I once tested some gold dowsers in the Yukon Territory of Canada, site of the famed Klondike gold rush. Alas, they could not differenti\u00ad ate between gold nuggets, fool's gold, chromium nuts and bolts, and empty boxes\u2014aldiough they had rationaliza\u00ad tions for their failures (Nickell 1976). The well-established, scientific expla\u00ad nation for the movement of dowsing rods and pendulums is that it is due to \"die unwitting translation of thoughts into muscular action,\" die same force responsible for various phenomena like automatic writing, table tipping, the movement of a Ouija boards planchctte, etc (Gardner 1957, 109). Nevertheless, the claims continue. 14 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Here are rwo examples\u2014one from Australia, the other from Germany\u2014 that involve dowsing to supposedly locate or provide information about alleged archaeological sites. The Mahogany Ship Reportedly, a boat carrying three men hunting seals capsized off southeastern Australia in 1836, drowning the captain. The two survivors sought safety along this now aptly named \"Shipwreck Coast\" iWuEfC OVCf **i\u00bbhrv shin- ping disasters 1922). At that site, between pre\u00ad sent-day Port Fairy and Warrnambool, the two spied a wrecked ship, lodged in the hummocks (or sand dunes) (Lindsay 1996, 2). Since rhen, the legend of the Mahogany Ship has challenged historians and intrigued tourists. There is even an eye-catching \"Mahogany Ship Replica\" (figure 1) at the McDonalds restaurant in Warrnambool\u2014dubbed the \"McReplica\" by a waggish Bob Nixon, Australian Skeptics' Chief Investigator.

The enigma is that the wreck was periodically sighted and lost, presumably due to shifting sands, until it finally dis\u00ad appeared, leaving only controversy behind. Worse, it was a perambulating wreck. As Bob Nixon (2001) says: It is variously described as close to Port Hairy, mid-way between Port Fairy and Warrnambool, three miles west of Warrnambool. She is said to be high in the hummocks, well above the high tide mark, in the water, between rwo hummocks, at the end of a gap in the hummocks. She is identified to be in various states of decay, in various orientations, bows pointing west and north. In short there is little agree\u00ad ment among the reports. The chronology of events is illuminat\u00ad ing. Just after the 1836 sighting by the two sealers, an expedition was mounted by a Captain John Mills to recover their capsized boat along with the drowned captain's body. However, the searchers failed to sight the reported shipwreck. Mills again searched in 1843 and did dis\u00ad cover a wreck, which he revisited in 1847. There were sightings off and on over sub\u00ad sequent decades, until the wreck was last seen in 1880. It has since become the sub\u00ad ject of persistent legend, as in these clos\u00ad ing verses of an unattributed poem, \"The Ancient Ship\" (Lindsay 1996): Figure 1. \"McReplica\" by Bob N ... An ancient ship\u2014 we've heard the tale Was forced ashore by southern gales, Nothing left\u2014no masts or sails, Just timbers like mahogany. Will it be discovered soon That ancient ship beneath a dune? Only the sun, the stars, the moon Arc witness to this mystery. Some have thought the legendary wreck was Dutch, Spanish, or Portuguese (Loney 1998, 20), possibly even proof of a prior \"secret\" discover)- of Australia by the Portuguese, rather than by Captain Cook (Mclnryre 1977). There have been skeptics, however. In 1896 a local historian expressed doubt as to the existence of the wreck, stating that most older residents regarded it as mere fable. He cited the use of old timbers, sat\u00ad urated with whale oil, that had been used for flooring in a house; they were mistak\u00ad enly thought to have been salvaged from the Mahogany Ship but had probably come from \"an old whaling punt\" (Loney 1998, 17-18). I was fortunate to be able to investi\u00adgate the Mahogany Ship mystery with Bob Nixon and Richard Cadena. Bob had been in touch with Peter D'Aloisio, the 1988 \"Australian Champion\" water diviner (dowser) and professional water driller. D'Aloisio had used his divining rods to locate what he believed was a chain and nine-foot anchor, possibly from the fabled wreck itself. He had \"found\" the alleged relics in December 1992, and from February to June 1993 (when he was hospitalized with an angina arrack) he drilled two holes: One turned up bits of metal; he then sank a large-diameter pipe to a depth of some thirty-three feet, but unfor\u00ad tunately the shaft flooded. We met Peter, his brother Dominic, and two of their friends in Warrna\u00ad mbool and followed them to the location at Levy's Point Coastal Reserve. Peter told me he had been directed to the general site by local landmarks. He had, he said, spent about $150,000 (Australian) in motel bills and exploration costs. He and a diver had gone down to the bottom of the flooded pipe shaft but could not be certain what was there. Since 1993 the pipe has been sealed with a metal cover (D'Aloisio 2000). Peter demonstrated his dowsing tech\u00ad nique for us at the site. We took pho\u00ad tographs (see figure 2) and later discussed the evidence at the Mahogany Ship Restaurant (where I had a delicious kan\u00ad garoo steak). Peter showed us some papers related to his project, but the report on tests of the metal traces he had obtained by drilling\u2014provided by Monash University\u2014determined they had proba\u00ad bly been from one of Peter's own broken drill bits (D'Aloisio 2000; Nixon 2001a). Not only is the dowsing evidence therefore unsupported, but much other evidence renders unlikely the claim that a Mahogany Ship anchor has been found. For example, while one possible location for the wreck (shown on a widely pub\u00ad lished map) is appropriately near the beach, the D'Aloisio site is almost a mbool, along ixon. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 15 kilometer inland, a fact difficult to recon\u00ad cile with a beached ship. Actually there is evidence that casts doubt on die existence of an ancient Portuguese (or odier exploratory caravel's) wreck. As it happens, the \"original\" 1836 sighting was reported only decades later and there are conflicting, even apparently \"doctored\" versions of some accounts (McKiggan 1987, 65). Indeed, Hugh Donnelly, who claimed to have been aboard the boat diat set out to recover the capsized whale boat and body of the drowned captain in 1836, did not arrive in Australia until five years later (Fawcett n.d.). Richard, Bob, and I\u2014in addition to visiting the D'Aloisio site, taking pho\u00ad tos, and looking over his documents\u2014explored the area in and around Tower Hill. Actually a lake-filled ancient volcano crater, it provided a magnificent view of Armstrong's Bay to the south, the reputed site of the Mahogany Ship. We also did research at the Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum where we obtained clippings and researched anchors, learning that one from an ancient Portuguese ship would proba\u00ad bly have been much smaller than that described by D'Aloisio. We also inter\u00ad viewed a member of the Mahogany Ship Committee, John Lindsay (2000), who told us that extensive negative results of searching with a magnetome\u00ad ter suggest it is unlikely an anchor would be found in the area. Finally, we visited the local library, staying until closing time and photocopying much material. This included information from a book cited in a Mahogany Ship display at the museum\u2014which turned out to be a novel! Back in Melbourne, Bob Nixon and I visited die state library of Victoria to con\u00ad duct still further research. We searched out early newspaper accounts on micro\u00ad film, notably one from the Portland Guardian of Octobet 29, 1847, describ\u00ad ing a wreck found near Warrnambool. It was \"thrown completely into the hum\u00admocks, and buried in the sand,\" its deck was \"completely gone.\" The account went on to suggest it had been die source of \"a number of articles strewed along the beach\" in 1841, adding diat \"from several articles of French manufacture that were then found it was deemed that the vessel had been a French whaler.\" Bob and I have come to believe diat this French whaler was a plausible\u2014I will even say probable\u2014candidate for the Figure 2. Peter D'Aloisio dowsing the site where he believes may lie the anchor of the Mahogany Ship. (In background, left to right, are Bob Nixon, Richard Cadena, Peter's brother, and a friend.) Mahogany Ship. Given the differing descriptions and locations, however, it appears that more than one wreck could be involved. In any case, to date there is no evidence that dowsing has added any\u00ad thing other than confusion to the ship\u00ad wreck mystery. Celtic Sites During an investigative tour of Germany in the fall of 2002 (Nickell 2003a; 2003b), which included some locales in Franconia (northern Bavaria), 1 was able to explore three sites associated with the legendary Druids, the Celtic priesthood. The expedition, on a bleak, drizzly October 13, was arranged at the request of my excellent German guide, Martin Manner, Executive Director of the Center for Inquiry\u2014Europe. Accompanying us were several intrepid members of the Bamberg Skeptics Guild and our distin\u00ad guished leader, geologist Michael Link, from the Paleontological Institute of the University of Erlangen. Michael was con\u00ad ducting the three-site tour in English especially for me, and I am indebted for that and many additional kindnesses from him and others (see Acknowledgments). From Bamberg, our little convoy pro\u00ad ceeded some fifty kilometers southeast into the atea known to tourists as \"Franconian Switzerland\" for its moun\u00ad tainous terrain, caves, castle ruins, and other scenic features. It was once inhab\u00ad ited by the Celts, a tribe that extended into central Europe about 1200 B.C. Our first stop took us to a remote wooded hill known as Ringwall. Had we not been with Michael Link, we would have thought it only a scenic place with some natural rock outcroppings. Once shown, however, we could sec that, in addition, covered with thick moss and a stand of trees, were distinct earthworks. They had been added to the limestone formations to create what was, indeed, an ancient Celtic fortress\u2014hence the name Ringwall (\"circular rampart\"). Michael informed us that exca\u00ad vations at the site turned up iron implements and pottery dating to ca. 500 B.C From Ringwall we proceeded to another isolated site, about 1.5 kilometers further southeast, known as Espershohle {hohle meaning \"cavern\"). This is a cave of Jurassic limestone from which cold air emanates, giving it the popular name Eisholle (i.e., \"Ice Hell\"). It may have had mystical meaning fot the Celts. Having been an avid spelunker during my college years, I was Michael Link's apt pupil when he pointed out that the amphitheater-like entranceway resulted from a cave \"room\" having collapsed and over time becoming exposed at die surface (see figure 3). A passageway (which is home to hibernat\u00ad ing bats from October until April) leads to a fifteen-meter-deep pit. This was exca\u00ad vated by archaeologists in 1937-1938, and the recovered artifacts identified it as a Celtic site. The presence of skeletal remains\u2014some bones even exhibiting knife marks\u2014seemed to indicate the practice of sacrifice (Link 2002). The last of the three sites we visited on our expedition is known as Druidenhain 16 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER or \"Druid's Grove.\" The arrangement of giant rocks that litter the wooded area, interspersed with passageways for a labyrinthine effect, have inspired popular belief that it is an ancient Celtic site. Some have called it \"The University of the Druids.\" Supposedly, the Celts sub\u00ad jected the rock to heating and cooling to produce fracturing and thus create the \"monoliths,\" a notion leading to another sobriquet for the place, \"The Franconian Stonehenge\" (Link \"Bowl Stone,\" \"Entrance to the Underworld,\" and so on. The belief that the place was one of sacrifice\u2014an idea that dates from 1863\u2014led to one boulder being styled the \"Sacrificial Stone.\" Dowsers eventually got into the game and in 1983 determined that the \"Altar Stone\" was at the intersection of two \"earth-ray\" lines. These are apparendy similar to the earth-energy or \"ley\" lines that are imagined to connect mystical sites; leys represent an idea advanced by English beer salesman Alfred Watkins (1925), an amateur antiquarian. Dowsing is often touted as a method of supposedly detecting such \"earth energies\" (Guiley 1991,157). Dowsing was also used in other ways at Druidenhain. For example, dowsers employed their witching wands to deter\u00ad mine the supposedly true nature of one of the supposed megaliths. As a conse\u00ad quence, it was bestowed with the fanciful name, \"The Grave\" (Link 2002). Alas for the evidence from dowsing, and for the belief that the site is Celtic or even manmade, Druidenhain has yielded no potsherds, skeletal remains, or other evidence of human habitation. More\u00ad over, the array of \"monolith';\" is actually a natural formation\u2014the product of geologic forces and erosion. (During the geologic formation of the mountain, pressure caused the rock to fracture, pro\u00ad ducing numerous faults crisscrossing each other. These faults were then attacked preferentially by seeping water, with the erosion along the lines eventu\u00ad ally resulting in a multitude of rocks aligned in rows [Link 2002).) Conclusions As both the Mahogany Ship and \"Druidic Grove\" cases demonstrate, dowsing does not seem an effective method of archaeo\u00ad logical investigation\u2014whether consid\u00ad ered a \"psychic\" means or not. However, not only is science an ongo\u00ad ing process, but so is popular belief. From either perspective, it is important to con\u00ad tinue to look at significant new cases and Figure 3.

May/June THINKING ABOUT SCIENCi MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI 'Elementary, Dear Watson' i t turns out that Sherlock Holmes never says \"Elementary, dear Watson!\" in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. App\u00ad arently, the phrase was introduced with the first theatrical representations of the fictional detective, with the consent of Doyle in reply to a letter by the actor William Gillette, who originally played one interested in critical thinking and science to understand the difference between deduction and induction, and the strengths and pitfalls of the two approaches. Deduction is a form of reasoning with which one can go from general premises to specific predictions. It was first formalized in Western philosophy The type of reasoning employed by Sherlock Holmes was not \"deduction\" at all, though Doyle referred to it that way. Holmes on the stage. More important, as far as skeptics are concerned, the type of reasoning employed by Sherlock Holmes was not \"deduction\" at all, though Doyle referred to it that way. In fact, in all his adventures Holmes uses what in philosophy of sci\u00ad ence is referred to as \"induction to the best inference.\" It is important for any- Massimo Pigliucci is associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Tennessee and author of Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scien- tism, and the Nature of Science. His essays can be found at www. rationally speaking.org. by Aristotle, who described a simple variety of it known as syllogism. From the two premises \"All men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\" one can deduce the conclusion that \"Socrates is mor\u00ad tal\" (a conclusion that, unfortunately, was given final proof when Socrates was condemned to die by the Athenian state for teaching critical thinking to the local youth). Deduction is particu\u00ad larly useful in mathematics and to for\u00ad mulate predictions (hypotheses) based on general scientific theories. Notice, however, that while deduction is truth- conservative, it is not truth-ampliative. What this means is that, if the premises are true (and the deductive sequence is formally correct), then the conclusion is guaranteed to be true (i.e., the truth of the premises is conserved). However, a deductive reasoning does not aug\u00ad ment our knowledge of the world (it is not ampliative), it simply makes explicit what is already contained in the premises. While the latter is often a valuable enterprise, it clearly is not the sort of thing that would help Holmes solve a crime, or a scientist make gen\u00ad eralizations about the world. For the latter, we need a different kind of reasoning, often referred to as induction. Induction is, in some sense, the opposite of deduction: it seeks to go from particular facts to general statements. However, the price to pay is that induction is not necessarily truth-preserving: we can generalize from specifics, but the generalization may turn out to be wrong. Bertrand Russell, with his characteristically dry humor, nicely explained this: he imag\u00ad ined an \"inductivist turkey\" which is brought to a farm and fed regularly every morning at the same time. The turkey wishes to make predictions about his future, but\u2014being a good inductivist\u2014realizes that he needs a large sample of data before being able to do so confidently. So he collects data on when he is fed, how often, and with what. After 364 days, the turkey feels confident that he has enough particular examples to draw a general conclusion: 18 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER He will be fed every morning at the same time, with the same amount and type of food. Sadly, the following day was Thanksgiving, and the turkey was instead slaughtered and brought to the farmer's table. Such are the perils of the non truth-preserving character of induction. And yet induction is a quintessential component of scientific investigations. Indeed, the argument can be made that even deductive reasoning does, ulti\u00ad mately, rely on induction: after all, one has to get die premises from somewhere, and this is usually done by induction. For example, while we can establish that \"Socrates is a man\" by direct observa\u00ad tion, the premise that \"All men are mor\u00ad tal\" is neither the result of simple obser\u00ad vation nor a necessary piece of logical inference. The only reason we think that all men are mortal is because every man we have seen so far eventually died. But\u2014for all we know\u2014we may be in die same position as Russell's turkey and drawing unwarranted conclusions from insufficient evidence (notice, inciden\u00adtally, that even \"simple observations\" are made possible by the inductive inference that our senses\u2014usually\u2014are reliable). Skeptic philosopher David Hume was the first one to recognize this \"problem of induction,\" i.e., that all our knowledge, ultimately, is based on inductive generalizations, even though we have no independent validation ol induction itself. One might think to get around the problem of induction by taking a pragmatic approach and stating that we use induction because it has worked well so far. Sure, but that in itself is a piece of inductive reasoning. You see the problem. Famously, Karl Popper thought he had solved the problem ol induction by stating that science does not seek to prove its theories, only to disprove them. This is the well-known principle of falsification. I will eventually devote a whole column to it, given its impor\u00ad tance in skepticism and science, but for now let us say that most philoso\u00ad phers ot science think that simple falsi-ficationism cannot work for the reason that we can never test hypotheses in isolation. Every time we allegedly attempt to falsify a hypothesis, in real\u00ad ity we are also testing several corollar\u00ad ies and assumptions, and at least some of them will have been derived via induction. Having said this, I wouldn't throw away science or skeptical investigation just because induction cannot be justi\u00ad fied from within science. There are solid philosophical reasons to think that sci\u00ad ence is on firm grounds as a method of inquiry, and there are plenty of results that assure us that it works. But the problem of induction is a good reminder that even skeptics and scien\u00ad tists do have to accept certain philo\u00ad sophical assumptions to do their work. If such assumptions make you a bit uncomfortable, this just adds to the fun. Further Reading Hume. D. 11748] 1956. Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Chicago. Illinois: Gateway Editions. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Mjy/Jun* 2003 19 PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS ROBERT SHEAFFER Special Forces Battle Giant Scorpions in Iraq According to a report first pub\u00ad lished December 17, 2002, in Joseph Trainor's UFO Roundup (http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/), a UFO may have crashed in Iraq\u2014leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of extraterrestrial technology that may be turned against invad\u00ad ing forces. The San Francisco Bohemian physicist Jack Sarfatti passes on information that America's \"great\u00ad est fear is that Saddam will reverse-engineer the crashed alien spacecraft. . . . The craft allegedly crashed during the Gulf War (1990-1991) or more recendy (possibly De\u00ad cember 1998). This will be Iraq's Roswell. The U.S. is currently reverse-engineering the Roswell craft and fears Saddam's scientists will catch up with or even go beyond the U.S. in one or more areas. These areas of research include zero point, over-rario or gravi\u00ad metric technology, which would allow for a tremendous advance, allowing Iraq to become a leading power.\" Robert Sheaffer's World Wide Web page for UFOs and other skeptical subjects is at www. debunker. com. The Arab reporter Mohammed Hajj al-Amdar writes, \"Saddam gave the aliens sanctuary, so that they couldn't be cap\u00ad tured by Americans. Nobody can reach the citadel Qalaat-e-Julundi at night. They say that the aliens created 'watch\u00ad dogs' for Saddam. The aliens took ordi- Soldiers prepare for battle in Iraq. nary desert scorpions and used their bio- engineering to grow die scorpions to giant size. Scorpions of a cow-size! They are wonderful watchdogs: they blend in widi die desert, swifdy and silendy move on their warm-blooded prey for a decisive arrack. Luckless intruders hear just some strange sound from behind stones, then a pincer crushes their necks, another pincer crushes their legs; then the victim is slammed to die ground and beaten with a barbed tail six or seven times. Dearii comes almost immediately.... I hear that Saddam says die mission of diese creatures is 'to discourage guests who have not been invited.'\" The story about Saddam's crashed UFO was picked up by the Russian news\u00ad paper Pravda on January 31, citing Trainor. Pravda adds to the story by citing dubious sources who claimed that \"A high-ranking source admitted that U.S. Air Forces F-16 brought down a UFO over Saudi Arabia dur\u00ad ing the Operation Desert Storm, and five countries are trying to conceal information about this fact.... It was a relatively small craft, of approximately fifteen feet in diameter. It had three chairs, probably for crew mem\u00ad bers, but they were so small as if meant for children. To all appearance, space aliens were just about three feet tall. However, it seems incredible that there were no dead bodies at the crash site.\" Pravda leaves itself an \"out\" by suggesting, \"If no addi\u00ad tional information follows in connection with the case, it may be sail considered just doubtful anonymous rumors,\" leav\u00ad ing one to wonder why the newspaper published them in the first place. 20 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER The best-selling horror and fantasy writer Whitley Strieber, who also writes supposedly true accounts about his encounters widi alien-like entities, placed die story of Saddam's Scorpions on his Web site (www.unknowncountry.com/ news/?id=2351). Strieber suggests that Saddam may have planted the crashed saucer stories to scare people away from Qalaat-e-Julundi, where his henchmen may be making banned weapons. * s * If the messages received from the Zetas by Nancy Lieder are correct, by the time this is published, the whole world will be staring up at the huge red object in the sky. And we don't mean the planet Mars, which this summer will be drawing unusually close to Earth and has undoubtedly already startled many early- risers. We refer instead to a supposed Planet X, which according to the Zetas is now approaching Earth to cause a \"pole shift\" and massive destruction on or about May 15 (see this column, Nov\u00ad ember/December 2002). \"The Twelfth Planet will be visible to the common man some seven weeks prior to the shift, with\u00ad out the use of telescopes,\" says Nancy, meaning that it should have become visi\u00ad ble around the end of March. \"Planet X will have a distinct red appearance, with a roiling tail full of moons, that are more concerned with the dance between them than any effect the solar wind might have upon them. Thus, they swirl, and look like a dragon approaching, not a straight line tail at all. Nevertheless, we anticipate NASA will explain the Planet X complex as any number of things, or rather their lackeys, who will natter the word on every Internet or media source that allows their nattering\u2014asteroid bunch, passing comet [C2002/X5], unusual comet [C2002/V1], Mars closest pass in many eons, or whatever.\" In other words, by May \"Planet X\" will be huge and impossible to miss, but the government will attempt to convince you that you are actually seeing something else. At the dme of this writing, Nancy still appears supremely confident that her prophecy of doom will indeed take place. She notes on her Web site (which claims to be in the top five percent of sites, and it wouldn't surprise me if it is) that last December, the popular late-night radio host Art Bell interviewed Sylvia Browne, \"the well-known psychic and author. And she disclosed she is no longer able to see the future beyond the summer of 2003.\" Bell also interviewed Ed Dames, who claims to have been a \"remote viewer\" employed by the CIA. Dames said that \"he and his remote viewing team are no longer able to remote view the future beyond next summer.\" From this, Nancy deduces that there will be no future beyond this summer. It will be instructive to check Nancys Web site, www.zetatalk.com, after her Doomsday has come and gone to see what explanation she offers for the fact that the Earth is still intact. Some possibilities: (1) She misinterpreted the Zetas messages, and the destruction is coming at a later date; or (2) the cosmic near-collision has already occurred, and we didn't notice it; or (3) she may say nothing, do nothing, and just slink away. But just because Earth has narrowly avoided destruction at the hands of a planet diat failed to show up for doom as scheduled does not mean that doomsday won't soon be upon us. In another issue of Trainor's UFO Roundup (October 15, 2002), he notes that \"Neo-Nazis, Black Sun enthusiasts and a handful of esoteric types believe that Hitler's Germany made contact sixty years ago with an alien civi\u00ad lization on a planet orbiting the star Aldebaran, from Earth.\" (According to some contempo\u00ad rary neo-Nazi conspiracy theories, the Aryans actually arrived thousands of years ago in spaceships from Aldebaran.) \"In a last-ditch effort to stave off defeat, the Nazis launched a crude spaceship, the Vril-Odin, which traveled to Aldebaran, seeking military assistance against the Allies. The ship supposedly arrived in 1967.\" If this is true, then the worlds first manned space voyage was interstel\u00ad lar, and it traveled faster than light. At this very moment, an \"Aldebarani space armada\" consisting of over 200 heavily armed battle cruisers and the like is sup\u00ad posedly on its way to Earth to deal World War Us victorious allies a crushing defeat. But since this information comes from a book published by a notorious holocaust denier, I wouldn't bet money on its veracity. Trainor has more to say about \"saucer Nazis\" in the item about Saddam's Scorpions. He notes that \"Nazi interest in Iraq goes back eighty years to the early 1920s.\" Supposedly the early Nazi leader Detlef Schmude went to Iraq in 1924, \"and spent the next few years hunting for what he called 'the Hidden Masters.'\" In 1940, SS-Brigadefuhrer Karl Maria Wiligut \"called Himmler's attention to important archaeological discoveries in Iraq's Irbil province.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Miy/)un\u00ab 2003 21 NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO I Remember Doing the Time Warp The Incredible Story of Father Ernetti's Chronovisor Marco Tullio Cicero, the great lawyer, orator, politician, and philosopher, gave a speech to die Roman senate in 63 B.C. and an observer noted: \"His gestures, his intona\u00ad tion; how powerful they were! What flights of oratory!\" These comments, however, are not from a contemporary of Cicero but instead from Father Pellegrino Ernetti, an Italian Benedictine monk born in 1925 and who died in 1992. Logically, similar appreciations on gestures and intonations could only be possible by observing the said orator in action; this is exactly what Father Ernetti claimed he had done. Not only that, die monk was also apparently able to witness one of Napoleon's speeches, a Latin tragedy of 169 B.C., and even the passion of Christ on die cross. Just anodier mystic visionary? Not at all. Father Ernetti was a musician, a cele\u00ad brated historian of archaic music at Venice's Conservatorio di Stato Benedetto Marcello, a philosopher, and a physics studies graduate. It was thanks to his sci\u00ad entific interest that, in the 1950s, he was able to build the \"Chronovisor,\" a true time machine! Unlike die fantastic one imagined by H.G. Wells, however, die Chronovisor could not transport people back and forth Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and co- founder and head of CICAP, the Italian skeptics group. in time but was said to allow the user to see historical events in the exact moment they took place, like a sort of tridimen\u00ad sional television. As Time Goes By Father Ernetti, who was also an exorcist of considerable renown, claimed that the Chronovisor was die result of many years of study by a team of scientists that, apart from himself, included twelve famous people who, he said, preferred to be anonymous. The only names he let slip were those of physicist and Nobel Laureate Enrico Fermi and of rocket sci\u00ad entist Wernher von Braun. \"First of all we wanted to verify that what we saw was authentic,\" Ernetti told Father Francois Brune, a French dieolo- gian and author who had befriended die Italian monk. \"So we started off with a relatively recent scene of which we had much documentation and footage. We tuned the machine on one of Mussolini's speeches. Then we started to go backward and observed Napoleon giving die speech in which he proclaimed Italy a republic. We then traveled much further back in time, to ancient Rome. First, there was a bustling fruit and vegetable market in the time of Emperor Trajan. Next, a speech by Cicero, one of the most famous, the first delivered against Catilina.\" Ernetti said that he had noticed slight differences in the Latin pronunciation of Cicero's time as compared to the Latin taught in schools today. Next, die time-travelers \"dallied,\" as Ernetti put it, \"at a playlet.\" The year was 169 B.C.; they watched part of a tragedy, Thyestes, written by the \"father of Latin poetry,\" Quintus Ennius. It was a play, explained Ernetti, that is now almost wholly lost to us; only twenty-five frag\u00ad ments, a line or so each, have survived. \"Have you been able to reconstruct what you heard?\" asked Father Brune. \"Yes,\" replied Father Ernetti enthusiasti\u00ad cally. \"Since we heard and saw everything, text, choruses, music, I've been able to publish the entire text of the tragedy.\" Ernetti appeared to be very reticent to give details about the machine's invention. \"It happened virtually by accident.... The basic idea was very sim\u00ad ple. It was just a matter of stumbling upon it.\" And who exactly invented it? \"No one person\" replied Ernetti. It had been a joint creation, where Fermi played a seminal role. Father Ernetti said the Chronovisor consisted of three components. First, a multitude of antennae, which were able to pick up every conceivable wavelength of light and sound. These antennae were made of alloys consisting of three mysteri\u00ad ous metals. The second component was a type of direction finder, activated and dri\u00ad ven by the wavelengths of light and sound which it received. You could set it to a given place, date, and even person of your choice. The third component was an extremely complex array of recording 22 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER devices, which made possible the record\u00ad ing of sound\u2014and particularly of images\u2014from any time and any place (Brune and Chauvin 1993). Jesus Christ Superstar! Aside from these engaging tales, however, the only solid fact was that nobody had ever seen the Chronovisor; the only proof of its existence was Father Ernetti's words. On May 2, 1972, the weekly Italian magazine La Domenica del Corriere (Courier's Sunday) pub\u00ad lished a picture which Father Ernetti claimed was obtained through the Chronovisor: the image showed Christ's face in agony on the cross. \"At first,\" explained Father Ernetti to Brune, \"we tried to recapture the images of the day of Christ's crucifixion. But we had a problem. Crucifixions, as awful as they were, were commonplace in Christ's time. People were nailed to the cross every day. It also did\u00ad n't help that Christ wore a crown of thorns, because, contrary to popular belief, it wasn't unusual to be punished by having a crown of thorns put on your head.\" They were thus obliged to go a few days further back in time, to the last supper of Christ. \"We saw everything\" said Father Ernetti Supposed simply. \"The agony in the garden, the betrayal of Judas, the trial\u2014Calvary.\" The Chronovisor team brought back a record of this experience: \"We filmed it\u2014 losing the fine details, of course, but film\u00ad ing it was the only way to preserve it.\" No trace of this film, however, ever came to light. The only objective proof that came out of this story was that pic\u00ad ture. A few months after its publication, however, the mystery was solved: in the August 1972 issue of the Giornale dei Misteri (Journal of Mysteries) a letter and a photo were published. A reader, Alfonso De Silva, explained that he had purchased the photo for 100 lire in the gift shop of the Santuario dell'Amore Miscricordioso (Sanctuary of Merciful Love) in the town of Collevalenza, neat Todi and Perugia. It was a photograph of the face of Christ on a woodcarving adorning the sanctuary. The woodcarv\u00ad ing was by a Spanish sculptor named Cullot Valera. This photo and the one produced by Father Ernetti were identical, except that one was the mirror image of the other. No one could deny that they were identical, not even Father Brune who, when the monk had less than a year to live, asked his friend about this compromising photo. photograph of Jesus by Father Pellegrino Ernetti. Ernetti's reply was very disingenu\u00ad ous: \"He explained that he was aware of the other photo, aware that it was the work of a Spanish sculptor. He also said he knew that the Spanish sculptor had carved his Christ according to the instructions of a certain Spanish nun. that this Spanish nun had been a mystic who carried the stigmata of Christ on her body and was consumed by ecstatic visions of Christ's Passion.\" Ernetti seemed to have assumed that Father Brune would understand the rest. The Parisian priest does not dwell on this in his article but Peter Krassa, author of Father Ernetti's Chronovisor, does and assumes that Father Ernetti is tendering the following explanation: The ecstatic vision of Christ's Passion which the mys\u00ad tical nun had enjoyed was a vision of Christ dying on the cross on Golgotha. This was the vision she had communi\u00ad cated to the Spanish sculptor; following her instructions, he had sculpted on the face of the Christ on the wooden cross the exact features, the very expression of Christ, that she had seen in her vision! The fact that not only were the pictures identical in their subject, but also in the shadows and light reflections, means that the two images were in fact the same picture (Krassa 2000). Sunset Boulevard No trace of the Chronovisor exists and Father Ernetti was very careful to explain that, after its experimen\u00ad tal runs, it had been disassembled and \"hidden in a safe place.\" But why hide such a discovery, Father Brune asked. Father Ernetti's replied, \"This machine can tune in on everyones past completely, leaving nothing out. With it, there can be no more secrets; no more state secrets, no more industrial secrets\u2014no more private lives. The door would be wide open for the most fearsome dictatorship the world has ever seen. We ended up agreeing to dis\u00ad mantle our machine\" (Brune and Chauvin 1993). What to make, then, of such an incredible tale? \"As a matter of fact,\" says Peter Krassa in a recent interview in Fortean Times, \"there is no reliable witness to Ernetti s claims. No one ever saw the Chronovisor, not even Brune or Senkowski, who were both in close contact with him. Ernetti never named the scientists who were cooperating with him because he wanted, he claimed, to protect them from public harassment. The exceptions were Wernher von Braun and Enrico Fermi, who were already dead\" (Heinzerling 2002). Aside from the photograph of Christ, which turned out to be a fake, the only other \"proof\" of the existence of the Chronovisor was the transcript of the Thyestcs, the lost tragedy. Actually, this one as well, after close scrutiny by Katherine Owen Eldred, who holds a Ph.D. in Classics from Princeton University, provides reasons to doubt. For SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 23 one thing, a number of words in the text expect (Krassa 2000). do not appear in the Latin language Near the end of die Chronovisor saga, until at least 250 years later. Also, says as in a classic mystery tale, comes an unex- Was Ernetti the culprit of a pious fraud, wishing that his tales could lend credibility to Christianity? Or was he the victim of a monster that he created and could not kill? Eldred, there are certain words which are reused in this text too often, clear sign of a limited Latin vocabulary\u2014 which was certainly not the case with author Quinto Ennio. Furthermore, of the twenty-four frag\u00ad ments of Ennio's Thyestes which have been preserved for us by later commenta\u00ad tors such as Cicero, Nonius, and Statius, more dian half show up in the Ernetti Thyestes piece. Since the Ernetti Thyestes playlet is only one-tenth the probable length of die complete tragedy by Ennius, it might have been expected that, on the average, about ten percent of the frag\u00ad ments would show up. Here 65 percent of the fragments show up\u2014about seven times as many as you might reasonably pected surprise: a confession. In his book, Krassa reproduced a letter from an unidentified \"distant relative\" of Father Ernetti who claimed he had met him on his deathbed. Ernetti wished to leave this world with a clear conscience, and so he admitted that \"he had not really brought that play back on the Chronovisor. He said that he thought he had composed the play himself, using many fragments that were preserved in the writings of other authors\u2014but he could only very obscurely remember doing that.\" However, before taking this as a true con\u00ad fession one must know that a few sen\u00ad tences later Father Ernetti tells about another lifetime in which he was a con\u00ad temporary of Nostradamus. \"I knew him. He was an alchemist and a physicist. He, too, experimented with a Chronovisor. It was he who taught me that it might be possible.\" Was Ernetti the culprit of a pious fraud, wishing that his tales could lend credibility to Christianity? Or was he the victim of a monster that he created and could not kill, like the Fox sisters who started out by playing a joke on their parents and ended up inventing Spiritualism? We will never know . . . unless, of course, someday, someone will come forward with a time machine and will let us go back in time and ask Ernetti for the truth.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 25 The Luck Factor A ten-year scientific study into the nature of luck has revealed that, to a large extent, people make their own good and bad fortune. The results also show that it is possible to enhance the amount of luck that people encounter in their lives. RICHARD WISEMAN Barnett Helzberg Jr. is a lucky man. By 1994 he had built up a chain of highly successful jewelry stores with an annual revenue of around $300 million. One day he was walking past the Plaza Hotel in New York when he heard a woman call out, \"Mr. Buffett\" to the man next to him. Helzberg wondered whether the man might be Warren Buffett\u2014one of the most successful investors in America. Helzberg had never met Buffett, but had read about the financial criteria that Buffett used when buying a company. Helzberg had recently turned sixty, was thinking of selling his company, and realized that his might be the type of com\u00ad pany that would interest Buffett. Helzberg seized the oppor\u00ad tunity, walked over to the stranger and introduced himself. May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER The man did indeed turn out to be Warren Buffett, and the chance meeting proved highly fortuitous because about a year later Buffett agreed to buy Helzberg's chain of stores. And all because Helzberg just happened to be walking by as a woman called out Buffett's name on a street corner in New York. Helzberg's story illustrates the effect of luck in business, but good fortune also plays a vital role in all aspects of our lives. Stanford psychologist Alfred Bandura has discussed the impact of chance encounters and luck on people's personal lives. Bandura noted both the importance and prevalence of such encounters, writing that \"some of the most important deter\u00ad minants of life paths often arise through the most trivial of cir\u00ad cumstances.\" He supports his C9\u00ab\" with several telling exam\u00ad ples, one of which was drawn from his life. As a graduate stu\u00ad dent, Bandura became bored with a reading assignment and so decided to visit the local golf links with a friend. Just by chance, Bandura and his friend found themselves playing behind two attractive female golfers, and soon joined them as a foursome. After the game, Bandura arranged to meet up with one of the women again, and eventually ended up marrying her. A chance meeting on a golf course altered his entire life. In short, lucky events exert a dramatic influence over our lives. Luck has the power to transform the improbable into the possible, to make the difference between life and death, reward and ruin, happiness and despair. The Power of Superstition People have searched for an effective way of improving the good fortune in their lives for many centuries. Lucky charms, amulets, and talismans have been found in virtually all civiliza\u00ad tions throughout recorded history, lbuching (\"knocking on\") wood dates back to pagan rituals that were designed to elicit the help of benign and powerful tree gods. The number thir\u00ad teen is seen as unlucky because there were thirteen people at Christ's last supper. When a ladder is propped up against a wall it forms a natural triangle which used to be seen as symbolic of die Holy Trinity. To walk under the ladder would break the Trinity and therefore bring ill fortune. Many of these beliefs and behavior? ar<- still with us. In 1996, the Gallup Organization asked 1,000 Americans whether they were superstitious. Fifty three percent of people said that they were at least a little superstitious, and 25 percent admitted to being somewhat or very superstitious. Another survey revealed that 72 percent of the public said that they possessed at least one good luck charm. Superstitious beliefs Richard Wiseman is a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire and a CSICOP fellow. E-mail: R. Wiseman @herts.ac.uk. This article is based on his new book The Luck Factor, published in April 2003 by Talk Books. Web site: www. luckfactor. co. uk. pSfHaXxwyflgp SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 27 and behaviors have been passed down from generation to gen\u00ad eration. Our parents told us about them and we will pass them on to our children. But why do they persist? I believe that the answer lies in the power of luck. Throughout history, people have recognized that good and bad luck can transform lives. A few seconds of ill fortune can lay waste years of striving, and moments of good luck can save an enormous amount of hard work. Superstition represents people's attempts to control and enhance this most elusive of factors. And the enduring nature of these superstitious beliefs and behaviors reflects the extent Superstition comes from a time when people thought that luck was a strange force that could only be controlled by magical rituals and bizarre behaviors. of people's desire to find ways of increasing their good luck. In short, superstitions were created, and have survived, because they promise that most elusive of holy grails-\u2014a way of enhancing good fortune. Testing Superstition There is just one problem. Superstition doesn't work. Several researchers have also tested the validity of these age-old beliefs and found them wanting. My favorite experiment into the topic was a rather strange study conducted by high school stu\u00ad dent (and member of the New York Skeptics) Mark Levin. In some countries, a black cat crossing your path is seen as lucky, in other countries it is seen as unlucky. Levin wanted to dis\u00ad cover whether people's luck really changed when a black cat crossed their path. To find out, he asked two people to try their luck at a simple coin tossing game. Next, a black cat was encouraged to walk across their path, and the participants then played the coin tossing game a second time. As a \"control\" condition. Levin also repeated the experiment using a white, rather than a black, cat. After much coin tossing and cat cross\u00ad ing. Levin concluded that neither the black or white cat had any efFect on participants' luck. Also, skeptics have regularly staged events in which they have broken well-known supersti\u00ad tions, such as walking under ladders and smashing mirrors\u2014 all have survived the ordeals intact. A few years ago I decided to put the power of lucky charms to the test by empirically evaluating the actual effect that they have on people's luck, lives, and happiness. I asked a group of volunteers to complete various standardized questionnaires measuring their levels of life satisfaction, happiness, and luck. Next, diey were asked to carry a lucky charm with them and to monitor the effect that it had on their lives. The charms had been purchased from a New Age center and promised to enhance good fortune, wealth, and happiness. After a few weeks everyone in the group was asked to indicate the effect that the charms had had on their lives. Overall, there was absolutely no efFect in terms of how satisfied they were with their lives, how happy they were, or how lucky they felt. Interestingly, a few participants diought that they had been especially unlucky, and seemed somewhat relieved that they could now return the charms. The Luck Project Superstition doesn't work because it is based on outdated and incorrect thinking. It comes from a time when people thought that luck was a strange force that could only be controlled by magical rituals and bizarre behaviors. Ten years ago I decided to take a more scientific investigation into the concept of luck. I decided that the best method was to examine why some people are consis\u00ad tently lucky whilst others encounter little but ill fortune. In short, why some people seem to live charmed lives full of lucky breaks and chance encounters, while others experience one disaster after another. I placed advertisements in national newspapers and magazines, asking for people who considered themselves exceptionally lucky or unlucky to contact me. Over the years, 400 extraordinary men and women have volunteered to participate in my research; the youngest eighteen, a student, the oldest eighty-four, a retired accountant. They were drawn from all walks of life\u2014businessmen, factory workers, teachers, housewives, doctors, secretaries, and salespeople. All were kind enough to let me put their lives and minds under the microscope. Jessica, a forty-two-year-old forensic scientist, is typical of the lucky people in the group. She is currently in a long-term relationship with a man who she met completely by chance at a dinner party. In fact, good fortune has helped her achieve many of her lifelong ambitions. As she once explained to me, \"I have my dream job, two wonderful children, and a great guy that I love very much. It's amazing, when I look back at my life I realize that I have been lucky in just about every area.\" In contrast, the unlucky participants have not been so fortunate. Patricia, twenty-seven, has experienced bad luck throughout much of her life. A few years ago, she started to work as cabin crew for an airline, and quickly gained a reputation as being accident-prone and a bad omen. One of her first flights had to make an unplanned stop-over because some passengers had become drunk and abusive. Another of Patricia's flights was struck by lightning, and just weeks later a third flight was forced to make an emergency landing. Patricia was also con\u00ad vinced that her ill fortune could be transferred to otJicrs and 28 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER so never wished people good luck, because this had caused them to fail important interviews and exams. She is also unlucky in love and has staggered from one broken relation\u00ad ship to the next. Patricia never seems to get any lucky breaks and always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Over the years I have interviewed these volunteers, asked them to complete diaries, personality questionnaires, and intelligence tests, and invited them to my laboratory to par\u00ad ticipate in experiments. The findings have revealed that luck is not a magical ability or the result of random chance. Nor are people born lucky or unlucky. Instead, although lucky and unlucky people have almost no insight into the real causes of their good and bad luck, their thoughts and behavior arc responsible for much of their fortune. My research revealed that lucky people generate their own good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intu\u00ad ition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good. about the whole situation. They became very focused on the center dot and over a third of them missed the large dots when they appeared on die screen. The harder they looked, the less they saw. And so it is with luck\u2014unlucky people miss chance opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else. They go to parties intent on finding their per\u00ad fect partner and so miss opportunities to make good friends. They look through newspapers determined to find certain type of job advertisements and as a result miss other types of jobs. Lucky people are more relaxed and open, and therefore Lucky people generate their own good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good. Chance Opportunities Take the case of chance opportunities. Lucky people consis\u00ad tently encounter such opportunities whereas unlucky people do not. I carried out a very simple experiment to discover whether this was due to differences in their ability to spot such opportunities. I gave both luck)' and unlucky people a newspaper, and asked them to look through it and tell me how many photographs were inside. On average, the unlucky people took about two minutes to count the photographs whereas the lucky people took just seconds. Why? Because the second page of the newspaper contained the message \"Stop counting\u2014There are 43 photographs in this newspa\u00ad per.\" This message took up half of the page and was written in type that was over two inches high. It was staring everyone straight in rhc face, but the unlucky people tended to miss it and the lucky people tended to spot it. Just for fun, I placed a second large message halfway through the newspaper. This one announced: \"Stop counting, tell the experimenter you have seen this and win $250.\" Again, the unlucky people missed the opportunity because they were still too busy look\u00ad ing for photographs. Personality tests revealed that unlucky people are generally much more tense and anxious than lucky people, and research has shown that anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected. In one experiment, people were asked to watch a moving dot in the center of a computer screen. Without warn\u00ad ing, large dots would occasionally be flashed at the edges of the screen. Nearly all participants noticed these large dots. The experiment was then repeated with a second group of people, who were offered a large financial reward for accurately watch\u00ad ing the center dot. This time, people were far more anxious see what is there rather than just what they are looking for. But this is only part of the story when it comes to chance opportunities. Many of my lucky participants went to consid\u00ad erable lengths to introduce variety and change into their lives. Before making an important decision, one lucky participant would constantly alter his route to work. Another person described a special technique that he had developed to force him to meet different types of people. He had noticed that whenever he went to a party, he tended to talk to the same type of people. To help disrupt this routine, and make life more fun, he thinks of a color before he arrives at the party and then chooses to only speak to people wearing that color of clothing at the party! At some parties he only spoke to women in red, at another he chatted exclusively to men in black. Although it may seem strange, under certain circumstances, this type of behavior will actually increase the amount of chance opportunities in people's lives. Imagine living in the center of a large apple orchard. Each dav vou have to venture into the orchard and collect a large basket of apples. The first few times it won't matter where you decide to visit. All parts of the orchard will have apples and so you will be able to find them wherever you go. But as time goes on it will become more and more difficult to find apples in the places that you have visited before. And the more you return to the same loca\u00ad tions, the harder it will be to find apples there. But if you decide to always go to parts of the orchard that you have never visited before, or even randomly decide where to go, your chances of finding apples will be dramatically increased. And it is exactly the same with luck. It is easy for people to exhaust the opportunities in their life. Keep on talking to the same SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 29 people in the same way. Keep taking the same route to and from work. Keep going to the same places on vacation. But new or even random experiences introduce the potential for new opportunities. Dealing with Bad Luck But a lucky life is not just about creating and noticing chance opportunities. Another important principle revolved around the way in which lucky and unlucky people dealt with the ill fortune in their lives. Imagine being chosen to represent your country in the Olympic Games. You compete in the games, do very well, and win a bronze medal. How happy do you think that you would feel? Most of us would, I suspect, be overjoyed and proud of our achievement. Now imagine turning the clock back and competing at the same Olympic Games a sec\u00ad ond time. This time you do even better and win a silver medal. How happy do you think you would feel now? Most of us think that we would feel happier after winning the silver medal than the bronze. This is not surprising. After all, the medals are a reflection of our performance, and the silver medal indi\u00ad cates a better performance than a bronze medal. But research suggests that athletes who win bronze models are actually happier than those who win silver medals. And the reason for this has to do with the way in which the ath\u00ad letes think about their performance. The silver medallists focus on the notion that if they had performed slightly better, then they would have perhaps won a gold medal. In contrast, the bronze medallists focus on the thought that if they had performed slightly worse, then they wouldn't have won any\u00ad thing at all. Psychologists refer to our ability to imagine what might have happened, rather than what actually did happen, as \"counter-factual.\" I wondered whether lucky people might be using counter- factual thinking to soften the emotional impact of the ill for\u00ad tune that they experienced in their lives. To find out, I decided to present lucky and unlucky people with some unlucky sce\u00ad narios and see how they reacted. I asked lucky and unlucky people to imagine that they were waiting to be served in a bank. Suddenly, an armed robber enters the bank, fires a shot, and the bullet hits them in the arm. Would this event be lucky or unlucky? Unlucky people tended to say that this would be enormously unlucky and it would be just their bad luck to be in die bank during the robbery. In contrast, lucky people viewed the scenario as being far luckier, and often sponta\u00ad neously commented on how the situation could have been far worse. As one lucky participant commented, \"It's lucky because you could have been shot in the head\u2014also, you could sell your story to the newspapers and make some money.\" The differences between the lucky and unlucky people were striking. Lucky people tend to imagine spontaneously how the bad luck they encounter could have been worse and, in doing so, diey feel much better about themselves and their lives. This, in turn, helps keep their expectations about the future high, and, increases die likelihood of diem continuing to live a lucky life. 30 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Luck School I wondered whether the principles uncovered during my work could be used to increase the amount of good luck that people encounter in their lives. To find out, 1 created \"luck school\"\u2014a series of experiments examining whether people's luck can be enhanced by getting them to think and behave like a lucky person. The project comprised two main parts. In the first part I met up with participants on a one-to-one basis, and asked them to complete standard questionnaires measuring their luck and how satisfied diey were with six major areas of their life. I then described the four main principles of luck, explained how lucky people used these to create good fortune in their lives, and described simple techniques designed to help them think and behave like a lucky person. For example, as I noted earlier, without realizing it, lucky people tend to use var\u00ad ious techniques to create chance opportunities, and soften the emotional impact of any ill fortune they encounter. During luck school participants were shown how to be more open to the opportunities that surround them, how to break daily rou\u00ad tines, and also how to deal more effectively with bad luck by imagining how things could have been worse. I asked my vol\u00ad unteers to spend a month carrying out exercises and then return and describe what had happened. The results were dramatic. Eighty percent of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives, and, perhaps most important of all, luckier. Unlucky people had become lucky, and lucky people had become even luckier. At the start of the article I described the unlucky life of Patricia. She was one of the first people to take part in Luck School. After a few weeks carrying out some simple exercises, her bad luck had com\u00ad pletely vanished. At the end of the course, Patricia cheerfully explained that she felt like a completely different person. She was no longer accident-prone and was much happier with her life. For once, everything was working out her way. Other vol\u00ad unteers had found romantic partners through chance encoun\u00ad ters and job promotions simply through lucky breaks. Positive Skepticism After ten years of scientific research my work has revealed a radically new way of looking at luck and the vital role that it plays in our lives. It demonstrates that much of the good and bad fortune we encounter is a result of our thoughts and behavior. More important, it represents the potential for change, and has produced that most elusive of holy grails\u2014an effective way of increasing the luck people experience in their daily lives. The project has also demonstrated how skepticism can play a positive role in people's lives. The research is not simply about debunking superstitious thinking and behavior. Instead, it is about encouraging people to move away from a magical way of thinking and toward a more rational view of luck. Perhaps most important of all, it is about using science and skepticism to increase the level of luck, happiness, and success in people's lives. D More Hazards Hypnosis, Airplanes, and Strongly Held Beliefs Afier a single-case history was reported in the psychological literature, I made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain any documents of the case. However, the adventure provided lessons about why some therapists hold so firmly to certain psychological theories and disdain the critical research. LOREN PANKRATZ Imagine that a Viennese prankster, to amuse his friends, invented the whole busi\u00ad ness of the id and Oedipus, and made up dreams he had never dreamed and little Hanses he had never met. And what happened? Millions of people were out there, all ready and waiting to become neurotic in earnest. And thousands more ready to make money treating them. Umberto Eco, Foucault's Pendulum In this magazine, Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin Guyer (2002a, b) reviewed a single-case history report that had been hailed as evidence of recovered memory. Psychiatrist David Corwin had captured on videotape the story of the abuse of a six-year-old girl and the recovery, at age seventeen, of her \"repressed memories.\" However, serious doubts were raised when Loftus reviewed the court records and inter\u00ad viewed the girl's mother. Here I review another single-case SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2003 31 history on recovered memory that appeared in the psychologi\u00ad cal literature. Although my attempts to obtain the facts were less than successful, the adventure provided some lessons about professional credulity and the power of theories that are formed by personal experience. A Case History Report of Repressed Memory In 1997, Bertram Karon and An marie Widener published an article in Professional Psychology: Research and Practice entitled \"Repressed memories and World War II: Lest we forget!\" In their article, the authors claimed that there were \"literally hundreds of documented batdefield neuroses that involved the repression of traumatic combat experiences\" and that professionals who worked in the Veterans Administration hospitals (now Veterans Affairs hospitals) after WWII frequently saw such patients. Karon and Widener then described what they identified as a typical combat hysterical neurosis. In their example, a psy\u00ad choanalytic psychologist identified as Edward Karon' treated a veteran with a hysterical paralysis for six months in twice- weekly sessions. At the end of this period, the patient brought his therapist a newspaper clipping that presumably dealt with an airplane crash in which he and the pilot had been injured. The patient reported that he had been a tail gunner in a two- man bomber, selected because he was small enough to fit into the cramped tail gunner's turret. The pilot, however, was over six feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds. Returning from a mission, the patient said that six of the planes in their squadron crashed during landing, raising the suspicion of sabotage. Because the runway was littered with wreckage, the patients plane was forced to land in a field. The tail gunner broke his arm, while the pilot broke both legs and was unconscious. Rescuers refused to approach the burning plane because its fuel was ready to explode. However, with his one good arm, the patient managed to drag the pilot, inch by inch, away from the plane. Although his broken arm subsequently healed, his other arm was thereafter paralyzed. Furthermore, he had no con\u00ad scious memory of the crash or of saving his friend. He was reported to have repressed it. After recovering his memory in an emotional therapy ses\u00ad sion, the patient regained partial movement of his paralyzed arm for the first time. Unfortunately, the secondary gains from this paralyzed arm were not sufficiently resolved for him to return to work until after another year of psychoanalytic psy\u00ad chotherapy.2 The authors concluded that current controversies concerning repressed memories \"are always discussed without reference to this well-documented body of data.\" They encour\u00ad aged mental health professionals to \"remember their past in order to be effective in die real world.\" In ways they did not intend, this case history sparked many memories for me because I was well acquainted with stories like these and this style of therapy. A Search for More Information Events in war are sometimes stranger than fiction. I know, because in my twenty-five years as a Veterans Affairs psycholo- Loren Pankratz is a Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Oregon Health Sciences University Portland, Oregon. 32 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER gist I checked the records of nearly every patient who, like this tail gunner, asserted improbable and self-aggrandizing claims. Time and again the stories turned out to be bogus.1 Students and colleagues of mine quickly learned not to present a report like that of Karon and Widener's without first obtaining some verification. The purpose of checking a veterans story, of course, is not directed at catching lies but at identifying and treating the proper problem. For example, was this man's arm paralyzed at the time of his discharge, and did he receive a Purple Heart? Was he receiving a service-connected disability pension for his symptom? Maybe the war story provided an explanation for his marital and occupational problems. These questions could be answered by consulting the patient's C-file (claim file) or his DD-214.' Also, when and where was the newspaper article written? Whether the therapist is a psychoanalyst or a behav- iorist, such critical details should always be checked against outside records. Nevertheless, these simple facts are almost never verified, a point I return to later. I wondered as well what documents were available to Karon for his reconstruction of this case. I believed that the author understood that he would be obligated to provide such infor\u00ad mation because the Ethical Principles of Psychologists (1992) state that \"After research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the sub\u00ad stantive claims through reanalysis. . . .\" Thus, in November 1998, I wrote to Dr. Patrick DeLeon, then editor of Professional Psychology to ask his assistance. My letter was directed to him because Pendergrast, in preparing a response (1998), had repeatedly made specific requests for doc\u00ad umentation, which Karon ignored.* My first mailing to DeLeon went unheeded, but he responded to my second request by saying 1) that he thought my first letter was merely a \"FYI,\" needing no reply; 2) that I should write ditectly to Karon; and 3) that he believed that the ethical code about shar\u00ad ing data applied only to \"empirical data.\" I disagreed about the empirical data limitation on the grounds that the spirit of the code has always been to promote the science of psychology by allowing open examination of \"substantive claims,\" not merely to recheck t-tests. Subsequently I wrote to Karon. After he failed to respond to my second request, I provided all my correspondence to the Ethics Office of the American Psychological Association for an opinion. Dr. Dolph M. Printz, the acting director of the Office of Ethics, responded by saying that Dr. Gary R. VandenBos was quite familiar with my concerns, and he had summarized his knowledge of the issues in an enclosed memorandum. Printz trusted that the careful review would assure me \"that no further action is indicated in this matter.\" Surprisingly, the enclosed memorandum by VandenBos was merely a discussion of airplanes. This was clearly not my pri\u00ad mary concern and was mentioned only parenthetically in the last paragraph of my letter. The airplane issue had been raised by software engineer James Giglio, in one of the four responses to the Karon article. Giglio (1998) claimed that no such airplane as the one described in the article was ever flown in the European theatre about qualifying planes \"he then tried to become technical.\" of war, namely a two-man bomber with a tail gunner in a sep- Even more damaging, they still failed to mention die name of arate tail turret.

Karon several examples: the Mosquito A-20a and A-26, the Douglas finally insisted that the Rand McNally Encyclopedia of Military SBD Dauntless, the Curtis SB2C Helldiver, the British Aircraft (Angelucci 1981) contained bombers that qualified. deHavilland Mosquito, the Douglas A-20 Havoc, the Douglas Giglio then asked for specific page numbers because he found A-26B Invader, and the Bristol Beaufighter. However, Giglio nothing mat fit.

VandenBos opined that any distortions of the patient's memory were a \"side detail\" and not the essential determinant of accuracy and validity of the clinical discussion. Memory dis\u00ad tortion was the issue, and it was difficult for me to dismiss as We applauded each theory knowing that next month our fickle devotion would be overwhelmed by a new series of fascinating case histories. \"side detail\" the obvious importance of investigating the patient's service record, clinical treatment notes, and any other data that could \"verify the substantive claims\" of the article. Then I discovered that VandenBos had co-authored a book with Karon. VanderBos was caught in a conflict of interest. Any hope of finding the facts behind this case were now blocked, and it was clear that many issues remained unresolved. Boiling Controversy About a year after the article appeared, Professional Psychology published four critical reviews and a response by Karon and Widener. The Giglio article has already been discussed. The review by Lilienfeld and Loftus (1998) was about twice as long as the original Karon article because the authors reviewed a broad spectrum of research concerning the evidence for repression, the role of hypnosis and sodium pentathol in the recovery of memories, problems with the specific case example, and the appropriate use of single case-history reports. Piper (1998) focused on the problem of definitions that confuse dis\u00ad cussions of repression, and he also reviewed many of the papers cited by Karon and Widener that they believed supported the notion of repression and amnesia. Finally, die article by Pendergrast (1998) described many examples of recovered war traumas that were false. The response by Karon and Widener (1998) reflects the bit\u00ad ter divide that infects the issue of repressed memories. They began their article with another case history\u2014this one about a rape. \"Would any serious clinician tell her she is lying because there is no such thing as repression?\" These reviewers, they charge, are dismissing all WW II patients who suffered trauma and repression as malingerers. The only point of their article, they insist, was to show that repression exists. \"Every psychodynamic therapist sees it. The only way he or she could not see it is by assuming that what die patient says are lies.\" Although they put up a brave fight over the research, the bottom line for Karon and Widener was that clinicians know repression exists, and \"psychologists who dis\u00ad pute die conclusive existence of repression do not do therapy.\" They implied that those who deny repression are academics who make money by testifying for the defense in court cases, and they agreed widi famous attorney Alan Dershowitz when he stated, \"The defense has no obligation to tell die truth.\" The only hint of a concession in the Karon and Widener article was an acknowledgment that hypnosis and pentathol procedures can be leading and suggestive. Further, \"Remem\u00ad bered events may or may not be literally true,\" but then, \"People in or out of therapy have memories of events that never occur as well as memories of events that did occur, but this fact has noth\u00ad ing to do with our article.\" This admission, it seems to me, suggests the possibility of a mistaken story by a tail gunner. I can think of several options other than lying and malingering to explain die onset of hysteri\u00ad cal symptoms and recovered memories. They were the ones who brought up the patient's secondary gain\u2014a mark of malin\u00ad gering. Why does a skeptical attitude about repression evoke such distress in some therapists? Remembering the Lessons I agree with Karon that the lessons of WWII seem to have been forgotten but \"need to be remembered in order for therapists to be effective in the real world.\" He was also correct in stating that few living clinical psychologists were working in the VA in the 1940s. However, my generation was trained by them. For example, I interacted several times with Jack Watkins who was at the Portland Veterans Administration before moving to the University of Montana where he continued his work in hypno\u00ad sis and in the multiple personality disorder movement. Further, in 1974,1 was president of the Portland Academy of Hypnosis, where month after month speakers shared dramatic case histo\u00ad ries that demonstrated the \"truth\" of their particular theories. These therapists promoted a vast array of explanations for the development of symptoms. They focused on childhood events, anniversary reactions, blocked emotions, sexual issues, double binds, internal conflicts, hidden trauma, and, of course, repressed memories. We applauded each theory knowing that next month our fickle devotion would be overwhelmed by a new series of fascinating case histories. Why did each therapist have a different explanation about the cause of symptoms? In 1784, the French commission investigating mesmerism found that subjects appeared to know when and where they should have a convulsion only if the mesmerist was present to provide the cues. From the very beginning, patients unwit\u00ad tingly confirmed the theories of their therapists. For example, Zerffi (1871) illustrated the extent of this problem when he said, \"Hundreds of trustworthy witnesses have asserted facts which we cannot understand\" (p. 67), namely that somnam\u00ad bulists exhibit clairvoyant powers. For example, Grimes (1850) noted that a phrenologist could ask a mesmerized subject to identify the part of her brain where she kept secrets, and she would place her finger exactly on the organ of Secretiveness. Similarly, she could identify other regions of emotions without any understanding of phrenological science. Then, Grimes dis\u00ad covered that phrenologists with different cranial maps obtained information from subjects that confirmed their own individual theories. He concluded: \"When the subject, the operator, and all concerned, believe in any peculiar notion, the experiments 34 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER will not contradict that notion, but will confirm it, however absurd it may be\" (p. 209). The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot confirmed his own theories in a similar manner when he studied hysteria using hypnosis, a process described as \"one of the most significant mis\u00ad understandings in the entire history of medicine\" (Webster 1995, p. 72). Charcot was Freud's most significant mentor, and this problematic methodology was passed on to die generation of psychiatrists who were con\u00ad vinced that the conversion disorders of WW I servicemen were caused by repressed battle trauma. Like Karons patient, rfiey were often treated with hypnotic abreaction in which the patient was expected to re-live the moment of trauma with unrestrained emo\u00ad tions. They believed that memories revealed during abreaction were completely true to the original experi\u00ad ence, and if not, for those who wondered, the process itself was probably necessary for healing. For example, Hadfield (1940) believed that most of the sol\u00ad diers with traumatic neuroses had repressed experiences of being buried or blasted by an explosion. He used hypno-analy- sis to recover these memories, although sometimes \"consider\u00ad able patience and persistence are required to recover the experi\u00ad ence\" (p. 142). In such cases, he recommended telling the patient that he will not leave the room until he has recovered the experience. \"Such persistence nearly always succeeds.\" But from WWII on, the number of psychotherapeutic strategies exploded. This was also true for hypnotic interven\u00ad tions, and many of those innovators traveled through the informal speaking circuit of hypnosis societies that I men\u00ad tioned above. Martin Orne (1959) provided some insight into why this proliferation was happening. Through a series of dia\u00ad bolically clever experiments, he showed that the hypnotic interaction is such a powerful experience for therapist and sub\u00ad ject that both remain unaware of how certain implicit cues guide their process. The subject integrates the expectations of the hypnotist in an attempt to be cooperative, while modify\u00ad ing his own story to fit that expectation. Of course, in some situations the patient's story might be true. However, confab\u00ad ulated reports can be \"extremely deceiving, as they represent a subjectively real situation, and, therefore, arc produced with complete sincerity\" (Orne 1951, 221). Unaware of how much they are influencing each other, both therapist and subject become convinced that their theory is true, with the result that they will likely come to view research as contrived or irrelevant to their dynamic experience. Checking the facts seems irrelevant, even confrontational or counter-therapeutic. This powerful subjective experience can lead both panics into false beliefs (Pankratz 2002). During the Vietnam war, conversion disorders were seldom encountered as repressed memories, and abreactivc treatments became a quaint historical artifact. The effects of trauma were now expressed as symptoms of avoidance and intrusion, with flashbacks as a marker.\" Because this war was unpopular, some suggested that most who participated would have symptoms independent of any constitutional vulnerability\u2014if not now, then delayed. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entered the ever diagnostic manual as a natural adaptation to extraordinary adverse situations (Yehuda et al. 1995). his In 1983, Landy Sparr and I were the first to show how easily sing this new disorder was feigned. However, PTSD became a wildly nis- popular research enterprise. But in their enthusiasm, most >95, researchers failed to check their subjects' claims or consider more this mundane explanations for their symptoms.' Like patients who >eri- told their therapists what they wanted to hear, research subjects was validated experimenters' hypotheses (Orne 1962). During the twenty years that I have refereed papers sub- sol- mitted to the American Journal of Psychiatry, I discovered that ; of many authors merely gathered evidence for what they believed aly- was true about symptoms and the underlying trauma, ier- Fortunately, editors usually understood my skepticism, but it cri- was of great help when Southwick and colleagues (1997) the showed that the memories of veterans of Operation Desert Ted Storm were highly inconsistent when questioned one month after combat and then again two years later. Most disturbing iitic was the amplification of recall of traumatic events. Subjects 'en- changed their reports to say that they had seen others killed or the wounded, that their unit had been ambushed, or that they had ien- encountered booby traps or mines. The authors concluded nto that \"If memories of combat are inconsistent, then the rela- iia- tionship between PTSD and combat exposure would be a ten- otic uous one.\" An accompanying editorial frankly admitted that ub- no one now knows what posttraumatic stress disorder really is ues (Hales and Zarzick 1997). s of But careful research testing competing explanations has ify- shown us how far we have drifted off course. The vast majority imc of people exposed to toxic events do not subsequently experi- ab- ence any long-term disorder, and delayed responses are it a extremely rare. Both children and adults, it turns out, are amaz- rith ingly resilient in the long run to trauma and unfavorable envi\u00ad ronments (Bowman 1997; Masten 2001). Pre-existing personal oth vulnerabilities are more predictive of outcome than an event, f is just as the DSM-I suggested (Yehuda et al. 1995). Finally, B.C. rch Burkett and Glenna Whitley (1998) provided compelling evi- lce. dence that Vietnam veterans are better educated, have a lower or suicide rate, have a higher employment record, are underrepre- can sented in prison populations, and have a lower homelessncss rate than those who did not serve. They suggested that the VA is not om treating posttraumatic stress disorder; they are teaching it. :nts ,ere Conclusions rirh In 1781, Mesmer fled Paris in disappointment and fury because me the commission appointed to investigate him was not interested ims in the personal experiences of his patients but in whether there ow, was evidence for his underlying assumption of animal magnet - the ism.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 35 when they questioned the value of his Tuesday lectures. In the twentieth century, psychiatrists disdained the idea of checking the reality of abreactions and self-reported trauma. As a result, posttraumatic stress disorder disability pensions may now cost taxpayers $2 billion a year, and we must face the possibility that two decades of posttraumatic stress disorder research, all based on dubious self-reports, may be useless. In the single-case history report investigated by Loftus, small inconsistencies were ignored by professionals who were over\u00ad whelmingly convinced by the emotional response of the subject. When Loftus looked for all the facts, she became the object of some serious harassment (Tavris 2002). James Giglio was accused of being unpatriotic when he asked for information, and the American Psychological Association would rather talk to aviation experts than acknowledge whether or not any docu\u00ad ments support a repressed memory report.9 From these generations of neglected critical questioning emerged an eagerness to treat recovered memories, multiple personality disorders, and traumas of ever)' sort. The disheart\u00ad ening news is that we have yet to discover an effective treatment for those who really suffer from chronic posttraumatic stress (Shalev et al. 1996) or from the acute effects of trauma. Litz and colleagues (2002) reviewed six studies of early interven\u00ad tions for acute trauma that they judged as having sound methodology. In all instances, psychological debriefing failed to promote change to a greater degree than no intervention at all, and in two studies the symptoms of treated victims became worse over time. While society demands that mental health professions help, sufferers are likely to be better off relying on their own natural support systems. I believe psychologists have a responsibility to provide safe and effective treatments to those who use our services. Karon and I agree on one thing: Mental health professionals need to remember their past in order to be effective in the real world. Notes 1. Bertram Karon told Beth Loftus that Edward was his brother who had died about twenty years previously. 2. 1 published a single-case report describing two sessions of hypnosis to treat a similar hysterical paralysis (Pankratz 1979). My point was that a face- saving strategy can avoid a struggle over the etiology of symptoms, and it is not necessary that the paradigm fit the facts to be effective. 3. See, for example, Pankratz 1990, 1998; McCarthy 1986. 4. The DD-214 is the veteran's discharge document that provides a general review of the individuals military history. The DD-214 is now so commonly forged, however, that it should no longer be considered a reliable document. 5. Interested readers can obtain a copy of this correspondence from Mr. Pendergrast at markD@nasw.org. 6. Interested readers can obtain a copy of this correspondence from Mr. Giglio at jgiglio@nova.umuc.edu. 7. Jones, et al. (in press) examined symptoms of UK servicemen from 1854 to the present. They concluded that symptoms of stress have changed dramat\u00ad ically over time and that PTSD (as described in the diagnostic manual) is a cul\u00ad ture-bound syndrome. 8. My favorite example is from the National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NWRS), research that consumed four years and $9 mil\u00ad lion (Kulka et al. 1988). Six women in die study claimed that their stress was caused by being a prisoner of war. Not one of the many researchers involved in the study apparendy realized that no American military woman ever became a POW in Vietnam. 9. The American Psychological Association recently was accused of backing away from some controversial scientific findings.

Belief in PMS/PMDD is a result of conditioning, not biological processes, and best treated as such. STEPHEN RAY FLORA and MELISSA SELLERS Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is not a dis\u00ad order, illness, or disease, but an extreme point on the continuum of premenstrual tension. Nor is \"premen\u00ad strual syndrome\" (PMS) an illness or disorder. Premenstrual physical changes related to the menstrual cycle are a normal part of female life. Emotional and behavioral problems associated with men\u00ad struation in some women are a result of basic conditioning processes\u2014reinforcement and modeling. Expressions of PMS symptoms are negatively reinforced when they result in sick days from work or school or allow the \"sufferer\" to escape or avoid anxiety-provoking or unpleasant social situ\u00ad ations. PMS provides an excuse for what would otherwise be SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 37 unacceptable behavior. PMS behaviors are positively rein\u00ad forced when expression of symptoms result in social comfort or medical care. PMS symptoms develop when they are mod- tied by others as expected patterns of female behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, nutrition, and exercise, are the most rational and the most effective treatment for PMS symp\u00ad toms. Drugs given for PMS produce many side effects (e.g., anxiety) that are the same as reported \"symptoms\" of PMS. Physiology of Menstruation The body's hormone interactions are responsible for the men\u00ad strual cycle. Seven to ten days prior to the onset of menstrua\u00ad tion, many women report symptoms of \"premenstrual syn\u00ad drome\" (PMS). \"The most common physical complaints include breast tenderness, bloating, weight gain, headache, and fatigue. Common emotional and mental symptoms include irritability, difficulty concentrating, moodiness, depressed feeling, anxiety, anger, and food cravings\" (Premenstrual Syndrome 2001). The psychological commu\u00ad nity, the medical-psychiatric community, and feminists all have varying opinions on the validity of PMS and PMDD as mental or physical illnesses. The consensus among psychiatrists, who consider PMS/PMDD to be a valid disorder, is that drugs should be the first line of treatment. However, neither PMS nor PMDD has been scientifically established as an illness. A Brief History of PMS \"The notion that women's reproductive systems affect their lives is ancient,\" notes Linda Brannon in Gender: Psychological Perspectives (Brannon 1996, 62). Historically and across cul\u00ad tures, as recently portrayed in Anita Diamant's award-winning novel The Red Tent, (2001) menstruation was celebrated: \"how my mothers celebrated the new moon [menstruation] with cakes and songs and stories, leaving ill will outside\" (133). Menstruation was seen as a reconfirmation of \"womanhood,\" and eagerly looked forward to by many women\u2014\"a gift to women that is not known among men, and this is the secret of blood ... to men this is flux and distem\u00ad per, bother and pain. They imagine we suffer and consider themselves lucky. We do not disabuse them. ... In the red tent, the truth is known . . . women give thanks\u2014for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes from between our legs, and that life costs blood\" (158). Once, menstruation was seen as . the essential part of life that it is. \\\u00bb How did normal menstrual If symptoms come to be viewed by some as an illness? In Psychobbable and Biobunk, Carol Tavris concludes that \"just ancient supersti\u00ad tion in pompous new jargon\" (2001). The problem of whether or not severe PMS\u2014PMDD\u2014 is a real mental disorder is actu\u00ad ally a particular case of the gen\u00ad eral problem of when any set of conditions constitutes a mental disorder. In Creating Mental Illness (2002) Rutgers sociologist Allan Horwitz argues that \"psychiatrists, epidemiologist, and clinicians simply Stephen Ray Flora is an associate profes\u00ad sor of psychology at Youngstown State University Melissa Sellers is a writer and psy\u00ad chology major at Youngstown State. Correspondence concerning this article can be sent to srflora@ysu.edu. 38 May/Junt 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER accept as mental disorders whatever conditions the DSM [a psychological diagnostic manual] lists. They do not ask how these conditions came to be regarded as mental disorders ... there is no reason to accept that any particular group of symp\u00ad toms represents a valid form of mental dis\u00ad order\" (pp. 19-20). of other women, Melissa's sister was given a free sample of Sarafem from a different doctor for a different \"problem\"\u2014 she had a baby. \"Premenstrual tension\" was first described in 1931. In 1953 Katherine Dalton introduced the term \"premenstrual syndrome,\" and in subsequent years pro\u00ad moted and researched PMS (see Dalton 1987) The list of PMS symptoms, some directly contradicting others, has grown to over 150. Dalton notes that \"The symp\u00ad toms themselves are commonplace and also occur with great frequency in men, children, and postmenopausal women\" (1987, 717). How can this vast group of common \"symptoms\" that occur in all people represent a valid mental disorder? Tavris argues that PMS is a \"manufactured\" problem (e.g., a fiction). 16 support this claim Tavris notes that although described in 1931, it wasn't until 1964 that the first article on PMS appeared in a medical journal, and 1966 for the first psychological journal article. But by 1989 there were 305 medical journal articles and 120 psychological journal articles on PMS (Tavris 1992, 140). Women have always ovu\u00ad lated and menstruated, but research on PMS \"erupted\" in the 1970s, according to Tavris, because \"When women's participation in the labor force is seen as a threat instead of a necessity, menstruation becomes a liability\" (141). Along the way, as noted by Tavris, PMS was \"coopted\" by biomedical researchers\u2014\"The big money, the big grants\" (141). Indeed, today the pharmaceutical companies are the biggest promoters of PMS/ PMDD. Do real medical problems need promoting? In 1987, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition- revised (DSM-Hl-R), labeled those with severe PMS symp\u00ad toms as meeting the criteria for \"late luteal phase dysphoric disorder.\" In 1994 the DSM-IV task force (literally a group of psychiatrists that decide, not by scientific data, but by con\u00ad sensus what to call a \"disorder\") put late luteal disorder\" under disorders needing further siudv.\" This inclusion legitimized PMDD for women, die medical community, and the insurance industry. It wasn't long until Prozac, repackaged in pretty purplish pills and called \"Sarafem,\" was being readily offered to women for mention\u00ad ing \"commonplace symptoms.\" For example, when Melissa (the second author) casually asked her doctor how a new birth control pill was with \"PMS symptoms,\" before she could finish her sentence the doctor offered her Sarafem. Melissa did not say she had severe symp\u00ad toms or was depressed. The doctor didn't ask what symptoms Melissa was referring to. He simply offered her a powerful pharmaceutical. This occurrence is not unique. Like millions Through observational learning and reinforcement women are taught that premenstrual symptoms are problematic. if girls are taught that menstruation is normal, then as women they are unlikely to perceive the symptoms as problematic. Conditioning of PMS Reports of subjectively experienced premenstrual pain are not a product of actual physical severity, but of basic conditioning processes\u2014reinforcement and observational learning. In an article \"Modeling and reinforcement of the sick role during childhood predicts adult illness behavior,\" the authors, led by William E. Whitehead of the Division of Digestive Diseases of die University of North Carolina, studied 382 women and found that \"subjects were most likely to report the symptoms and to take disability days for the symptoms that their parent reinforced and modeled\" (Whitehead et al. 1994, 548). Specifically: \"Childhood reinforcement and modeling of menstrual illness behavior had a significant influence on the number of physician visits for menstrual symptoms\" (547). Similarly, Canadian researchers Melanie Thompson and Mary Glick found that among college students: \"Consistent with previous research, care-seekers reported more reinforcement for adolescent menstrual illness behaviors than non-care-seekers. Care-seekers also reported their symptoms as more serious and more difficult to ignore. The perceived seriousness and severity of symptoms were both correlated with reinforcement for adolescent menstrual symptoms\" (2000, 137). Mexican researchers Luisa Marvan and Claudia Escobedo (1999) studied PMS with eighty-six healthy Mexican women who had no higher than a sixth grade education. A \"Menstrual Distress Questionnaire\" (MDQ) was given to all women one week after menstruation. Then half the women were shown a video describing the menstrual cycle. The other women were shown a video describing PMS and its negative consequences. All the women were again given the MDQ after their next menstruation. There were no changes in the women who simply learned about the menstrual cycle, but the women who watched the PMS video reported more severe premenstrual symptoms after watching the tape. Would watching a video about measles produce measles? These results show that viewing premenstrual symptoms as problematic is not the result of physical conditions. Through SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 39 observational learning and reinforcement women are taught that premenstrual symptoms are problematic. The converse is that if girls are taught that menstruation is normal\u2014 nonproblematic, then as women they are unlikely to perceive the symptoms as problematic. Misattribution and lllusionary Correlations The more salient different stimuli or events are, the more likely they are to be associated. Therefore, once women come to believe they \"have PMS,\" other salient physical states, emo\u00ad tional states, and behaviors are likely to be believed to be caused by PMS. A University of Texas-Houston Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences study (Dougherty et al. 1998) found that aggression did not vary across the menstrual cycle. They did find that women with high MDQ scores (PMS) were almost twice as aggressive as women without PMS during all menstrual cycle phases (premenstrual, men\u00ad strual, mid-follicular, and ovulation). The Houston study shows that the link between aggression and premenstruation is an illusion. Aggressive women are aggressive across the cycle, believing they have PMS just gives them an excuse for much of their aggression. Indeed, an ear\u00ad lier study of violent women offenders found that only 29 per\u00ad cent committed their crimes during the premenstrual phase (71 percent were committed during other phases), indicating menstrual phase has no effect on the likelihood of a woman behaving violently (d'Orban and Dalton 1980). The premen\u00ad strual phase is not a cause of aggression. Studies that find relationships between premenstrual phase and inappropriate behaviors or psychological problems are ret\u00ad rospective self-report surveys, often with the intent of die study known to the participants. Such findings suggest PMS is an illusion due to women's (learned) expectations and (mis)attri- butions, not biology. Other studies (such as Aubuchon and Calhoun 1985) find that symptoms are exaggerated if women believe menstruation is the focus of the study. But when the purpose of a PMS study is disguised there is little evidence of PMS. For example, when Maria Marvan and Sandra Cortes-Iniestra compared disguised-purpose daily reports with retrospective reports of premenstrual changes they found much higher retrospective reports of premenstrual change than actually occurred according to the daily reports. The researchers concluded that \"many women have a misper- ception about the meaning of PMS: consequently, they amplify their premenstrual changes in recall, reflecting women's cultural stereotypes rather than their actual experiences\" (2001, 276). In addition to cultural stereotypes, experimentally produced biases (\"expec\u00ad tancy effects\") cause changes in reported premenstrual symptoms. There are several questionnaires other than the MDQ that evaluate premenstrual changes, and the amount of reported distress depends on the questionnaire given. Indeed, compared to women who first complete a MDQ and then a Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ), women who first complete a Menstrual Joy Questionnaire (MJQ) report more positive cyclic changes on the MAQ (Chrisler et al. 1994). The MJQ asks subjects to evaluate the experience of positive symptoms (such as increased sexual desire, sense of euphoria, and feelings of power) the week preceding menstruation. Menstruation is a fact, but whether it is interpreted as joyful or distressful depends on what one is taught to expect (see also Diamant 1997). Studies that do not inform the participants that the study is looking at PMS but simply ask people to chart their moods and physical state daily for extended periods of time fail to find any correlation between \"symptoms\" of PMS or PMDD and impending menstruation (Mcfarland, Ross, and DeCourville 1989). Studies find that both men and women regularly cycle though mood changes, on both daily and monthly cycles (McFarlane et al. 1988). Treating PMS and PMDD Irritability, anxiety, and depression associated with the onset of menstruation is very real for the woman even if the suffer\u00ad ing is the result of conditioning and misattribution. PMS dis\u00ad tress deserves effective treatment. To dismiss PMS as \"all in you head\" would be as dismissive as telling a depressed person \"don't worry, be happy.\" How then should PMS be treated? Exercise Water retention and abdominal discomfort may occur pre- menstrually, and decreasing the physical symptoms through regular exercise in turn decreases the behavioral and emotional symptoms. Regular exercise improves psychological function\u00ad ing for all individuals regardless of die \"diagnosis\" of the indi\u00ad vidual suffering. A research review by Australian researchers Byrne and Byrne (1993) found that exercise was successful in producing antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and mood-enhancing effects across mood disorders. A team of Duke University medical researchers (Babyak et al. 2000) recently found that Studies that ask people to chart their moods and physical state daily for extended periods of time fail to find any correlation between \"symptoms\" of PMS or PMDD and impending menstruation. 40 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER exercise was as effective as antidepressant medications such as Prozac in treating major depressive disorder at six months, and at ten months fewer exercisers relapsed into depression than drug takers. That is, exercise is more effective than SSRI drugs in treating major depression. Exercise is equally effective in treating PMS/PMDD. Strength training produces general improvement in premenstrual symptoms (e.g., Steege and Blumenthal 1993). Aerobic exercise produces even greater improvements, and is \"protective\" against both physical symp\u00ad toms such as water retention and psychological symptoms including dysphoric mood (depression) anxiety, pain, and functional impairment (Bibi 1996; Stoddard 1999) The protective nature of exercise against PMS provides a clue as to why premenstrual tension became a problem. Since the early 1900s. people in the \"developed world\" have become increasingly sedentary. Obesity is at epidemic levels. Before modern labor-saving devices, living required regular exercise. As a result, problems such as obesity and PMS were rare. Therefore it is not surprising that women who exercise have sig\u00ad nificantly fewer PMS symptoms than non-exercisers (Johnson, Carr-Nangle, and Bergeron 1995). Nutrition Corresponding to the decrease in the amount of exercise required by daily life there has been an increase in food avail\u00ad ability and food consumption\u2014particularly consumption of high fat and high sugar foods. An increase in fat consump\u00ad tion and a decrease in low-fat vegetable consumption con\u00ad tributes to PMS symptomology. Improving nutritional habits effectively decreases premenstrual distress. Because \"anecdotal reports indicate that a low-fat, vegetar\u00ad ian diet might reduce menstrual pain,\" and because several research findings have established that \"plant-based and vege\u00ad tarian diets increase serum concentration of sex-hormone binding globulin, which binds and inactivates estrogens\" (245), Georgetown University researchers (Barnard, et al. 2000) studied the effects of a vegetarian diet on dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) and premenstrual symptoms. The veg\u00ad etarian diet resulted in weight loss, decreased dysmenorrhea, decreases in pain and water retention, and other premenstrual symptoms. Following the Federal Drug Administration's rec\u00ad ommended diet of five servings of fruits and vegetables and minimal animal fat would result in greatly improved men\u00ad strual health including a decrease in PMS symptoms. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Although effective, exercise and diet alone may not address the misattributions that problematic behaviors (e.g., aggres\u00ad sion) and emotions are caused by premenstrual tension. Fortunately, education and dicrapy directed at changing diese beliefs is effective (Christensen and Oei 1995). Cognitive therapy that includes diet and exercise recommendations has shown to be an effective treatment for PMS. Fiona Blake and her coworkers (1998) treated women diagnosed with PMS with cognitive therapy that included: treatment goals, educa\u00ad tion, engaging in new behaviors for homework, and gaining new skills (p. 311). Results showed that \"cognitive therapy for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was found to be associated with significant improvements in a range of measures, which included measures of PMS symptoms, associated impair\u00ad ments, and depression . . . there was no sign of any tendency to lose the gains made\" (316). Dissertation work by Susan Koons indicates that the best treatment for PMS may involve a combination of exercise, diet, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). When women who were diagnosed with severe PMDD completed a CBT treatment package that included diet and exercise, the sched\u00ad uling of pleasant events, and stress management, symptoms were alleviated and gains were maintained at six month follow up (Koons 1999). Drug \"Treatment\" Despite the fact that exercise, dietary changes, and CBT have been shown to be equally effective as (or more effective than) drugs in treating mood disorders including PMDD, drugs are considered to be \"the first line treatment option\" (Pearlstein and Steiner 2000) by psychiatrists. Clearly, if womens' best interest was the primary consideration then the suggestions mentioned thus far would be the first line of treatment. But psychiatrists are medical doctors, trained to give diagnosis and treat problems with drugs. Thus if the disorder is diagnosed, then it is only logical that doctors would to look to drugs to treat the illness. However, die data suggests that drug treat\u00ad ment is short-sighted. The first drug approved specifically for PMDD by the FDA is Sarafem (previously marketed as is a selective inhibitor preventing the reuptake of the neurotransmitter molecule serotonin by the neuron that released it. Preventing reuptake increases serotonin's concentration in the synapse between communicating neurons and thus increases neuronal com\u00ad munication. Prozac was developed for depression. SSRIs were not developed for, or assumed to have anything to do with, menstruation. With the impending expiration for the patent on Prozac, Eli Lilly's multibillion-dollar drug, the color of the pill was changed and on July 6, 2000, die FDA approved the \"new\" drug Sarafem for PMDD. As listed on the \"informa\u00ad tion for the patient\" insert included in packets of Sarafem, some of the side effects include \"tiredness, upset stomach, nervousness, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating.\" These side effects are among the very \"symptoms\" of PMDD! One of the impetuses for Sarafem/Prozac being approved by the FDA was a 1995 study (Steiner, Steinberg, Stewart, et. al.), funded by Eli Lilly, that found that for 52 percent of suf\u00ad ferers drug treatment produced \"moderate improvement.\" Obviously, yet ignored, this means the drug did not help (or only slightly helped) 48 percent. The efficacy of Prozac also decreased considerably after four months. Furthermore, taking drugs for PMS is likely to produce misattributions\u2014e.g., \"If I'm feeling good now, it must be because I'm on Sarafem. It couldn't be due to my own actions and of those around me. I'm not aggressive now because I'm SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 41 on drugs.\" Such misattributions are likely to foster further drug dependence\u2014e.g., \"I need Sarafem or I'll be a real bitch.\" The side effects of SSRJs such as Sarafem are detri\u00ad mental, whereas the side effects of improved diet and exercise are beneficial. In contrast to drug treatment, behavioral approaches including lifestyle changes (involving diet, exercise, social skills, and education) directly confront the sources of PMS (poor diet, lack of exercise, poor social skills, misattributions, and ignorance about menstruation). While the initial costs of changing one's lifestyle may be higher than simple pill pop\u00ad ping, the results are much greater (e.g., Babyak et al. 2000). Diana Taylor (1999) of the University of California at San Francisco investigated the effectiveness of a symptom man\u00ad agement intervention involving self-monitoring/regulation (diet regulation, vitamin supplementation, and self/environment modification (\"lifestyle alterations, . . . change in daily activities, and interpersonal competency training\") with ninety-one women with severe PMS. Treatment produced \"dramatic reductions in premenstrual symptom severity (75-85 percent)\" (507). Results were main\u00ad tained or enhanced at follow up. Taylor (1999) compared these results with those of drug treatment: a 75-85 percent reduction in PMS severity in women [results from] using a combination of dietary, exercise, and behav\u00ad ioral, cognitive, and environmental stress management strate\u00ad gies (Goodale et al. 1990; Kirby 1994). When compared to antidepressant drug therapy, the PMS-SMP (Symptom Management Program] was more effective in reducing pre\u00ad menstrual symptom severity and distress than studies testing fluoxetine [Sarafem/Prozac], which demonstrated 40-50 per\u00ad cent improvement in PMS severity, but up to one third of women will discontinue medication use due to drug side effects such as nausea, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and dizziness\" (Steiner et al. 1995). Thus, there is only one rational conclusion concerning treat\u00ad ment for the so called \"disorder\" of PMS/PMDD: Behavioral, educational, and cognitive-based treatment should be the first line treatment option. Ignorance, conve\u00ad nience, and the profit motive, not women's health, are why drug treatment is advocated. . References Aubuchon, P.G. and K.S. Calhoun. 1985.

But the myth that a patent commissioner once resigned because \"everything that can be invented has been invented\" keeps being uncritically repeated in prominent news outlets. So we thought it would be interesting and useful to reprint Samuel Sass's brief article investigating that claim, \"A Patently False Patent Myth, \"from our Spring 1989 issue. The article has not appeared in any SI anthology. Author Sass has slightly revised one paragraph, and at the end he provides an update.\u2014EDITOR A Patently False Patent Myth\u2014Still! Did a patent official really once resign because he thought nothing was left to invent? Once such myths start they take on a life of their own. SAMUEL SASS For close to a century there has periodically appeared in print the story about an official of the U.S. Patent Office who resigned his post because he believed that all possible inventions had already been invented. Some years ago, before I retired as librarian of a General Electric Company division, I was asked by a skeptical scientist to find out what there was to this recurring tale. My research proved to be easier than I had expected. I found that this matter had been investigated as a project of the D.C. Historical Records Survey under the Works Projects Administration. The inves\u00ad tigator, Dr. Eber Jeffery, published his findings in the July 1940 Journal of the Patent Office Society. Jeffery found no evidence that any official or employee of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 43 the U.S. Patent Office had ever resigned because he thought there was nothing left to invent. However, Jeffery may have found a clue to the origin of the myth. In his 1843 report to Congress, the then-commissioner of the Patent Office, Henry L. Ellsworth, included the following comment: \"The advance\u00ad ment of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end.\" As Jeffery shows, it's evident from die rest of that report that Commissioner Ellsworth was simply using a bit of rhetorical flourish to emphasize that the number of patents was growing at a great rate. Far from considering inventions at an end, he oudined areas in which he expected patent activity to increase, and it is clear tJiat he was making plans for the future. When Commissioner Ellsworth did resign in 1845, his let\u00ad ter of resignation certainly gave no indication that he was resigning because he thought there was nothing left for die Patent Office to do. He gave as his reason the pressure of pri- Samuel Sass (523 Crane Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201) was librar\u00ad ian of the General Electric Company's transformer division for thirty-one years before his retirement in 1976. vate affairs, and stated, \"1 wish to express a willingness that others may share public favors and have an opportunity to make greater improvements.\" He indicated that he would have resigned earlier if it had not been for the need to rebuild after the fire of 1836, which had destroyed the Patent Office build\u00ad ing. In any case, the letter of resignation should have put an end to any notion that his comment in the 1843 report was to be taken literally. Unfortunately, the only words of Commissioner Ellsworth that have lived on are those about the advancement of the arts taxing credulity and presaging the period when human improvement must end. For example, the December 1979 Saturday Review contained an article by Paul Dickson titled \"It'll Never Fly, Orville: Two Centuries of Embarrassing Predictions.\" He lists a pageful of \"some of the worst wrong- headed predictions.\" Ellsworth's rhetorical sentence is included with such laughable statements as that said by Napoleon to Robert Fulton: \"What sir, you would make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire under her decks? I pray excuse me. I have no time to listen to such nonsense.\" If in the case of Commissioner Ellsworth there was at least a quotation out of context on which the \"nothing left to 44 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER invent\" story was based, a more recent myth attributing a sim\u00ad ilar statement to a commissioner who served a half-century later is totally baseless. This news story surfaced in the fall of 1985, when full-page advertisements sponsored by the TRW Corporation appeared in a number of leading periodicals, including Harper's and Business Week. These ads had as their theme \"The Future Isn't What It Used to Be.\" They contained photographs of six individuals, ranging from a baseball player to a president of the United States, who had allegedly made wrong predictions. Along with such statements as \"Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote,\" attributed to President Cleveland, and \"There is no likelihood man can cvci iap die power of the atom,\" attrib\u00ad uted to physicist Robert Millikan, there is a prediction that was supposedly made by Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office Charles H. Duell. The words attributed to him were: \"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\" The date given was 1899. Since I was certain that the quotation was spurious, I wrote to the TRW advertising manager to ask its source. In response to my inquiry, I received a letter referring me to two books, although I had specifically asked for the primary and not secondary sources. The books were The Experts Speak, by Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky, published in 1984 by Pantheon, and The Book of Facts and Fallacies, by Chris Morgan and David Langford, published in 1981 by St. Martin's Press. When I examined these two volumes I found that the 1981 Morgan and Langford work contained Commissioner Ellsworth's sentence about the advancement of the arts taxing our credulity, although the quote was somewhat garbled. It also contained the following comment by the authors: \"We suppose that at just about any period in history one can imag\u00ad ine, the average dim-witted official will have doubted that any\u00ad thing new can be produced; the attitude cropped up again in 1899, when the director of the U.S. Patent Office urged President McKinley to abolish the office, and even the post of director,\" since \"everything that can be invented has been invented.\" The authors do not give the name of the commis\u00ad sioner whom they call \"director,\" but it was Charles H. Duell who held that office in 1899. They don't offer any documen\u00ad tation to support that alleged statement, and they would have had a tough time finding any. It's easy enough to prove that Duell was not the \"dim-witted official\" so glibly referred to. One need only examine his 1899 report, a document of only a few pages, available in any depository library. Far from suggesting to the president that he abolish the Patent Office, Duell quotes the following from McKinley's annual message: \"Our future progress and pros\u00ad perity depend upon our ability to equal, if not surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science, industry and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful aids to the accomplishment of such a result.\" Duell then adds, \"May not our inventors hopefully look to the Fifty-sixth Congress for aid and effectual encouragement in improving the American patent system?\" Surely these words are not those of some kind of idiot who believes that every\u00ad thing has already been invented. Other information in that report also definitely refutes any such notion. Duell presents statistics showing the growth in the number of patents from 435 in 1837 to 25,527 in 1899. In the one year between 1898 and 1899 there was an increase of about 3,000. It's hardly likely that he would expect a sudden and abrupt ending to patent applications. The other book cited by the advertising manager of TRW, Inc., The Experts Speak, by Cerf and Navasky, offers a key to how myths are perpetuated. This volume, published three years after the Morgan and Langford work, contains the spu\u00ad rious Duel! quote, \"Everything that can be invented has been invented,\" and prints it as though it had formed part of the commissioner's 1899 report to President McKinley. However, unlike the earlier work, The Experts Speak contains source notes in the back. The source given reads as follows: \"Charles H. Duell, quoted from Chris Morgan and David Langford, Facts and Fallacies (Exeter, England, Webb & Bower, 1981), p. 64.\" Unlikely as it is for the head of the U.S. Patent Office to have said something so silly, evidently it did not occur to Cerf and Navasky to question that statement. They simply copied it from the earlier book. One can expect that in the future there will be more copying because it is easier than checking the facts. The irony is that the subtitle of The Experts Speak is \"The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation.\" One can only wonder how much more misinformation is con\u00ad tained in this nearly 400-page compendium. On the tide page the book is described as a \"joint project of the Nation magazine and the Institute of Expertology.\" Whatever this institute may be, on the theory that the Nation is a responsible publication, I wrote to Mr. Navasky, who is editor of that magazine and coauthor of the book, to ask if he could tell me where and when Commissioner Duell made the stupid statement attrib\u00ad uted to him. 1 did not receive a reply. Addendum to Original Article The earliest appearance of the patent myth in print that I am aware of is the October 16, 1915, issue of The Scientific American. It contains the following item: \"Someone poring over the old files in the United States Patent Office in Washington the other day found a letter written in 1833 that illustrates the limitations of the human imagination. It was from an old employee of the Patent Office, offering his resig\u00ad nation to the head of the department. His reason was that as everything inventable had been invented the Patent Office would soon be discontinued and there would be no further need of his services...,\" As in all \"urban legends,\" the details are vague. Neither \"the old employee\" who is supposed to have resigned nor the \"someone poring over the old files\" is identified. The fact is that when the Patent Office burned to the ground in 1836, ail records were destroyed so that even if that 1833 letter had ever A PATENTLY FALSE PATENT MYTH STILL! Continued on page 48 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 45 Wired to the Kitchen Sink Studying Weird Claims for Fun and Profit An evaluation of Dr. John Upledger's craniosacral therapy illustrates an exercise proposed for skeptics to develop critical thinking and a better understanding of human psychology. HARRIET A. HALL After reading some particularly egregious nonsense, you have probably asked yourself, \"How could anyone in his right mind believe that?\" There is an answer to your question. In fact, the person who believes the nonsense will usu\u00ad ally provide the answer himself if you give him half a chance. Go to the source. Read the believers account of how he came to believe. He will probably give a clear enough description that you can see where he went wrong. It will give you an insight into human psychology. It will probably also be very entertain\u00ad ing. Here is an example of how it works. I recendy heard of craniosacral therapy. It is a method some osteopathic physicians use to restore health by adjusting 46 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER the bones of the skull and sacrum. Anatomists can demon\u00ad strate that the skull bones are fused together in adulthood and cannot move. Other fallacies inherent in the therapy are too numerous to list: craniosacral therapy is totally implausible and has been thoroughly debunked elsewhere. So how could anyone in his right mind believe in it? To find out, I went to the horses mouth. My local library had a book entitled Your Inner Physician and You: Craniosacral Therapy and Somato Emotional Release, by Dr. John E. Upledger, who is a major proponent of craniosacral therapy. I decided to read his account with as open a mind as I could summon, and give him a fair chance 10 convince tnc He describes his \"eureka\" moment. He was assisting a neurosurgeon by holding the dura (membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord) steady while the surgeon removed a calcified plaque. He wasn't doing a very good job of holding still. The surgeon complained. Most of us would have thought our own muscles were at fault: however. Upledger observed that the dura was fluctuating up and down at about ten cycles per minute, overcoming his attempts to hold it still. Nobody had ever observed this before. He hypothesized that this \"craniosacral rhythm\" was intrin\u00ad sic to human health. Since the cerebrospinal fluid within the dura is in a closed space, the skull bones must move in and out to accommodate the rhythmic changes. The nervous system controls the rest of the body, so if the bones are not moving freely, nerve conduction might be abnormal and health might suffer. Perhaps he had found the basic cause of all disease. He tried mobilizing the cranial bones through hands-on manipulation, and convinced himself he could feel the bones move one-sixteenth of an inch or more. Patients with autism, seizures, cerebral palsy, headaches, dyslexia, colic, asthma, and other diseases reported dramatic improvement. He found that well people treated with monthly adjustments reported more energy, felt happier, and were sick less often. He felt he had achieved a glimpse into the \"core.\" He states, \"I'm not quite sure as yet what the core is all about, but I do know that at times the craniosacral system feels like the entree into the deepest region of the patient's (and my own) total being. I'm not quite sure as yet what the 'total being is all about, but it feels like the craniosacral system is where it all comes together, whatever it is.\" So far, he had failed to convince me. It seems obvious that he had experienced an illusion (ideomotor activity, as experi\u00ad enced by Ouija boarders and water witchers). His false per\u00ad ception was reinforced when patients seemed to respond to treatment (perhaps from placebo effect, suggestion, hypnosis, a wish to agree with the doctor, the natural tendency of symp\u00ad toms to improve with time, hands-on massage therapy, or whatever). I found his claims implausible and unbelievable. This was bad enough, but then he really got carried away. He thought he had found a \"cure-all,\" but apparently it wasn't enough to cure all, since he proceeded to add other treatments to his armamentarium. He discovered tissue memory, he found his hands \"almost moving by themselves\" to certain areas of the patient's body that seemed to contain some son ol mem\u00ad ory of an old injury. He could feel heat and pulsations: under his hands these increased, then decreased until the sensations seemed to stop. At that point the patients pain would subside. The patient sometimes felt an emotion (fear, anger) and at that time or later might remember a forgotten injury. He proceeded to discover energy cysts (energy from an injur,' supposedly forms a ball deep in the tissues and stays there until released), somatoemotional release (touching the patient and giving permission allows old traumatic memories to surface and ventilate), and healing energy (which he transmits from the fin\u00ad gers of one hand to the other hand through the patient's body). Next he tried hypnosis. He regressed a patient to age two days, where she remembered her grandmother saying she should never have been born; insight caused her symptoms to disap\u00ad pear. He asked to talk to a patient's Inner Physician, who would explain the cause of the illness. One Inner Physician appeared to the patient in the form of a seagull and asked to be addressed as \"Mermaid.\" (I am not making this up.) He found that combinations of therapies worked even bet\u00ad ter than one at a time. Multiple hands with multiple therapists got results logarithmically faster. He tried therapy in float tanks: it worked wonders. He tried swimming with dolphins: multiple therapists surrounded the patient and were told to silently encourage the dolphins' freedom of choice, and to think that the dolphins were at least equal to them in knowl\u00ad edge and skill, and probably superior. (Perhaps this was true.) Dolphins spontaneously came up and touched the therapist's back to relieve the patients symptoms. In one case, they reduced a leg-length discrepancy from three inches to one inch. At the same time the therapists' own skills were enhanced in \"some non-conscious wav.\" Harriet A.

Hearing a cello play a concert \"A\" tone caused back pain; \"G\" relieved upper and lower back pain, while \"B\" worked only for his upper back. He would try anything his intuition suggested to him. He sensed that a patient had excess energy, so he grounded the patient's big toe to a drainpipe with copper wire, and\u2014lo and behold\u2014it worked! He successfully applied the same therapy to a woman with sympathetic reflex dystrophy who was in so much pain she would scream when the therapist's hand came within three inches of her body (!?). He had her husband con\u00ad nect her to the kitchen sink at home with a thirty-foot copper grounding wire so she could get around the house. (My hus\u00ad band says this sounds like a reasonable way to control a wife, but he may be prejudiced.) Upledger never reports a failure. Everything seems to work for him. With that kind of reinforcement, how could he doubt? He is an intelligent and educated man and is admirable in many ways. You have to respect his creativity, imagination, and die courage to try unorthodox things in defiance of traditional medical education. New ideas should be encouraged: eventually some will lead to breakthroughs. It is obvious that he believes he has helped patients and patients believe they have been helped. If the skull bones really could move as much as one- sixteenth of an inch, it would be easy enough to measure and prove it. Unfortunately, Upledger is so convinced his treatments work that he has no motivation to prove the effect is real. He wants to keep on truckin' and to \"spread the word.\" He doesn't pause to reflect that if his hypotheses were demon\u00ad strated to be true, it would be a major scientific discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize. He doesn't stop to think that he is subjecting his patients' money, time, health, and perhaps even their lives to unproven treatments. Evolution has given the human mind a great ability and A PATENTLY FALSE PATENT MYTH\u2014STILL/ from page 45 existed it could not have been seen \"the other day\" in 1915. With the imaginative addition later of the names of Commissioners Ellsworth and Duell, the myth kept cropping up sporadically for decades but then received a major boost twenty years ago by the publication of the Morgan and Langford book in 1981 and the Cerf and Navasky book three years later. The 1985 TRW ad, which made use of die misin\u00ad formation in these volumes, helped spread it more widely. A particularly discouraging aspect of die repetition of this fable is that it is repeated by individuals who have research and fact-checking facilities at their disposal. For instance, in his book The Road Ahead published in 1995, Bill Gates relates the myth as fact. He was chided for that in the February 1996 issue of Scientific American in these words: \"If Bill Gates's grasp of the past is any guide, readers should take his visions of the future with a dose of skepticism.\" In view of the fact that desire to find patterns everywhere and the motivation to seek explanations. If we can't find meaning, we will invent it. If somerhing seems to work once, we will repeat it with the expectation that it might work again. We have a tendency to jump to conclusions because there is a survival value to decid\u00ad ing quickly. We tely strongly on personal testimonials, because until recently (in an evolutionary sense) that's all we had to go by. As any magician knows, our senses are prey to many kinds ol illusions. Illusory perceptions allow us to accomplish things we couldn't otherwise do; for instance, our brains fill in the blind spot in our visual field. All these traits were instrumen\u00ad tal in our developmental success as a species. Every one of us can be fooled, so don't cast any stones. Be skeptical of weird ideas, but go to the source and listen carefully and sympathetically. Approach it as a case study of self-deception. Try to pinpoint where logic went wrong. You might learn how to better avoid making mistakes yourself, and you just might have a few laughs in the process. Just remember, you're not laughing at an individual; you're appre\u00ad ciating the humor in the very human failings we all share. Further Reading Barrett, Stephen.

It's too good a story and lends itself too readily to those who are eager to make a point and to whom facts and truth are secondary. 48 M\u00bby/)une2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS Human Nature Is (Fill in the Blank) * irTii r% A rev The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature. Steven Pinker. Viking Penguin Press. New York. 0670031518. 528 pp. Hardcover, $27.95. The next time you want to end a dinner conversation about some social problem or other, try using the argument that \"it's human nature.\" If you are talking with intel\u00ad lectuals in the humanities or social sci\u00ad ences, chances are they will take you for a reactionary or an ignoramus, and excuse themselves. If you arc talking with ordinary people, they probably will consider the matter settled by appeal to naturalness. The people to watch out for are the ones who respond by asking you what you mean by \"human nature.\" The truth is, the con\u00ad cept is muddled. For the ancient Greeks, a thing's nature had to do with those features that are possessed by all and only those things of its type\u2014a nature is an essence. Bur essentialism about organisms has been undermined by Darwinism. Early modern thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau tried to discover \"natural man\" through a kind of rJiought experi\u00ad ment whereby one looks at contempo\u00ad rary people and subtracts from diem those characteristics that appear to depend on society and politics. This was armchair anthropology. Remarkably, empirical anthropolo\u00ad gists throughout much of the twentieth century insisted that uSere really is no such thing as human nature. This they concluded from the remarkable diversity of human behavior cross-culturally. It does make sense to think that if a trait belongs to human nature, then it belongs to all individuals (or is at least \"species- typical\"\u2014more on rhis later). However, it would be a mistake to seek universality at the level of behavior. In principle. STEVEN PINKER behavioral sameness can arise from shared circumstances as much as from shared \"natures,\" and behavioral differ\u00ad ence can arise from shared \"natures\" exposed to different circumstances. Perhaps, we need to look past vari\u00ad able behavior to an invariant structure underlying it. In the age of the Human Genome Project, it is tempting to equate this structure with DNA sequences. The difficulty with this sug\u00ad gestion is that we expect a concept of human nature to be useful in explain\u00ad ing things about us, yet genes them\u00ad selves cannot explain anything. This is because organisms result from a process involving DNA interacting with its developmentally relevant environ\u00ad ments\u2014cellular, organismic, social, and ecological (not to mention stochas\u00ad tic developmental events). A revised version of the gene-centered view acknowledges the role of the develop\u00ad mental environments, but assigns ana\u00ad lytical priority to genetic factors because they supply the information needed to build an organism, while non-genetic factors merely supply the raw construction materials. However, even if this description were accurate, there would be no rationale for assign\u00ad ing causal priority to informational fac\u00ad tors as such.' It seems we cannot simply identify human nature with the genes. Should we conclude that there is nothing in scientific or everyday knowledge that fills the bill? That would be a grave mistake, according to Steven Pinker, the MIT cognitive psy\u00ad chologist and popular author of The Language Instinct and How The Mind Works. In his ambitious new book. The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Austin Dacey is visiting research professor of philosophy at SUNY-Buffalo and exec\u00ad utive editor o/Thilo. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 49 REVIEWS Human Nature, Pinker argues that the denial of human nature is no longer scientifically respectable. [An excerpt from the book appeared in the March/April 2003 SKEPTICAL IN\u00ad QUIRER.] He challenges head-on the radical environmentalist and social constructivist belief that our only sig\u00ad nificant biological endowment is an undifferentiated capacity for \"learning\" or \"reasoning.\" In the opening chapters of the book. Pinker brilliantly critiques this and related orthodoxies. First, he presents a series of broad, conceptual arguments informed by empirical research. Biology teaches us that wherever one finds complex adaptive systems in liv\u00ad ing nature, one finds evolution by nat\u00ad ural selection behind them. Since the mind is surely a complex adaptive sys\u00ad tem, it stands to reason that it has been significantly shaped by selection. Meanwhile, common sense suggests that \"there can be no learning without innate mechanisms to do the learning\" (101). \"Learning,\" \"plasticity,\" and \"culture\" are not alternatives to biolog\u00ad ical or evolutionary explanations, but components of them: Culture ... is not some miasma thai seeps into people through their skin. Culture relies on neural circuitry that accomplishes the feat we call learning. Those circuits do not make us indiscriminate mimics but have to work in surprisingly subtle ways to make the transmission of culture possible. . . . for children to learn about culture they cannot be mere video cameras that passively record sights and sounds. They must be equipped with mental machinery that can extract the beliefs and values underlying other people's behavior so that the children themselves can become competent members of the culture. (60) Finally, Pinker deftly summarizes a diverse and fascinating assortment of evidence gathered from animal behav\u00ad ior, anthropology, archaeology, cognitive and developmental psychology, learn- ability theory, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and genetics. He relies heavily on evolution\u00ad ary psychology, the emerging research tradition that synthesizes evolutionary science and cognitive psychology. Evolu\u00ad tionary psychologists expect to find that the mind is mosdy an array of complex, \"domain-specific\" information-process\u00ad ing mechanisms that on average con\u00ad tributed to reproductive success in ancestral environments. What does this have to do with human nature? Many evolutionary psy\u00ad chologists think that cognitive adapta\u00ad tions (excepting sex differences) will be species-typical, or possessed by the average member of the species. Two leading researchers, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, have dubbed this thesis the \"psychic unity of humankind.\"; In it, we find a novel notion of human nature, distinct from eternal essences, pre-social states, common behaviors, or genes: our nature is our universal evolved psychology. In a number of places, Pinker endorses this concept of human nature: whatever the exact picture turns out to be, a universal complex nature will be part of it. I think we have rea\u00ad son to believe that the mind is equipped with a battery of emotions, drives, and faculties for reasoning and communicating, and that they have a common logic across cultures, are difficult to erase or redesign from scratch, were shaped by natural selection acting over the course of human evolution, and owe some of their basic design (and some of their variation) to information in the genome. (73) Evolutionary psychologists look for\u00ad ward to the day (which may come) when they can compile a kind of cog\u00ad nitive Gray's Anatomy, a complete com\u00ad pendium of the mind, carved at the naturally selected joints. Of course, that day is nowhere near. Pinker is quick to admit that many important facts are not yet in, including \"how our minds use the information coming in from the senses.\" He will defend a gen\u00ad eral model that can \"embrace a variety of theories, present and future, and a range of foreseeable scientific discover\u00ad ies\" (73). Pinker's circumspection here is reasonable. After all, it is one thing to argue that the Blank Slate is prima facie implausible in light of a body of well- established evidence. It is another thing altogether to argue that the Blank Slate has been replaced by an alternative account. One can think that there is a human nature\u2014the Non-Blank Slate\u2014without thinking that science now knows what it is\u2014the Full Slate. Agnosticism about the Full Slate is all the more advisable at present because so much of the relevant science is immature. Consider evolutionary psychology. Despite some very promis\u00ad ing studies, the field is rife with deep conceptual and methodological dis\u00ad agreements characteristic of a nascent discipline. For example, there is little agreement about what constitutes ade\u00ad quate confirmation of an adaptationist hypothesis that some cognitive trait evolved under natural selection. How does one rigorously define, in the One can think that there is a human nature\u2014 the Non-Blank Slate\u2014without thinking that science now knows what it is\u2014the Full Slate. 50 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS context of cognitive psychology, the \"evidence of special design\" that is the hallmark of selection? How does one bridge the evidentiary gap between showing, via an \"optimality analysis,\" that selection should have favored'a given cognitive trait under some possible ancestral conditions, and showing that those conditions actually obtained and selection actually did favor the traiii' It is curious, therefore, that after making a powerful case for the Non- Blank Slate, Pinker devotes nearly half of the book to quite specific (and con\u00ad troversial) positive claims about altru\u00ad ism, morality, violence, gender roles, rape, art, and much else. In these sec\u00ad tions, we are assured of the naturalness of numerous traits, including sexual ori\u00ad entation, women's desire to be with chil\u00ad dren, men's tolerance for danger and risk, the taste for risky sexual liaisons and infidelity, representational realism in art, and so on. This is a Full Slate, a substantive account of our nature that goes well beyond the basic supposition of a universal evolved psychology. Pinker complicates matters by plac\u00ad ing behavioral genetics among what he calls the sciences of human nature (135). Behavioral genetics studies twins, siblings, and adoptees to ascer\u00ad tain the heritability of personality traits such as openness to experience, consci\u00ad entiousness, and \"general intelligence.\" Overall, Pinker says, the field is reveal\u00ad ing that \"about half of the variation in intelligence, personality, and life out\u00ad comes is heritable\u2014a correlate or an indirect product of genes\" (374). He says that this richer conception of human nature\" will clarify controversies about childrearing (3), among other things. The problem is that behavioral genetics looks at the differences between individuals, not their com\u00ad monalities. Therefore, it does not describe our \"universal complex nature.\" Pinker also endorses psycholo\u00ad gist Linda Mealey's view that psychopa\u00ad thy is actually not a pathology at all, but an adaptation, a strategy for defecting from reciprocal social interactions that evolved by frequency-dependent selec\u00ad tion (in which the fitness of a behav\u00ad ioral strategy depends on the incidence of other strategies employed in the pop\u00ad ulation). This would make homo sapiens what biologists call a polymorphous species\u2014in which several \"morphs\" or \"types\" coexist in stable equilibrium. What happened to the psychic unity of humankind? Or would Pinker say that the Mealean psychopath is not a human being? When focusing on these issues, Pinker's usage of \"human nature\" tacitly shifts from \"universal evolved psychol\u00ad ogy\" to \"whatever is due to genes.\" For all of its bold vision, rare insight, moral clarity, and polemical firepower, The Blank Slate spends precious litde time analyzing just what it means to affirm or deny human nature. Half of the time, the book reads as an affirma\u00ad tion of the Non-Blank Slate. Here it is at its strongest, although it fudges the dis\u00ad tinction between species-typical psy\u00ad chology and genetic factors as such. The other half of die time, it reads as an affir\u00ad mation of the Full Slate, an advertise\u00ad ment for a soon-to-be-published Gray's Anatomy of the mind. Such a book truly would be before its time. Notes 1. For over a decade, a new research pro\u00ad gram now known as \"developmental systems theory\" has attempted to reconceprualizc the intractable nature-nature debate in terms of a \"developmental system\": the various genetic. cellular, organismic, and ecological structures interacting in a contingent ontogenetic his\u00ad tory in which no single structure\u2014including the DNA\u2014is seen as \"controlling\" or \"guid\u00ad ing\" development.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/luce 2003 51 REVIEWS The Shaky Ground Between Science and Nonscience PETER LAMAL The Borderlands of Science: Where Sense Meets Nonsense. By Michael Shermer. Oxford University Press, New York, NY 10016, 2001. ISBN 0-19-514326-4. 360 pp. Hardcover, $27.50. How do we draw the line between science and non- science? Can we make this demarcation reliably? Are there cases where the difference between the two is fuzzy? The \"Boundary Detection Problem,\" as Michael Shermer dubs it, is die focus of this book. Shermer con\u00ad siders and illustrates this foundational issue from three perspectives: theory, individuals, and history. In the intro\u00ad duction he points out that knowledge sets are fuzzy and the lines between them are blurry. Whether a particular claim belongs in the set labeled science or pseudoscience depends on both the claim and the definition of the sets. Shermer approaches the boundary problem by examining specific claims in some detail (e.g., remote viewing) in order to formulate principles for draw\u00ad ing the boundary. But he avers that many claims and theories are best thought of as existing in the borderland between science and nonscience. Before outlining the ten questions that constitute his \"Boundary Detection Kit,\" Shermer warns that an investigator should abide by the fairness question: \"If I were to ask the holders of die claim if dicy feel tiiat they and their beliefs were fairly treated, how would they respond?\" This can alert investigators to the danger of setting up and then demolishing straw men. Shermer distin\u00ad guishes normal science, nonscience, and Peter Lamal is Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. E-mail: plamal@car- olina.rr.com. borderlands science and lists examples of each, along with his judgment about their scientific validity. He says that because claims in each of the categories are fuzzy they can be reevaluated and moved to a different category as a result of changing evidence. All of the normal science claims (e.g., plate tectonics), he maintains, were once either in the non- science or borderlands science cate\u00ad gories, and it is the latter category to which the book is devoted. In Part I, Shermer considers what he calls our \"knowledge filter\" that enables us to distinguish what is true from what is not. This section also includes consid\u00ad eration of borderland theories (e.g., ath\u00ad letic racial differences), at least some of which involve the hindsight bias and the confirmation bias as factors signifi\u00ad cantly contributing to the degree of plausibility they enjoy. Shermer dis\u00ad cusses scientific paradigms and the con\u00ad troversy over punctuated equilibrium. It is here that Shermer presents his defini\u00ad tion of science, one with which scien\u00ad tists would doubtless agree. He also offers definitions of paradigm, paradigm shifts, and scientific progress and uses punctuated equilibrium as the frame\u00ad work for discussing them. Part II is concerned wiuH individuals such as Copernicus, A.R. Wallace, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Sagan, all of whom were sometime dwellers in die bor\u00ad derland. Shermer points out fJiat Copernicus's heliocentric system was, for scientific and ideological reasons, slow to be accepted. He describes why he labels Wallace \"die heretic-personality,\" as well as Wallaces crossing die boundary from science to pseudoscience. Using the cate\u00ad gories \"hero as great as myth,\" Shermer considers Freud and Darwin; I leave it to die reader to guess into which category he places each. Shermer then describes die balance that Sagan maintained between scientific orthodoxy and scientific heresy. In Part III, Shermer explores how the study of humans' past can be accom\u00ad plished using the scientific methods employed by such historical sciences as cosmology and paleontology. He also applies cognitive science to the study of historical figures and debunks the notion of the \"miraculous\" nature of genius. How science, especially revolu\u00ad tionary science, really works is illus\u00ad trated by die priority dispute (Darwin or Wallace) over the theory of evolution. The Piltdown hoax is presented as a case study of a shift from science to pseudo- science, a warning that the data never just speak for themselves. Although this book was an interest\u00ad ing and often informative read, it is not without problems. For example, Sher\u00ad mer cites tulipomania as a nineteenth century phenomenon. More impor\u00ad tantly, we are presented with various kinds of data regarding the question of Carl Sagan's stature as a scientist, but perhaps the most important data, cita\u00ad tions of his work by other scientists, is absent. In addition, Shermer reports die results of applying the Five Factor Personality Inventory of traits to Stephen Jay Gould and A.R. Wallace in order to assess such characteristics as their Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience. But the construct of \"trait\" is a contentious one among behavioral scientists. Even in the wake of disclaimers, it strongly suggests an innate determinant of individuals' behavior. Furthermore, \"traits\" are descriptions of certain of individuals' behavior patterns; diey do not explain those behavior patterns. They are instead shorthand labels for the pat\u00ad terns. In his reliance on traits as explanatory, Shermer has, knowingly or not, moved into the borderland. 52 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS Divining Science's Simple Rules ANUTOSH MOITRA A New Kind of Science. By Stephen Wolfram. Inc., Hardcover, $44.95. Patterns are curious tilings. They are ubiquitous, and discovering a few only whets die appetite for more, possibly leading to a sweet obsession to go quietly crazy. Stephen Wolfram is any- riling but crazy, but patterns have a curi\u00ad ous hold on him. He is a well-known and respected scientist renowned as die origi\u00ad nator of Mathematica, a software system for solving differential equations. He is also a proponent of Cellular Automata (CA), a computational scheme that in Wolframs estimation would make differ\u00ad ential equations obsolete as a tool for describing die workings of die physical universe. To support this ironic claim Wolfram has filled a book of over twelve hundred pages, A New Kind of Science, with exquisite patterns\u2014of randomness, paradoxically. Wolfram's suspicions and certainties, strangely often synonymous in his writing, could have been succinctly laid out in a volume one-fifth die size of his much acclaimed and often maligned book. But the real questions to be asked are. Is it new? and Is it science? Claims of \"new science\" tend to raise skeptics' hack\u00ad les, and rightly so. After all. claims of die supernatural and the paranormal often come clothed in precepts claiming to be beyond die capabilities of traditional sci\u00ad ence to understand diem. They claim existence of phenomena that are only revealed when normal modes of percep\u00ad tion are transcended. I do not believe Wolfram is making these claims, although his language of discourse is often reminiscent of them. Wolfram talks about Cellular Auto\u00ad mata and their ability to generate repre\u00ad sentations of complex phenomena. Cellular Automata may be thought of as synthetic universes. The behavior of the constituents of these universes is defined by simple rules as in a board game. Space is represented by a uniform grid widi each cell containing a few bits of data. Time advances in discrete steps and at each step the data in each cell is updated based only on die states of die data in its closest neighboring cells. Wolfram has presented an abundance of examples of complex behavior arising out of CA gov\u00ad erned by elementally simple rules. But is this new? Claims of new sciences appear every now and then. Two popular books widi subtides claiming the advent of new sciences have been published in the recent past (Ban Kosko's Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic and James Gleick's Chaos: Making A New Science). Both of them have disappeared from popular imagination without kindling a revolution. Toffoli and Margolus, in their book widi a far more appropriate subti\u00ad tle. Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling, tell us that CA have been invented many times under different names, and somewhat different concepts have been circulated under die same name. CA were introduced in die late 1940s by John Von Neumann. I have followed Wolfram's work with great interest, CA modeling of fluid mechanics in particular, over a couple of decades and would hate to see die interesting parts of his work marginalized because of inflated claims of newness. In a nutshell Wolfram's claim appears to consist of the following line of argument: Algorithms based on simple rules can generate complex behavior of systems. The universe is a complex system. Therefore the universe operates through simple rules. The obvious flaws of diis syllogism notwithstanding, die analyses given in die book warrant serious critical evalua\u00ad tion. The usefulness of CA in modeling the behavior of complex systems has been well established in many fields of science including fluid mechanics\u2014a field Wolfram draws upon often to illustrate his arguments. What must be noted, however, is that his claims go far beyond just modeling. He finds no reason not to believe that die universe is in fact a giant cellular automaton. A skeptic will imme\u00ad diately notice die multiple negation. I suppose Wolfram is open to being proven wrong, but he places the burden of proof on everybody else, shrugging off the responsibility to furnish extraordinary proof for his own extraordinary claim. This confusion between models and actual physical systems\u2014the confound\u00ad ing of die metaphor and die real thing\u2014 pervades die whole of Wolfram's book. Skeptics are well aware that indulging this synonymy between symptom and cause can easily lead one to accept falla\u00ad cious arguments such as \"after this, there\u00ad fore because of this.\" Models have always been used in sci\u00ad entific simulation of physical phenom\u00ad ena. Models are approximations used to describe the aggregate behavior of physi\u00ad cal systems, insofar as these behaviors arc known, without actually reproducing die workings of the system in its minutest details. Take die example of fluid turbu\u00ad lence, Wolfram's favorite topic. Theoretical models are essential to study\u00ad ing turbulence because the exact mecha\u00ad nism through which turbulence is gener\u00ad ated is not yet known to science. Traditionally, turbulence theories at\u00ad tempt to model fluid turbulence phe\u00ad nomena through statistical averages of the velocity field. This field is, however, Anutosh Moitra, Ph.D., is Principal Engineer at Boeing. His specialties are enabling technology and research and com\u00ad putational fluid dynamics. E-mail anutosh. moitra@pss.Boeing.com. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Mjy/lunr 2003 S3 REVIEWS itself an average over microscopic molec\u00ad ular motion. I was first drawn to Wolfram's work by his depiction of flow- fields showing structures characteristics of turbulent flow that he had generated by CA without incorporating any physi\u00ad cal principles whatsoever. However, these structures were visible only when the states of the individual cells in die grid were averaged over large numbers of cells. In this sense of predict\u00ad ing averaged behavior, therefore, CA fares not much better than traditional models of turbulence. Claiming a new science that makes ir.ulitii.ii.il science obsolete is thus unwarranted; it provides just another model for studying turbulence. There are many precedents in physics of simple discrete models able to provide correct approximations of complexities of real world phenomena. This in no way implies that these models actually gener\u00ad ate the behavior of the system at its microscopic level. Philosophically the real question here must be considered in both its cpistemo- logical and ontological aspects. In the context of modeling it is sufficient to know the rules that effectively describe the aggregate behavior of a system. These models can then be utilized and refined to gain further insight into and knowl\u00ad edge about the system. But what does this knowledge consist of? In scientific inquiry one seeks to know what actually happens, not just what the end result looks like. Here Wolfram presents us with a curious argument. He informs us that CA's ability to actually reproduce physical phenomena entirely down to the microscopic interactions can only be realized when viewed from an as-yet indefinable higher form of perception and analysis. This leads him to make dubious statements such as the follow\u00ad ing: the very fact that we have so far failed to discover any evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence may itself conceivably already be a sign that higher forms of perception and analysis may be in use. This is not new either. Skeptics have heard this line of argument before from proponents of ESP. Let me now explain why despite all this I consider Wolfram's book an impor\u00ad tant one. Science is not best served by models which slavishly obey all of our wishes by faithfully reproducing what we have programmed into them. Science needs models that give back more than what we have put into them. A good way to stan may be to put in as litde as possi\u00ad ble, to program into our models the sim\u00ad plest possible rules. Wolfram shows that simple rules can generate most classes of complex behavior and the simplest of these rules can generate all the other rules. Validation of this principle, termed \"Principle of Computational Equiv\u00ad alence\" by Wolfram, will be a significant step in the journey toward the holy grail of science\u2014the definition of the simple rules that describe die universe. Wolfram has not accomplished this validation, but one can hope. A Tour of the Halls of Flummery BENJAMIN RADFORD The Museum of Hoaxes: A Collection of Pranks, Stunts, Deceptions, and Other Wonderful Stories Contrived for the Public from the Middle Ages to the New Millennium. By Alex Boese. Penguin Putnam, New York. 2002. ISBN 0-525-94678-0. 266 pp. Hardcover, $19.95. Hoaxes and the history of hoaxing are important elements in understanding practical skepti\u00ad cism. The very notion that perhaps a remarkable story or account may not be entirely (or at all) true is, at its heart, a skeptical one. In a way, the history of the paranormal closely parallels the history of hoaxes. From Btgfoot to Spiritualist mediums, from the Turin Shroud to the Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and writes about hoaxes in his upcoming book Media Mythmakers (2003, Prometheus Books). Roswell crash, there is hardly a category of the unexplained or paranormal that does not have a robust history of fraud and hoaxing. Alex Boese, a graduate stu\u00ad dent in San Diego and curator of rhe Museum of Hoaxes Web site, guides teaders through his virtual museum in his new book The Museum of Hoaxes. Some of the hoaxes will be familiar to longtime SKEPTICAL INQUIRER readers, such as the Cardiff Giant (said to be a pet\u00ad rified giant as described in the Bible), the Cottingley Fairies, and crop circles. The book, however, also includes a fascinating survey of lesser-known hoaxes. Boese cov\u00aders hoaxes perpetrated Franklin and Mark Twain as well as inveterate pranksters such as Joey Skaggs. The book's presentation of the early history of hoaxes is very good and enlightening. Sir John Mandeville, Marco Polo, and other early explorers were accused\u2014with good reason\u2014of fak\u00ad ing some of their seminal travel observa\u00ad tions and journals. The Museum of Hoaxes begins with a good (if arguable) discussion delineating differences between hoaxes, pranks, urban legends, frauds, and tall tales. There's some overiap, but he setdes on the careful definition of hoax as \"a delib\u00ad erately deceptive act that has succeeded in capturing the attention of the public.\" Boese provides an insightful discus\u00ad sion of the public's role in hoaxing. Hoaxes do not occur in a vacuum; rhe public's reaction to the hoax is rhe hoax. With an histo\u00ad rian's perspective, Boese points out that current notions of truth are quite differ\u00ad ent from medieval ones. These days, we have a modern sophistication (and desire to discern truth) that might have seemed 54 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER REVIEWS bizarre to our ancestors. Truth, after all, is the basis by which a hoax, tall tale, or other deception is measured. A mutable (or postmodern) truth leaves little basis upon which to discern fact from fraud. \"The medieval world treated the concept of truth allegorically and spiritually, while we treat it scientifically. Claims that we would regard as obviously false were regarded by the medieval mind as true if they revealed a deeper underlying metaphysical meaning about the world. . . . Public life was highly local\u00ad ized and Sharing of infor\u00ad mation between communities was spo\u00ad radic and unreliable. As a result secrecy, not openness, became the fountain of medieval knowledge.\" There arc many books on hoaxes. Some, like Gordon Stein's Encyclopedia of Hoaxes and Carl Sifakis's Hoaxes and Scams, are excellent encyclopedic resources. Others, such as Outrage: The Story Behind the Tawana Brawley Hoax, are exhaustive, detailed analyses of a particular hoax. But among this lot, there is usually little discussion of the nature of hoaxes. The Museum of Hoaxes admirably fills the gap between the exhaustive catalogues of hoaxes and sin\u00ad gle-case studies. The book does a fine |u'u of \u00bbci ving as a reference source; ;; not only has an index but also lists hoaxes by category and includes an extensive chapter-by-chapter list of ref\u00ad erences for further reading. There arc some apparent omissions. In die section on literary hoaxes, there's no mention of The Amityville Horror, or Mark Helfrich's 2000 book Naked Pictures of My Ex-Girlfriends (though the story of Sony's fake film reviewer David Manning is briefly recounted). There's also no mention of terrorism hoaxes, such as the literally thousands of hoaxes that followed the September 11, 2001, attacks and the anthrax-laced letters to politicians (though perhaps the book's deadline was too early to include a discussion of these). I was often left wanting more infor\u00ad mation on a given topic or hoax, and it was at times frustrating to read an entry of only a few paragraphs. Still, a book the size and scope of The Museum of Hoaxes (like any museum) cannot hope to be complete and authoritative; new hoaxes occur all the time. The best a hook like this can do is to bring readers a general survey of hoaxes, their nature and perpetrators, and offer some tips on how to avoid being hoaxed. In that. The Museum of Hoaxes is a valuable skeptical book for both serious research and casual amusement. 'Einstein' Exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History JERRY KURLANDSKI If Einstein hadn't been born, would we have had to create him? That's one of die big unasked questions lurking behind the Einstein exhibition now showing at the American Natural History Museum in New York City. A special program of events, talks, perfor\u00ad mances, and workshops both direcdy and tangentially related to Einsteins life and work runs concurrendy. The exhibition proper\u2014sans events, talks, and whatnot\u2014serves as a mixed- media biography of the scientist. We learn the kind of summary information that can be picked up from an article in, for example. The World Book Encyclo\u00adpedia. What makes the tour worthwhile is its artful marriage of encyclopedia-like text with the traditional strengths of a museum\u2014photographs, manuscript reproductions, and interactive presenta\u00ad tions. The curator, Michael M. Shara, has done a fine job; still, there is little in his show that is going to raise any eyebrows. The same cannot be said of the spe\u00ad cial program. While many of the talks have unsurprising themes (\"Einstein's Relativity: Past, Present and Future,\" \"Einstein: Patents and Inventions\"), other have more intriguing tides (\"The Soul of Einstein: A Dialogue on the Moral, Religious, and Philosophical Life of Albert Einstein\"). The events billed as \"performances\" explore the Einstein theme through such means as cabaret, musical narration, and juggling. Perhaps one day the distinction between the modern-day museum exhi\u00ad bition and its symbiotic gift shop will cease to exist. In the meantime, a pair of heavy glass doors separate this particular exhibition from its fund-raising coun\u00ad terpart. Through those doors you can purchase, of course, Einstein T-shirts and mugs, as well as Einstein Beanie babies, plates, and refrigerator magnets. Taken as a whole, the exhibition admirably fulfills its duty to entertain, educate, and even inspire. What it lacks, however, is any hint of self-examination. There is much on Einstein the genius, Jerry Kurlandski is a software engineer cur\u00ad rently involved in natural language process\u00ad ing applications. He lives in Morristown, New Jersey E-mail: jkurlandski- Qyahoo.com. \"Einstein\" began November 15, 2002, and runs tbrougfi August 10. 2003. The special program ran through April 7. See www.amnh.orgfor details. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 55 BOOK REVIEWS but no mention of Einstein the pop icon, though the latter would seem to have as large a part in the exhibition as the former. In his essay \"Einstein's Brain,\" written around the time of the scientist's death in 1955, Roland Barthes pointed out the discord between pho\u00ad tographs and cartoons of Einstein. Typically, photographs showed him before a blackboard covered with com\u00ad plex mathematical equations, whereas cartoons depicted the theoretical physi\u00ad cist \"having just written on an empty blackboard, as if without preparation, the magic formula\" E=mc2. From Barthes's observation we can safely con\u00ad clude that, even while he was still alive, Einstein the genius had to share the limelight with Einstein the pop star. What Einstein the human being thought about all this is not discussed in the exhibition and its programs. Which brings us to the question asked at the beginning of this review. If Einstein hadn't been born, would some other scientist have been elevated to the same position? And if so, who would have been thrust into this curious, amalgamated role of scientist, sage, and saint? Darwin, perhaps? I am inclined to believe that the post could only be filled by an American still alive after World War II, when advanced methods of mass communication came into exis\u00ad tence. Perhaps, then, the answer to the question is No\u2014no other scientist would have enjoyed and suffered the same fame as Einstein. In any case, after enjoying and appre\u00ad ciating this exhibition, one nevertheless regrets that the question\u2014or others like it\u2014is not even raised.

SCHWARTZ Most rational scientists agree that the credibility and integrity of a review of a body of research is that it includes all die important infor\u00ad mation, not just the reviewer's favored information. Ray Hyman's review \"How Not To Test Mediums\" (January/February 2002) is a textbook example of the selec\u00ad tive ignoring or dismissing of historical, procedural, and empirical facts to fits one's preferred interpretation. The result is an inaccurate, mistaken, and biased set of conclusions of the current data. Hyman is a distinguished professor emeritus from the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon, who has had a longstanding career as a skeptic focused on uncovering potential flaws in parapsychology research. Hyman is well skilled in carefully going through die conventional checklist of potential sources of experimental errors and limita\u00ad tions in research designs. Hyman's overall appraisal of the research conducted to date is implied by his conclusion: \"Probably no other extended program in psychical research deviates so much from accepted norms of scientific methodology as does this one.\" Is Hyman's summary conclusion based upon a thorough review of the total body of research? Or does it reflect the system\u00ad atic ignoring of important historical, pro\u00ad cedural, and empirical facts\u2014a cognitive bias used by the reviewer in order to Gary E. Schwartz is with the Human Energy Systems Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson. maintain his belief drat die phenomenon in question is impossible? As I document below, Hyman resorts to (consciously and / or unconsciously) selectively ignor\u00ad ing important information dial is incon\u00ad sistent with his personal beliefs. Selective ignoring of facts is not acceptable in science. It reflects a bias that obviates the purpose of research and disal\u00ad lows new discoveries. I have made die statement that the survival consciousness hypothesis does account for the totality of the research data to date. Of course, this does not make the survival hypodiesis the only or correct hypothesis\u2014my state\u00ad ment reflects die status of die evidence to date, not necessarily the truth about the underlying process. This is why more research is needed. Note diat I do not use die word \"believe\" in relationship to the statement. This is not a belief. It is an empirical observation derived from experiments. It is correct that some of die single- blind and double-blind studies have weaknesses\u2014we discuss the experimental limitations at some length in our pub\u00ad lished papers as well as in The Afterlife Experiments. However, these weaknesses do not justify dismissing die totality of the data as mistaken or meaningless. Quite the contrary, an honest and accu\u00ad rate analysis reveals that the data, in total, deserve serious consideration. Our research presents all the find\u00ad ings\u2014the hits and the misses, the creative aspects of the designs and dieir limita\u00ad tions^\u2014so that the reader can make an accurate and informed decision. What we strive for is seeking the truth as reflected in Harvard's motto \"Veritas.\" I appreciate Hyman's effort to outline some of the possible errors and limitations in the mediumship experiments discussed in The Afterlife Experiments. However, as Hyman emphasizes in his review, I do \"strongly disagree\" with him about his interpretations. The two fundamental dis\u00ad agreements I have with Hyman's argu\u00ad ments are: 1. Hyman has chosen to ignore numer\u00ad ous historical, procedural, and empirical (acts that are inconsistent with his interpretive descriptions of our experiments; and 2. Hyman has chosen not to acknowl\u00ad edge the totality of the findings fol\u00ad lowing Occam's heuristic principle as a means of integrating the total set of findings collected to daic. Space precludes my providing a detailed and diorough commentary here illustrating how pervasively Hyman ignores and omits important information. (An extensive commentary has been pub\u00ad lished on various Web sites, including www.openmindsciences.com.) Four sam\u00ad ples of important ignored facts are pro\u00ad vided below. Selective Ignoring of Historical, Procedural, and Empirical Facts Veritas 1: In his review, Hyman failed to mention the important historical fact that our mediumship research actually began with double-blind experimental designs. For example, die published experiment 58 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FOLLOW-UP referred to in The Afterlife Experiments as \"From Here To There and Back Again\" with Susy Smith and Laurie Campbell was completed almost a year before we conducted die more naturalistic multi- medium/multi-sitter experiments in\u00ad volving John Edward, Suzanne Northrop, George Anderson, Anne Gehman, and Laurie Campbell. The early Smith-Campbell double-blind studies did not suffer from possible sub\u00ad tle visual or auditory sensory leakage or rater bias\u2014and strong positive findings were obtained. Our decision to subsequently conduct more naturalistic designs (which are inherendy less controlled), was made par\u00ad tially for practical reasons (e.g., develop\u00ad ing professional trust with highly visible mediums) and pardy for scientific ones (e.g., we wished to examine under labora\u00ad tory conditions how mediumship is often conducted in die field). Conclusion: Hyman makes a factually erroneous criticism when he reports diat double-blind experiments were initiated only late in our research program, and therefore makes a serious interpretative mistake when he decides tliat all the early data can be dismissed because they were not conducted double-blind. Veritas 2: In an exploratory double-blind long distance mediumship experiment where George Dalzell (GD) was one of six sitters and Laurie Campbell (LC) was the medium, Hyman states \"because nothing significant was found, die results do not warrant claiming a successful replication of previous findings.\" However, Hyman minimizes the fact that the number of subjects in this exploratory experiment was small (\u00ab=6). More importandy, Hyman fails to cite a important conclusion mat we reached in me discussion: \"If die binary 66 percent figure approximates (1) LC's actual ability to conduct double-blind readings, cou\u00ad pled widi (2) the six sitter's ability, on die average, to score transcripts double-blind, die 66 percent figure would require only an n of 25 sitters to reach statistical signif\u00ad icance (e.g., p< .01).\" Hyman fails to mention mat NIH, for example, requires that investigators who apply for research grants calculate statisti\u00ad cal power and sample size to determine what n is required to obtain a statistically significant result. This is accepted scien\u00ad tific practice and is required for obtaining NIH funding. Conclusion: Hyman would rather dis\u00ad miss the fact that the highly accurate rat\u00ad ings obtained in the single-blind pub\u00ad lished were indeed repli\u00ad cated in the double-blind published study, than to admit the possibility that individual differences in sitter characteris\u00ad tics are an important and genuine factor in mediumship research. Veritas 3: It is curious that among the many examples of readings provided in The Afterlife Experiments, one early subset (cluster/pattern) of facts happened to fit Hyman nicely. It is true that mention of the \"Big H,\" a \"father-like figure,\" an \"HN sound\" would fit Hyman's father like it did the sitter's husband mentioned in the book. Hyman chose not to report the fact that many other pieces of specific infor\u00ad mation also reported for the \"Big H\" did not fit Hyman but did fit the sitter pre\u00ad cisely. Moreover, Hyman consistently failed to report scores of examples from readings reported verbatim in the book that were highly unusual and unique to individual sitters (e.g., John Edward see\u00ad ing a deceased grandmother having two large poodles, a black one and a white one, and die white one \"tore up the house\"). Conclusion: The reason Hyman railed to mention these numerous examples is because they contradict the conclusion Hyman chose to accept\u2014that the infor\u00admation, by chance, could fit multiple sit\u00ad ters\u2014an erroneous conclusion that can be reached only if we do what Hyman did and accept the information selectively. Veritas 4: Hyman's conclusion that expe\u00ad rienced cold readers can readily replicate the kinds of specific information obtained under the conditions of our experiments is mistaken at best and deceptive at worst. Under experimental conditions where (a) professional cold readers do not know die identity of die sitters (i.e., cheating is ruled out), and (b) cold readers are not allowed to see or speak with the sitters (i.e., cueing and feedback is ruled out), it is (c) impossible for cold readers to use whatever pre-obtained sitter specific information they might have obtained, and (d) impossible for cold readers to use their feedback tricks to help them get information from the sitters. At the two-day meeting I convened in Los Angeles of seven highly experienced professional mentalist magicians and cold readers, they all agreed that they could not apply their conventional mentalist tricks under these stria experimental condi\u00ad tions. However, a vocal subset (Hyman was one of rhe three), made the unsub\u00ad stantiated claim that if dicy had a year or two to practice, they might be able to fig\u00ad ure out a way how to fake what the medi\u00ad ums were doing. My response to this vocal subset was simple. It was \"show me.\" Just as I don't take the claims of me mediums on faith, I don't take die claims of die magicians on faith either. I am a researcher. Mentalist magicians who make these claims will have to \"sit in the research chair\" and show us that diey can do what diey claim they can do. Thus far, the few cold readers who Just as I don't take the claims of the mediums on faith, I don't take the claims of the magicians on faith either. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 59 FOLLOW-UP have made these claims have refused to be experimentally tested. They have been unwilling to demonstrate in the laboratory that they can't do what the mediums do under these experimental conditions; and they have been unwill\u00ad ing to demonstrate at a later date that their performance can improve substan\u00ad tially with practice. Conclusion: The claim that cold reading can account for the research findings is not supported when the experimental procedures are honestly taken into account. Failure to Integrate Information and Appreciate the Process of Discovery In most areas of science, no single experi\u00ad ment is perfect or complete. Different experiments address different conditions and different alternative explanations to different degrees. The challenge is to con\u00ad nect the dots of the available data and integrate the complex set of findings using the fewest number of explanations (i.e., Occam's razor). Hyman reveals in his review that he learned as a teenager that it was easy for him to fool many people widi palm read\u00ad ing. It is also quite easy to fool many peo\u00ad ple widi fake mediumship, as anyone trained in cold reading will tell you. I have studied a number of books on cold read\u00ad ing and have taken some classes on cold reading myself. However, just because it is possible sometimes to be fooled (espe\u00ad cially by die masters of magic) doesn't mean diat everyone is fooling you. Hyman reluctandy agrees mat it is improbable diat the totality of our find\u00ad ings can be explained by fraud. As a result, his preference is to propose mat the set of findings collected to date must involve a complex set of subtle cues providing information in some studies, cold reading techniques being used in some studies, rater bias providing inflated scores in some studies, and chance findings in some studies. The idea that mediums might be obtaining anomalous informa\u00ad tion that can most simply and parsimo\u00ad niously be explained in terms of die con\u00ad tinuance of consciousness is presumed categorically to be false by Hyman until proven odierwisc. I make no such categorical assump\u00ad tions, one way or die other. To me the question of whedicr or not mediums are obtaining anomalous information is a purely scientific one, to be revealed through a program of systematic research. Such research must be conducted by mul\u00ad tiple laboratories. The reason for publish\u00ad ing findings, as diey emerge, is to encour\u00ad age odier investigators to conduct their own experiments, and then integrate the totality of the findings. However, the truth is, it is impossible to integrate the totality of die findings in any area of science if one selectively (con\u00ad sciously or unconsciously) ignores those specific findings diat do not fit one's pref\u00ad erences or biases. Scientific Integrity and Changing One's Beliefs I admit, quite adamantly, that I do have one fundamental bias\u2014my bias is to use the scientific method to discover the truth, whatever it is. Discovering the truth cannot be achieved through selective reporting of history, proce\u00ad dures, and data. So what is the truth at the present time, based upon the available data? When the totality of die history, proce\u00ad dures, and findings to date are examined honestly and comprehensively\u2014not selectively sampled to fit one's particular theoretical bias\u2014somediing anomalous appears to be occurring in die medi\u00ad umship research, at least with a select group of evidence-based mediums. Over and over, from experiment to experiment, findings have been observed diat deserve the term extraordinary. In our latest double-blind, multi-center experi\u00ad ments, stable individual differences in sit\u00ad ters have been observed that replicate across laboratories and experiments. The observations are not going away\u2014even with multi-center, double-blind testing. Hyman once told me, \"I have no control over my beliefs.\" When I asked him what he would conclude if a perfect large sample multi-center double-blind experiment was conducted, his response was, \"I would want to see your major multi-center, double-blind experiment replicated a few times by odier centers before drawing any conclusions.\" This conversation is revealing psychologically. Until multiple perfect experiments are performed and pub\u00ad lished, Hyman would rather believe that die totality of the findings must be due to some combination of fraud, cold read\u00ad ing, rater bias, experimenter error, or chance\u2014even if this requires diat he selectively ignores important aspects of the history, designs, and findings in order to hold on to his belief that he (or we) are being \"fooled.\" Why spend the time and money con\u00ad ducting multiple multi-center, double- blind experiments unless mere are suffi\u00ad cient dieoretical, experimental, and social reasons for doing so? The critical question is, \"Is it possible diat consistent widi die actual totality of die data collected to date\u2014viewed histor\u00ad ically (e.g., the observations of William James) as well as across disciplines (e.g., from andiropology to astrophysics)\u2014diat future research may lead us to come to die conclusion that consciousness is inti\u00ad mately related to energy and information. To me the question of whether or not mediums are obtaining anomalous information is a purely scientific one, to be revealed through a program of systematic research. 60 May/lune 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FOLLOW-UP and diat consciousness, as an expression of dynamically patterned energy and information, persists in space like die light from distant stars?\" This is ultimately an empirical ques\u00ad tion; it will be answered by data, one way or die other. If positive data are obtained\u2014and I emphasize if\u2014accepting the data will require diat we be able to change our beliefs as a function of what the data reveal. The Afterlife Experiments was written to encourage people to keep an open mind about what the future research may reveal. Epilogue: What is a Magazine's Responsibility? If the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER wishes to be viewed as being a credible publication, more like the Philadelphia Inquirer than the National Enquirer, it should take responsibility for fact checking its articles and correcting mistakes caused by simple errors and/or the selective ignoring of important information. Icannot, of course, respond in detail within the allotted space to each of Schwartz's arguments. Instead, I will comment on his major points and con\u00ad clude with a general reaction to his rebuttal. 1. \"Hyman resorts to . . . selectively ignoring important information that is inconsistent widi his personal beliefs.\" In preparing my critique of his research program, I not only read The Afterlife Experiments carefully, I also scrutinized in detail every report of his research that was available. It was not possible to discuss each separate piece of information in my critique. I took each item into account, however, in making For example, Hyman's review begins by stating that I was a professor at Yale University for twenty-eight years\u2014die fact is, I was at Yale for twelve years. If the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER had not chosen to keep Hyman's review secret, and had asked me to fact check Hyman's review, I would have gladly done so, and therefore enabled both the magazine and the reviewer to correct at least the obvious errors of fact. Qeariy, iittie mistakes, com\u00ad pounded by big mistakes, do not make for a credible publication or review. I am taking a strong position about accuracy of reporting here not because of the ultimate validity of the survival hypothesis (i.e., whether it is true or not, since that is an experimental question) but because of the nature of scientific reviewing process itself. The selective ignoring and omission of important information cannot be con\u00ad doned in cither reviewing or publishing. It must be exposed and understood. my assessment of the research. I chose to focus my discussions on those items that Schwartz and his colleagues had empha\u00ad sized as the strongest outcomes amongst their findings. 1 have refereed and reviewed research reports for more dian fifty years for many of the major scien\u00ad tific publications and for major granting agencies. I applied die same standards to my evaluation of the afterlife experi\u00ad ments that I have used in my other assessments. 2. \". . . Hyman failed to mention the important historical fact that our medi- umship research actually began with double-blind experimental designs.\" As his example he refers to his exper-regardless of die specific research area diat is being reviewed or the specific person doing die reviewing. Note diat my argument is not widi Hyman as a person, nor with the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER as a publication. My concern is about die process by which Hyman has written his review, and die responsibility of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER to decrease the likelihood that this kind of mistaken review will be published in die future. There is a bigger lesson here. It is worth considering, and correcting.

Schwartz's 'How Review Mediumship Research' RAY HYMAN SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 61 FOLLOW-UP This is a peculiar example to use as a model of a controlled, double-blind experiment. The experiment involved having Susy Smith, designated as Medium One, apparently contact four deceased persons: her own mother, William James, Linda Russek's father, and Schwartz's father. Smith made a drawing for each of these departed indi\u00ad viduals supposedly with their input. She also made a \"control\" drawing. Laurie Campbell, designated as Medium Two, was then requested to independently attempt to contact these departed indi\u00ad viduals and, using the information obtained from them, to try to match each drawing to the associated departed individual. Campbell attempted to con\u00ad tact the departed entities during two ses\u00ad sions in the presence of three experi\u00ad menters. Campbell is described as being \"blind\" to personalities of the four de\u00ad parted individuals. However Schwartz, who was not blind to the personalities of these entities, was not only present dur\u00ad ing these sessions but actively trying to convey this information (through \"telepathy\") to Campbell. This unneces\u00ad sary blunder compromises whatever blinding would have existed between Medium Two and the personalities of the departed individuals. No psychic investigator would be surprised if Laurie Campbell came up with some correct information such as die gender and other descriptors of the departed indi\u00ad viduals under these conditions. Another defect of this phase of die experiment is that no provisions were made to use a systematic and objective method for assessing die accuracy of Medium Two's descriptions. The evalua\u00ad tion of the information for this stage of the experiment was subjective. During the sittings with Medium Two, all the experimenters were blind as to which drawing was associated with which departed individual. (Although it is plausible that one might be able to make some reasonable guesses, given the characters of each of the departed indi\u00ad viduals, which type of drawing would go with each one.) Unfortunately, the experimenters then make another seri\u00ad ous, and completely unnecessary, blun\u00ad der when it came time to see if Medium Two could accurately match the draw\u00ad ings with the appropriate individual. The experimenters brought Medium Two and Medium One together. Medium One then displayed the draw\u00ad ings she had made to represent each individual. Medium Two then attempted to match the drawings to the appropriate sources in the presence of Medium One. Ironically, the experi\u00ad menters openly admit that this could allow clues about the correct matching through the \"Clever Hans\" phenome\u00ad non. They dismiss this as possibility because Campbell was able to correctly match only one of the five drawings to its appropriate source. At this point in the experiment the report becomes especially murky. Presumably, the experiment has failed. However, the experimenters inexplica\u00ad bly have Medium Two try again to match die drawings to dieir appropriate source. This second attempt is made after she is shown an explicit summary of her comments about die pictures and die departed individuals. Campbell cor- recdy matches the five drawings (includ\u00ad ing die control) in this second attempt. No reason is given for giving the medium two tries at matching the draw\u00ad ings, nor do the experimenters tell us how they justify asking the medium to redo her matching. Probably these and other questionable aspects of the proce\u00ad dure arc moot given that the possibility of blinding was compromised. Schwartz and his colleagues, in their published paper, describe this as an \"exploratory study.\" The proceedings seem to have been improvised at each stage. Certainly, no competent investi\u00ad gator would plan to unnecessarily com\u00ad promise experimental blinding at the two most critical points of the data col\u00ad lection. Nor does it make sense to design an experiment wherein the medium is given two chances at getting the matching correct. I simply was applying the principle of charity in not discussing this botched experiment. 3. \"In an exploratory double-blind long-distance mediumship experiment ... Hyman states 'because nothing sig\u00ad nificant was found, the results do not warrant claiming a successful replication of previous findings.' However, Hyman minimizes die fact that die number of subjects in this exploratory experiment was small (\u00ab=6). More importantly, Hyman fails to cite a(n) important con\u00ad clusion that we reached in the discus\u00ad sion: If the binary 66 percent figure approximates (1) LC's actual ability to conduct double-blind readings, coupled with (2) the six sitters' ability, on the average, to score transcripts double- blind, the 66 percent figure would require only an n of 25 sitters to reach statistical significance (e.g. < .01).\" This pan of Schwartz's rebuttal, like all the odier parts, strikes me as both bizarre and off die mark. First, we need to clear up some mistakes and/or mis\u00ad understandings. Schwartz confuses the sample statistic with the population (or hypothesized true value). Given twenty- five sitters and a sample outcome of sev\u00ad enteen correct identifications (success rate of 68 percent) of their actual read\u00ad ings (which, given the discrete nature of die binomial distribution is the closest we can get to 66 percent correct) die one-tailed probability would be .054 Schwartz has really not answered my criticisms. A close reading reveals that he does not deny the various failings I have divulged in his research. 62 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FOLLOW-UP and not less than .01 as Schwartz claims. Regardless of the correct probability value here, this has little to do with power. Schwartz is hypothesizing that the true (population) proportion of cor\u00ad rect binary choices in this situation is close to the 67 percent (4 out of 6) that he observed in his sample. If, indeed, this value is correct, then, given his use of a one-tailed test and a significance level of .01, the probability of getting a significant outcome with twenty-five sitters would be slightly more than 0.54. To have a reasonable power (say close to 90 percent) one would need over 100 sitters. Schwartz appears to be begging the question here. He begins by observing that four out of six sitters correctly iden\u00ad tified which of two readings was meant for them. Because of the small sample, this outcome is consistent with a num\u00ad ber of possibilities including the chance value of 50 percent. If he had obtained the same proportion of correct hits with a larger sample, then it would have been significant. However, since we cannot tell what the true proportion is from a sample outcome based on only six cases, we have no basis for predicting the out\u00ad come for a larger sample. His argument reduces to the trivial one: If the true proportion is 67 percent then we will be able to get a significant outcome with a larger sample. From his actual outcome, we can just as well say: If the true pro\u00ad portion is 50 percent (and this, too, is consistent with his data), then he will very likely not get a significant outcome with a larger sample. I find it difficult to understand why Schwartz considers this point worthy of mention. Of course a binary outcome with only six trials has very low sensitiv\u00ad ity. However, he did not rely on this out\u00ad come. He used two other measures, the number of dazzle shots and the hits and misses, which are clearly much more sensitive. These also failed to provide overall significance. For these measures (as well as for the actual choice of the relevant reading), the overall sensitivity would have been greatly enhanced if each sitter actually rated all six readings. In addition to greatly enhanced sensi\u00ad tivity, this would have avoided the unfortunate situation where each sitter was rating his or her own reading against a foil that differed for each rater. Another plus would have been the opportunity to determine which read\u00ad ings had more general appeal indepen\u00ad dent of any specific information pecu liar to a given sitter. In his longer rebuttal to my critique which he posted on the Web (see his reference in his rebuttal) Schwartz claims he actually predicted that GD would successfully differentiate his own reading from the accompanying foil reading. The claim that this particular outcome was predicted does not square with the opening sentence of the report wherein the experimenters state, \"This paper reports an unanticipated replica\u00ad tion and extension. . . . I have already pointed out in my cri\u00ad tique how Schwartz has an unusually lib\u00ad eral interpretation of \"replication.\" Not only is the statistical and experimental evi\u00ad dence suspect, but the qualitative analysis of die actual reading for GD in die sec\u00ad ond experiment does not overlap in any important respect with the reading in die earlier experiment. In particular, none of the apparently striking examples of names, events, and places that are reported for the first reading are in the second reading. I agree widi Schwartz that the outcome of this \"double blind\" exper\u00ad is consistent with sitter characteristics.\" However, borrowing from Schwartz's propensity to resort to Occam's Razor, I believe it is prudent to suggest a much more mundane explanation. We need only assume two very plausible and non- extraordinary assumptions to account for the results: 1) Luck: GD had a 50-50 chance of choosing the correct reading; 2) Rater bias: given diat he has chosen the correct reading, he would show a strong response bias to give high marks to the chosen reading and low marks to die rejected one. Note diat this is consistent with the qualitative evidence dial 1 pro\u00ad vided in my critique. However, note that the burden of proof is not upon the critic to show that this explanation is correct. Rather, the burden of proof should be on Schwartz to show, as the claimant, that he has ruled out this and other possible mundane explanations. This is what good experimental methodology, which is so far lacking in the afterlife experiments, is intended to accomplish. Unfortunately, I do not have space to respond to other specifics of Schwartz's rebuttal. In his rebuttal he attributes motives, preferences, and biases to me. These are based on assumption unsupported by facts. For example, he characterizes me as \"reluc\u00ad tantly\" agreeing that fraud is unlikely. In fact, I have no reluctance at all to make such an assertion. He attributes certain preferences to me that are, in some cases, just not true. He also is fac\u00ad tually incorrect on some matters. He says that I was one of the group of cold readers who declared that I could, with training, duplicate what his mediums had accomplished in his laboratory. This is wrong. I deliberately refrained from such a commitment. My major point during the meeting with him on cold reading was that the determination of whether his mediums are using cold reading is a separate matter from the question of whether they were convey\u00ad ing any information of a paranormal nature. If he wanted to study the role of cold reading in the readings given by his mediums, that was an experimental goal that was separate from determining if his mediums are providing evidence for the survival of consciousness. Nor did I conclude, contrary to Schwartz's implication, that his medi\u00ad ums were using cold reading. I did observe\u2014and I specifically emphasized that this was a subjective opinion\u2014that 1 could see little difference between the utterings of his mediums and those of the typical psychic reader. I want to emphasize again, it is not for me, or other critics, to show that his mediums are using cold reading or some other ploys. The burden of proof is on Schwartz to show that he has convinc\u00ad ingly eliminated such possibilities. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/lune 2003 63 FOLLOW-UP So far as I can tell, Schwartz has really not answered my criticisms. A close reading reveals that he does not deny the various failings I have divulged in his research. Instead, he defends the departures from proper experimental methodology on a number of grounds: 1) he and his colleagues were aware of these defects and actually admitted so in their reports (but such admissions do not somehow neutralize the defects); 2) there were practical reasons such as wanting to provide a more naturalistic context (but this does not excuse using inappropriate control comparisons, fail\u00ad ing to correct for rater bias, using inap\u00ad propriate probability and statistical computations, etc.); 3) some of the \"defects\" were deliberately included to check on certain questions (but this does not justify drawing strong conclu\u00ad sions); and 4) that taken in their totality the experiments somehow provide pow\u00ad erful evidence for anomalous communi\u00ad cation even if the individual experi\u00ad ments are flawed (actually, repeatedly making similar mistakes from experi\u00ad ment to experiment compounds rather than compensates for the errors). Despite the deficiencies in his exper\u00ad iments, Schwartz seems convinced that his mediums have provided, in some cases, specific and unique information including names, places, etc., that the critics cannot explain away. For one thing, these apparently specific items are much fuzzier than he believes. His examples are selected just because they appeared to contain such specifics. This raises the difficult question of how to actually assess how much of this is just coincidence. Furthermore, even the most specific and concrete match is problematical because practically no constraints are placed upon the sitter in finding a suitable match (e.g., it can be a dead or a living person; it can be some\u00ad one close to the sitter or a mere acquain\u00ad tance; etc.). No actual check is made as to how close the match actually is. My point here is that Schwartz really has provided us with nothing to explain. We do not know if he has produced anything worth taking seriously until he can convincingly demonstrate that he has obtained his data under method\u00ad ologically appropriate conditions. Science demands this in the conven\u00ad tional fields of inquiry. We should demand no less from Schwartz. z^^W INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS COMPLETE SETISI WELCOMING REMARKS DONTGET TAKEN EVOLUTION AND INTELLIGENT DESIGN SPECIAL ADDRESS FRINGE PSYCHOTHERAPIES LOOK TO THE STARS KEYNOTE ADDRESS URBAN LEGENDS NATIONAL MEDIA CENTER- LA LUNCHEON CFI WEST VIDEO MEOICAl CLAIMS THE INVESTIGATORS AWARDS BANQUET EDUCATING OUR FUTURE PARANORMAL AROUND THE WORLD | CONFERENCE VIDEO TAPES NOW AVAILABLE \u00a5 From the CSICOP conference PROSPECTS FOR SKEPTICISM: The Next Twenty-Five Years June 20 - 23, 2002 Burbank, California SPEAKERS Special Discount for Full Set Orders ONLY $150.00 PIUS $1500 Shipping and Handling Paul Kurtz Ray Hyman.

And, based on that two-day expe\u00ad rience, I thought I'd offer some comments on the article: Ray Hyman and 1 have long shared a mutual respect for one another, but wc do not always agree on various topics. This is one such case, as I feel Hyman was far too gener\u00ad ous in assessing The Afterlife Experiments. Gary Schwartz is an engaging, even charming fellow, but his understanding of cold reading is remarkably minimal (and largely mistaken), and it seems diat he has little knowledge or interest in the fundamen\u00ad tals of protocol design and the interpretation of probability. Professor Schwartz is not a stupid man. However, given his seemingly willful ignorance combined with astonishing hubris, he might as well be. Max Maven MaxMavcn@aol.com Missing from Ray Hyman's effective dissec\u00ad tion of Gary Schwartz's past-life experi\u00ad ments was any explanation of how Schwartz, with all his academic credentials, careened into such oudandish views and such shabby thinking in the first place. Schwartz's work at the University of Arizona is hardly limited to \"past-life\" considera\u00ad tions; he has been deeply involved with the mystical alternative medicine projects of the University of Arizona's other shabby thinker Andrew Weil as well, serving as Senior Research Advisor to Weil's program. One common denominator is Schwartz's and Weil's education at Harvard in the psy\u00ad chedelic 1960s\u2014when chemical paths to \"creativity were .ill the rage. Weii, of course, can properly be called a psychedelic mystic; he admits he still uses LSD to tune his creative \"natural mind\" and recently has been the object of ridicule for his assertions that LSD is an effective treatment for cat allergies. Has a psychedelic cult been established at the University of Arizona? Indeed, in 2001, psychiatrist Dr. Stanislav Grof, the leading guru of paranormal psychedelicism, deliv\u00ad ered a Grand Rounds lecture to the Depart\u00ad ment of Psychiatry titled \"Psychology of the Future: Lessons for Modern Consciousness Research.\" Grof then met with a research team purporting to be studying the use of psilocybin for treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This questionable research is a project of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies\u2014a Groffian organization that endorses psychc- delics to amplify paranormal powers. The University of Arizona's research team, as part of their \"research\" preparation, underwent Grofs hallucinogenic psychotherapy called Holotropic of 1960s-1970s psyche- delicism. Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, has just been added as Coordinator of Integrative Psychiatry to Andrew Weil's research team, funded by the National Center for Comple\u00ad mentary and Alternative Medicine. Mehl-Madrona, a mystic with an extraordinarily checkered career, is aiso a product of the Grof-Esalen Institute circles. Known for his book Coyote Medicine, his medical practice might best be called \"pcyote\" medi\u00ad cine. (See SI July/August 2000. \"SRAM Articles Lead to Alternative Medical Doctors Resignation.\") Mehl-Madrona and Schwartz will be sharing keynote responsibilities at an upcoming conference exploring \"clinical practices integrating mind, body, and spirit\" at Arizona State this coming February. Gary Schwartz regularly shares mystical conference billings with Grof and his follow\u00ad ers, as any Internet search can verify. My substantive study of Stanislav Grofs influence on alternative medicine. \"Carl Jung. Stanislav Grof and New Age Medical Mysticism\" has been published in die Spring 2002 issue of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. I would think that the public exposure of these psychedelic spiritualist networks is at least is effective a way to deal with obvious irrationalists like Schwartz as the meticulous point-by-point rebuttal of Ray Hyman. Schwartz, like all paranormalists, has an infi\u00ad nite capacity to spew out defective research. Is it not better to expose the very roots of the detective \"vr\"\"f\u00bbg icsdr rather than spend our own limited time constantly rebutting his nonsense? E. Patrick Curry Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Ray Hyman has exposed the flaws in Gary Schwartz's claim to demonstrate that medi\u00ad ums can communicate with the dead. Supported bv public funds. Schwartz and his research methods also inform the academic \"integrative medicine\" movement. As a col\u00ad league of alternative medicine guru Andrew Weil at the University of Arizona, Schwartz contributes to claims dial \"conventional\" medicine is preeminent only because it is \"politically dominant,\" that the modern clas\u00ad sification of diseases refers to \"Western dis\u00ad orders,\" that modern physicians arc unaware of emergent properties, that they arc unlikely to be open to \"new paradigms.\" and that they do not \"emphasize healing the person as a whole\" or understand that \"a given disease may manifest at the spiritual level as well as on the physical plane.\" As an antidote to such failings, Schwartz, Weil, and their col\u00ad leagues offer traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Native American Medicine, and homeopathy. Since these disciplines are not readily amenable to study by \"Western reductionist\" methods. Schwartz and Weil argued (in the January 28. 2002, Archives of Internal Medicine), they must be studied in a \"sys\u00ad tems theory framework.\" A standardized acupuncture regimen oughtn't be studied as a treatment for patients with asthma, for example. Rather, patients with the \"Western\" diagnosis of asthma should be individually diagnosed and treated by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine, using what\u00ad ever diagnostic and therapeutic options they deem appropriate\u2014however numerous and disparate these may be. Outcomes must not be reductionist either in addition to \"dis\u00ad ease-specific conventional outcomes\" there should aiso be \"psychological, social, and spiritual outcomes in the same study.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER May/June 2003 65 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The only trouble, the authors grant, is that these schemes will introduce so many variables that it will be impossible to draw any conclusions. No problem: \"given many choices, the patient's preferences for the course and sequencing of action guide the ultimate decision-making process.\" Likewise, the difficulty in conducting ran\u00ad domized, controlled trials under such condi\u00ad tions isn't a problem because \"not only are observational studies justifiable under cer\u00ad tain conditions, they may even have several advantages over randomized controlled tri\u00ad als, including lower cost, greater timeliness, and a broader range of patients.\" Schwartz is the recipient of a grant from the NIH's National Center for Comple\u00ad mentary and Alternative Medicine for his \"Center for Frontier Medicine in Biofield Science.\" According to the NCCAM Web site, \"This Center facilitates and integrates research on the effects of low energy fields. The research is focused on developing stan- dardized bioassays (cellular biology) and psy\u00ad chophysiological and biophysical markers of biofield effects, and on the application of the markers developed to measure outcomes in the recovery of surgical patients. As unlikely as it may seem, some influen\u00ad tial academic physicians take such ideas seri\u00ad ously. Ralph Snyderman is the Chancellor for Health Affairs at Duke University and President and CEO of Duke University Health System. He has \"fostered discussion of Integrative Medicine at meetings of the Association of Academic Medical Colleges,\" of which he is the chairman. In a recent arti\u00ad cle for Academic Medicine, Snyderman and former Schwartz and Weil co-author Tracy Gaudet praised Weil's \"Arizona Program\" and called for incorporating \"integrative medicine\" into the standard medical school curriculum. Elsewhere they have written, \"We believe that what we now call integra\u00ad tive medicine will one day be such an inte\u00ad gral part of medical education, training, and practice that it becomes the new paradigm for good conventional medicine.\" Kimball C. Atwood IV, M.D. Waben, Massachusetts (See also the Follow-Up section in this issue, 58-64 If Richard M. on Trial and the Legality of Reasonableness,\" January/February 2003) was to justify die application of litigation paradigms to the skeptical inquiry into claims of the paranor\u00ad mal, he has failed to do so, and accordingly the jury should be directed to dismiss his case! The pith and substance of his argument seems to be that the standard of proof of para\u00ad normal phenomena should be one rhat would satisfy ordinary people sitting on a jury. This standard depends on \"what is reasonable in the circumstances,\" which in turn depends on what would be expected from persons stand\u00ad ing \"in the shoes of the claimant.\" In this way Fisher seeks to cram the \"Reasonable Person\" (RP) standard into a con\u00ad text in which it was never intended to operate. Originally formulated by the courts as an objective standard, the RP becomes subjective: it is to be defined in relation to the specific \"education, experience, and capacity\" of the person making the paranormal claim. Next he changes the RP concept from a standard for assessing a defendant's past conduct into a yardstick for measuring the credibility (or fal\u00ad libility or gullibility) of a witness\u2014something the law does not do. This leads to Fisher's extraordinary sug\u00ad gestion that a claim by an air traffic con\u00ad troller to have seen a UFO is to be assessed according to whether \"a reasonable air traffic controller, with similar background and experience to the claimant\" would have been led to the same inescapable conclusion. I'm sorry, but the answer to that question proves nothing to me about the existence of UFOs. Would Fisher be satisfied with an alien abduction story told by a country bumpkin, provided it's good enough to persuade a jury of \"reasonable\" country bumpkins? Fisher disdains the evidence of experts, because not all experts are skeptics, and some arc \"out-and-out flakes.\" We don't need experts, says he; all we need is the Reasonable Person. This populist, anti-intellectual view\u00ad point may be in keeping with the current Zeitgeist, but I still like to think there's room for scientific evidence to be brought to bear on claims of the paranormal. Fisher doesn't like the idea of requiring extraordinary proof of extraordinary claims, unless it's \"reasonable in the circumstances\" to require it. Reasonable people can differ over what's reasonable, so where does that leave us? The standard, he says, depends on what would be expected from any other per\u00ad son with similar qualifications and experi\u00ad ence to the claimant. Again, a subjective test for proving objective facts. Jeff White Toronto, Ontario I frequently encounter misapplications of legal reasoning other than those described by Richard Fisher. A common example is invok\u00ad ing a variation of \"innocent until proven guilty,\" for example, UFO sightings are real until proven wrong. This ploy, of course, effectively places the burden of disproof on science. Criminal defendants are innocent until proven guilty, but ideas arc wrong until proven right. A much better model is the civil stan\u00ad dard of \"preponderance of the evidence.\" If the vast majority of UFO sightings are erroneous, the preponderance of the evi\u00ad dence suggests that the remaining unex\u00ad plained cases arc, too. Even more useful is the doctrine of \"control of the facts.\" The burden of proof is frequently on the side that was best in a position to record the facts. That's why taxpayers are required to keep financial records. Similarly, both the orthodox scientist and the believer in UFOs have the responsibility for collecting convincing data and ensuring that it meets stringent standards. In the ongoing debate about the Mars Effect (the Ertel-Dcan exchange), there is one possible explanation I have never seen discussed. If you scan a large body of data for apparent correlations, you will probably find a few. If you focus solely on the apparent cor\u00ad relation and ignore all the other possible combinations and permutations, the correla\u00ad tion will stand up to every imaginable statis\u00ad tical test. No amount of post-hoc statistical analysis will make a run of ten consecutive heads in coin flipping go away, but if we find out the ten heads arc a selected part of a series of a thousand flips, the run becomes a lot less remarkable. If the Mars Effect is nothing more than statistical clustering, no amount of post-hoc statistical testing of the original data set will discredit it. To test whether the Mars Effect is real, we need to look in a broader context. Are there equally strong analogous correlations between other planets and other traits? No. Does the effect persist when examined over a longer time span than the original data? No. The pre\u00ad ponderance of the evidence is that the effect is statistical clustering, nothing more.

Qukk I eflexol-LETTERS TO THE EDITOR methodology, a useful first step for the skep\u00ad tic is to acquaint himself with the basic prin\u00ad ciples of science and statistics. In the article, Fisher makes the following statements: \"For publishing in most scientific journals, the minimum standard is P<.05. In other words, in order to convince me, and others, that the results are valid, you must first be able to show, by statistical analysis, that if you repeated the experiment 100 times, you would be expected to get the same result 95 times out of 100,\" What Fisher seems not to realize is that the \".05\" in the phrase \".05 level of statisti\u00ad cal significance\" refers to the probability of what is called a Type I error (obtaining a sig\u00ad nificant result if the null hypothesis is true). Thus, a correct version of Fisher's statement would be something like: \"If only chance is operating, and you repeated the experiment 100 times, you would fail to get a significant effect 95 times out of a 100.\" Fisher has instead erroneously assumed that the .05 refers to what is called a Type II error (failing to get a significant result when the null hypothesis is false). The probabilities of making a Type I and Type II error are not in general the same. For instance, suppose that a weight-loss program really does pro\u00ad duce a loss in the average weight of its par\u00ad ticipants. If the effectiveness of the program is tested using a .05 level of significance, the probability of a Type II error (getting a non\u00ad significant result) is likely to be much greater if the program produces an average weight loss of three ounces than if it produces an average loss of twenty-five pounds. Fishers error would be sufficient to earn him a B- in Statistics 101 (any lower grade being of course precluded by contemporary grade inflation and the ever-present possibil\u00ad ity of litigation). Douglas M. Stokes Ann Arbor, Michigan Causes and Precognitions Massimo Pigliucci's new column is a won\u00ad derful idea, and he chose an excellent topic for his first entry (January/February 2003). Unfortunately, in conveying the essence of the post hoc fallacy, he used a terrible exam\u00ad ple which severely undermines the impact of his article. When people claim to have had precog- nitive dreams, they do not, as Pigliucci says, imply \"some causal connection between the dream and the phone call.\" They merely believe that they have had advance warning 68 May/June 2003 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER of something that was going to happen. It I had fixed the World Series, for exam\u00ad ple, and then telephoned a crony on the opposite coast to tell him about it, that would not imply that the call caused the fix. John Orr Fullerton, California Askance at Yogic 'Miracles' I greatly enjoyed Massimo Polidoro's \"Don't Try This At Home\" (January/February 2003). To his suggestions for further reading, I would like to add Arthur Koestler's delight\u00ad ful travelogue and critique of both India and Japan, The Lotus and The Robot (Hutchinson 1960), which includes a description of vari\u00ad ous bizarre and, in Koestler's opinion, often \"degrading\" Yogic practices. Koestler con\u00ad cludes that yogis can achieve high levels of conscious control over various neuro\u00ad endocrine functions which are normally autonomic, and can, for example, raise boils, stigmata, etc. through meditative exercises. In no case, however, could he find evi\u00ad dence of a genuine miracle, one in which a law of physics as we know it was clearly vio\u00ad lated by a Yogic feat. Koestler chose levita- tion as an example; no yogi has ever been reported to be able to alter his own weight by even a small amount, when measured under controlled conditions. Koestler and others have noted that, when Vedic philosophy is exported to the West, either as New Age stuff (and non\u00ad sense) or in the older writings of Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, etc., the role of the miraculous is usually down\u00ad played. In India, however, the story was very different in 1960, when Koestler wrote, and probably remains so today in many areas of the country. A typical New Age/spiritualist response to a skeptic's demand for proof is that yes, Yogic miracles are possible, but only at great risk to the practitioner, and that miracles are in any case not for public consumption. Nonsense! Jesus' \"miracles\" were allegedly performed for the multitudes, not just for \"initiates,\" and included wine, transformed from water, enjoyed by unbelievers. If \"advanced\" yogis can in fact perform mira\u00ad cles, there is no necessary \"karmic law\" that would prevent them from doing so under laboratory conditions. One very strongly suspects that yogis do not give such demon\u00ad strations because they are in fact unable, rather than merely unwilling, to do so. If so, the tacit encouragement of public belief in the possession of miraculous powers by vari\u00ad ous \"gurus\" gives one good cause to seriously question the integrity and honesty of these \"spiritual leaders,\" and, by extension, to look askance at the fundamental precepts of their tradition. John A. Finch Madison, Wisconsin Letters on 9/11 Concerns A more rational, objective alternative to the events of September 11, 2001, (Letters, January/February 2003) could unwittingly provide a framework for minimizing the human significance of an act of profound moral evil. A rational analysis that objecti\u00ad fies the personal and symbolic meanings of this act of terrorism can easily \"spill over\" into a rationalization that minimizes the meaning of this evil act and more impor\u00ad tant, leads to a neglect of prophylactic action and healing. A purely logical analysis of the terrorist attacks is characterized by both strengths and weaknesses. Strengths include an ana\u00ad lytical, objective examination and an emo\u00ad tional distancing from the event. Weak\u00ad nesses include the objectification of an event that should be, at least in part, expe\u00ad rienced within an emotionally empathic framework of shared meanings. The \"disproportionate\" response is not ai all disproportionate when viewed in psy\u00ad chological terms. The meaning of this event should be recognized in terms of implica\u00ad tions for such core American identity ele\u00ad ments and values (arguably somewhat illu\u00ad sory) as security and safety. The core identi\u00ad ties of many Americans were threatened\u2014 exposing millions to vivid awareness of the fragility and contingency of human life. The symbolic meaning of this event cannot be experienced within the context of a purely rational analysis, but must be exam\u00ad ined from multiple perspectives, including subjective, emotional, symbolic, and collec\u00ad tive meanings. Jerome J. Tobacyk Psychology Department Louisiana Tech University Ruston, Louisiana The central point to be made about the response to 9/11 is not whether it was dispro\u00ad portionate but rather whether any effective LETTERS TO THE EDITOR response can be made, other than the exercise of belter than usual care (i.e., \"vigilance\"). Although it wasn't the central point of their letters, respondents Thomas Freeman and Charles Chandler touched on it. Chandler wrote, \"The next big terrorist attack will probably have nothing to do with air transport,\" and Freeman added, \"My engineer friends and I spent time at lunch dreaming up terrorist scenarios.\" To sec how easy it is 10 COOK up with horrific acts against which virtually no defense is possible, especially when the perpetrator is willing to commit suicide in the process, imagine sev\u00ad eral terrorists, say, hijacking several gasoline tank trucks one day and driving them into, say, several banks around the country. This would require little in the way of planning and almost nothing in the way of equip\u00ad ment. I will probably be accused of encour\u00ad aging terrorism for giving this example, but surely it is clear this isn't rocket science. How many mailboxes did just one mixed-up teenager blow up before he was caught? So Chapman and Harris's comparison wiih other, risks is die only comparison that matters. Reinforcing cockpit doors is a good (and overdue before 9/11) idea. Catching bin Laden would be a great (and overdue before 9/11) event. But 1 don't think we now need a Federal Bank Petroleum Truck Approach Radar and Barricade Network or a National Teenage Mailbox Antipathy Screening Network. Jonathan R. Smith Brunswick, Georgia Kudos for a Professor Yesterday, I finished my last day of class for Computer Science 540: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The course was taught by Professor Jude Shavlik at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I believe he deserves an honorable mention in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER for two instances I observed during the course of the semester First, the class watched an ABC Nightline episode titled, \"Machines Like Us.\" The final part wc watched talked about an investment business using genetic algorithms to create artificial stock pickers. Nightlintefocused on the successes of the featured busmen Professor Shavlik informed us that a former graduate of UW-Madison had worked for the company, and ended that day of class by saying, \"Weii, he no longer works for the company, and he's not independently wealthy. So perhaps let that be the final les\u00ad son, that maybe in a bull market lots of things will work that might otherwise not.\" Second, on die last day of class, we briefly reviewed some of the philosophical topics related to artificial intelligence. In the clos\u00ad ing remarks for die course, he asked the stu\u00ad dents to \"be skeptical of claims about artifi\u00ad cial ji^Kgfprr. Dor.': !c: some snake oi! salesman convince you of some machine learning technology because 'it's got genetic algorithms' or 'it's based on nature.'\" In summary. Professor Shavlik was not only an excellent professor who taught CS 540 very well, but also a proponent of skep\u00ad tical thinking in the field. For this, I feel he deserves an honorable mention as one of the best professors I've encountered in my undergraduate career. Professor Shavlik's home page is www.cs.wisc.edu/-shavlik/. Patrick Meade Madison, Wisconsin The Report of Our Extinction May Be Exaggerated Richard M. Fisher, reviewing The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World by Bjorn Lomborg (November/ December 2002) takes its author to task for resurrecting a statistical straw man: \"he quotes from the work of a scientist who stated in 1979 that we could be losing some\u00ad thing in the order of 40,000 species a year to human-driven extinction. To increase the caricature, Lomborg reprints the 40,000 species number on an X-Y graph so that the 40,000 figure spikes up like a sore thumb from a near-zero baseline from the years 1600-2000. Lomborg states that this 'is a figure which with monotonous regularity has been repeated everywhere until in the end wc all believed it.\" The problem is, it hasn't, and we don't.\" This will come as a surprise to the mil\u00ad lions who have seen just such a graph in a book that is very much still in print. It is not a product of the 1970s, but Al Gore's best seller The Earth In the Balance. Its depiction ot the exponential rate of species loss is liter\u00ad ally impossible to exaggerate, since its curve goes vertical, and hence its rate of extinction infinite, upon reaching the year 2000. Despite having been extinct for these last diree years, I nevertheless look forward to Richard Fishers review of the newest and most elegant edition of this Vice-Presidential masterpiece. Perhaps he will commend it to The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty. Russell Seitz Nantucket, Massachusetts ID and NEA This note relates to the concept of Intelligent Design creationism, and specifically to the \"Unintelligent Design\" Forum article in the November/December 2002 issue of SI. I am a career public school teacher, and I'm saddened to learn that the National Educational Association (NEA) of which I'm a member apparently is going to provide a forum for ID proponents. This note appears in the January 2003 issue of NEA Today, dis\u00ad tributed to all members: \"Should Schools Teach 'Intelligent Design? If you'd like to take part in this future debate, send a brief note to Alain Jehlen, ajehlcn@nea.org.\" This is a yes/no \"Debate\" page, a regular feature of the educational journal.
