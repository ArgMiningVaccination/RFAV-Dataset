The traditional practitioners demonstrate and biomedical personnel participate in curing rituals. Joint therapy sessions and development of joint strategies to improve health are included. Participants list the names, symptoms, causes, and treatments of diarrhea in a column for ethnomedicine and another for biomedicine. Biomedical and ethnomedical practitioners work together to persuade indigenous peoples to overcome their fear of and resistance to vaccination. One way to achieve this is by having people examine unsterilized knives under the microscope to see the tetanus toxoid. Physicians tend not to respect midwives and traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Biomedical trainers are not trained in and/or undervalue ethnomedicine, and can introduce midwives and TBAs to unhealthy practices. For example, they insist on scissors to cut the umbilical cord, but scissors are hard to sterilize, resulting in increased rates of neonatal tetanus. Women trained in medical anthropology, cross-cultural communication, and public health are the best trainers of TBAs and midwives. Supervision is needed to integrate TBAs and midwives into health programs and to improve their skills. Herbalism and ritual healing are more popular than the rural health care delivery system. Integrated clinics attract more clients than standard clinics. Recommended guidelines on collaboration revolve around recognition and respect of traditional healers, rewards for biomedical and ethnomedical personnel who collaborate, and issuance of health cards so both sets of practitioners can view patients' medical histories.
