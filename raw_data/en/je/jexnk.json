A cold is an infection of the upper respiratory (breathing) tract caused by a virus. Colds usually get better on their own, without taking specific treatment like antibiotics. Influenza, or 'the flu', is a viral infection that can cause symptoms similar to the common cold \u2014 but can also cause serious complications for some babies and young children. [Respiratory syncytial virus](/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-in-babies-and-children), or RSV, is a very common virus that causes respiratory infections in children. It is often the cause of the common cold and [bronchiolitis ](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/bronchiolitis). Anyone can get RSV, and most children have had RSV by the age of 2 years. RSV is very infectious \u2014 it spreads easily by coughing and sneezing or coming into contact with surfaces or objects that have droplets from an infected person. RSV is more common in colder months. Very young children may have had little or no previous contact with the viruses that cause colds and flu, so they will have low resistance to infection. This is why children can get sick more often than adults. What are the symptoms of colds, flu and RSV? Depending on the infection, symptoms of a cold can include: - stuffy or runny nose - sneezing - sore throat and sore ears - cough - headache - red eyes - swollen lymph glands Some children will develop a [fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/fever-and-high-temperature-in-children). They might feel sick or vomit, not feel like eating, or be more irritable than normal. Symptoms usually last about a week. Children with influenza may have the symptoms of a cold, as well as: - muscle aches - shivering - feeling hot and cold Most of the time, RSV will cause a mild to moderate, cold-like illness. However, it can also cause severe illness, such as: - bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) [pneumonia](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/pneumonia)(infection of the lungs) Symptoms usually develop about 3 to 5 days after being infected with RSV and can last for up to 10 days. What causes colds, flu and RSV? Colds are caused by [viruses](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/bacterial-vs-viral-infection) that cause an infection in the upper respiratory (breathing) tract. The flu is caused by an infection with a particular Influenza virus. There are two main types of human influenza viruses: [A](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/influenza-a-flu) and B. RSV is a virus that causes infection of the lungs and breathing passages. It is one of the most frequent causes of the common cold. When should I see a doctor? Most colds run their course and get better on their own. However, very occasionally children may develop complications such as an [ear infection](/ear-infections-in-babies-and-children), laryngitis or [croup](/croup), bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Sometimes a child's coughing may be due to [asthma](/asthma-in-children) rather than a cold. If your child coughs through winter, or their coughing is brought on by exercise, or happens only at night, they may have asthma. See your doctor if you think your child may have asthma. Seek urgent medical advice if your baby or young child : - has a [high fever](/fever-in-babies)(see a doctor straight away for any fever in a baby younger than 3 months) - is unable or unwilling to feed, eat or drink - is not passing urine - is [vomiting](/vomiting-in-children)a lot - has a bad headache - has a [rash that does not disappear](/serious-childhood-rashes)if you press a glass against it - has decreasing alertness, awareness and activity \u2014 or is unusually sleepy. You should also see your doctor if your child has any breathing problems like: - a cough that lasts more than 3 weeks - wheezing - periods of breathlessness (breathing very rapidly) or difficulty breathing - bluish or very pale skin You should also see your doctor if there is any worsening of your child's illness. If at any time your child has trouble breathing, call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance. How are colds and flu diagnosed? Colds and flu are usually diagnosed by your doctor asking you about your child's symptoms and examining your child. Sometimes your doctor will take a nose and throat swab to test for influenza. How can I treat colds and flu in babies and young children? Young babies with upper respiratory tract infections sniffle a lot and may cough a little. Even if your baby seems to be breathing comfortably, they may have trouble [feeding](/baby-feeding) if their nose is blocked. Proper feeding is important to avoid dehydration and weight loss. Babies with colds and flu need: - cuddles and reassurance - smaller, more frequent feeds - extra sleep Ask your doctor if your child can take paediatric nasal drops to help them breathe while they feed. Only use medicines made for babies (not an adult formulation), and don't use nasal drops for more than a couple of days without first checking with your doctor. Babies can take [paracetamol](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/paracetamol) or [ibuprofen ](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ibuprofen)in liquid form to relieve uncomfortable symptoms, such as pain. Make sure to read the label for the recommended dose based on your child's age and weight. Like babies, young children with infections also need rest, warmth, nourishing food and plenty of fluids. You can give older children paracetamol as tablets. Be sure to give them only as recommended on the packaging, and to store them out of the child's reach. Do not give aspirin to babies or young children, as aspirin may have serious side-effects. Cough and cold medicines and over the counter products such as nasal sprays should not be given to children except on the advice of a doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Things to remember: - Colds and flu should get better in around 7 to 10 days. - Watch for breathing problems and other infections if your child has a cold or flu. - Medicines can ease some symptoms but must be used carefully. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about all [medicines for children](/medicines-for-your-child). How can I prevent colds and flu? If your child attends a [child care centre](/child-care), it is a good idea to let the director know that your child has a cold or flu. Centres have guidelines on when and for how long sick children should stay away. This is to minimise the risk of the disease spreading to other children. Children can receive the flu [vaccine](/immunisation-and-vaccinations-for-your-child) from 6 months of age. It's free under the [National Immunisation Program](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/national-immunisation-program-schedule?language=und) for children aged 6 months to under 5 years. It's also free if you are [pregnant](/cold-and-flu-during-pregnancy). If your baby or child has asthma, be extra careful and watchful during bouts of colds or flu, and protect them from passive smoking. Children are more likely to get infections of the airways if someone in the family smokes at home. Who can get free flu vaccination? The flu vaccination is free to the following groups of people under the National Immunisation Program: - children from 6 months to under 5 years - pregnant women - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people - people with certain medical conditions - people aged 65 and over Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about getting your free flu vaccination.
