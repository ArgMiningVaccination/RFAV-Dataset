The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in helping us get back to doing more of the things we enjoy with the people we love. We've gathered the latest expert information to answer some of the most common questions about COVID-19 vaccines. [ What are the benefits of getting vaccinated? ](#) Vaccines save millions of lives each year and a COVID-19 vaccine could save yours. The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and provide the best protection against serious illness and death. WHO reports that unvaccinated people have at least 10 times higher risk of death from COVID-19 than someone who has been vaccinated. It is important to be vaccinated as soon as it's your turn, even if you already had COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from COVID-19 than getting infected. The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but no vaccine provides 100 per cent protection. Some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination or pass the virus onto someone else. Therefore, it is important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others, including avoiding crowded spaces, opening windows for ventilation, physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.

[ Should I get vaccinated if I already had COVID-19? ](#) Yes, you should get vaccinated even if you've previously had COVID-19. While people who recover from COVID-19 may develop natural immunity to the virus, it is still not certain how long that immunity lasts or how well it protects you against COVID-19 reinfection. Vaccines offer more reliable protection, especially against severe illness and death. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ New COVID-19 infections and deaths have reduced significantly. That means we're safe, so why should I vaccinate? ](#) While new infections and deaths are down compared to the numbers reported in 2020 - 2021, it is still important to get as many people as possible vaccinated to cover most of the population in South Africa. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from COVID-19 than getting infected and it protects you from severe illness and death. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ How do COVID-19 vaccines work? ](#) Vaccines work by mimicking an infectious agent - viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause a disease. This 'teaches' our immune system to rapidly and effectively respond against it. Traditionally, vaccines have done this by introducing a weakened form of an infectious agent that allows our immune system to build a memory of it. This way, our immune system can quickly recognize and fight it before it makes us ill. That's how some of the COVID-19 vaccines have been designed. Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using new approaches, which are called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines. Instead of introducing antigens (a substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies), mRNA vaccines give our body the genetic code it needs to allow our immune system to produce the antigen itself. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades. They contain no live virus and do not interfere with human DNA. For more information on how vaccines work, please visit [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-do-vaccines-work). Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Are COVID-19 vaccines safe? ](#) Yes, COVID-19 vaccines have been safely used to vaccinate billions of people. More than [38 million doses](https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics) have been administered in South Africa. The COVID-19 vaccines were developed as rapidly as possible, but they had to go through rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and effectiveness. Only if they meet these standards can a vaccine receive validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ How were COVID-19 vaccines developed so quickly? ](#) Scientists were able to develop safe effective vaccines in a relatively short amount of time due to a combination of factors that allowed them to scale up research and production without compromising safety: - Because of the global pandemic, there was a larger sample size to study and tens of thousands of volunteers stepped forward - Advancements in technology (like mRNA vaccines) that were years in the making - Governments and other bodies came together to remove the obstacle of funding research and development - Manufacturing of the vaccines occurred in parallel to the clinical trials to speed up production Though they were developed quickly, all COVID-19 vaccines approved for use by the WHO are safe and effective. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines? ](#) Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. Not everyone does, but it's common to experience some mild-to-moderate side effects that go away within a few days on their own. Some of the mild-to-moderate side effects you may experience after vaccination include: - Arm soreness at the injection site - Mild fever - Fatigue - Headaches - Muscle or joint aches - Chills - Diarrhoea You can manage any side effects with rest, staying hydrated and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. If any symptoms continue for more than a few days then contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious side effects are extremely rare, but if you experience a more severe reaction, then contact your healthcare provider immediately.

[ Can I still get COVID-19 after I have been vaccinated? What are 'breakthrough cases'? ](#) A number of vaccinated people may get infected with COVID-19, which is called a breakthrough infection. In such cases, people are much more likely to only have milder symptoms. Vaccine protection against serious illness and death remains strong. With more infectious virus variants such as Omicron, there have been more breakthrough infections. That's why it's recommended to continue taking precautions such as avoiding crowded spaces, ensuring good ventilation, wearing a mask and washing your hands regularly, even if you are vaccinated. And remember, it's important to receive all of the recommended doses of vaccines to have the maximum protection. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ How long does protection from COVID-19 vaccines last? ](#) According to WHO, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines wanes around 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination has been completed. Taking a booster to strengthen your protection against serious disease is recommended if it is available to you. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Do the COVID-19 vaccines protect against variants? ](#) The WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death. However, the vaccines offer less protection against infection from Omicron, which is the dominant variant globally. That's why it's important to get vaccinated and continue measures to reduce the spread of the virus - which helps to reduce the chances for the virus to mutate - including physical distancing, mask wearing, good ventilation, regular handwashing and seeking care early if you have symptoms. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Do I need to get a booster shot? ](#) Booster doses play an important role in protecting against severe disease, hospitalisation and death. From the end of January 2023, people 50 years and older will be eligible for a 5th booster dose and people 18 years and older will be eligible for a 4th booster dose - 6 months after their previous shot. Data shows that a booster shot plays a significant role in boosting waning immunity and protecting against severe disease from highly transmissible variants like Omicron. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ When shouldn't you be vaccinated against COVID-19? ](#) If you have any questions about whether you should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, speak to your healthcare provider. At present, people with the following health conditions should not receive a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid any possible adverse effects: - If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of a COVID-19 vaccine. - If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (although you can get vaccinated once you have recovered and your doctor has approved). Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ I'm breastfeeding. Should I get vaccinated against COVID-19? ](#) Yes, if you are breastfeeding you should take the vaccine as soon as it is available to you. It is very safe and there is no risk to the mother or baby. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them, so there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine. In fact, the antibodies that you have after vaccination may go through the breast milk and help protect your baby.

[ I'm pregnant. Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19? ](#) Yes, you can get vaccinated if you are pregnant. COVID-19 during pregnancy puts you at higher risk of becoming severely ill and of giving birth prematurely. Many people around the world have been vaccinated against COVID-19 while pregnant or breastfeeding. No safety concerns have been identified for them or their babies. Getting vaccinated while pregnant helps to protect your baby. For more information about receiving a COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant, speak to your healthcare provider.

[ Some say the COVID-19 vaccine causes impotency, infertility and negatively affects the sex drive. Won't my sexual and reproductive health be affected? ](#) No, you may have seen false claims on social media, but there is no evidence that any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines, can affect fertility in women or men. You should get vaccinated if you are currently trying to become pregnant. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Could a COVID-19 vaccine disrupt my menstrual cycle? ](#) Some people have reported experiencing a disruption to their menstrual cycle after getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Although data is still limited, research is ongoing into the impact of vaccines on menstrual cycles. Speak to your healthcare provider if you have concerns or questions about your periods. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ How do I talk to my kids about COVID-19 vaccines? ](#) News about COVID-19 vaccines is flooding our daily lives and it is only natural that curious young minds will have questions - lots of them. Read our [explainer article](https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/how-to-talk-to-children-covid-vaccines) for help explaining what can be a complicated topic in simple and reassuring terms. It's important to note that from the millions of children that have so far been vaccinated against COVID-19 globally, we know that side effects are very rare. Just like adults, children and adolescents might experience mild symptoms after receiving a dose, such as a slight fever and body aches. But these symptoms typically last for just a day or two. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ If I've taken my Johnson & Johnson or two Pfizer doses, why do I need a booster? ](#) Booster doses play an important role in protecting against severe disease, hospitalisation and death. Data shows that a booster shot plays a significant role in boosting waning immunity and protecting against severe disease from highly transmissible variants like Omicron. From the end of January 2023, people 50 years and older will be eligible for a 5th booster dose and people 18 years and older will be eligible for a 4th booster dose - 6 months after their previous shot. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Have people died from taking the vaccine? ](#) There have been 2 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome - a very rare but potentially severe neurological adverse event that is associated with the administration of various vaccines and other medicines. In many cases, GBS resolves with no serious after-effects, but in some cases GBS can cause serious or life-threatening problems. What is important to note is that of the more than 38 million doses of vaccine administered in South Africa, there have been only 2 associated fatalities. Globally, we know from research that the COVID-19 vaccine has saved 20 million lives. Based on the available evidence, it is clear that the benefits of COVID- 19 vaccination far outweigh the very low risk of severe adverse events, including GBS.

[ First COVID, and now a measles outbreak - what's going on? ](#) Cases of measles have been recorded in 5 provinces in South Africa. The outbreak has been attributed to consistent lower than optimal vaccine coverage of routine measles 1 and 2 doses, which increases the risk of being infected and of spreading the disease. COVID-19 further interrupted childhood vaccinations in South Africa but catch-up campaigns in late 2020 and 2021 have helped to recover levels to near pre-COVID levels. Like with COVID-19, it is never too late to vaccinate.

How do I talk to them? ](#) The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a huge step forward in our global effort to end the pandemic. This is exciting news, but there are still some people who are skeptical or hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines. Chances are you know a person who falls into this category. We spoke to Dr. Saad Omer, Director at the Yale Institute for Global Health, to get his tips on how to navigate these challenging conversations. Read: [How to talk to your friends and family about COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/how-talk-about-covid-19-vaccines) [ Can COVID-19 vaccines affect your DNA? ](#) No, none of the COVID-19 vaccines affect or interact with your DNA in any way. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines teach the cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside the body. This response produces antibodies which keep you protected against the virus. mRNA is different from DNA and only stays inside the cell for about 72 hours before degrading. However, it never enters the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is kept. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Do the COVID-19 vaccines contain any animal products in them? ](#) No, none of the WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines contain animal products. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ I've seen inaccurate information online about COVID-19 vaccines. What should I do? ](#) Sadly, there is a lot of inaccurate information online about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines. A lot of what we're experiencing is new to all of us, so there may be some occasions where information is shared, in a non-malicious way, that turns out to be inaccurate. Misinformation in a health crisis can spread paranoia, fear and stigmatization. It can also result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus. Get verified facts and advice from trusted sources like your local health authority, the UN, UNICEF, WHO. If you see content online in South Africa that you believe to be false or misleading, you can help stop it spreading by reporting it to the social media platform and to the [Real411](https://www.real411.org/). Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. The Omicron variant The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been called a variant of concern by WHO. Omicron is spreading faster than any previous variant. The overall risk related to this variant remains very high. [ What do we know about the subvariants of Omicron? ](#) Since the Omicron variant emerged in late 2021, several subvariants have been observed. They're all considered to be variants of concern, as the virus is circulating at intense levels worldwide. The BA.5 strain of Omicron is currently the dominant subvariant globally and the most contagious so far. BA.5 is not seen as more severe than the other Omicron subvariants and WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide strong protection against serious illness and death. Spikes in cases however, which are being observed globally, can put health services under extreme pressure. With the huge increase in the number of cases, there has been an increase in hospitalizations in countries around the world. In many countries the lifting of public health measures, such as the use of masks and physical distancing, is contributing to the spread of the virus. [ What are the symptoms of the new XBB.1.5 or \"Kraken\" subvariant of Omicron? ](#) It is not yet known if the severity of infection will be different to other Omicron sub-lineages. The World Health Organization (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution is conducting an ongoing risk assessment on XBB.1.5. According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa: \"Due to the widespread circulation of other Omicron sublineages, and the overall high population immunity in South Africa, the introduction of XBB.1.5 in South Africa may not necessarily result in a large wave of infections. Ongoing surveillance to track variants will continue to track the growth of XBB.1.5 in South Africa and information is published weekly on the [NICD website](https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/disease-index-covid-19/sars-cov-2-genomic-surveillance-update/). All private and public laboratories are requested to send positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens for genomic sequencing. Currently, no changes to the public health response are required, and individuals are encouraged to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and boosters, as recommended by the National Department of Health, because vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death.\" Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Is the Omicron variant more severe than other COVID-19 variants? ](#) There is a reduced risk of hospitalization for Omicron compared to the Delta variant. But WHO warns that it should not be dismissed as \"mild\". An increase in the number of COVID-19 related deaths because of the Omicron variant have been seen in many countries, especially where vaccination levels are low among vulnerable populations. It is important to remember that all variants of COVID-19 can cause severe disease or death, which is why preventing the spread of the virus and reducing your risk of exposure to the virus is so important.

[ Does the Omicron variant cause different symptoms? ](#) There is no information to suggest that Omicron causes different symptoms from other COVID-19 variants. Omicron does however typically cause less severe disease than previous variants like Delta. [ Are the COVID-19 vaccines effective against the Omicron variant? ](#) The WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death, including against Omicron. Data shows that a booster shot plays a significant role in boosting waning immunity and protecting against severe disease from highly transmissible variants like Omicron. For best protection, it's important to also continue taking measures to reduce the spread of the virus - such as physical distancing, mask wearing, good ventilation and regular handwashing.

[ Is a prior COVID-19 infection effective against the Omicron variant? ](#) If you had COVID-19 before, it is possible that you can be reinfected by Omicron. You should get vaccinated even if you've previously had COVID-19. While people who recover from COVID-19 may develop some natural immunity to the virus, we do not yet know how long it lasts or how well you are protected. Vaccines offer more reliable protection. Use [FindMyJab](https://findmyjab.co.za/) to locate your nearest vaccination provider. [ Are children more likely to contract the Omicron variant? ](#) The Omicron variant is the most transmissible variant to date for all age groups, including both adults and children. So, an increase in the number of children affected is expected. People who are mixing socially and those who are unvaccinated are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
