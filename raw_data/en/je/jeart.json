Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus infection is a serious health problem worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been widely used to treat chronic liver diseases, and many controlled trials have been done to investigate their efficacy. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis B infection. Search methods Searches were applied to the following electronic databases: the Cochrane HepatoBiliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register, The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS (October 2000). Five Chinese journals and conference proceedings were handsearched. No language restriction was used. Selection criteria Randomised or quasirandomised trials with at least three months followup. Trials of Chinese medicinal herbs (single or compound) compared with placebo, no intervention, general nonspecific treatment or interferon treatment were included. Trials of Chinese medicinal herbs plus interferon versus interferon alone were also included. Trials could be doubleblind, singleblind, or unblinded. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the Jadadscale plus allocation concealment. Intentiontotreat analyses were performed. Main results Nine randomised trials, including 936 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was considered adequate in only one trial. There was a significant funnel plot asymmetry (regression coefficient=3.37, standard error 1.40, P=0.047). Ten different medicinal herbs were tested in the nine trials. Compared to nonspecific treatment or placebo, Fuzheng Jiedu Tang (compound of herbs) showed significantly positive effects on clearance of serum significant effect on clearance of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA and on alanine aminotransferase normalisation compared to interferon treatment. There were no significant effects of the other examined herbs. Authors' conclusions Some Chinese medicinal herbs may work in chronic hepatitis B. However, the evidence is too weak to recommend any single herb. Rigorously designed, randomised, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trials are required. Plain language summary Still awaiting evidence on Chinese medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus. Around 350 million people worldwide are chronic infected carriers of the virus. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have for long been used for treating chronic liver diseases both in China and in Southeast Asia. This systematic review evaluates the effect of Chinese medicinal herbs (single or compound) for treating chronic hepatitis B infection. The review of trials found that some of the Chinese medicinal herbs may have a positive effect on the clearance of hepatitis B virus and on the diseased liver. However, the methodological quality of the trials evaluating these herbs was generally poor. Analysis of the identified trials also indicated that trials with positive findings are more likely to be published than trials without significant findings. Further, medicinal herbs may be associated with side effects. Therefore, Chinese medicinal herbs should not be used outside new trials. Testing the herbs in larger, welldesigned trials is needed in order to establish the necessary evidence for their use. Background Hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). More than two billion people alive today have been infected worldwide ( [WHO 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0109)) and approximately 350 million people are chronically infected carriers of the virus ( [Purcell 1993](#CD001940-bbs2-0102); [WHO 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0109)). These carriers are at high risk of getting serious illness and die from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Each year more than one million carriers worldwide die from these diseases ( [WHO 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0109)). China bears a heavy burden of this disease, with an estimated 120 million chronically infected carriers; up to 12 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B disease, and 300 thousand people die each year ( [CMH 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0085)). Hepatitis B is, therefore, an important public health problem in China where treatment costs amount to 30 to 50 billion RMB Yuan (3.575.95 billion US $) per year ( [CMH 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0085)). The hepatitis B virus is transmitted by body fluids, such as blood and serum, and can be passed from mother to child. The virus belongs to the family hepadnaviridae ( [Gitlin 1997](#CD001940-bbs2-0090)). The virus is a round structure (42 nm diameter), called the Dane particle, which has an outer coat and an inner core. A protein on the surface, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a standard marker of infection when found in a patient's serum. The inner core is made of nucleocapsid protein (HBcAg) which encloses the virus DNA (HBV DNA). There is another core protein called hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) which is used in diagnosis as a marker of infection and virus replication. The incidence of new HBV carriers in children has decreased in high endemic areas thanks to the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, but for the areas of low endemicity, high risk group immunization strategy is not leading to a significant reduction of HBV infection on a national or international scale ( [WHO 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0109); [WHO 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0110)). Treating adults who have with alpha2binterferon (IFN) results in viral, biochemical and histological remission in about 30 per cent of the cases. Interferon therapy, which is presently considered 'standard therapy' for hepatitis B, however, even in combination with a nucleoside analogue, is associated with a high incidence of recurrence, serious side effects, and is very expensive; hence it is not widely used in developing countries. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used widely for more than 2000 years to treat chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B infection. Many controlled trials have been completed investigating treatment with TCM. The quality of these trials, however, has not been assessed systematically. Furthermore, the spontaneous evolution of chronic hepatitis B disease is difficult to predict and a definitive assessment of the effects of treatment requires longterm followup. TCM has its unique theories for concepts of etiology, systems of diagnosis, and treatment which are vital to their practice. TCM drug treatment consists typically in complex prescriptions of a combination of several components. The combination based on the Chinese diagnostic patterns (i.e., inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpation) follows a completely different rationale than many western drug treatments. Beside, for hepatitis B, the diagnostics includes laboratory evidence through liver function indices and viral markers. Treatment with alternative medicines may have great potential as viral hepatitis B disease therapy ( [Wang 2000](#CD001940-bbs2-0108)). However, the effectiveness of such treatment needs to be reviewed systematically and appraised critically to inform the current practice and direct the continued search for new treatment regimens. Chinese medicinal herbs for HBV infection are considered collectively in this review as a special experimental treatment. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs as a special experimental treatment for chronic hepatitis B compared with placebo, no intervention, nonspecific treatment, or IFN treatment. Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Randomised or quasirandomised clinical trials regardless of whether they were singleblind, doubleblind, or unblinded. Only trials with a minimum followup of three months were to be included. Types of participants Male or female patients, of any age or ethnic origin, who had chronic hepatitis B, defined as serum HBsAg positive persisting six months or more accompanied by elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or with recurrent fluctuation, whether symptomatic or symptomless, and with or without liver biopsy findings compatible with chronic hepatitis ( [Dusheiko 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0086)). Trials in populations with superinfection or coinfection of chronic hepatitis B with another hepatitis virus were excluded. Types of interventions Chinese medicinal herbs (a single herb or compound of herbs) were compared with placebo or no intervention, or general nonspecific treatments such as vitamins, or interferon (IFN) treatment (no limitation regarding IFN type or IFN treatment regimen). Trials of Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN treatment versus IFN alone were also included. In this review, Chinese medicinal herbs are defined as products derived from plants or parts of plants that grow and have been widely used in China for medicinal purpose. This definition does not exclude some herbal compounds that contain nonplant materials as supplements, like minerals or animal parts ( [Ergil 1996](#CD001940-bbs2-0088)). Types of outcome measures The following primary outcome measures were sought at three, six, and 12 months after completion of the treatment: 1. Mortality 2. Hepatocellular carcinoma 3. Viral response: Loss of serum HBeAg. Seroconversion serum HBV DNA. Loss of serum HBsAg. Viral response was measured by validated methods as follows: HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBsAg were measured radial immunoassay, and HBV DNAby polymerase chain reaction. 4. Biochemical response: Normalisation of ALT and/or AST levels (less than 40 IU/L) or decrease of ALT and/or AST levels. 5. Liver histological recovery: Decrease of liver inflammatory disease activity by comparison of pre and posttrial inflammatory severity through liver biopsy. The Knodell histologic activity index (HAI) reflects the inflammatory activity. The score can be 018 and, when comparing before and after treatment, a decrease greater than or equal to two is called improvement ( [Ishak 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0093)). The following secondary outcome measures were sought at three, six, and 12 months after completion of the treatment: 6. Quality of life. 7. Adverse effects: fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, urticaria, headache, gastrointestinal reaction, myalgia, decreased white blood cell count. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches The Trials Registers of The Cochrane HepatoBiliary Group, The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2000), and The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field were searched. MEDLINE (March 1966 to October 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2000) and BIOSIS (January 1969 to October 2000) were searched from their date of inception onwards. The MeSH terms included hepatitisB, medicineChinesetraditional, plantsmedicinal, drugsChineseherbal, plants extracts, and herbs. No language restrictions were applied. Handsearches Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases, Chinese Journal of Hepatology, Chinese Journal of Clinical Hepatology, Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine, and Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine on Liver Diseases were handsearched from the first publication date onwards (October 2000) by the contact reviewer. Conference proceedings in Chinese were also handsearched. Results of handsearching were submitted to the Cochrane HepatoBiliary Group. The bibliographic references of identified RCTs were checked in order to find RCTs not identified by the handsearched journals. Data collection and analysis Selection of trials for inclusion Two authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review according to the prespecified selection criteria. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. Assessment of methodological quality The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the instrument developed by Jadad et al. ( [Jadad 1996](#CD001940-bbs2-0095)). The scale awards one to five points to a RCT. RCTs with one or two points would be considered as low quality, and three to five as high quality ( [Moher 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0101); [Kjaergard 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0096)). An unblinded quasirandomised trials with alternate allocation which does not report on dropouts would score zero. In addition, concealment of the allocation sequence was scored A (adequate), B (unclear) or C (inadequate), following criteria adopted from The Cochrane Handbook and Schulz et al. ( [Schulz 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0103)) as follows: A Adequate measures to conceal allocations such as central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained convincing elements of concealment. B Unclearly concealed trials, in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all, or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A). C Inadequately concealed trials, in which method of allocation was not concealed, such as alteration methods or use of case record numbers. Data extraction Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a selfdeveloped data extraction form. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. Papers not in English or Chinese were translated with the help of the Cochrane HepatoBiliary Group. Data on the number of patients with each outcome event and by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance or followup, were sought to allow an intentiontotreat analysis. If the above data were not available in the trial reports, additional information was sought by correspondence with the principal author. If the information was still lacking after the author was contacted, this was recorded. Data synthesis Dichotomous data were presented as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were performed on intentiontotreat basis where possible. For dichotomous outcomes, patients with incomplete or missing data were included in sensitivity analyses by counting them as treatment failures ('worstcase' scenario analysis). Counting these patients in the treatment group as treatment failures and those in the control group as responders was considered as a 'worstworst case' scenario analysis. We intended to display studies as comparisons of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with: placebo or no treatment general nonspecific treatments (such as vitamins) IFN treatment. Trials of Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN treatment versus IFN treatment alone were presented as a separate comparison. Metaanalysis was performed within the comparisons where individual trials compared similar treatment and control interventions. We prespecified the following subgroup analyses for each outcome: ethnic origin age at time of infection. Age is a major factor in determining the outcome of HBV infection as children and adults exhibit different patterns of disease outcome. Young children rarely develop symptomatic HBV infection, but about 25 per cent of the children infected under the age of seven become HBsAg carriers. After the age of seven, children exhibit an adult pattern of disease outcome with about 5 to 10% becoming HBsAg carriers ( [WHO 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0109)). a single herb or a compound of herbs. Sensitivity analysis If a sufficient number of trials was found, sensitivity analyses were performed as follows: excluding quasirandomised trials (such as alternate allocation or systematic allocation). excluding studies with inadequate concealment of allocation ( [Schulz 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0103)). excluding studies in which outcome evaluation was not blinded. When we evaluated trials for inclusion in this review, a high proportion was found to have followed patients only to the end of treatment, and not for a minimum of three months as we had prespecified for inclusion. In order not to lose these data altogether, we performed a separate analysis of these trials according to the duration of followup. Potential publication bias ( [Vickers 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0107)) was investigated by a funnel plot where possible ( [Egger 1997](#CD001940-bbs2-0087)). Results Description of studies Our initial searches (October 2000) identified 521 articles; 312 from the electronic searches and 209 from the handsearching. After reading titles and abstracts, 439 of these articles were excluded because they were duplicates, nonclinical studies, or had study objectives different from this review. A total of 82 articles published in five languages (Chinese, English, German, Japanese, and Polish) were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, 50 articles were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion were listed under 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. The remaining 32 articles consisted of one quasiRCT and 31 RCTs that reported random allocation of patients (n=3509) with chronic hepatitis B to Chinese medicinal herbs versus control (placebo in four trials, nonspecific treatment in 15 trials, no treatment in one trial, and IFN treatment in four trials) or to Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN versus IFN alone (eight trials). However, of these 32 trials, 23 had followup duration less than three months after the end of intervention with Chinese medicinal herbs. According to our inclusion criteria, each RCT had to report a minimum of three months followup. As this criterion would lead to exclusion of the majority of the RCTs, we decided, before embarking on data analysis, to include the 23 RCTs in sensitivity analyses to investigate immediate therapeutic effects. These 23 trials are described in Additional tables ( [Table 6](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/table/CD001940-tbl-0006/): Trials with less than three months followup). 1 |Study ID||Methods||Participants||Interventions||Outcomes||Quality| |Chang 1994||Randomised clinical trial.

All assessed at the end of treatment. |Jadad score=1| Nine RCTs (including a total of 936 Chinese participants) met all our prespecified inclusion criteria, of which one trial was published in English ( [Chen 2000](#CD001940-bbs2-0003)) and the remaining in Chinese. Duration of followup after end of interventions was three to 12 months. Six trials included inpatients and one trial included outpatients. The other two did not specify the status of the patients. Inclusion criteria were explicit chronic hepatitis B diagnosed by clinical manifestations, biochemical responses, and virological markers. The diagnostic criteria were based on different consensus by the Chinese associations for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B depending on different period of times when the trials were conducted ( [CMA 1984](#CD001940-bbs2-0082); [CMA 1990](#CD001940-bbs2-0083); [CMA 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0084)). The diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy in three trials. From the available information, it was not possible to conduct subgroup analysis on ethnic origin or of age at infection. All nine RCTs included adults; mean age was 32 years in eight trials. One trial ( [Huang 1993](#CD001940-bbs2-0007)) did not describe the sex or age of participants (n=122), another trial ( [Zhang 1993a](#CD001940-bbs2-0028)) did not report sex (n=67), and the rest reported a male to female ratio of three to one (564:183). The average size of the trials was 106 patients, ranging from 40 to 252. Medicinal herbs According to the category of Chinese medicinal herbs, four trials studied a single herb or ingredient of a single herb (Phyllanthus amarus, Potenlini, kurorinone, and Polyporus umbellatus (Kangdu Jiedu Tang, Phyllanthus compound, and Anisodamine plus Salviae miltiorrhizae), and one trial studied a combination of a single and a compound of herbs (Polyporus umbellatus polysacharide plus a decoction called Buqi Jiedu Tang). The constituents and dosage of medicinal herbs varied ( [Table 7](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/table/CD001940-tbl-0007/)). The large heterogeneity of the intervention prevented us from doing a meaningful subgroup analysis on herbs either single or compound. The median duration of treatment was three months (range one to six months). Two trials used placebo ( [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025); 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0031)) in their alcamin | : not estimated NS: not significant Outcomes None of the nine trials reported mortality, quality of life, or incidence of liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. The common outcomes reported were viral responses (including serum HBsAg, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBV DNA), biochemical responses (serum ALT, AST, bilirubin), symptoms and signs, as well as adverse effects. One trial ( [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025)) described liver histology. One RCT awaiting assessment reported incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and survival rate in 260 patients with liver cirrhosis, but only 37 patients of them were HBsAg positive and no data of the outcomes were reported in this group of patients (Oka 1995a). This trial is listed in 'Studies awaiting assessment' until more data become available from the authors. Risk of bias in included studies Of the nine included RCTs, one was assessed as high quality (a Jadadscore of three for [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025)) and the remaining as low quality (a to be adequate in one trial ( [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025)). Only two of the nine doubleblind design ( [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025); [Yang 1986](#CD001940-bbs2-0026)), and seven gave no information on how the allocation sequence was generated. We decided that an insufficient number of trials were found to perform meaningful sensitivity analysis excluding studies with inadequate concealment of allocation. None of the trials reported a sample size calculation. Four RCTs reported they used an intentiontotreat analysis to evaluate their data. Among the 23 randomised trials with a followup of less than three months, one was quasirandomised. Only two were doubleblind and reported adequate Applying the Jadadscore, three RCTs were assessed as high quality trials (a score of five for [Hirayama 1989](#CD001940-bbs2-0006), and a score of three for [Chen 1990](#CD001940-bbs2-0002) and [Wang 1995b](#CD001940-bbs2-0020)) and the rest as low quality trials (a score of one). Effects of interventions MORTALITY No mortality data were reported. HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA No data on hepatocellular carcinoma were reported. ANTIVIRAL RESPONSE Phyllanthus herb Phyllanthus amarus (a single herb) showed a significantly better effect on clearance of serum HBeAg (RR 3.35, 95% CI 1.49 to 7.56) ( [Analysis 1.2](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00102/)) compared to nonspecific drugs (vitamin plus hypoxanthosine plus orazamide), but did not show a significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg at three months followup after the end of treatment. A compound in which Phyllanthus herb was the principal drug showed no significant difference compared to gammaIFN (5 mega unit/two days, for three months) on clearance of serum herb Polyporus) was tested in two trials in the same dosage and treatment duration. Compared to placebo, Polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide showed a positive effect on clearance of serum HBeAg (RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.29) ( [Analysis 1.2](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00102/)), but did not show a significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg ( [Analysis 1.1](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00101/)). Compared plus hypoxanthosine), Polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide showed positive effects liquorice root plus cysteine and glycine) showed no significant effect on viral response compared to nonspecific treatment (potassium magnesium aspartate treatment (hypoxanthosine plus vitamin), Fuzheng Jiedu Tang (a compound of herbs) showed significant antiviral activity (RR 5.19, 95% CI 1.24 to 21.79) for clearance of serum 0101); RR and RR 8.50, of serum HBV ( [Analysis 1.4](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00104/)). Kangdu Wan Compared to placebo, Kangdu Wan (a compound of herbs) was not effective in terms of clearance of serum HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA at three months Salviae miltiorrhizae (extract from herb Salvia miltiorrhiza) showed no significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA significant effects on clearance of serum HBeAg and HBV reported in four trials, a 'worstcase scenario' analysis for these outcomes including all patients losttofollowup as treatment failure direction. Kurorinone, Potenlini, and Anisodamine plus Salviae miltiorrhizae showed no significant effects on clearance of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA. A 'worstworst case' scenario showed no effect from these herbs (P=0.08). Medicinal herbs plus IFN versus IFN alone Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN versus IFN alone were compared in eight trials, all with a followup of less than three months. The average dosage of IFN in both arms was 1.84 mega unit/day, and the median duration of treatment was four months. Eight trials (n=628 patients) reported the clearance of serum HBeAg, six (n=466) the clearance of serum HBsAg, and six (n=524) the clearance of serum HBV DNA. Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN showed a significantly better effect than IFN alone on clearance of serum HBeAg (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.51), HBsAg (random effects model RR 2.61, 95%CI 1.10 to 6.21), and HBV DNA (RR 1.90, 95% 3.1](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00301/), [Analysis seroconversion from HBeAg to HBeAb (two trials, n=144, random effects model RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.80). Duration of followup RCTs with less than three months followup after the end of treatment were included in analyses to examine how their findings compared with those from trials that reported a minimum of three months followup after the end of intervention. Most data were available on clearance of serum HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA. Because of the huge heterogeneity, this comparison was limited to trials comparing Chinese medicinal herbs versus placebo or nonspecific treatment (excluding trials comparing herbs versus IFN). The effect size was almost the same comparing the results of trials with shorter followup with the results of trials patients assessed biochemical response. Only serum ALT normalisation data were available for analysis. In trials with over three months followup, the combined result of Chinese medicinal herbs was better than placebo or nonspecific drugs in reducing elevated serum ALT to normal (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.75) ( [Analysis 1.5](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00105/)). Individually, Anisodamine plus Salvia miltiorrhiza was better than nonspecific treatment in normalising ALT (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.62) ( [Analysis 1.5](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00105/)). Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN showed a better effect of the combination than of IFN treatment alone (for ALT normalisation: n=204, RR 1.66, 95% RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.78) in trials with followup 3.5](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00305/), [Analysis 3.6](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00306/), [Analysis 3.7](/pmc/articles/PMC7017971/figure/CD001940-fig-00307/)). less than three months followup (n=606) showed a similar effect on ALT normalisation (random effects model RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.22 to described liver histological improvement in six patients among 40 using Polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide treatment, but it did not report the result from the control group. Another trial ( [Zhang 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0029)), with followup of less than three months, reported outcome of liver histopathology in both the experimental group (20 patients) and control group (18 patients) after three months treatment with glycyrrhisin. They found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in grading of pathological changes (WMD 0.55, 95%CI 1.29 to 0.19, P=0.15). SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS Only three of the nine included trials reported improvement of patients' symptoms and signs. One trial ( [Yan 1988](#CD001940-bbs2-0025)) reported 20/22 patients with improvement in Polyporus umbellatus polysaccharide treatment group, and 8/19 in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference (Chisquare=9.07, P=0.002). The other trial ( [Yang 1986](#CD001940-bbs2-0026)) reported improvement of fatigue in 13/16 in Kangdu Wan treatment group, and in 1/11 in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference (Chisquare=10.19, P=0.01). Similarly, nine patients out of nine with abdominal distention improved in the Kangdu Wan group compared to two of eight in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference (Chisquare=8.39, P=0.001) ( [Yang 1986](#CD001940-bbs2-0026)). Eighty per cent of patients treated with Yigan No. 3 granule was reported to have disappearance or improvement of symptoms, but no data were reported in control arm of IFN treatment ( [Zheng 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0031)). QUALITY OF LIFE No trials evaluated quality of life. ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse events were reported in eight trials. These reports, however, did not indicate whether the effects were ascertained through standardised monitoring or voluntary selfreport. One trial described an occurrence of ascites and lower limb edema in one case with earlystage liver cirrhosis during treatment with Potenlini ( umbellatus polysaccharide injection developed enlarged groin lymph nodes after one week of treatment and persisted for one more week ( [Wang 1994a](#CD001940-bbs2-0018)). A few patients were found to have symptoms of dry throat from the herbal compound formula Kang Du Wan ( [Yang 1986](#CD001940-bbs2-0026)), and thirst and rapid and Salviae miltiorrhizae ( [Zhang 1993a](#CD001940-bbs2-0028)). No serious adverse events were reported. FUNNEL PLOT The outcome measure loss of serum HBeAg in the nine included trials was used for a funnel plot analysis. A linear regression analysis, in which the standard normal deviate, defined as the RR divided by its standard error, was regressed against the estimate's precision, defined as the inverse of the standard error, showed a significant funnel plot asymmetry (intercept 3.37, standard error 1.40; t=2.40; P=0.047). Discussion The present systematic review suggests that some Chinese medicinal herbs may have positive effects on the clearance of HBV markers and on normalisation of liver biochemistry in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, at present there is no strong evidence to recommend any of these medicinal herbs for treatment of chronic hepatitis B due to the significant funnel plot asymmetry as well as the general low methodological quality of the trials. However, it seems that Fuzheng Jiedu Tang (a compound of more than 10 herbs such as raw Astragalus membranaceus, Phyllanthus amarus works of serum HBeAg. The antiviral effect of Phyllanthus compound and kurorinone appears to be the same as IFN in terms of clearance of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA. These positive effects are supported by eight RCTs with less than three months of followup after the end of the interventions examining the combination of Chinese medicinal herbs plus IFN versus IFN alone. These findings must be interpreted conservatively due to the following facts: Methodological quality The majority of the RCTs included in this review had poor methodological quality. They provided only limited descriptions of study design, randomisation, and allocation concealment. Most trials state only that random assignment was used, but do not give sufficient information to allow a judgment of whether or not it was conducted properly. Methodologically less rigorous trials show larger differences between experimental and control groups than do those conducted with better rigor ( [Schulz 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0103); [Moher 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0101); [Kjaergard 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0096)). The insufficient number of trials prohibited us from performing meaningful sensitivity analysis to illuminate how robust the results of the review are to the exclusion of the trials with inadequate methodology. No multicentre, large scale RCTs were identified. Funnel plot asymmetry An asymmetry in a funnel plot can originate from several sources such as publication bias, location bias, heterogeneity of trials, chance, and poor methodological design of small trials ( [Egger 1997](#CD001940-bbs2-0087)). As our literature searches covered both electronic databases and handsearches, English language and any other languages, published and unpublished studies, location bias is not considered as a likely explanation of the funnel plot asymmetry in this review. Vickers and colleagues ( [Vickers 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0107)) found that some countries including China publish unusually high proportions of positive results; publication bias being a possible explanation. All of the included trials in this review were conducted in China and eight out of the nine trials were published in Chinese (the remaining one in English). The presence of publication bias might explain the funnel plot asymmetry. Although we undertook extensive searches for unpublished material, few trials of the identified qualified for inclusion, but at the same time we cannot disregard the fact that trials with negative findings remain unpublished. Secondly, the heterogeneity of medicinal herbs and control interventions may contribute to the asymmetry. Thirdly, the general low methodological quality of the trials and small trials may also contribute to the asymmetry. 'Worstcase' scenario From reports of four trials on losstofollowup patients, the effect size of Anisodamine plus Salviae miltiorrhizae, Fuzheng Jiedu Tang, kurorinone, and Potenlini did not change significantly by counting those lost as treatment failure. But a 'worstworst case' scenario, performed by counting those lost in the treatment group as treatment failures and those in the control group as responders, made the beneficial effect disappear. Five trials used nonspecific treatment as control intervention. A search of the Cochrane Library and PubMed did not provide any evidence on efficacy of these nonspecific drugs for chronic hepatitis B. On the other hand, we are not able to exclude the possibility that these nonspecific drugs may have had a negative effect on the course of the HBV infection. This could lead to an inflated positive effect of Chinese medicinal herbs. However, Chinese medicinal herbs versus placebo showed similar effects as Chinese medicinal herbs versus nonspecific interventions. Surrogate outcomes The longterm goal of treatment for chronic hepatitis B is to prevent progression to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma and ultimately to prolong survival. Available outcomes from the included trials are mainly laboratory tests, i.e., surrogate outcomes. There is lack of data from RCTs on clinically relevant outcomes from longterm followup such as mortality, incidence of liver cirrhosis or cancer and, therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions about these important outcomes. Liver biopsy diagnosis Only three trials had the clinical diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B confirmed by liver biopsy. Therefore, we were unable to obtain direct evidence on effects of the Chinese medicinal herbs on liver pathology. Nevertheless, Chinese medicinal herbs have been used for treating chronic liver diseases for more than 2000 years and are still being widely used for chronic hepatitis B in China. It is estimated that more than 300 Chinese herbal medicines have been officially registered and approved for use in treatment of viral hepatitis in China during the past two decades ( [CMH 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0085)). Every year there are at least dozens of clinical trials testing Chinese medicinal herbs for viral hepatitis published in Chinese medical literature and most of them reported a positive effect ( [Liu 1998](#CD001940-bbs2-0097)). In this review some Chinese medicinal herbs seem to have an effect on antiviral activity and decrease hepatic inflammatory activity. Two double blind RCTs demonstrate an effect of Chinese medicinal herbs on improvement of symptoms and signs. The suggested benefit of some Chinese medicinal herbs combined with IFN for treatment of hepatitis B should also encourage further trials to verify this efficacy. As IFN treatment even in combination with nucleoside analogues is unsatisfactory, the longterm therapy for persistent HBV infections leads to the risk of cumulative toxicity and development of viral resistence. Therefore, it is necessary to explore which drug combinations or sequences of drug combinations are likely to be most useful ( [Fontana 1997](#CD001940-bbs2-0089); [Shaw 2000](#CD001940-bbs2-0104)). The combination of 'western' conventional therapy with 'eastern' classical herbal therapy may reveal itself as an attractive option. A definite conclusion on adverse events associated with Chinese medicinal herbs cannot be drawn from this review due to the limited number of trials identified, the limited duration of treatment and followup, and inadequate recording and reporting of adverse events. In China, only about 50% of clinical trials of Chinese medicinal herbs report adverse effects, and the reason for the insufficient report is possibly that Chinese practitioners perceive Chinese medicinal herbs as free of side effects ( [Liu 1999b](#CD001940-bbs2-0099)). However, there are reports of liver toxicity and other serious adverse events associated with using Chinese herbal (Xiao Chai Hu Tang), a widely used Chinese herbal compound for chronic liver diseases, was found to be associated with interstitial pneumonitis when used either alone or combined with IFN in Japan ( [Ishizaki 1996](#CD001940-bbs2-0094)). For this reason, Shosaikoto is no longer allowed to be used in Japan ( [Hirayama 2000](#CD001940-bbs2-0092)). Safety of complementary medicines needs to be monitored ( [Vautier 1995](#CD001940-bbs2-0106)). In clinical trials efficacy and safety should receive equal attention and occasional and severe adverse events identified from large scale epidemiological studies need to be investigated. Authors' conclusions Based on this systematic review, it appears that some Chinese medicinal herbs may have positive effects on viral activity and liver biochemistry in chronic hepatitis B. However, due to the low methodological quality of the RCTs and the risk of publication bias, there is no strong evidence for treating chronic hepatitis B with Chinese medicinal herbs. The methodological quality of clinical trials of treatment with Chinese medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis B needs to be improved ( [Liu 1999](#CD001940-bbs2-0098)). The following aspects should be attended: (i) detailed reporting of the generation of allocation sequence and the allocation concealment; (ii) application of blinding and placebo control; (iii) clear description of withdrawal/dropout during the trial; (iv) reporting of clinically important outcome measures from longterm followup. Rigorously designed, multicentre, large scale RCTs are required to evaluate Chinese medicinal herbs versus placebo. From the results of this systematic review it seems worthwhile to evaluate these interventions in patients treated with IFN, and possibly with nucleoside analogues like lamivudine. The outcome measures should include virological and biochemical outcomes as well as liver pathology, such as hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, quality of life, and mortality. Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardised monitoring or an effective selfreport system. Attention should also be paid to longterm adverse events of Chinese medicinal herbs.
