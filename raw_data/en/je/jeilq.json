India was at the third position with 8,364,086 confirmed cases and 1,24,315 deaths due to COVID-19 along with 7,764,763 cases of recovery. According to media reports, 239 scientists from 32 countries have written a letter to the World Health Organization for revising the guidelines of coronavirus considering the stay of this virus in the air. Different systems of medicines are currently practiced or under trials to combat this pandemic. It includes allopathic, ayurveda, traditional herbal medicines (Chinese, Persian, etc.). The world is still in search of a potentially effective vaccination against Covid. Many people rely upon plant-based (herbal) medicines to manage their healthcare issues. There are hundreds of plant species and their different parts that have been suggested to be of medicinal importance. More than one thousand species are purposed as anticancer agent. Similarly, there are hundreds of antidiabetic plant species. Although humankind has plenty of traditional plant-based medicinal preparations to choose from, scientific validation is needed. A few species have been declared as immune modulators and antivirals. The role of any of these species in the treatment of COVID-19 has yet to be established. "}
