Cleveland Clinic Community Care is our platform for transforming primary care and addressing the physical, social and emotional aspects of care. Community Care physicians are part of teams that include advanced practice providers, nurses, medical assistants, behavioral health social workers, pharmacists, care coordinators and navigators. Specialists work with these teams to integrate specialty care into the patient journey.TRANSFORM CAREWHO WE ARE 7 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020We will continue to treat our fellow caregivers as family. Providing the best care requires a workforce that combines exceptional skills with unwavering empathy. Our organization's future depends on our ability to attract, engage and develop outstanding caregivers. The new Caregiver Office is committed to fostering peak caregiver engagement and preventing burnout.ENGAGE CAREGIVERS We will double the number of lives we touch by 2024. Cleveland Clinic will continue to grow to serve more patients in more ways and more places. In 2020 we added new locations, renovated facilities in Ohio and Florida, and continued construction of Cleveland Clinic London.EXPAND REACH We will be at the forefront of digital care. Digital technology will make care smarter, more affordable and more accessible. We are enhancing the electronic health record. We will understand our patients better through use of customer relationship management tools and increased adoption of augmented intelligence and predictive analytics. Our continuing expansion of virtual visits will provide convenience and access for more patients.EMBRACE DIGITAL We will build a sustainable model for growth, reducing the cost of care. We are finding new value by building a sustainable model of efficient care. This involves establishing metrics for efficiency in all areas. By analyzing buildings and their footprints, we are making the best use of clinical areas and administrative space. The result: increased reinvestment in our organization and communities. OPTIMIZE RESOURCES CLEVELAND CLINIC 8Care for Patients Care for patients as if they are your family. 9 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020VISION : Become the best place for care, anywhere. Our job is to take care of patients. We are known for exceptional care delivered by multidisciplinary teams. We challenge ourselves to get better every day. Our goals are to touch more lives, relieve suffering and give every patient the best outcome and experience. PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY PROGRESS IN SAFETY EVENTS The serious safety event rate measures how many potentially harmful events occur in relation to the number of patients we serve. This rate allows us to monitor progress toward our goal of being the safest place to receive care. By empowering and expecting caregivers to speak up when safety is at risk, we made progress on reducing harm in 2020. SUCCESS IN PATIENT SURVIVAL The mortality ratio is a key measure of patient survival. It reflects the actual number of patient deaths versus the number of deaths expected based on the severity of illness. Cleveland Clinic continued to be a top-performing health system on this measure in 2020. Patients at our hospitals have a greater chance of survival than predicted based on national benchmarks.SERIOUS SAFETY EVENT RATE (PER 10,000 PATIENT DAYS) MORTALITY RATIO, OBSERVED TO EXPECTED2019 YEAR-END 2020 YEAR-END0.270.34 2019 YEAR-END 2020 YEAR-END0.67 0.69 CLEVELAND CLINIC 10READMISSIONS REMAIN A FOCUS Despite a sicker patient population in 2020, our readmission rate remained consistent with prior years. Even so, the number of patients who return to our hospitals soon after discharge continues to be a challenge. We are working to reduce preventable readmissions by enhancing care coordination and adopting new approaches in home care and virtual follow-up appointments. READMISSIONS 2019 YEAR-END 2020 YEAR-END PATIENT EXPERIENCE What is most important to a patient's experience? Surveys reveal the answer: \"Did you care about me as a human being?\" Patient experience improves when caregivers more deeply appreciate patients as individuals. In 2020, the Office of Patient Experience developed a new way to promote connections between patients and caregivers. Called \"Care to Share,\" the evidence-based intervention includes a display board near the hospital bed that the care team and patient fill in with details about the patient as a person. 76% of hospitalized patients across the enterprise said they would \"definitely recommend\" Cleveland Clinic13.0%13.4% 11 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020EXTERNAL VALIDATION BY INDEPENDENT RATINGS Cleveland Clinic is regularly assessed by outside organizations. In 2020, our hospitals continued to be highly ranked in national ratings by third-party groups. Cleveland Clinic was named the No. 2 U.S. hospital in U.S. News & World Report's 2020- 21 \"Best Hospitals\" rankings. We are No. 1 in cardiology and heart surgery for the 26th straight year and rank among the top 10 hospitals in 13 specialties. Cleveland Clinic Children's earned national recognition in 10 of 10 ranked specialties. Four Cleveland Clinic hospitals rank among the top seven in Ohio: main campus (No . 1), Hillcrest (No. 4), Fairview (No. 5) and Akron General (No. 7). Cleveland Clinic Weston tied as No. 1 in the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale metro area and as No. 5 in Florida. Indian River Medical Center and Martin Health were named top hospitals in Florida. Several Cleveland Clinic hospitals have earned Magnet\u00ae designation from the American Nurses Credentialing Center: Akron General, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, Fairview, Hillcrest, main campus and South Pointe. This reflects the quality of our nursing programs , as fewer than 10% of U.S. hospitals have achieved Magnet status. The Leapfrog Group issues grades for patient safety performance and practices. The grades combine data from a voluntary self-reported survey and publicly reported metrics. In spring 2020, 12 of our U.S. hospitals received an A grade , and five earned a B. In fall 2020, 10 of our hospitals earned an A, five earned a B and two received a C. Vizient ranks U.S. hospitals on quality and value metrics.

Their research activity remained robust in 2020 despite the pandemic. Cleveland Clinic received $312 million in research funding last year. The funds support 2,781 active research projects like those profiled below. Gene Variant for Aggressive Prostate Metastasis Identified Treatment for prostate cancer is becoming more personalized, thanks to a discovery led by Lerner Research Institute investigators. They found that a specific testosterone-related genetic variant is associated with faster cancer growth and shorter survival in men with metastatic disease. Testing for this gene variant may help identify patients most likely to benefit from more aggressive treatment. (Published in JAMA Oncology)Using Nanoparticles to Halt Cancer Metastasis in Bone A combination therapy regimen that includes nanoparticles loaded with a potent cancer drug can stop cancer bone metastasis in its tracks. So found a preclinical study from the Department of Biomedical Engineering in Lerner Research Institute. The combination therapy, delivered intravenously, could quickly translate into hope for many patients living with advanced-stage cancers. (Published in Biomaterials ) A new biorepository is under construction on Cleveland Clinic's main campus. The two-story building will house laboratory facilities and 400 freezers. It will double our capacity to store and analyze biological samples in support of targeted therapeutics development. BIGGER AND BETTER BIOREPOSITORY CLEVELAND CLINIC 14INNOVATION Innovation to improve patient care has been in Cleveland Clinic's DNA since our founding 100 years ago. Our caregivers continued to make breakthroughs in 2020, including the examples here. 3D-Printed Custom Airway Stent A unique 3D-printed airway stent designed at Cleveland Clinic was introduced for clinical use in 2020 after receiving regulatory clearance in late 2019. The customizable device provides a more precise anatomic fit for patients with breathing disorders needing airway support. The stents are made using computed tomography scans and proprietary 3D visualization software. First Postapproval Use of Tumor Ablation Technology Cleveland Clinic surgeons were the first in the world to use a recently approved ablation technology designed to destroy large liver tumors. The minimally invasive procedure uses a needle, connected to a powerful microwave generator, to burn malignant tumors as large as an egg. Record-Breaking Transplant Programs In 2020, Cleveland Clinic became the first U.S. hospital to surpass 2,000 cumulative transplants in both heart and lung transplantation. Our transplant teams perform 50 to 60 heart transplants and more than 100 lung transplants nearly every year. This steady experience enables them to deliver patient survival rates that consistently exceed national averages. 15 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020EDUCATION Our Education Institute prepares the caregivers of today and tomorrow through a range of offerings to shape practice and promote health. In 2020, the Lerner College of Medicine graduated its 12th class and welcomed 32 new students. Our Health Education Campus saw its second year of interdisciplinary education in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University. Over 450 new residents and fellows from 38 countries joined our graduate medical education program. Our Center for Continuing Education offers more continuing medical education activities and engages more participants than any other academic medical center ranked by U.S. News & World Report. 14896%1,952 trainees hiredboard pass ratetotal residents and fellows CLEVELAND CLINIC 16CATALYST GRANTS Our caregivers' brightest ideas for transforming patient care are funded by Catalyst Grants supported by donations of all sizes. One such grant funded an idea to help parents bond with their newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Parents record themselves reading and singing to their baby, and the recordings are played for the newborn when the parents cannot be there. The result: enhanced parent-child communication in the first weeks of life.PHILANTHROPY Cleveland Clinic strives to be the most deserving place for healthcare philanthropy. $216 million >$3million raised by VeloSano in 2020in total commitments in 2020In an unprecedented year, donors continued their compassionate \u2014 and passionate \u2014 support of Cleveland Clinic, with 100% of every gift going toward our mission.

LARGEST EMPLOYER IN OHIO Cleveland Clinic continues to be Ohio's largest employer, with 52,825 employed caregivers in the state. Since 1924, our number of employed caregivers has doubled every 15 years. It now includes individuals at locations worldwide. 19 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020ENGAGEMENT PULSE SURVEY We take the pulse of our caregivers' engagement through an annual survey. In 2020 we achieved our highest engagement percentile to date. Our caregivers rate Cleveland Clinic for safe, highly reliable care at levels among the highest in all of healthcare.85% of caregivers would recommend Cleveland Clinic as a place to workCAREGIVER OFFICE FORMED The Office of Caregiver Experience was established in 2018 to promote the emotional, physical, spiritual and social well-being of all who work for Cleveland Clinic. In 2020, we expanded support for caregivers by forming the new Caregiver Office and appointing our first Chief Caregiver Officer. The office and position aim to foster caregiver engagement and enhance our culture of working as a team of teams. CLEVELAND CLINIC 20DIVERSITY & INCLUSION LEADERSHIP DIVERSITY Cleveland Clinic is acting on our declared commitment to having a leadership that reflects the teams it leads. This means recruiting for diversity. It also means creating sustainable pipelines to attract candidates from diverse backgrounds and cultivating an environment to develop, retain and advance them.Diversity is our strength. It helps us deliver better care. Respect for patients and each other makes Cleveland Clinic an inclusive place to work. We recognize that racial disparities harm the health of individuals and communities. We will continue our efforts to end structural racism in healthcare and build a workforce as diverse as the communities we serve. LIFT EVERY VOICE In 2020, we launched a series of \"Lift Every Voice\" forums to give caregivers a platform to discuss the impact of racism and bias. More than 3,400 caregivers participated in 95 of these virtual forums. Ideas from the forums led to the formation of an Inclusion and Racial Equity Executive Council that will recommend diversity and inclusion priorities for our organization.75% of caregivers are female of caregivers are minorities27% 21 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020PATHWAY FOR FUTURE LEADERS Last year saw the development of the Mandel Global Leadership and Learning Pathway, a training initiative for cultivating future Cleveland Clinic leaders. The pathway is designed to further develop caregivers with the greatest potential for leadership. Its curriculum will immerse these individuals in training to ser ve the next generation of patients and caregivers. The pathway is an initiative of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Global Leadership and Learning Institute and is funded by a grant from the Mandel Foundation.

A key part of caring for our organization is keeping it healthy to grow and touch more lives. We will continue our progress toward our goal to double the patients we serve by 2024. Increasing our ability to touch more lives requires sufficient resources. This means reinvesting in the patient care, research and education that has been our mission since 1921. FINANCIALSLIVES TOUCHED $10.6 billion operating visits department visitsadmissions and observations CLEVELAND CLINIC 24DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE In 2020 Cleveland Clinic served more patients virtually than ever before, with virtual visits increasing approximately 25-fold from 2019. Expanding our ability to offer virtual appointments allows us to meet patients where they are and help them when they need us most. As a result, more patients can benefit from the time, travel and inconvenience saved by virtual visits. CYBERSECURITY Cyberattacks can be crippling to health systems. One malicious computer hack can bring a large medical system to a halt, jeopardizing the care and privacy of countless patients. A number of U.S. hospitals had their operations shut down in ransomware attacks in 2020. The heightened threat prompted the federal government to issue an unprecedented cyberattack warning to healthcare organizations. We are entrusted by our patients to maintain the confidentiality of their medical information. For years, Cleveland Clinic has invested in cybersecurity tools to secure information, keep our systems resilient and withstand evolving cyberattacks. We recognize the need for continued vigilance against cyber threats to preserve our ability to fulfill our mission.1.2M virtual visits 2019 YEAR-END 2020 YEAR-END46,5001,200,000 25 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020GROWTH TORONTO Cleveland Clinic Canada's unique Medical Director Program partners with businesses to improve employee health and safety.

The agreement will add Mercy's 2,700 caregivers to the Cleveland Clinic family. LAS VEGAS The Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health continues to be a national leader in research and care of the aging brain. In 2020 it received a three-year, $3.3 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to establish the Nevada exploratory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The center will focus on reducing disparities in dementia care in rural settings. CLEVELAND CLINIC 26GROWTH FLORIDA Cleveland Clinic Weston performed its 1,000th organ transplant in 2020. It now has the fastest-growing transplant program in the state. A new cardiac electrophysiology lab was opened at Cleveland Clinic Martin Health, expanding the heart conditions it can manage. In September, Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital completed implementation of electronic health record capabilities to enhance integration of patient care. The year also saw Cleveland Clinic Florida establish a strategic alliance with L ee Health, a not-for-profi t public health system that operates four acute care and two specialty hospitals in Southwest Florida. The goal is to explore collaborative opportunities to strengthen patient care on Florida's west coast. 27 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020ABU DHABI Patients served at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi increased by 20% in 2020 over the prior year. The facility also expanded cancer services in preparation for the 2022 opening of its dedicated oncology building. This included the launch of a comprehensive Breast Health Clinic, which offers targeted diagnostic testing, genetic counseling, innovative therapies, and access to breast health and reconstruction specialists in one location. LONDON Construction of Cleveland Clinic London progressed despite a pause for several months due to the global pandemic. An outpatient location with an imaging suite and various specialty services is scheduled to open in September 2021. The 184-bed hospital is due to open in January 2022. In preparation, the Cleveland Clinic London team continued to welcome new caregivers in 2020.GROWTH CLEVELAND CLINIC 28Care for the Community We are committed to the communities we serve. 29 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020VISION : Treat our neighbors as family and our communities as home. Our goal is to help create the healthiest communities for everyone. We do this through actions and programs to heal, hire and invest for the future. Opioid addiction - We have new programs underway to address opioid addiction. An opioid management dashboard was created in the electronic health record to help primary care providers manage patients who have long-term opioid prescriptions. Cleveland Clinic Akron General expanded its Centering P regnancy prenatal care program to help pregnant women with substance use disorders achieve recovery and better health outcomes for themselves and their babies. HEAL Mental health - Mental health is a silent crisis for many in the communities we serve. In response, we are building on our offerings as the largest provider of mental health services in Ohio through expanded caregiver training. Cleveland Clinic Akron General announced plans to launch a psychiatry residency program in July 2021. The program will double the number of trained psychiatrists graduating in the Akron area each year. At Lakewood Family Health Center, our Center for LGBTQ+ Care expanded its offerings as a national leader in behavioral healthcare for adolescents and adults with needs specific to sexual identity. 258mental health inpatient beds CLEVELAND CLINIC 30HIRE INVEST Food security - Eleven percent of Americans have limited or uncertain access to nutritionally adequate food. This impacts rates of diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and other diseases. To promote healthy eating in our community, Cleveland Clinic is exploring ways to make fresh food more available in neighborhoods around our main campus.Broadband internet - Internet access is increasingly essential to employment, education and social connectedness. Yet countless households lack reliable broadband connections. To narrow this digital divide, Cleveland Clinic joined with local businesses and a nonprofit to provide affordable high-speed internet to residents of Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood. The assistance includes equipment installation and subsidies for subscription fees.Diverse hiring - Cleveland Clinic creates rewarding jobs that broaden opportunities for people from all communities and at all skill levels. In 2020, we joined OneTen, a coalition of 37 large U.S. employers formed to train, hire and promote 1 million Black Americans into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement. The coalition pledged to achieve this goal in 10 years.Local hiring - As part of the Cuyahoga County Workforce Funders Group, Cleveland Clinic is working to develop a deep pool of skilled labor for the healthcare sector and create opportunities for local residents. This involves collaborating with other local healthcare providers to expand our workforce development program, partner with community training programs and provide early exposure to healthcare careers. 31 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020CLEVELAND CLINIC POLICE The Cleveland Clinic Police Department is Ohio's seventh-largest police force. Its officers protect the safety of patients, visitors and caregivers 24/7. In 2020, the department continued to recruit diverse officers who reflect the community. All officers receive training in diversity, inclusion and unconscious bias. For the fourth straight year, the department was named one of the nation's top three security programs in healthcare in Security Magazine's \"Security 500 Report.\" $1.16 BILLION COMMUNITY BENEFIT Community benefit is the value of programs and services we provide to meet community needs. It ranges from charity care to education, medical research and community health initiatives. In 2019 (the most recent year reported), Cleveland Clinic's community benefit reached the highest level reported to date: $1.16 billion. Cleveland Clinic came together with businesses and community partners to donate Thanksgiving meals to 2,000 neighbors in the Fairfax and Hough communities surrounding our main campus. PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University were honored to have the opportunity to host the first presidential debate of the 2020 general election. It was held in the Sheila and Eric Samson Pavilion at the Health Education Campus on our main campus. Cleveland Clinic also served as Health Security Advisor to the Commission on Presidential Debates throughout the 2020 general election. CLEVELAND CLINIC 32COVID-19 Protecting our patients and caregivers while fulfilling our mission. 33 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 20202,439 13,104 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for COVID-19patients served for COVID-19LIVES TOUCHED IN OHIO & FLORIDA PREPARATIONS TO PRESERVE CARE Our first COVID-19 patients were cared for at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, which shared valuable lessons with the rest of our system on safe caregiving during the pandemic. In Ohio, we converted our Health Education Campus building to the 1,000-bed Hope Hospital to be ready for a surge of patients when the pandemic's course was most uncertain. Caregivers were redeployed to meet the most pressing care needs. Virtual visits skyrocketed, and our Las Vegas and Canada locations temporarily converted to all-virtual appointments.COVID-19 : CARE FOR PATIENTSThe pandemic tested Cleveland Clinic more than anything else in our organization's modern history. Our caregivers selflessly met the test at every turn. We stood together to keep our patients and each other safe while fulfilling our mission. We looked after our communities and accelerated innovations in response to new challenges. We will emerge stronger and more resilient. 81% ICU survival rate among COVID-19 patients, better than the U.S. benchmark CLEVELAND CLINIC 3434>100K >570K N95 masks reprocessed patients tested for COVID-19 SUPPLY CHAIN & PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Early in the pandemic, supply chain and operations managers swiftly identified additional suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE), solicited donated items and developed homemade options. Working with industry, our researchers validated a process to sterilize N95 masks, allowing multiple reuses. These and other efforts avoided PPE shortages and allowed caregivers to take care of all our patients safely. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Fast, reliable tests curb the pandemic's spread. Cleveland Clinic was one of the first U.S. medical centers to offer COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute caregivers worked 24/7 to process tests, reaching a capacity to complete 5,000 daily by November. Standard results were available in 13 to 15 hours. The tests include a PCR-based assay developed at Cleveland Clinic that received emergency use authorization in August. 35 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020COVID-19 : RESEARCH & INNOVATION PREPARING FOR THE NEXT VIRAL THREAT In April, we established the Global Center for Pathogen Research & Human Health to accelerate discovery of treatments for future pandemics. Although planned before the current pandemic, the center was launched in time to address COVID-19. The center integrates investigations from Lerner Research Institute and the new Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center, which brings together top scientists in virology, immunology, genomics and population health. The latter center features a secure biosafety level 3 lab that allows handling of potentially deadly infectious agents such as the Zika and dengue viruses. 24 grants received for COVID-19 research, totaling $7.3 million >570 academic publications on COVID-19 SAFE STRATEGY FOR PRESERVING PPE Early in the pandemic, nurses frequently entered the rooms of COVID-19 patients in intensive care to closely monitor their intravenous pumps. This required fresh personal protective equipment (PPE) for each visit. Placing pumps in the hallways outside reduced PPE use, but the intravenous lines snaking across the floor posed a safety hazard. In response, nurses worked with Cleveland Clinic Innovations to develop the High-Line, a ceiling-mounted cradle that suspends lines overhead, out of harm's way. Problem solved, and PPE conserved. From the pandemic's earliest days, we worked to understand and combat it. We were one of the first organizations to create a registry and biobank specific to COVID-19. Our researchers developed COVID-19 risk prediction models and used artificial intelligence to identify existing drugs that might effectively treat the virus. We joined scores of national studies of proposed COVID-19 therapies, and initiated several studies of our own. CLEVELAND CLINIC 36COVID-19 : PHILANTHROPYVACCINATION BEGINS Vaccines are the most important public health measure we have to end the pandemic. As one of 10 \"pre-positioned\" vaccine sites in Ohio, Cleveland Clinic was among the earliest hospitals to administer the first vaccines for COVID-19. Following receipt of our first vaccines in mid-December, more than 10,000 frontline caregivers received their initial vaccination by year's end. Our guiding principle is to distribute COVID-19 vaccines safely, equitably and transparently, recognizing that the greatest need is to maintain patient care. The pandemic's challenges were matched by generous offers of support from the community. In response, we launched the COVID-19 Community Response Campaign to produce the greatest impact by encouraging specific types of donations. Priorities included donating to COVID-19 research, making face masks, contributing hygiene supplies, giving blood and donating meals to those caring for patients. Support poured in from individuals and businesses. We are deeply grateful to our donors and community partners.>10K $28 million frontline caregivers vaccinated in December 2020 raised to support COVID-19 research and caregiver programs 37 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020COVID-19 : CARE FOR CAREGIVERS KEEPING CAREGIVERS SAFE AND WHOLE As a family, we took proactive steps to keep each other safe and whole. We ensured sufficient personal protective equipment for safe caregiving and adopted universal pandemic precautions. As many U.S. healthcare workers faced employment disruption due to the pandemic, we chose to stand together as one organization and avoid layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts. For caregivers who could do their jobs at home, we provided flexible work-from-home options while preserving operations. >7,000 caregivers transitioned to working from home CLEVELAND CLINIC 38SUPPORT AT WORK We recognized caregivers for their resolve and selfl essness in the face of unprecedented stresses. Teams adopted daily \"hero huddles\" to celebrate caregivers for providing exceptional COVID -19 care. We established COVID-19 Heroes Awards for exemplary performance, drawing over 650 nominations. An online \"kudoboard\" was created to enable the community and colleagues to post expressions of thanks to caregivers. In our facilities, we set up comfort stations offering caregivers refreshments and a place to unwind. SUPPORT AT HOME Support for caregivers went beyond the workplace. We fi lled our communities with signs celebrating our caregivers as heroes. A 24-hour Caregiver Emotional Support Hotline was established, staffed by the Center for Behavioral Health. The Caregiver Hardship Fund was expanded, providing $3.6 million in support and 75,000 meals to more than 3,000 caregivers. We offered temporary housing to those involved in direct COVID-19 care who had at-risk household members. Caregiver support teams provided meals and other aid to many of the more than 6,500 caregivers infected with COVID-19 at some point in 2020. 39 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020VOLUNTEER CAREGIVING Caregivers' dedication and bravery extended beyond our communities. In April, teams of our physicians and nurses traveled to New York City and Detroit to help care for COVID-19 patients at overwhelmed hospitals. Others from our main campus flew to assist colleagues at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi when it was hit hardest by the pandemic. Abu Dhabi nurses returned the favor at year's end by coming to help at Hillcrest Hospital in Ohio. Cleveland Clinic London caregivers were among early volunteers to assist the U.K.'s National Health Service in its COVID-19 response. COVID-19 : CARE FOR THE ORGANIZATION FEDERAL FUNDING Hard work, shared sacrifice and careful expense cuts helped our organization ease the pandemic's economic impact while maintaining services. Also key was $388 million in federal CARES Act stimulus funding and $67 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for pandemic-related expenses. 68 volunteers traveled to New York, Detroit and Abu Dhabi to aid in COVID-19 care $388 million in CARES Act funding CLEVELAND CLINIC 40MEETING PANDEMIC-RELATED NEEDS When COVID-19-related health disparities became clear, we cared for our communities with extra attention to the most vulnerable. Cleveland Clinic partnered with community organizations to sponsor COVID-19 testing events. We shared over 400,000 donated personal protective equipment items with more than 120 organizations, including over 40 Ohio schools. We donated meals as well as cleaning and safety supplies to nearby neighborhoods whose residents have felt the pandemic's economic toll. COORDINATION & COLLABORATION Cleveland Clinic played critical roles in shaping responses to the pandemic at the local, state and national levels. In Northeast Ohio, we coordinated with other healthcare institutions to promote a unified message to the community urging practices to prevent virus spread. Our leaders worked closely with the governors and health departments in Ohio and Florida to monitor pandemic severity and guide planning. The Ohio Department of Health chose a Cleveland Clinic physician to lead the COVID-19 response in the northern third of the state. At the national level, we participated in a ventilator sharing program to lend these lifesaving machines to meet demand at U.S. hospitals facing severe patient surges.COVID-19 : CARE FOR THE COMMUNITY CEO and President Tom Mihaljevic, MD, spoke outside the White House at the launch of the ventilator sharing program. 41 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 2020HOME MONITORING PROGRAM To care for COVID-19 patients whose condition does not require hospitalization, we developed a home monitoring program that features a follow- up care plan available through our MyChart app. Patients use the app to get health information, report symptoms and contact caregivers when needed. The program helped thousands recover safely while preserving hospital capacity. PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION We took a national lead in promoting safe behaviors in public spaces. A prime example was our work to organize 123 U.S. health systems in the pandemic's largest national public health campaign, #MaskUp. It used creative tactics across social and traditional media to promote a simple message: Wear a mask and slow the spread of COVID-19.PROMOTING SAFE RETURN TO WORK As businesses reopened after pandemic shutdowns, Cleveland Clinic's AtWork program developed free resources to help them return their employees to work safely. Drawing on our growing understanding of COVID-19, we offered advice through a dedicated website for employers, a webinar series and industry-specifi c playbooks. 36K >150COVID-19 patients monitored at homeorganizations supported with return-to-work guidance LET'S KEEP IT UP .

In 1921, our founders were inspired by the teamwork of military medicine they experienced during World War I. The organization they built survived a disastrous fire and explosion in its earliest years. This year, we faced yet another monumental test, in the form of an unprecedented worldwide pandemic. As we celebrate our centennial year, we can take pride in upholding the spirit of our founders. We have met this historic challenge with the skill, resolve and compassion that made us one of the world's great medical centers. This achievement is a testament to the dedication of our caregivers. That dedication is a bright light guiding us into our next century. To learn more about our centennial, visit clevelandclinic.org/centennial . In 1922, this motherless girl with juvenile diabetes was the first child in Cleveland to receive the then-pioneering therapy of insulin. Temporarily adopted by several of her Cleveland Clinic nurses, she was one of the first patients touched by the combination of innovation and empathy that has come to define our organization. 43 STATE OF THE CLINIC | 20202020 Statistics CARE FOR PATIENTS Objectives Key Results 2019 Metric 2020 Goal 2020 Best Place to Receive Care AnywhereSerious Safety Events (#) 100 81 72 Serious Safety Events (rate) 0.34 N/A 0.27 Mortality, Observed to Expected (ratio) Recommend (% yes of Patients by 2024Unique Patients 2.40M 2.60M 2.45M RESEARCH AND EDUCATION Objectives Key Results 2019 Metric 2020 Goal 2020 Stay True to Our MissionExternal Research Funding $206M $213M $198M Board Pass Rate 96% 100% 96% Invention Disclosures 309 320 205 CARE FOR CAREGIVERS Objectives Key Results 2019 Metric 2020 Goal 2020 Best Place to Work in HealthcareWould Recommend as Place to Work 84% 90% 85% Regrettable Turnover 9.0% 8.3% 8.6% CARE FOR THE ORGANIZATION Objectives Key Results 2019 Metric 2020 Goal 2020 Care for the Organization As If It Were Our HomeOperating Revenue $10.56B (% on track) 95% 95% 95% Digital Transformation Virtual Visits 37,000 1.09M*** 1.14M CARE FOR THE COMMUNITY Objectives Key Results 2019 Metric 2020 Goal 2020 Care for Every Community We ServeCommunity Benefit (latest reported) $1.04B $1.1B $1.16B Opioid equivalents per encounter rate)29.7 33.1 28.9 *OKRs are objectives and key results, which set goals and measure progress toward their achievement.
