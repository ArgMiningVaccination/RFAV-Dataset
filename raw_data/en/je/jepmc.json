Surge in demand According to a [Mordor market intelligence report](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/canada-nutraceuticals-market), the Canadian nutraceuticals market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.62% from 2022-2027. Statistics Canada recently reported that vitamin and supplement sales in the country increased from some C$740mllion in the last quarter of 2019 to nearly C$800 million in the first quarter of 2020. The surge in demand for different supplements also led to an upsurge in demand for nutraceuticals in the Canadian market. The Mordor report also noted that, \"personal nutrition\" is a current trend of interest for consumers and that \"the biggest issue faced by nutraceutical companies operating in Canada is complying with the stringent health regulations in Canada. Unlike many countries throughout the world, Canada has very stringent regulations governing the sale of dietary supplements.\" Antioxidant curcuminoids The first license supports the well-known health benefits of antioxidant curcuminoids in Curcugen, a 50% concentrated, water-dispersible formula. Curcugen's of curcuminoids is natively other naturally-occurring turmeric constituents in a turmeric oleoresin matrix that provides proven bioavailability enhancement. The extract also is uniquely suitable for diverse applications across and has high palatability for easy flavoring. Curcugen turmeric extract has been the subject of three published clinical studies that support its beneficial actions in aiding in exercise recovery, promoting healthy digestion and mood, and relieving joint discomfort. It also is in an actively progressing clinical study investigating its effects on fatigue, cognitive performance, and mood. Results of that study are expected to lead DolCas Biotech to submit a request to Health Canada to expand the license to include a diversity of claims and doses. Digestive health Earlier this year, Curcugen was recognized as a food supplement in several European countries, allowing regulated use of the brand in its most common clinical dose of 500 mg/day. Ginfort, the market's highest-concentrated, 26% gingeroid compounds, including gingerols and shogoals. The innovation behind the potent bioactive stabilizes the volatile gingerols, to maintain the ratio between the bioactives over time. The powdered oleoresin base material provides a slow, sustained release of the gingeroids from its matrix, enhancing their solubility. Nausea and vomiting Ginfort's efficacy is backed by two clinical studies, one published to support and further qualify the traditional use claims in promoting digestive health; and the second (currently in review) for its ability to relieve menstrual discomfort in healthy, reproductive-age women. The Health Canada approved claims include: Ginfort help(s) prevent nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and/or seasickness while also allowing broader digestive support claims informed by traditional medicine use. The monograph for ginger permits the added claims language to parallel, and is traditionally used in herbal medicine to help relieve digestive upset/disturbances including lack of appetite, nausea, digestive spasms, indigestion, dyspepsia and flatulent colic (carminative).
