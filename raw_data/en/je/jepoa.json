Founder of the philosophy of Anthroposophy. It turns out of course to be a controversial line of research. I've dedicated only the last 5 hours to reading about such topics as biodynamic agriculture as they have been coming up in many of the organic and permaculture farms that we have visited, that is not to say all permaculture farms use biodynamic practices. BIODYNAMIC AGRICULTURE Biodynamics in short is a farming practice, said to have preceded Organic farming and often the terms are incorrectly used interchangeably. Biodynamics relies on several practices; biodynamic production of seeds, preparations for fields and composts, and a planting and harvesting calendar based on the position of the moon and its relative position within the star signs; each plant being aligned with Earth, Air, Fire or Water depending on whether the primary crop of that plant be Root, Flower, Fruit or Leaf. ASIDE: Before I go on I will say that the practice is labelled by many as pseudoscience, that being the foundations of the practice are based on spirituality and astrology (scientists don't like these as they can't be tested or proven and of course there are some risks in terms of education, and of course scaling) \u2014 Most studies show that there is a benefit of biodynamic farming compared to conventional farming, often quoting lower yields but that the results are similar to organic farms with better diversity, resilience and efficiency of energy in vs energy out. The critics say this is all due to the organic practices of crop rotation (no annuals for more than 2 years), diversification, no chemicals therefore more biomass, no till, no bare land, and so on rather than specific evidence of planting calendars and herbal preparations driving those improvements. Biodynamic philosophy also suggests that 10% of land should be used to preserve biodiversity through forests, wetlands, insectaries or [riparian corridors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_zone). Founded in 1924 by German intellectual Rudolf Steiner, biodynamic agriculture is an interesting area of research especially when presented with it as a practical and functioning method of organic farming by at least 3 or 4 local "}
