Prior to the pandemic of COVID-19 which started in March 2020, there was a well-established understanding about the structure and pathogenesis of previously known Coronaviruses from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. In addition to this, vaccines for various Coronaviruses were available for veterinary use. This knowledge supported the creation of various vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2. Before COVID-19 there are no reports of a vaccine being developed in under a year and no vaccine for preventing coronavirus infection in humans had ever been developed. Approximately nine different technologies are being researched and developed at various levels in order to design an effective COVID-19 vaccine. As the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for generating substantial adaptive immune response, mostly all the vaccine candidates have been targeting the whole spike protein or epitopes of spike protein as a vaccine candidate. In this review, we have compiled the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and followed by the mechanism of action of various vaccine platforms such as mRNA vaccines, Adenoviral vectored vaccine, inactivated virus vaccines and subunit vaccines in the market. In the end we have also summarized the various adjuvants used in the COVID-19 vaccine formulation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-06-21", "cleaned_text": "Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines [https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10071464](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10071464) [Emerging Issues [1](#B1-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations were developed with the goal of preventing symptomatic and severe sickness [ [2](#B2-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The first successful sequencing of the genetic data for the betacoronavirus originating from Wuhan occurred on 10 January 2020 by GISAID and was followed by over 320,000 additional sequences from samples of coronaviruses from around the world [ [3](#B3-biomedicines-10-01464)]. On 19 March 2020, the global pharmaceutical sector affirmed their commitment to addressing the COVID-19 situation. [Table 1](#biomedicines-10-01464-t001)) in reducing the severity and fatality of the disease [ [4](#B4-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The COVID-19 vaccines have been extensively credited with decreasing the severity and fatality rates associated with COVID-19. Various nations' programs for vaccine distribution have been widespread and focused on prioritizing at-risk individuals and frontline workers such as healthcare personnel. According to official estimates from national public health organizations, 11.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered worldwide as of 17 March 2022, though only a small percentage of these have been distributed in low-income countries [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [6](#B6-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Prior to the COVID-19 vaccine, vaccines that targeted coronaviruses in animals, such as Bovine CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, were developed and approved for use by the FDA [ [7](#B7-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Some research was conducted on vaccine development for other viruses in the Coronaviridae family that affect humans such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), though interest in this research waned as the prevalence of these viruses dissipated [ [8](#B8-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Non-human animals have been used to test vaccines against SARS [ [9](#B9-biomedicines-10-01464)] and MERS [ |Rare allergies and anaphylaxis| |2||Moderna||N = 30,000| Overall efficacy 94.5% after 2 doses) [ |Rare thromboembolic events, rare cases of blood-clots, pulmonary Johnson & Johnson||72% in the USA| 66% in Latin America 57% in South Africa There has yet to be developed a safe and effective treatment or protection strategy against SARS [ [30](#B30-biomedicines-10-01464), [31](#B31-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Upon the occurrence of the major MERS outbreak in 2012, previous research on SAR-CoV allowed for more efficient research into the pathogenesis and structure of MERS-CoV due to their similarities [ [32](#B32-biomedicines-10-01464), [33](#B33-biomedicines-10-01464)], though no effective vaccine was developed during that period or ever since [ [34](#B34-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [35](#B35-biomedicines-10-01464), [36](#B36-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Vaccines made with an inactive or weakened virus often take over a decade to produce. mRNA was considered a candidate for more rapid vaccine development as mRNA molecules can be generated more quickly. As early as 2012, scientists were able to employ mRNA therapy to induce erythropoiesis in mice as a treatment for certain diseases [ [37](#B37-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Human trials for a human mRNA treatment developed by Moderna targeting oncology and infectious diseases began in 2015 [ [38](#B38-biomedicines-10-01464)]. After the technique was cleared for Ebola, viral vector vaccines were created for the COVID-19 pandemic [ [39](#B39-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [40](#B40-biomedicines-10-01464)]. These studies focused on both the short-term and long-term effectiveness of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated in a study [ [41](#B41-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 2. Vaccine Development Approaches [42](#B42-biomedicines-10-01464), [43](#B43-biomedicines-10-01464), [44](#B44-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Other coronavirus proteins, such as the nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are also being studied for vaccine development since they are able to generate a strong T-cell response and their genes are frequently conserved and less prone to recombination compared to spike proteins [ [45](#B45-biomedicines-10-01464), [46](#B46-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [42](#B42-biomedicines-10-01464), [47](#B47-biomedicines-10-01464), [48](#B48-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Viral vector vaccine technologies such as those used in the development of the influenza vaccine were not popularly employed in COVID-19 vaccine technologies as newer techniques were proven to better utilize the pathogenesis of COVID. In order to prevent the conversion of prefusion spike proteins into their elongated form, a 2P mutation is used to stabilize the protein's form [ [49](#B49-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This protein would still trigger an adaptive immune response in human cells to the virus before the protein could bind to the cell [ [49](#B49-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 3. Immune Response Generated by SARS-CoV-2 Infection [50](#B50-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The envelope is comprised of four structural proteins, envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), a lipid bilayer obtained from the host's cell membrane, as well as a variable number of nonstructural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 recognizes and the class I fusion spike proteins attach to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) commonly found in the respiratory epithelial cells of the host [ [51](#B51-biomedicines-10-01464), [52](#B52-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This allows for the viral capsid to fuse with the host cells and inject its nucleic acid into the host cells. The S2 subunit plays a vital role by permitting viral and cellular membranes to fuse and the S1-S2 junction is cleaved by the serine transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) found [52](#B52-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In cats and ferrets, SARS-CoV-2 replicates well, but not in dogs, pigs, chickens, or ducks with cats having recently been shown to be especially susceptible to an experimental airborne illness [ [53](#B53-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Recent research has shown that the same receptor may be involved in infection in both cats and ferrets and is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S) [ [54](#B54-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Following attachment to the cell surface, the virus may enter the cells through endocytosis [ [55](#B55-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In vitro and in vivo research has been conducted regarding the translation and budding processes of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS viruses [ [56](#B56-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Different intercellular sensors, such as RIG I/MDA5/MAVS/TRAF3/IRF3/IRF7 and various TLRs/TRIF/MyD88/IkB/NF-kB/MAPK/AP-1 pathways, detect SARS-CoV-1 infection [ [57](#B57-biomedicines-10-01464)]. RIG I and IRF3/7 pathways are involved in type 1 interferon responses and may be inhibited by SARS proteins resulting in reduced antiviral response while boosting NF-kB activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and necroptosis [ [57](#B57-biomedicines-10-01464)]. These signaling events have been implicated in hyper inflammation, increased cellular death, and cytokine storms [ [50](#B50-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [58](#B58-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Macrophage and epithelial cell activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18, which contribute to the pathogenic inflammation that causes COVID-19 symptoms to be so severe [ [59](#B59-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [60](#B60-biomedicines-10-01464), [61](#B61-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Aside from heightened levels of acute-phase reactants and cytokine storm, little is known about the innate immune response. Presently, the majority of reports have concentrated on serious consequences and adaptive immune responses. [62](#B62-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins Orf3b and Orf9c are canonical. B and T Cell Immune Response [50](#B50-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind to the cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) and infect human T-cell lines and this pathway may even be implicated in inducing T-cell death [ [63](#B63-biomedicines-10-01464)]. CD147 is found in a variety of tissues and cells and is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor cell migration, metastasis, and differentiation, particularly in hypoxic environments [ [64](#B64-biomedicines-10-01464)]. CD147 Ig0-Ig1-Ig2 is a second isoform of CD147 that has been identified. CD147 dysregulation has been linked to many varieties of cancer and regulates the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as signals for tumor cell invasion and metastasis [ [65](#B65-biomedicines-10-01464)]. COVID-19 treatment may be prevented by hindering the SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and subsequent infection by blocking CD147 protein with meplazumab [ [64](#B64-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [66](#B66-biomedicines-10-01464)]. These CD4+ T cells, or helper T-cells, can interact with B cells which can identify viruses directly and produce virus-specific antibodies. Within the first week, after the onset of symptoms, the IgM isotype primary virus-specific antibody response is detected [ [67](#B67-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This can generate lifelong immunity through the production of IgG isotype antibodies that follow the early IgM response. [68](#B68-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 is the third SARS-like virus to cause an outbreak, and thus shares many similarities with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. These similarities may have resulted in those populations affected by the 2002 and 2012 outbreaks having some immune protection from COVID-19. Potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 have been predicted using a bioinformatics technique based on their resemblance to SARS-CoV possible T-cell B-cell epitopes, T-cell epitopes shared between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 show the potential to lead to vaccination strategies that direct the immune response to these conserved regions. This immunity not only builds on existing research, but may result in cross-protective immunity against other varieties of coronavirus and future strains that may be mutated [ [69](#B69-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins show significant genetic similarities with SARS-CoV but not to MERS-CoV. Reactivity of SARS-specific memory T-cells was found to persist for 9- to 11-years post-infection and was specific to the S, N, and M proteins in SARS-type viruses with no cross-reactivity with MERS [ [71](#B71-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 4. mRNA Vaccines [72](#B72-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This has made RNA a popular choice in several COVID-19 vaccines, including the approved Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These vaccines use RNA to induce the expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which are then recognized and destroyed, allowing the body to build up memory immune cells. Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA is commonly used in RNA vaccines, although this is not necessarily always the case. The mRNA molecules are combined with lipid nanoparticles which improve the absorption of RNA into cells and protect the strand while in transport [ [73](#B73-biomedicines-10-01464), [74](#B74-biomedicines-10-01464), [75](#B75-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The first COVID-19 vaccines to be approved in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union were RNA vaccines [ [76](#B76-biomedicines-10-01464), [77](#B77-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [78](#B78-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In total, 10 occurrences of anaphylaxis were reported between December 2020 and January 2021 of the 4,041,396 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dosages administered. The allergic symptoms were most likely caused by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [ [79](#B79-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 4.1. Mechanism of Action [80](#B80-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This response may be elicited through the use of attenuated, or inactivated forms of the virus or recombinant antigen-encoding viral vector which are harmless carrier viruses with an antigen transgene. Conversely, mRNA vaccines use a synthetic, transient segment RNA encoding a viral antigen [ [81](#B81-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Dendritic cells pick up these mRNA snippets through phagocytosis [ [82](#B82-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Dendritic cells read the mRNA and make the viral antigens that the mRNA encodes using their own machinery (ribosomes). Within a few days of their introduction, the mRNA fragments are degraded by the body [ [68](#B68-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Dendritic cells take vaccine mRNA globules far more quickly than non-immune cells, which can also absorb vaccine mRNA, generate antigens, and show antigens on their surfaces. Fragments of mRNA are translated in the cytoplasm and have no effect on the genomic DNA stored in the cell nucleus [ [83](#B83-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [Figure 1](#biomedicines-10-01464-f001)). Dendritic cells travel to lymph nodes after activation and present the antigen to T- and B-cells, resulting in the production of antibodies that target the antigen [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 4.2. B Cell and Antibody Response [85](#B85-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The activation of B-cells by an antigen presented by an MHC molecule leads to the production of plasmablasts (PB) in extrafollicular (EF) sites as a part of the short-term immune response. Following this, germinal centers (GCs), microanatomical locations of secondary lymphoid organs, produce affinity-matured, persistent antibodies against viruses [ [86](#B86-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The GC is the site where activated B-cells undergo random mutations. This produces Abs with a higher affinity for the antigen. B-cells with stronger affinities are selected for, resulting in higher concentrations of more specific B-cells. This process creates high-affinity long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B-cells (MBCs). LLPCs release antibodies, some of which are neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), which may play a role in sterilizing immunity [ [87](#B87-biomedicines-10-01464)]. These LLPCs are important for their varying ability to survive for many years in some situations, secreting Abs even with no additional antigen activation [ [88](#B88-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In the case of a future pathogen encounter, MBCs become activated and increase the production of high-affinity Ab-secreting cells. Thus, it is desirable for vaccinations to induce the production of LLPCs and MBCs. [89](#B89-biomedicines-10-01464), [90](#B90-biomedicines-10-01464)]. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine efficacy has been determined in pre-clinical assessments by focusing on their abilities to elicit binding and neutralize Ab responses in mice. Importantly, researchers discovered that the Ab responses elicited by these mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer), and CVnCoV (CureVac (Frankfurt, Germany)) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were able to neutralize the virus in vitro, as evaluated by both pseudovirus and [95](#B95-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Appropriate nAb levels were observed greater than two months following administration of these mRNA vaccines. Further analysis of the Ab responses to the mRNA vaccines showed that the Ab response was boosted following the administration of a booster injection after initial priming [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-10-01464), [95](#B95-biomedicines-10-01464), [96](#B96-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Higher vaccine doses (30 g) appeared to be adequate with only a single dose to generate an increased humoral response in mice, however, at lower vaccine doses of 1 g or 2 g, a second round of immunization was required for sufficient nAb production. Overall, the findings from these many mice investigations imply that in order to reach nAb levels following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, two doses or a single higher dose may be required. The choice of antigen has been shown to affect Abs and nAbs production as a study found that receptor-binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccines were more efficient at generating SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies compared to SARS-CoV-2 S1 mRNA vaccines [ [97](#B97-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Significantly stronger humoral responses were found in studies with mRNA vaccines encoding the full-length S protein [ [97](#B97-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [98](#B98-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Two clinical candidates for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mRNA-1273 (10 or 100 g) and BNT162b2 (30 or 100 g), both showed the dose-dependent ability to induce the production of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In vitro, the values evoked in NHPs by BNT162b2 were higher than the nAb values generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human sera [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-10-01464), [94](#B94-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Larger doses of mRNA vaccines were required to evoke sufficient amounts of S- and RBD-binding antibodies when only a single immunization was used [ [95](#B95-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Utilization of a booster immunization showed that these vaccine candidates resulted in in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2 in all cases. Although these vaccine candidates did not prevent viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in animals, the virus was only detected in these areas for a few days following infection. Fluid and nasal swabs of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in primates following infection after immunization showed the absence of significant SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA which provided evidence to indicate that the lower respiratory tract of primates following immunization was protected from viral infection [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The CVnCoV candidate was evaluated with several lower doses (0.5 or 8 g), and studies showed that only the higher dose of the ones tested evoked significant levels of RBD and S-binding IgG titers following a single immunization, with the amount of IgG increasing in the time post-immunization [ [80](#B80-biomedicines-10-01464)]. After the booster immunization, these candidates' nAb responses were shown to be accompanied by in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2. These trials also showed that higher vaccine doses provided better upper respiratory tract protection, but both doses provided equal protection for the lower respiratory tract [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-10-01464), [94](#B94-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [6](#B6-biomedicines-10-01464)]. No evidence exists currently to prove the significant presence of this Ab-dependent enhancement occurring following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. 4.3. T Cell Response [91](#B91-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Furthermore, CD+8 T-cells activated by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines displayed cytotoxic T cell characteristics (Granzyme B and CD107a). Another 2020 study discovered a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cells after immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, as evaluated by IFN production on CD8+ T-cells following another activation by antigens, in an independent investigation [ [99](#B99-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Recent findings show that CD8+ T-cells may comprise the main immune response shortly after immunization and can be observed in patients as early as one week after vaccination [ [100](#B100-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [94](#B94-biomedicines-10-01464)]. A 2020 study observed a similar observation in CD8+ splenocytes infected with CVnCoV [ [95](#B95-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Another study from the same year was also able to detect a large growth of CD8+ T effector memory cells in mice immunized with clinical candidate ARCoV [ [96](#B96-biomedicines-10-01464)]. However, in another 2020 study using macaques, the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine did not elicit an increase in CD8+ T-cell response as it did in mice [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Similar situations occur in humans as the S-protein does not induce a strong CD8+ T-cell response in all naturally infected humans [ [44](#B44-biomedicines-10-01464)]. While the increase of cytotoxic CD8 T-cells may be advantageous, there is no evidence that it is essential for successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection. 4.4. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna [101](#B101-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The use of genetically edited RNA to elicit a managed immune response through the production of viral proteins is what makes RNA vaccines so innovative [ [51](#B51-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The synthetic nature of mRNA-based vaccines eliminates the need for cell culture or virus fermentation and thus allows for more efficient development. [102](#B102-biomedicines-10-01464), [103](#B103-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The mRNA's sensitivity to degradation makes it necessary to address the limitations of mRNA vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine circumvents this issue by requiring storage at 94\u00b0 Fahrenheit, or 70\u00b0 Celsius. This prevents mRNA degradation but requires the use of costly freezer devices which may not be available in low- and middle-income countries (LMCI). Despite this, no adjuvants or preservatives are utilized in these vaccines as the vaccine is self-stimulating. Furthermore, a lipid particle encloses the mRNA in order to prevent degradation. [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). The mRNA reaches the ribosomes, which are then used to synthesize the viral spike proteins in a process referred to as translation [ [51](#B51-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The proteins are then recognized by antigen-presenting cells, such as B-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which possess MHC-2 molecules on their surface or cells that possess MHC-1 molecules. The binding of the protein acting as an antigen to the MHC molecules leads to immune recognition of the S-proteins by cytotoxic T-cells in the case of MHC-I cells and helper T-cells (Th) in the case of MHC-II cells. The CD4+ T-cell receptors on Th cells bind to the antigen-presenting MHC-II which triggers the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL5 [ [104](#B104-biomedicines-10-01464)]. These interleukins cause our body's B-cells to mature into plasma cells, which create a significant quantity of Abs targeting viral spike proteins. In the meantime, interleukins (IL) result in memory T-cell proliferation. The TCRs of CD8+ T-cells are activated by the presentation of the spike protein antigens by MHC-1 proteins on cell membranes, resulting in the production of cytotoxic T-cells (Tcx) which directly cause the death of virus-infected cells using harmful molecules such as granzyme and perforin [ [105](#B105-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Tcx cells also secrete immune signals to further amplify the immune response [ [106](#B106-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [107](#B107-biomedicines-10-01464), [108](#B108-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [106](#B106-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [78](#B78-biomedicines-10-01464), [109](#B109-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Of 1,893,360 individuals who received at least a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, 21 suffered from allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis in some cases. From 10 to 23 December 2020, 11.1 individuals per 1 million doses experienced an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has an anaphylaxis rate of one per 2.5 million administered doses. However, no deaths related to anaphylaxis caused by the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been reported. A small number of individuals experienced facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy) following vaccination, however, Bell's Palsy was not found to be higher after vaccination [ [78](#B78-biomedicines-10-01464), [109](#B109-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 4.4.1. Performance Evaluation of Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna Vaccine [111](#B111-biomedicines-10-01464), [112](#B112-biomedicines-10-01464)] (FDAa and b 2021). 5. Vaccines 5.1. Astra-Zeneca Oxford [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). This assures that most individuals have no prior immunity to the virus from which the vector was taken and the immune response is only reactive towards the viral protein encoded by the vaccine's injected viral DNA, rather than the adenovirus itself. The DNA encodes a protein that elicits a similar immune response as the SARS-CoV-2 S-peptide along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In human host cells, this vector leads to the production of new adenovirus viral proteins that generate this immunological response. The adenovirus latches on to the outside of the human host cell and DNA is then injected into the cytoplasm where it travels to the nucleus. The DNA is transcribed into mRNA by the host cells and this RNA is later translated into the appropriate proteins by ribosomes. MHC1 and MHC2 complexes are formed when the proteins are expressed on cell membranes. The processes of RNA and DNA vaccines are identical at this point, leading to the activation of T-cells, B-cells, and plasma cells along with the production of antibodies [ [113](#B113-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [114](#B114-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [114](#B114-biomedicines-10-01464), [115](#B115-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The majority of these symptoms were seen in women under the age of 55. Due to these concerns, AstraZeneca has been banned in Germany and several European countries for adults under the age of 60. Although a causal link between these disorders and the vaccine has yet to be proved, it has been determined that the occurrence warrants further investigation. [116](#B116-biomedicines-10-01464)]. AIFA approved the vaccine's use for persons 65 and older, due to health concerns regarding blood clotting overserved in younger recipients, on 18 February 2021, primarily in countries with circulating virus strains [ [117](#B117-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [118](#B118-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The efficacy of the vaccine was reported by the WHO to be 76% 15 days after the second dose is administered. The vaccine has been determined to be acceptable for low- and middle-income nations due to its minimal storage requirements and over 2.5 billion doses have been distributed globally. 5.2. Johnson and Johnson (Janssen) [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). It does not require the extreme cold storage of other vaccines, making it suitable for areas without advanced refrigeration. This vaccination works by using a laboratory-made adenovirus vector to deliver a gene encoding for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. On 27 February 2021, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for this vaccine to be used in people aged 18 and over. On 12 March 2021, Italy approved the vaccine based on its efficacy in the prevention of severe symptoms and reducing hospitalizations and deaths. The vaccine demonstrated 77% efficacy against disease after 14 days and 85% after 28 days of treatment [ [119](#B119-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Data currently available suggest that people beyond the age of 65 have equal efficacy. In April, the Italian government approved this vaccination. It was used for a while before being withdrawn due to serious adverse effects, but was later reintroduced to the market. [120](#B120-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The DNA enters the cytoplasm and then travels to the nucleus and is transcribed into mRNA which can be translated to have the host generate spike proteins. The DNA remains distinct from the host cell's DNA. The viral spike proteins present themselves on the surface of the host cells which leads to immune recognition and triggers the formation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, plasma cells, interleukin (IL), and B-cells [ [44](#B44-biomedicines-10-01464)]. T-cells are suited to targeting infected host cells whereas antibodies are effective at targeting free viral particles, preventing further infection. [121](#B121-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This resulted in the vaccine's usage being halted in Italy, despite the fact that it had only recently been certified for emergency use. [122](#B122-biomedicines-10-01464), [123](#B123-biomedicines-10-01464), [124](#B124-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 5.3. Sputnik V [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). Furthermore, according to Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the vaccine is half the cost of other vaccinations with the same efficacy rate. [125](#B125-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Symptomatic COVID-19 was found in 16 cases in the vaccine group 21 days following the first dose, compared to 62 in the placebo group, resulting in a 91.6 percent effectiveness rate. A stronger immune response could be the result of using different adenovirus vectors in each of the doses [ [126](#B126-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 6. Inactivated Vaccines [127](#B127-biomedicines-10-01464)]. To date, different chemical and physical strategies have been used to inactivate coronaviruses, including the use of formalin, formaldehyde, -propiolactone, and UV alone or a blend of these techniques [ [128](#B128-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [129](#B129-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Currently available inactivated vaccines serve to improve immunity by eliciting the production. Antibodies of this type frequently disrupt the virus from undergoing conformation changes or its interactions with cell entry receptors [ [130](#B130-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The mechanism of action by which the immune response is generated by inactivated vaccine is depicted in [Figure 1](#biomedicines-10-01464-f001). 6.1. CoronaVac [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). Sinovac's Phase II trials involving 600 patients given either 3 g or 6 g doses with a booster received either 2 or 4 weeks after priming revealed the vaccine was safe in healthy adults, with the 3 ug dose eliciting 92.4 percent seroconversion after 14 days and 97.4 percent after 28 days [ [128](#B128-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 6.2. BBIBP-CorV [131](#B131-biomedicines-10-01464)] ( [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). It was proven to be safe and tolerable in all dosages tested and in both age groups. On day 42, all vaccination recipients had humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, this study found that a two-shot immunization with 4 g vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 resulted in stronger neutralizing antibody titers than a single 8 g dose or a 4 g dosage on days 0 and 14 [ [127](#B127-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 6.3. WIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). Phase I and II clinical trials showed that by the 14th day after the second dose, 100% of individuals had binding antibodies against entire inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and 98 percent had neutralizing antibodies, with only minor side effects [ [127](#B127-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 6.4. Covaxin [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). Bharat Biotechnology claims an overall 65% efficacy against the DELTA variant with a 98% efficacy in the prevention of severe COVID-19 symptoms [ [132](#B132-biomedicines-10-01464)]. After the first dose 48 percent had nAbs, which increased to 97 percent after the second dose; and GMTs for binding and nAbs both increased significantly after the second dose [ [133](#B133-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7. Subunit Vaccines [134](#B134-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [135](#B135-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7.1. NVX-CoV2373 [128](#B128-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Novavax was reported to have an 89.7% efficacy in a trial involving the B.1.1.7 strain in the UK. However, in a smaller and less conclusive South African experiment, where the great majority of infections were caused by the B. 1.351 type that is proliferating there, its efficacy plummeted to 60% [ [106](#B106-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7.2. EpiVacCorona [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). A Phase II clinical trial in Russia showed antibodies in 100% of participants after vaccination and third phase clinical trials have been registered, though no results are yet available [ [136](#B136-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [136](#B136-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7.3. MVC COVID-19 Vaccine [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). It is adjuvanted with Dynavax's CpG 1018, which was formerly used in an FDA-approved adult hepatitis B vaccine [ [137](#B137-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7.4. Zifivax [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). In China, Ecuador, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan, the vaccine candidate is in Phase III studies with 29,000 people. ZF2001 is built on the same technology as other protein-based vaccines. It is given in three doses over the course of two months. The Longcom company announced that early data from a Chinese phase III study with 28,500 people in August 2021 showed an overall efficacy of 82 percent against disease of any severity. The Alpha variation had a 93% efficacy rate, while the Delta variant had a 78% efficacy rate [ [138](#B138-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 7.5. Corbevax [Table 2](#biomedicines-10-01464-t002)). 7.6. the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor-binding domain chemically coupled to tetanus toxoid [ [139](#B139-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 8. COVID-19 Vaccine Adjuvants [140](#B140-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In viral infection, T-cell recruitment is the hallmark and favored immunological response. In the case of subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, the T-cell response is the more significant marker of vaccine success, and adjuvants aid in eliciting a predominantly Th1-skewed immune response. [141](#B141-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [142](#B142-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of the S-AS03, S-CpG/alum, and placebo groups received 3, 9, and 30 g doses at 21-day intervals in a phase 1 subunit COVID-19 vaccine (SCB-2019). When opposed to AS03, CpG is a comparatively safe compound. S-AS03 and S-CpG/alum both cause the development of neutralizing antibodies (NA). S-AS03, on the other hand, developed a faster neutralizing antibody than the S-CpG/alum group, demonstrating the adjuvants' differences. In the two adjuvanted groups, helper T-cell immune responses were generated, but this was not the case in S-protein specific to the non-adjuvanted S-trimer COVID-19 vaccination. The preferred options were 9 g S-trimer-AS03 and 30 g S-trimer-CpG/alum, according to this dose discovery study [ [143](#B143-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Yang et al. conducted a phase 1 and 2 subunit vaccination trial (2021). Adverse effects were mild to moderate in both phases 1 and 2. The seroconversion rates of NA in phase 2 were 76 percent and 72 percent in the 25 g and 50 g dosage groups, respectively, 14 days after the second treatment. After 14 days, seroconversion rates in the 25 g and 50 g groups were 97 percent and 93 percent, respectively, in the third dosage schedule. Three consecutive 25 g dosage shots were shown to be safe and efficacious when given at 14-day intervals [ [138](#B138-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Alum is used as an adjuvant in this vaccine. 8.1. B Defensing [144](#B144-biomedicines-10-01464), [145](#B145-biomedicines-10-01464), [146](#B146-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Defensins are cationic peptides that serve as antimicrobials and signaling molecules in human innate and epithelial cells [ [147](#B147-biomedicines-10-01464), [148](#B148-biomedicines-10-01464)]. -defensin is the most abundant in most cells [ [147](#B147-biomedicines-10-01464)]. In human epithelial cells, three -defensins have been -defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, and [148](#B148-biomedicines-10-01464)]. hBD3 has a significant effect on dendritic cell and T cell activation, polarization, and migration [ [149](#B149-biomedicines-10-01464)]. It stimulates the production of IFN- and the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses [ [150](#B150-biomedicines-10-01464)]. A study looked at the adjuvant role of hBD2 and found that it boosted antiviral molecule expression levels [ [151](#B151-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 8.2. Alum, Emulsion and Liposome [152](#B152-biomedicines-10-01464), [153](#B153-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 8.3. CpG Adjuvant [154](#B154-biomedicines-10-01464)]. This leads to the production of more antigens which boosts helper T0 cell response and encourages proinflammatory cytokines production. When the vaccination antigen and ODN are near together, the adjuvant effects of CpG ODNs improve. Three types of synthetic CpG ODNs have been identified structurally [ [155](#B155-biomedicines-10-01464)], notably the 'K/B,' 'D/A,' and 'C' type ODNs. Different immunoglobulin types are activated by each class. CpG ODN, as a whole, is a unique and suggested adjuvant that works by increasing TNF- and IL-6 production. CpG has also been shown to improve the surveillance capabilities of antigen presenting cells. CpG ODNs' value are boosted even more by their ability to boost mucosal and systemic immunity [ [155](#B155-biomedicines-10-01464), [156](#B156-biomedicines-10-01464), [157](#B157-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The CpG pattern is uncommon in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and trends have been observed where new strains are favoring fewer CpG genomes. The increased proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases could be linked to the decreased CpG motif. As a result, employing CpG ODN as an adjuvant could be a suitable way to improve immunogenicity while reducing toxicity [ [158](#B158-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 8.4. SARS-CoV-2 Variants and Their Effect on Vaccines [159](#B159-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [160](#B160-biomedicines-10-01464)] illustrated that above 12,000 mutations have been recorded in the sequences of this virus. However, several variants have been generated from time to time. Among the variants, significant variants have been marked as VOCs/VOIs by WHO, eCDC, or CDC. Among the variants, emerging variants are Alpha (B.1.1.7; originated from the UK), Gamma (P.1; originated from Brazil); Beta (B.1.351; originated from South Africa); Delta (B.1.617.2; originated from India); (B.1.1.529: Reported in multiple countries) [ [161](#B161-biomedicines-10-01464), [162](#B162-biomedicines-10-01464), [163](#B163-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Significant mutations in the variants have resulted in immune escape, antibody escape, and partly vaccine escape [ [164](#B164-biomedicines-10-01464), [165](#B165-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Moore and Offit have described the rising concern of SARS-CoV-2 variants against the developed vaccine [ [166](#B166-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [167](#B167-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The mutation (D614G) was found in all VOIs and VOCs. Researchers have illustrated that the mutation has occurred through positive selection [ [168](#B168-biomedicines-10-01464)]. At the same time, due to the significant mutations of the variants, decreased efficiency in vaccine-elicited sera has been noted by the variants from time to time. A recent study has created a pseudovirus with different mutations in the spike of Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) which resulted in reduced efficiency of vaccine sera. In this case, the inserted mutations in the this study, mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 was used to assess the immune responses. [170](#B170-biomedicines-10-01464)]. [171](#B171-biomedicines-10-01464)]. 9. Conclusions [172](#B172-biomedicines-10-01464), [173](#B173-biomedicines-10-01464)]. Although vaccines with high efficacy have been identified and are used today, further work into assuring that their storage needs can be met in low-income areas is essential to eradicating COVID-19. [174](#B174-biomedicines-10-01464)]. The possibility of introducing yearly boosters to currently vaccinated individuals is one proposed solution to combat the growing prevalence of these new strains [ [175](#B175-biomedicines-10-01464)].
