The doctor had seating outside and filled out the tablet and did the swab outside. There's a side gate, so you don't have to be indoors at all. I paid extra for quicker results. He projected they'd be up to 3 hours and I got them within one hour. I've talked to others who waited up to two hours for COVID test, indoors and with others and waiting who might be infected. I feel much better about my experience and would recommend testing here. Business owner information Ryan N. Jun 1, 2022 I'm so happy to hear you at a great experience with us! Thank you for taking the time to write us such a kind of review! - Dec 27, 2021 Dr. Ryan Namdarkhan is personable, professional and runs an efficient professional practice. His assistant Amir, is kind and professional and we have used this practice for Covid tests - PCR, rapid, etc for the whole family. The turn around time is excellent - always faster than quoted. The set up with the testing outside, around the corner of the clinic is comfortable and convenient. Inside the clinic - I have had multiple PRP procedures - including PRP facial (aka Vampire facials) and PRP. injections. Again - very satisfied with the procedures as well as the results! Thank you Vitalize Natural Medicine! Business owner information Ryan N. Jun 1, 2022 Thank you for taking the time to write this review. It means the world to us! - May 15, 2022 Dr. Ryan is amazing! I first came to him for a covid test and was so impressed with his professionalism and attention to detail that i started seeing him for other things. i hadn't been feeling myself for a while but hadn't been able to figure out what was wrong until he ran some diagnostics on me and figured out i was struggling with hypothyroidism. with his help, i'm feeling back to feeling myself and i couldn't be more grateful. thank you dr. ryan!! Business owner information Ryan N. Jun 1, 2022 Thank you! So glad you're happy with us and feeling better! - Jun 8, 2022 This is one of the best practices I have ever been to. Heavy on holistics and every kind of proven therapy for the body and mind, Dr. Ryan delivers it all. The office is so well run and thorough, and Dr. Ryan is always there at a moment's notice. I am so happy to have found such a fantastic caregiver. I cannot recommend this practice highly enough. Thank you! Business owner information Ryan N. Jun 20, 2022 Thank you for the kind review! We're thrilled that you had a great experience which is what we always strive for! - Aug 2, 2021 Dr. Namdarkhan is a world class health professional. He sees you as a human, and I think genuinely cares about the well being of his patients. He conducted a COVID antigen test with almost immediate results. He even went further to test me for strep throat (which an earlier urgent care tech told me was negative). Came back positive, only because Dr. Namdarkhan actually extracted a sound sample from my throat. Eased a lot of anxiety. Thank you! - Dec 29, 2020 I almost hesitate to write this because it might make it harder to get an appointment! But this place also deserves major recognition for their amazingly kind and competent staff, readily available appointments, and extremely affordable covid testing. I would not have made it through this weird year without them, they're the best! plus, you can get amazing coffee next door as a treat for being responsible and getting a covid test! - Jan 5, 2022Updated review This is my second review, just because I continue to believe this is one of the best places to really go to get your Covid Test. its worth it, Doctor and assistant very kind and sweet. a place to go to if you need get a covid test.Jul 26, 2021Previous review This place it's my go to in need of COVID testing, very profesional and super nice doctor . Recommend this place to anyone that needs professional and fast service. - Feb 2, 2021 Absolutely love Dr Ryan & all of his staff. They are thorough, personable, professional and reliable!! While COVID testing, they are in full PPE, making all customers feel most safe. COVID has turned our world upside down, but Vitalize makes it quick & easy to get tested... especially for the speedy-needs of productions! Oh, and Vitalize also does house-calls! :) - Jul 19, 2021 Dr. Ryan made the COVID test process super easy and fast. Highly recommend if you need this service. - Dec 22, 2021 I was in need of a pcr covid test and Vitalize was one of the few places that offered rapid pcr testing. I was able to reserve a time online without issue. The entire process was seamless and the prices were listed clearly on the website. I would definitely use them again.
