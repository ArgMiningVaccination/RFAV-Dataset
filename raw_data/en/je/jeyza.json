Defendants shall show cause, at a time and place to be directed by the Court, why a prelimin ary injunction should n ot issue requiring Defendants to act as described in above; the temporary restraining order shall remai n effective until such time as the Court has ruled on whether a preliminary injunction should issue. This Application is made on the grounds that Plaintiffs are lik ely to succeed on the merits of this case, they will suffer irreparable harm with out injunctive relief, the balance of equities tips sharply in their favor, and the relief sought is in the public interest. Good cause exists to issue the requested Order to preserve Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitutio n of the State of California, and to avoid irreparable harm to those rights. This Application is supported by the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities, by Pl aintiffs' Verified Complaint, and all exhibits attached thereto, by the declaratio ns of Plaintiffs and their counsel, Mark P. Meuser, and all exhibits attached thereto, and by such further argument and evidence that may be adduced at any hearing on thi s matter or of which the Court may take judicial notice. The Verified Complaint in this action was filed on April 13, 2 020; this Application followed. All papers relating to this Application w ill be delivered by email to the Defendants ' counsel by 4:00 p.m. on April 14. As reflected in the accompanying declaration of Mark P. Meuser, Plaintiffs have not ified the Office of the California Attorney General and county counsel for San Bern ardino and Riverside Counties, informing counsel of Plaintiffs' intention to file this Application and to seek a temporary restraining order of the nature described above. Plaintiffs request that the Court waive any bond requirement, because enjoining Defendants from unconstitutionally prohibiting religious practi ces will not financially affect Defendants. // Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 3 of 35 Page ID #:76 App.227 3 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Respectfully submitted, Date: April 14, 2020 DHILLON LAW GROUP gmichael@dhillonlaw.com DHILLON LAW GROUP INC. 177 Post Street, Suite 700 San Francisco, California 94108 Telephone: (415) 433-1700 Attorneys for Plaintiffs Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 4 of 35 Page ID #:77 App.228 i Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS U.S. Attorney General William Barr Issues Statement on Religious Practice and Social Distance .............................................................. .................................... 1 On April 14, 2020, U.S. Attorney General William Barr issued the following statement: .................................................... ....................................................... 1 INTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................ 1 RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND 2 LEGAL STANDARD ................................................ .................................................. 7 ARGUMENT ...................................................... ......................................................... 9 I.

While we believe that during this period there is a sufficient basis for the social distanci ng rules that have been put in place, the scope and justification of restrict ions beyond that will have to be assessed based on the circumstances as the y evolve. Religion and religious worship continue to be central to the li ves of millions of Americans. This is true more so than ever during t his difficult time. The pandemic has changed the ways Americans li ve their lives. Religious communities have rallied to the critical need to protect the community from the spread of this disease by making service s available online and in ways that otherwise comply with social distancing guidelines. The United States Department of Justice will continue to ensure that religious freedom remains protected if any state or local gover nment, in their response to COVID-19, singles out, targets, or discrimina tes against any house of worship for special restrictions. Meuser Dec., Ex. 8. INTRODUCTION The United States and California Constitutions do not contain b lanket exceptions for pandemics, and neither may California's lawmaker s ignore fundamental Constitutional norms on the basis of a health crisi s. In a knee-jerk response to the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when people of faith around the world have a greater need than ever for spiritual solace, Defen dants have Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 11 of 35 Page ID #:84 App.235 2 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 criminalized communal worship across California. While protecti ng the health and safety of the public during this crisis is certainly critically important \u2014to Plaintiffs also\u2014that interest may not be secured by abrogating the rights and l iberties enshrined by the U.S. and California Constitutions. Despite declarations of national, state, and local emergencies surrounding the coronavirus outbreak, Defendants have decided to allow \"essential\" businesses (as determined by Defendants on an ad hoc basis) to continue operations provided that certain social distancing guidelines are followed. For example, Defendants permit marijuana dispensaries, fast food restaurants, and laundromats to continue operations, subject to these restrictions. Statewide, the news media have been permitted to continue operations. Churches and religious services, however, have not made Defenda nts' cut. Instead, Defendants insist that all religious worship take plac e only at home, by live- streaming, apparently assuming that all Californians have acces s to high-speed internet, computer equipment, a desire to add intrusive, data-c ollecting apps to their computer devices, and the willingness to suspend a lifetime of worship practices at the command of the government. The United States and California Constitutions simply do not tolerate such arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions thrust upon fundamental rights while less restrictive measures are availabl e and are being allowed for entities the Government deems \"essential.\" This Court should immediately enjoin Defendants from further violating Plaintiffs ' religious liberty by ascribing second-class status to faith practices.

LEGAL STANDARD A temporary restraining order preserves the status quo and prev ents irreparable harm until a hearing can be held on a preliminary injunction ap plication. See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers , 415 U.S. 423, Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 17 of 35 Page ID #:90 App.241 8 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 439 (1974). A temporary restraining order may be issued without providing the opposing party an opportunity to be heard where \"specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition, \" and \"the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1). The standards for issuing a temporary restraining order and a p reliminary injunction are the same. See, e.g. , Stuhlbarg Int'l Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc. , 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has established two sets of criteria for evaluating a request for injunctive relief . Earth Island Inst. v. United States Forest Serv ., 351 F.3d 1291, 1297 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the \"traditional \" criteria, a plaintiff must show (1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) advancement of the public interest. See, e.g. , Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Alternatively, a temporary restraining order or prelimi nary injunction may be appropriate when a movant raise s \"serious questions going to th e merits\" and the \"balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,\" p rovided that the plaintiff is able to show there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and th at the injunction is in the public interest.

Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). // // // Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 18 of 35 Page ID #:91 App.242 9 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ARGUMENT I. PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO TEMPORARY AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. A. There Is a Strong Likelihood Plaintiffs' Will Succeed in Proving Their Claims on Multiple Constitutional Grounds. 1. Defendants' Ban on Communal Religious Worship Violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause and California Constitution Article 1, Section 4. As Plaintiffs' first and eleventh causes of action, they assert facial and as- applied challenges pursuant to (1) 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 on th e grounds that Defendants' Orders violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and (2) state law on the grounds that the Orders violate Article 1, Section 4 of the California Constitution. 1 See Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court , 32 Cal. 4th 527, 562 (2004) (implicitly recognizing state law claim for violations of Art. 1, Section 4 of the California Constitut ion); Ketchum v. Alameda Cnty. , 811 F.2d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir. 1987) (a cause of action arises under Section 1983 where \"(1) the conduct that harm[ed] [Plaintiffs] [was] co mmitted under color of state law (i.e. state action), and (2) the conduct . . . depriv e[d] [Plaintiffs] of a constitution al right.\"); Dennis v. Higgins , 498 U.S. 439 (1991) (The rights guaranteed by Section 1983 are to be \"liberally and beneficently construed .\") (quoting Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs. , 436 U.S. 658, 684 (1978)). 2 The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits governme nt actors from enforcing any \"law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U. S. Const. amend. I ; see also Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 1 Defendants cannot credibly contest that the issuance and enfor cement of the Orders by Defendants in their official capacities constitute state act ion. Accordingly, the likelihood of Plaintiffs' success turns on whether Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of a constitutional right. As discussed herein, Plaintiffs have ampl y established such deprivations. Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 19 of 35 Page ID #:92 App.243 10 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 U.S. 296, 303 (1940) (applying the First Amendment to the State s through the Fourteenth Amendment). The California Constitution similarly protects the \"[f]ree exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or pr eference. \" Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4; see also Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. , 32 Cal. 4th at 562. As the Supreme Court has note d, \"a law burdening religious prac tice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993). \"A law is not generally applicable if its prohibitions substantially u nderinclude non- religiously motivated conduct that might endanger the same gove rnmental interest that the law is designed v. Wiesman 508 U.S. at 542 -46). \"In other words, if a law pursues the government's interest 'only against conduct motivated by religious belief,' but fails to include in its prohibitions substantial, comparable secular con duct that would similarly threaten the government's interest, then the law is n ot generally applicable.\" Id. The Orders are neither neutral nor of general application. Defe ndants' restrictions have specifically and explicitly targeted religiou s and \"faith -based\" services and are thus not neutral on their face. Defendants hav e prohibited certain public and private gatherings deemed \"non -essential,\" including out -of-home religious services, while exempting a laundry list of industries and serv ices purportedly \"essential\" to the government's various interests, including medical cannabis dispensaries and other medical providers, courts, public utilit ies, daycare and childcare, and \"necessary\" shopping. Further, several Defendant s have granted ad hoc exemptions to the Orders for particular religious gatherings of particular faiths - i.e., Christians permitted to celebrate Easter, but not for other gatherings or other faiths. Defendants' mandates are not \"narrowly tailored\" to further any compelling governmental interest. Defendants have granted numerous special exemptions to their bans on public gatherings and conduct, including for purportedly \"essential\" Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 20 of 35 Page ID #:93 App.244 11 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 businesses and activities, provi ded that social distancing practices are observed; and even for out-of-home religious s ervices during Easter, an impor tant day of religious significance for Christians. Since these gatherings may be perm itted, there can be no doubt that Defendants may, and therefore must, permit Plaintiff s to engage in equivalent religious activities and services provided that Plai ntiffs also adhere to the social distancing guidelines currently in place. Requiring Plaintiffs to abstain from religious gatherings, desp ite substantial modifications to satisfy the public health interests at stake, violates Plaintiffs' Constitutional right to free ex ercise of religion. The state do es not have the power under o ur Constitutional scheme to decree that as to faith activities, \"streaming\" (for those congregations and parishio ners with the wealth and technological acumen to partake of such truncated substitutes) is \"good enough\" while at the same time acknowledging m edia organizations' First Amendment rights to freedom of the pr ess. Because narrower restrictions may be applied to Plaintiffs, whi le still protecting legitimate governmental interests, the Orders are unconstitutio nal and Defendants should be enjoined. 2. The Orders Violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Orders and Defendants' enforcement thereof violate the First Amendment, both facially and as- applied to Plaintiffs. The Establishment Clause of the \"First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.\" McCreary Cnty., Ky. v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ky. , 545 U.S. 844, 860 (2005) ( citing Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968)). The Establishment Claus e applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S. 1 (1947). Under the Lemon test, the courts ask whether the government action (1) has a clear secular purpose; (2) has a \"principal or primary effect\" that \"neither advances Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 21 of 35 Page ID #:94 App.245 12 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 nor inhibits religion\"; and (3) does not foster \"an exces sive government entanglement with religion.\" Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 (1971); but see Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass'n , 139 S. Ct. 2067 (2019) (writing for the plurality, Justice Samuel Alito refused to apply the Lemon test to a religious-display case, but failed to garner majority support for any other test). Defendants have not and do not act with a clearly secular purpo se in adopting and enforcing the Orders. The Orders are ambiguous in scope and application, granting law enforcement unfettered discretion in deciding what conduct shall constitute a crime, and what conduct is \"essential,\" and theref ore permissible. This discretion has already been exercised by government officials to temporarily exempt specific faiths (namely, Christians) from compliance with the O rders during Easter. It is not for Defendants to determine which faiths, and on which d ays of religious significance to those faiths, religious services may take place . The Orders and Defendants' ad hoc enforcement thereof have the primary effect of inhibiting religious activity. Indeed, the Orders exp ressly prohibit religious services unless practiced within the home, by live-streaming. A s a result, Defendants have also failed to avoid excessive government entanglement wit h religion. Defendants permit only some forms of religious observance, whil e disallowing all communal worship. Thus, the Court should grant this Application and enjoin further enforcement of the Orders. 3. Defendants Violate Plaintiffs' Free Speech Rights . As Plaintiffs' third and ninth cau ses of action, they assert facial and as-applied challenges pursuant to (1) 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 on the grounds that Defendants' Orders violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and (2) state law on the grounds that the Orders violate Article 1, Section 2 of the California Constitution . \"[T]he California liberty of speech clause is broader and more protective than the free speech clause of the First Amendment.\" Fantasyland Video, Inc. v. Cty. of San Diego , 496 F.3d 1040, 1042 (9th Cir. 2007).

Los Angeles All. For Survival v. City of Los Angeles , 22 Cal. 4th 352, 367, n.12 (2000). California courts treat the prior restraint and overbreadth doctrine simil arly to federal courts. See Wilson v. Superior Court , 13 Cal.3d 652, 658-62 (1975) (relying mostly on federal citations to analyze prior restraint doctrine under California Constitution); In re J.M. , 36 Cal. App. 5th 668, 680 (2019) (citing some federal cases and paralleling overbreadth doctrine analysis under California Constitution with that under the U.S. Constitution). The Orders \u2014by acting as a prior restraint to protected speech \u2014are unconstitutional facially and as-applied because they impermiss ibly burden Plaintiffs ' right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment and Califo rnia Constitution, Article 1, Section 2. See Clark Cnty. , 836 F.2d 1185, 1191 (9th Cir. 1988) (stating that a law is facially unconstitutional if it impermissibly burdened the plaintiff 's rights, such as in the case of a prior restraint); U.S. Const ., amend. I; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2. The term pr ior restraint is used \"to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\" Alexander v. United States , 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (citation omitted). \"Religious worship and discussion are protected speech under the First Amendment. \" Widmar v. Vincent (\"Widmar \"), 454 U.S. 263, 269, n. 6 (1981). Here, the Orders, with the exception of Easter, ban all in-pers on, religious meetings by excluding faith-based services from a list of essential businesses, and prohibiting people from going outside their homes. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 31-50, 62-71. The Orders were issued before the protected speech was to occur bec ause they prohibit congregating to engage in protected speech for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Orders are facially unconstitutional because they act as a prior rest raint to protected speech: religious services.

See IDK, Inc. , 836 F.2d at 1191 (stating that a law is facially unconstitutional if it impermissibly burdens the rights of third parties, such as in the case of an unconstitutionally overbroad law). \"Substantial overbreadth\" is shown not where one shows that he can conceive of some impermissible appl ications of the order, but where one can show a significant number of situation s where an order could be applied to prohibit constitutionally protected speech. Houston v. Hill (\"Houston \"), 482 U.S. 451 (1987) (ordinance--outlawing interruption of police officers while carrying out their duties--was unconstitutionally overbroad bec ause it criminalized substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and all owed police unfettered discretion in enforcement of the ordinance). Here, the purpose of the Orders is to slow the transmission rat e of the COVID- 19 pandemic in California and its counties. However, it virtua lly eliminates all in- person, religious meetings (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 63-67), a form 454 U.S. at 269, n.6), despite the fact that alternatives, su ch as drive-in services, would allow such religious speech without risking transmission. This is a substantial burden because it covers the protected speech that every Californian who attends mosques, temples, synagogues, gurdwaras, and churches r egularly usually would enjoy. In their current form, the Orders do not allow dri ve-in church services; unsigned clarifications from San Bernardino and Riverside Count y allowed such services for Easter, but not f or any Sunday thereafter, nor exc eptions for other faiths. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 49-50. Not only this, but here, akin to Houston , law enforcement officers have unfettered discretion in enforcing the law because they are pro vided no standards as to when to enforce, or exempt some event from, the law. Furthermo re, violators of the Orders are liable for criminal penaltie s. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 67. Be cause the Orders criminalize a substantial amount of protected speech that is un necessary for their underlying purpose, and provide l aw enforcement officers no gui dance as to Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 24 of 35 Page ID #:97 App.248 15 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 enforcement, the Orders are unconstitutionally overbroad, and this Court should grant injunctive relief. 4. The Orders Ban All Public and Private Assembly in Violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and California Constitution. \"The right of free speech, the right to teach, and the right of assembly are, of course, fundamental rights.\" Whitney v. California , 274 U.S. 357, 373 (1927). The First Amendment of the Constitution protects the \"right of the people peaceably to assemble.\" The Freedom of Assembly Clause was incorporated agai nst the sta tes in De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 (1937). The California Constitution also protec ts the right to freely assemble. See, e.g. , Cal. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 3; People v. Chambers , 22 Cal. App 2d 687, 706 (1937) ( \"laws should not infringe upon our guaranteed freedom of speech and lawful assembly.\") . When a government practice restricts fundamental rights, it is subject to \"strict scrutiny\" and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and, even then, only if no less r estrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. , San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U.S. 330 (1972). The Orders and Defendants' enforcement thereof violate the Firs t Amendme nt, both facially and as-applied to Plaintiffs. By denying Plaintif fs the ability to conduct services that complies with the CDC guidelines for social dista ncing, Defendants are in violation of the Freedom of Assembly Clause. Defendants cann ot meet the no-less- restrictive- alternative test. The CDC's social distancing guidelines are ap propriate to limit the spread of COVID-19. Imposing more restrictive require ments that target churches and their drive-in services while at the same time all owing restaurants, coffee shops, marijuana dispensaries to operate drive-ups is no t the least restrictive means of achieving Defendants' public safety goals. Requiring Plaintiffs to abstain from religious gatherings, desp ite substantial modifications to satisfy the public health interests at stake ( modifications that have Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 25 of 35 Page ID #:98 App.249 16 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 been deemed acceptable in the c ases of operations deemed \"essen tial\" by government decree) , violates Plaintiffs' Constitutional right to peaceably assemb le. 5. Defendants' Orders Are Void for Reasons of Vagueness. A regulation is constitutionally void on its face when, as matt er of due process, it is so vague that persons \"of common intelligence must necess arily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. \" Connally v. General Const. Co. , 269 U.S. 385, 391 1090, 1115 (1997). Vague \"trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\" Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 108 -109 (1972). If \"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who a pply them.\" Id. The problem with a vague regulation is that it \"impermissibly delegates basic poli cy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an a d hoc and subjective basis with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminator y application .\" Id.; see also Sessions v. Dimaya , 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1212 (2018). The Orders at issue in this case are so vague as to their scope and application as to run afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Embedded within the State Order is a public health directive to shelter in place. The State Order itself merely orders the public to \"heed\" the public health directive, it does not appear to order compliance therewith; Webster's Dictionary defines the word \"heed\" to mean \"to give consideration or attention to\"\u2014 not to \"adhere \" or comply. Despite this, state and local officials and the media have widely reported the Stat e Order to require compliance with the public health directive by sheltering in place. The San Bernardino and Riverside Orders, for example, both state this. 3 Complt. Ex. 2, \u00b6 2; Ex. 3, \u00b6 1 3 The New York Times, for example, reported that \"Gov. Gavin News om of California on Thursday ordered Californians \u2014all 40 million of them \u2014to stay in their house s....\" As of the date of this filing, the article is available on line at the following URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/u s/California-stay-at-home-o rder- virus.html . Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 26 of 35 Page ID #:99 App.250 17 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 (\"Executive Order N -33-20 issued by the Governor of the State of California . . . ordered all individuals living in the State of California to sta y home . . . .\"). Given this ambiguity, neither Plaintiffs nor any other reasonable person can understand precisely what is being ordered, and what actions may result in criminal penalties, fines, or imprisonment. As such, the State Order is void for vagueness. The San Bernardino and Riverside Orders, and Defendants enforce ment thereof, muddle the issue further. None of the Orders exempt specific re ligious holidays. Nevertheless, San Bernardino County explicitly exempted complia nce during Easter weekend, only. Meuser Decl., Ex. 5. San Bernardino County offic ials have also stated that it \"does not expect law enforcement to broadly impose cita tions on violators\" and that \"the expectation is that law enforcement will rely upon co mmunity members to use good judgment, common sense, and act in the best interest of their own health and the health of their loved ones and t he community at large.\" Meuser Decl., Ex. 2. In apparent self-contradiction, the states that \"non -essential personnel . . . are prohibited from entry into any hospital or long- term care facility,\" ostensibly banning \"non -essential\" people f rom seeking medical care. Complt., Ex. 3. Yet, that same Order states that \"visitors\" may be permitted access to hospita ls under certain conditions. Complt., Ex. 3. No reasonable person can make sense of what conduct is permitte d under the Orders and what conduct will result in criminal penalties. 6. The Orders Violate Plaintiffs' Substantive Due Process Rights Under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Orders and Defendants' enforcement thereof violate Plaintif fs' substantive due process rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U .S. Constitution. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no St ate shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process o f law.\" The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. See Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U.S. 145, 147 -149 (1968). In addition, these Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 27 of 35 Page ID #:100 App.251 18 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individ ual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices tha t define personal iden tity and be liefs. See, e.g. , Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U.S. 438, 453 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479, 484-486 (1965). Plaintiffs' rights to freedom of religion, assembly, speech, an d travel are fundamental rights protected by the U.S. Constitution. See, e.g. , Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500, 520 (1964); Kent v. Dulles , 357 U.S. 116, 127 (1958). When a government practice restricts fundamental right, as is the case here, it is subject to \"strict scrutiny\" and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose, and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternativ e is available. See, e.g. Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa Cnty. , 415 U.S. 250, 257-258 (1974); Dunn, 405 U.S. at 339-341; Shapiro v. Thompson , 394 U.S. 618, 660 (1969); Maher v. Roe , 432 U.S. 464, 488 (1977). Strict scrutiny applies to Plaintiffs' claims because all three Orders mandate that Plaintiffs stay at home because Plaintiffs desired actions are not deemed essential, impinging on their fundamental rights to freedom of religion, a ssembly, speech, and travel. Defendants' mandates are not \"narrowly tailored\" to further any compelling governmental interest. Defendants' have granted numerous specia l exemptions to their bans on public gatherings, includi ng for purportedly \"essential\" businesses and activities, provided that social distancing practices are obser ved; and even for out-of- home religious services during Easter. Since these gatherings can be permitted, there can be no doubt that Defendants may, and therefore must, permit Plaintiffs to engage in equivalent constitutionally-protected activities provided th at Plaintiffs also adhere to the social distancing guidelines. 7. The Orders Violate Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution. All Californians \"are by nature free and independent and have ina lienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 28 of 35 Page ID #:101 App.252 19 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, hap piness, and privacy. Cal. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 1. Understanding the basic fundamental right of liberty, California courts have held that Public Health Officials' authority is limited. Before exercising their full powers to quarantine, there must be \"reasonable grou nds [] to support th e belief that the person so held is infected.\" Ex parte Martin , 83 Cal. App. 2d 164 (1948). Public Health Officials must be able to show \"probab le cause to believe the person so held has an infectious disease ...\" Id. In a case that is somewhat analogous to what Californians are f acing with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, California courts found that Publ ic Health Officials could not quarantine 12 blocks of San Francisco Chinatown becau se of nine deaths due to bubonic plague. See Jew Ho v. Williamson , 103 F. 10 (C.C. Cal. 1900); Wong Wai v. Williamson , 103 F. 1 (C.C. Cal. 1900). These courts found it \"purely arbitrary, unreasonable, unwarranted, wrongf ul, and oppressive interferenc e with the personal liberty of complainant\" who had \"never had or contracted said b ubonic plague; that he has never been at any time exposed to the danger of contracting it, and has never been in any locality where said bubonic plague, or any germs of bact eria thereof, has or have existed. \" Jew Ho, 103 F. at 10. In Jew Ho and Wong Wai , the courts found that there were more than 15,000 people living in the twelve blocks of San Francisco Chinatown w ho were to be quarantined. The courts found it unreasonable to shut down the ability of over 15,000 people to make a living because of nine deaths. This was one de ath for every 1,666 inhabitants of Chinatown. As of July 1, 2020, San Bernardino an d Riverside Counties have a combined population of 4,650,631 individuals and as of April 11, 2020, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties have a total of 66 coronaviru s deaths. That is one death for every 70,464 inhabitants. California courts have found that \"a mere suspicion [of a contagious disease], unsupported by facts giving rise t o reasonable or probable caus e, will afford no justification at all for depriving persons of their liberty and subjecting them to virtual Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 29 of 35 Page ID #:102 App.253 20 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 imprisonment under a purported order of quarantine.\" Ex parte Arta , 52 Cal. App. 380, 383 (1921) (emphasis added). Plai ntiffs have never had or contracted said coronavirus; they have never been at any time exposed to the da nger of contracting it, and have never been in any locality where said coronavirus, or any germs of bacteria thereof, are known to have existed. Requiring Plaintiffs to abstain from all religious gatherings, despite substantial modifications to satisfy the public health interests at stake, violates their California Constitutional liberty rights. 8. Defendants Violate the Equal Pr otection Clause of the Fourteent h Amendment. As to Plaintiffs' seventh claim, the Orders and Defendants' enf orcement thereof violate the Fourteenth Amendment, both facially and as applied to Plaintiffs. The Fourteenth Amendme nt of the Constitution provides that \"[n]o State shall . . . de ny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Equal protection requires the state to govern impartially \u2014not draw arbitrary distinctions between individuals based solely on diff erences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objection. City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr. , 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985). Defendants intentionally and arbitrarily categorize individuals and conduct as eithe r \"essential\" or \"non -essential.\" Those persons classified as \"essential,\" or as participating in essential ser vices, are permitted to go about their business and activities provided certain social dis tancing practices are employed. Id. Those classified as \"nonessential,\" or as engaging in non -essential activities, are required to stay in their residence, unless it becomes necessary for them to leave for one of the enumerated \"essential\" activities. Id. Strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause applies where , as here, the classification impinges on a fundamental right, including the r ight to practice religion freely, to right to free speech and assembly, and the right to travel, among Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 30 of 35 Page ID #:103 App.254 21 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 others. Maynard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of California , 701 F. Supp. 738, 742 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (\"When a law disadvantages a suspect class or impinges upon a 'fundamental right,' the court will examine the law by a pplying a strict scrutiny standard\"), aff'd sub nom. Maynard v. U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of California, 915 F.2d 1581 (9th Cir. 1990). Under strict scrutiny review, the law can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose, and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. Memorial Hospital , 415 U.S. at 257-258. Defendants cannot satisfy strict scrutiny; their arbitrary classifications are not narrowly tailored measures (that further a compelling governmen t interest) because defendants' have granted numerous special exemptions to their b ans on public gatherings, including for purportedly \"essential\" businesses an d activities\u2014provided that social distancing practices are observed \u2014and even for out-of-home religious services during Easter. Since these gatherings can be permitted , there can be no doubt that Defendants must permit Plaintiffs to engage in equivalent constitutionally- protected activities provided that Plaintiffs also adhere to th e social distancing guidelines. B. Plaintiffs Face Imminent Irreparable Harm Absent Immediate Injunctive Relief \"In a case like the one at bar, where the First Amendment is im plicated, the Supreme Court has made clear that '[t]he loss of First Amendmen t freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury' for purposes of the iss uance of a preliminary injunction.\" College Republicans at San Francisco State University v. Reed , 523 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007) citing First Jud. Dist. Ct., 303 F.3d 959, 973-74 (9th Cir. 2002), in turn citing Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)); see also S.O.C., Cnty. of Clark , 152 F.3d 1136, 1148 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that a civil liberties organization that had demonstrated probable success on the merits of its First Amendm ent overbreadth Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 31 of 35 Page ID #:104 App.255 22 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 claim had thereby also demonstrated irreparable harm). \"In other words, t he requirement that a party who is seeking a preliminary injunctio n show 'irreparable injury' is deemed fully satisfied if the party shows that, with out the injunction, First Amendment freedoms would be lost, even for a short period.\" Reed , 523 F. Supp. 2d at 1011. \"Unlike a monetary injury, violations of the First Amendment 'c annot be adequately remedied through damages.'\" Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Harris , 182 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1058 586 F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009)). Without an injunction preventing Defendants from further enforc ing the Orders will suffer irreparable harm i n the form of deprivation of fund amental freedoms secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Const itution and the California Constitution. Plaintiffs' irreparable injuries cannot adequately be compensated by damages or any other remedy available at law. Th us, irreparable injury is clearly shown, necessitating the relief Plaintiffs seek in this Application. C. The Balance of Hardships Tips Decidedly in Plaintiffs' Favor . In cases implicating constitutional rights , \"the 'balancing of the hardships' factor also tends to turn on wheth er the challengers can show t hat the regulations they attack are su bstantially overbroad.\" Reed , 523 F. Supp. 2d at Plaintiffs' showing of the facially and as -applied invalidity of the vague, overbroad Orders, Plaintiffs necessarily have shown that leavin g those Orders in place for even a brief period of time \"would substantially chill the exercise of fragile and constitutionally fundamental rights,\" and thereby constitute an intolerable hardship to Plaintiffs. Reed , 523 F.Supp.2d at 1101. As mentioned above, Defendants' ban on communal religious services will deprive Plaintiffs, and potent ially millions of other Californians, of their ability to exercise religious freedom as secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 1 of the California Constitut ion. By contrast, temporarily enjoining Defendants' enforcement of the Orders will not result in hardship to Defendants, who are in a position to adopt, at least on an Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 32 of 35 Page ID #:105 App.256 23 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 interim basis, a more narrowly crafted set of equally applied provisions that enable the government to achieve any legitimate ends without unjustifiably invading First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms. See id. In addition, Defendants will suffer no legitimate harm by accommodating a Plaintiffs' exercise of fundamental rights in the same manner Defendants are accommodating thousands \u2014and millions\u2014of others engaged in secular activities. The Constitution demands no less . D. Injunctive Relief Is in the Public Interest \"As the Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized, there is a significant public interest in upholding First Amendment principles.\" Americans for Prosperity Foundation , 182 F. Supp. 3d at 1059 (internal citations omitted); see also Doe (9th Cir.2014); Sammartano , 303 F.3d at 974. As such, the requirement that issuance of a preliminary injunction be in the \"public interest\" usually is deemed satisfied when it is clear that core constitu tional rights would remain in jeopardy unless the court intervened. Reed, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 1101. The public is best served by preserving a foundational tenet of thi s American democracy: religious liberty. See Sammartano , 303 F.3d at 974 (\"Courts considering requests for preliminary injunctions have consistently recognized the significant public interest in upholding First Amendment principles.\"). As discussed above, Plaintiffs' core constitutional rights to practice religion freely, free speech, due process, and equal protection, will re main in jeopardy so long as Defendants remain free to enforce their Orders. Accordingly, issuance of injunctive relief is proper, and the Court should grant this Application. II. THE COURT SHOULD DISPENSE WITH ANY BOND REQUIREMENT Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides tha t a TRO or preliminary injunction may be issued \"only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrong fully enjoined or restrained.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8 Filed 04/14/20 Page 33 of 35 Page ID #:106 App.257 24 Plaintiffs' Application for TRO and Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK For OSC Re: Preliminary Injunction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 However, the Court has discretion as to whether any security is required and, if so, the amount thereof. See, e.g., Jorgensen v. Cassiday , 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs request that the Court waive any bond requirement, b ecause enjoining Defendants from unconstitutionally enforcing the orders as to r eligious activities will not financially affect Defendants, who already categorically ex empt specified non- religious activities from compliance. A bond would, however, be burdensome on already burdened Plaintiffs under these circumstances. See, e.g., Bible Club v. Placentia-Yorba Linda School Dist. , 573 F. Supp. 2d 1291, fn. 6 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (waiving requirement of student group to post a bond where case involved \"the probable violation of [the clu b's] First Amendment rights\" and minimal damages to the District of issuing injunction); citing Doctor John's, Inc. v. Sioux City , 305 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1043-44 (N.D. Iowa 2004) (\"requiring a bond to issue before enjoining potentially unconstitutional conduct by a governmenta l entity simply seems inappropriate, because the rights po tentially impinged by the governmental entity's actions are of such gravity that protection of those rights should not be contingent upon an ability to pay.\"). CONCLUSION Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant Plaintiffs ' motion for a temporary restraining order, and issue an order to show cause w hy a preliminary injunction should not be issued, as follows: 1. Defendants, as well as their agents, employees, and successors in office, shall be restrained and enjoined from enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with any prohibition on Plaintiffs' engagement in religious service s, practices, or activities at w hich the Center for Disease Control's social distancing guideline s are followed. 2.

The Court ENJOINS Defendants from enforcing, attempting to enfo rce; threatening to enforce; or otherwise requiring compliance with any prohibition on any faith based or religious services in the State of California wh ere the faith based or religious services are being conducted within the guidelines fo r social distancing issued by the Center for Disease Control. Unless the Court enters this Temporary Restraining Order, all f aith based or religious services will suffer irreparable harm. The government has substantially burdened and plans to continue to substantially burden the reli gious practice of Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 8-1 Filed 04/14/20 Page 2 of 3 Page ID #:110 App.261 2 Temporary Restraining Order and OSC Case No. 5:20-cv-00755-JGB- KK Why Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 millions of Californians. Notice to the Defendants before entering this Temporary Restrai ning Order is not necessary. The facts in the Verified Complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to Plaintiffs a nd all Californians who wish to freely exercise their religious rights will result befo re defendants may be heard in opposition. Mark Meuser, Plaintiffs' lawyer, certified that he sent Defendants a copy of the compl aint before the filing of this Motion for Temp orary Restraining Order. The Court issues this Temporary Restraining Order without notice because of the immediate and ongoing harm to the fundamental constitutiona l right to free exercise of religion. Providing notice to Defendants before ent ering this Temporary Restraining Order would be impractical in such a short period o f time. Plaintiffs do not need to post a security because enjoining def endants from prohibiting religious services that comply with the CDC guidance on social distancing does not interfere with Defendants ' rights. The Court ORDERS Defendants to show cause why a preliminary inj unction should not issue in this matter. The Court will hold a telephonic hearing on the preliminary injunction motion on ________ at __:__ __M. Defenda nts shall file any opposition no later than ___________, and are encourage to consolidate briefs. Plaintiffs may file a reply no later than ___________.

Clarification of religious services and face-coverings order Published April 8, 2020 | By County of San Bernardino The need has arisen for clarification of a Public Health Order and subsequent guidanceissued Tuesday regarding religious servicesand face coverings. The County acknowledges the manner in which the order and guidance were created and disseminated created unintended consequences and hardships. The County has taken steps to ensureappropriate notice and coordination will occur in the future as we address the complicated and fast-moving crisisfaced by our community and the entire world. \"We recognize the need to act quickly to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout San Bernardino County,\" said Board of Supervisors Chairman Curt Hagman. \"But we also recogni ze that we must take into consideration the myriad of impacts that can be felt in a large and diverse count y, and be willing to provide clarification and make adjustments while keeping our communities safe and healthy.\" The specific references to drive-in religious services so close to major religious observances taking place during the next four days, for which organizations had already conducted considerable planning and incurred expenses,are clarified as follows: Organizations that have planned such services for the coming weekend should proceed with those services if they choose to do so and make every effort to prevent contact between congregants. Regarding the use of face-coverings while driving, there is no need for drivers traveling alone or with members of their households to wear face coverings unless they must lower their windows to interact with first responders, food service workers, or others who are not members of their households. Other clarifying guidance will be forthcoming.On the subject of enforcement, the public is advised that altho ugh violation of a health order is a violation of the California Health and Safety Code, the County does not expect l aw enforcement to broadly impose citations on violators. The expectation is that law enforcement will rely upon community members to use good judgment, common sense, and act in the best interests of their own health and the health of their loved ones and the community at large. The imposition of penalties on members of t he public who willfully and grossly disregard public health orders by putting others at risk of exposure to this infectious disease is meant as a tool for law enforcement to use as a deterrent. San Bernardino County has 547 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and t he deaths of 17 county residents have been associated with the disease.Various appropriate County departments and agencies have been w orking together since Jan. 25 to protect the community from the COVID-19 pandemic.

A copy of the Order is attached here as Exhibit A . In a facially overbroad response to the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when Californians of faith need spiritual solace most, Defendants -Appellees \u2014all of whom are California State and county officials \u2014have criminalized communal religious gatherings across California. In March and April 2020, Appellees issued a series of orders requiring the public to shelter in place until further notice , including : (1) the March 19, 2020 Executive Order N -20-33 (\"Executive Order\") issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom, attached here as Exhibit B; and (2) the April 7, 2020 \"Order of the Health Officer of the County of San Bernardino for the Control of COVID -19\" (the \"San Bernardino Order\") attached here as Exhibit C. The Executive Order and San Bernardino Order are hereafter referred to as the \"Shelter -In-Place Orders.\" 1 1 In the district court, Appellants also challenge a shelter -in-place order issued by Riverside County officials. Appellants understand that Riverside County now relies solely on the Executive Order for purposes of enforcement. See https://www.rivcoph.org/Portals/0/Documents/CoronaVirus/April/News/4.29.20_k aiser_order_CLARIFICATION.pdf?ver =2020 -04-29-160508 - 500&timestamp=1588201557824 . Accordingly, Appellants seek emergency injunctive relief as to the Executive Order and San only. Case: 391) App.331 x Despite nominally applying to all persons in California , the Shelter -In-Place Orders permit \"essential\" businesses (as determined by Appellees on an ad hoc basis) to continue operations provided they comply with social distancing protocols that by now have become familiar to all Americans \u2014namely, by having customers remain six feet apart. These essential businesses include, for example, grocery stores, marijuana dispensaries, hardware stores, and shipping providers. No such accommodation is afforded to houses of worship and their congregants . Thus , Appellants \u2014each of whom are practicing Christians, and three of whom are religious leaders in their respective communities \u2014may lawfully stand six feet apart in line with dozens of strangers while waiting to pay for groceries. They may shop for hammers in aisle 6 with several strangers. They may linger in the wine section of any number of alcohol retailers in California for an unlimited time. But if they attempt to enter their house of worship for the purpose of receiving or providing the Sacrament of Holy Communion, however, they are labeled criminals and may be arrested, imprisoned for up to ninety days, and fined up to one thousand dollars. There is only one meaningful difference between these activities: the activities permitted by the State are motivated by secular concern s (physical sustenance , home improvement/maintenance, or consuming alcohol ), while the latter is motivated by religious conviction (spiritual sustenance) . And yet, of these Case: xi actions, the Shelter -In-Place Orders expressly criminalize only the actions undertaken with the religious purpose . Even though many other gatherings are also banned, the wide array of activities that are permitted under the Shelter -in-Place orders, makes it clear that the government has selected winners and losers in the enjoyment of civil rights in a manner that places religion at a lower level of importance than numerous secular actions. Falling woefully short of a neutral order of general applicability, the Shel ter-In-Place Orders facially criminalize certain acts only when motivated by religious belief. 2 This, the U.S. and California Constitutions do not abide, even for a day. On April 13, 2020, Appellants filed suit, challenging the Shelter -In-Place Orders and moving for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why preliminary injunctive relief should not issue . Dkts. 3 1, 8. On April 23, 2020, following a full briefing and hour -long telephone hearing on the matter, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California issued an Order denying Plaintiffs - Appellants' motion . Ex. A. A copy of the reporter's transcript of the hearing is 2 Other example s include : (1) socially distancing in a park (permitted) versus socially distancing at a cemetery for a funeral (prohibited); (2) performing an elective surgery at a hospital (permitted) versus performing a baptism (prohibited); and (3) providing plumbing services at another's home (permitted) versus providing the Sacr ament of Reconciliation (prohibited). 3 All citations to \"Dkt.\" in this filing refer to the district court's docket this case. Case: xii attached here as Exhibit D . In it, the court did not grant Appellants' request, in their moving papers and at the hearing, for a preliminary inju nction hearing. With each passing moment, Appellants suffer irreparable harm of the worst caliber: a severe deprivation of religious libert y. This Court should therefore immediately enjoin enforcement of Appellees' orders against religious activities that comply with the same social distancing protocols that \"essential\" businesses follow . See, e.g. , Pickup v. Brown , No. 12 -17681, 2012 WL 6869637, at *1 (9th Cir. Dec. 21, 2012) (grant ing an injunction pending an appeal following denial of preliminary injunction motion). (3) When and how counsel was notified : The undersigned counsel notified counsel for Appellees by email on April 27, 2020 of Appellants' intent to file a notice of appeal and to thereafter request that this Court expedite that appeal. On May 1, 2020, counsel further notified Appellees' counsel and this Court of Appellants' intent to file this Emergency Motion seeking interim injunctive relief. Appellees have indicated that they oppose Appellants' request to expedite , but they have not yet indicated their position as to Appellants' request for eme rgency injunctive relief . (4) Timeliness and Relief Sought Below: On April 13, 2020, Appellants filed their Verified Complaint with the district court , followed by their emergency request for temporary and preliminary Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, injunctive relief on April 14, 2020. Dkts. 1, 8. A copy of the Verified Complaint is attached here as Exhibit E . Appellees filed oppositions to the motion on April 17, 2020 . Dkts. 13 -15. Appellants filed their reply and motion for leave to file the same on April 19. 4 Dkt. 30. On April 22, 2020, the district court held a telephonic hearing on Appellants' motion, and later issued an Order denying the motion on April 2 3, 2020 . Ex. A. Appellants filed their notice of appeal the following court day, April 27, 2020. Dkt. 52. The transcript for the April 22 hearing was completed and received by counsel on April 30. See Dtks. 59 -60. Appellants filed this Motion three days thereafter , on May 3, 2020. Appellants have proceeded in this matter as expeditiously as reasonably possible . They do so in the face of Appellees' Shelter -In-Place Orders, which restrict access to ordinary business environs otherwise available to Appellants and their counsel . Further, since the district court has already refused to provide the interim injunctive relief of the same form sought by this Motion (or even a hearing on such relief) , Appellants submit that filing a repetitive request with the district court for relie f pending this appeal would be impracticable and waste judicial resources ; the district court has already denied Appellants' motion for injunctive 4 As of the date of this filing , the district court has not yet issued any order on Appellants' unopposed motion for leave t o 05/03/2020, xiv relief on the same set of facts , after a full briefing, and a nearly hour -long hearing . Accordingly, Appellan ts do not intend to file a separate motion in the district court for entry of an injunction pending this appeal. Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, 391) App.336 1 INTRODUCTION Flouting the U.S. and California Constitutions, Appellees have unilaterally decided that communal religious worship is not \"essential\" during the current coronavirus crisis . Under Appellees' Shelter -In-Place Orders, secular activities of an indistinguishable nature from religiously -motivated activities are still permitted , provided that certain social distancing protocols are observed. As a result, Appellants and their congregations are free to stroll down the busy aisles of their local grocery store; go to the hospital for certain types of elective surgeries; and even arrange for plumbers, electricians , and exterminators to come into their homes for extended periods. Yet, they cannot go to church; attend a baptism; gather to pray for the sick and dying; or even attend an outdoor funeral service for departed loved ones, regardless of the precautions they may take . The Shelter -In-Place Orders violate Appellants' fundamental rights to religious liberty, freedom of speech and assembly, and due process and equal protection under the law. Accordingly , Appellants respectfully request that this Court grant thei r Emergency Motion and enjoin enforcement of the orders against religious activities compliant with the Center for Disease Control's social distancing standards pending this appeal , or, alternatively, 391) App.337 2 STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION This Court may hear appeals from interlocutory orders of the District Court, which grant, continue, modify, refuse, or dissolve injunctions. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). An order denying a temporary restraining order may be appealable if it is tantamount to the denial of a preliminary injunction . Religious Tech. Ctr., Church of Scientology Int'l, Inc. v. Scott , 869 F.2d 1306, 1308 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing Envtl. Defense Fund, Inc. v. Andrus , 625 F.2d 861, 862 (9th Cir. 1980) ). This is so where the denial followed a \"full adversary hearing\" and if, \"i n the absence of review, the appellant would be effectively foreclosed from pursuing further interlocutory relief.\" Andrus , 625 F.2d at 862. Here, this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal because the Order below is tantamount to the denial of a preliminary injunction. Appellants had moved for (1) a temporary restraining order and (2) an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issu e. Dkt. 8. The district denied their requests following a full briefing on the merits and a lengthy telephonic hearing, at which all parties were represented by counsel . Ex. D. At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellants' counsel renewed their request for a further hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue . Ex. D. The Honorable Jesus G. Bernal responded by stating that he App.338 3 thereafter issued the Order denying Appellants' motion in full , and without setting any further hearing on Appellants' request for a preliminary injunction . Exs. A, D. By denying Appellants' motion, the district court effectively decided the merits of the case and foreclosed the possibility of any further interlocutory relief. In the Order, t he district court erroneously held , for example, that \"as acts of the executive in response to a national emergency, the [Shelter -In-Place] Orders are subject to only minimal scrutiny, which they easily survive.\" Ex. A, p. 4. The court further held that \"even absent consideration of greater leeway afforded to executive acts during a state of emergency, the [Shelter -In-Place] Orders do not violate Plaintiffs' rights under traditional constitutional analysis,\" because the orders survive rational basis review. Ex. A. The court's decision, while incorrect, conclusively denies interlocutory injunctive relief . Given the evolving nature of the government 's response to the coronavirus outbreak , interlocutory relief may very well be the only relief Appellants may expect to achieve in this action. As such, the district court's order is tantamount to an order denying injunctive relief altogether, which decision this Court has jurisdiction to review. FACTUAL BACKGROUND On March 13, 2020, President Donald J. Trump proclaimed a National State of Emergency following an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID App.339 4 28. In the weeks since , the federal government's projections of the anticipated national death toll from the virus has decrease d substantially. 5 Id. On March 4, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency as a result of the threat of COVID -19. Id. at \u00b6 30. On March 19, 2020, Newsom issued the Executive Order , requiring that \"all residents . . . heed the current State publ ic health directives.\" Ex. B . The state public health directive requires \"all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastruc ture sectors . . . .\" Id. The directive states that it \"shall stay in effect until further notice.\" Id. On March 22, 2020, the California Public Health Officer designated a list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers.\" Ex. L, p. 16 -24. Included on the list of the \"essential workforce\" are variety of activities, including services provided by coffee baristas, grocery stor es, and laundromat s. The list also includes \"faith based services that are provided through streaming or other technolo gy.\" Id. at p. 26 . Accordingly, the Executive Order prohibits religious leaders from providing 5 According to data released by the Center for Disease Control, the percentage of hospital visits for influenza -like illnesses (\"ILI\") has fallen sharply in recent weeks and is currently lower than ILI rates at the end of 2019, before an y known outbreak of COVID -19 in the United 5 communal religious services to their congregations , regardless of whether any non - technological measures might be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of the vi rus spreading, such as offering socially -distanced seating for family units, or mask and glove requirements. Ex. E, \u00b6 34. On or about April 7, 2020, Dr. Erin Gustafson signed the San Bernardino Order. Ex. C . As with the Executive Order, the San Bernardino Order \"allow[s] faith based services that are provided through streaming or other technology.\" Id. The order also provides that any violation \"is a crime punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both ,\" and that it will remain in effect \"until rescin ded.\" Id. On April 8, 2020, San Bernardino County issued a \"Clarification of religious services and face -covering order\" stating that \"[o]n the subject of enforcement, the public is advised that although violation of a health order is a violation of the California Health and Safety Code, the County does not expect law enforcement to broadly impose citations on violators.\" Id. The Clarification further provided that religious o rganizations that \"have planned [] services for the coming [Easter] weekend should proceed with those services if they choose to do so and make every effort to prevent contact between congregants.\" Id. at \u00b6 49. 6 6 In Governor Newsom's opposition brief filed in the district court, he indicated that drive -in worship services were permitted under the Executive Order as a form of \"other technology.\" Dkt. 13. Thereafter, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties issued statements indicating that drive -in worshi p services 6 Appellant Patrick Scales' church, Shield of Faith Family Church, Inc., is located in San Bernardino County. 7 Id. at \u00b6 51; Ex. I . He desires to hold in -person religious services for those congregants who desire to attend church. Ex. E, \u00b6 52. Scales believes that he can hold such religious services and abide by social distancing tips recommended by the CDC by keeping congregants at least six feet apart and providing masks and gloves. Id. at \u00b6 53. He believes that religious services are essential for the spiritual health of the congregation so that the congregants may exhort one another during these difficult times. Id. at \u00b6 54. Scales recognizes that most of his congregants will stay at home, but he wants to be available for those who are healthy and feel that in -person church service can be safely attended with social d istancing and other measures. Id. at \u00b6 55. Appellant Wendy Gish attends Shield of Faith Family Church and would attend an in -person church service should it be made available to her. 8 Id. at \u00b6 56; Ex. G . She regularly attends church services and believes that she has a scriptural command to \"not neglect meeting together.\" Ex. E, \u00b6 A copy of Scales' declaration submitted to the district court is attached here as Exhibit I . 8 A copy of Gish's declaration submitted to the district court is attached here as Exhibit G . Case: Appellant James Moffatt's church, Church Unlimited , is located in Riverside County. 9 Id. at \u00b6 73; Ex. H . Upon learning about the coronavirus, he immediately had his church building cleaned and disinfected. Ex. E, \u00b6 74. Moffatt ensured that sanitizing materials were available to each person who entered his church and encouraged family units to sit at least six feet apart. Id. at \u00b6 75. He encouraged anyone who was uncomfortable with gathering to stay at home. Id. at \u00b6 76. He also encouraged anyone experiencing symptoms of illness to stay at home. Id. at \u00b6 77. On April 9, 2020, Moffatt was threatened with a fine of on e thousand dollars for holding a church service on April 5, 2020, Palm Sunday. Ex. H . But for the Executive Order, Moffatt would continue to hold in -person religious services in Riverside County, while taking the same social distancing precautions taken by the laundry list of \"essential businesses\" that continue to operate in the county, despite any prevalence of COVID -19. He believes that it is important for Christians to come together, remember, and celebrate all that Jesus has done for this world. Id. at \u00b6 80. Appellant Brenda Wood's church, Word of Life Ministries International Inc. is located in Riverside County. 10 Id. at \u00b6 82; Ex. J . Word of Life Ministries 9 A copy of Moffatt's declaration submitted to the district court is attached here as Exhibit H . 10 A copy of Wood's declaration submitted to the district court is attached here as Exhibit J . Case: 391) App.343 8 International Inc. has approximately 20 -30 regular attendees. Ex. E, \u00b6 83. Wood believes Scripture commands her to provide opportunities for the believers to obey Hebrews 10:25 where the believers meet together and encourage one another. Id. at \u00b6 84. Durin g a drive -up Easter Sunday service at her church , communion was served by an individual wearing a mask and gloves and the elements were pre - packaged. Ex. J. The person serving Holy C ommunion used tongs to remove the communion cups from the pre -packaged box . Ex. E, at \u00b6 88. At this time, Wood has postponed all baptisms at her church. Id. at \u00b6 89. She would like to hold drive - up church services every Sunday , including by following reasonable precautions while sharing Holy Communion with her congregation . Id. at \u00b6 89. THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW On April 13, 2020, Appellants filed their Verified Complaint, followed by an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue on April 14, 2020. Ex. E; Dkt. 8. Appellees filed oppositions to the motion on April 17, 2020. Dkts. 13 -15. Appellants filed their reply and motion for leave to file the same on April 19. Dkt. 30. On April 22, 2020, the District Court held a telephonic heari ng on Appellants' motion, and later issued the Order denying the motion on April 24, 2020. App.344 9 Appellants filed their notice of appeal on the following court day, April 27, 2020. This Motion followed . RELIEF SOUGHT Pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant injunctive relief pending the outcome of their appeal as follows: Defendants -Appellees, as well as their agents, employees, and successors in office, shall be restrained and enjoined from enforcing, attempting to enforce, threatening to enforce, or otherwise requiring compl iance with any prohibition on Plaintiffs -Appellants' engagement in religious services, practices, or activities at which the Center for Disease Control's social distancing guidelines are followed. Alternatively , Appellants request that this Court issue an order expediting this matter to the extent reasonably possible, including by requiring simultaneous briefing on the merits, and by scheduling a telephonic oral argument for the earliest date available with the Court. LEGAL STANDARD A temporary restraini ng order and preliminary injunction preserves the status quo and prevents irreparable harm until a decision may be reached on the merits. See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers , 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974) ; Stuhlbarg Int'l Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc. , 240 F.3d 832, 839 391) App.345 10 This Court has established two sets of criteria for evaluat ing a request for injunctive relief. Earth Island Inst. v. United States Forest Serv. , 351 F.3d 1291, 1297 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the \"traditional\" criteria, a plaintiff must show (1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted, (3 ) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) advancement of the public interest. See, e.g. , Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Alternatively, injunctive relief may be appropriate when a movant raises \"serious questions going to the merits\" and the \"balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,\" provided that the plaintiff is able to show there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest. All. for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). ARGUMENT I. THIS COURT SHOULD ENJOIN ENFORCEMENT OF APPELLEES' SHELTER -IN-PLACE ORDERS AGAINST SOCIALLY -DISTANCED RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES PENDING THIS APPE AL. A. Appellants Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits . Central to each of Appellants ' eleven causes of action asserted under the U.S. and California Constitutions is Appellees' criminalization App.346 11 religious purposes .11 Appellants are likely to succeed on each of their claims, and , at an absolute minimum, they have established serious constitutional questions concerning Appellants' rights, such that immediate injunctive relief is proper. See Cottrell , 632 F.3d at 1131. 1. The Shelter -In-Place Orders violate Appellants' fundamental rights , including freedom of religion, assembly, speech, due process, and equal protection . The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits government actors from enforcing any \"law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U. S. Const. amend. I ; see also Cantwell v . Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940). The California Constitution similarly protects the \"[f]ree exercise and enjoyment of religion wi thout discrimination or preference.\" Cal. Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 4; see also Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court , 32 Cal. 4th 527, 562 (2004) . \"Religious worship and discussion are 11 The Verified Complaint asserts the following causes of action: ( 1) violation of the Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment; (2) violation of the Establishment Clause of First Amendment; (3) violation of the Free Speech Clause of First Amendment; (4) violation of the First Amendment Freedom of Assembly; (5) violation o f the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment by reason of vagueness; (6) violation of substantive rights protected by the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment; (7) violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment; (8) violation of the Right to Liberty (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 1); (9) Freedom of Speech (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 2 ); (10) Freedom of As sembly (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 3 ); and (11) Free Exercise and Enjoyment of Religion (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 4 12 protected speech under the First Amendment.\" Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263, 269, n. 6 (1981). \"[I]f a law pursues the government's interest 'only against conduct motivated by religious belief,' but fails t o include in its prohibitions substantial, comparable secular conduct that would similarly threaten the government's interest, then the law is not generally applicable\" and is subject to strict scrutiny. Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman , , 508 U.S. at 542 -46); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993). Relatedly, the \"First Amendment mandates governmental neutrali ty between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.\" McCreary Cnty., Ky. v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ky. , 545 U.S. 844, 860 (2005) . Here, the Shelter -In-Place Orders violate the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of First Amendment and related protections provided by the California Constitution. The orders are simultaneously underinclusive \u2014by permitting equally risky non -religiously motivated activities \u2014and overinclusive \u2014 by pr oscribing religious activities to a degree greater than necessary, as made evident by \"essential\" business es being allowed to continue operations . See On Fire Christian Ctr., Inc. v. Fischer , No. 3:20 -CV-264-JRW, 2020 WL 1820249, at *7 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020) (granting against Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, 13 Louisville's prohibition on religious gatherings); First Baptist v. Kelly , No. 20-1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, at *6 (D. Kan. Apr. 18, 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order against Kansas State's prohibition on religious gatherings). The orders are also unconstitutionally vague on their faces , indefinite in effect, and afford law enforcement unfettered discretion in deciding which religious ceremonies may be observed and which may not . Connally v. General Const. Co. , 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (holding that a regulation is constitutionally void on its face when, as matter of due process, it is so vague that persons \"of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"); see also Sessions v. Dimaya , 138 S. C t. 1204, 1212 (2018) . This discretion has already been exercised by officials , who discriminatorily suspended the orders on an important day for Christians (Easter) , without doing so on days important to other faiths .12 When a government practice restricts fundamental rights, it is subject to strict scrutiny and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government 12 On April 8, 2020, San Bernardino County officials issued the Clarification, excepting religious services held on Easter weekend from the San Bernardino Order. Ex. F, p. 14. The Clarification further provided that the \"County does not expect law enforcem ent to broadly impose citations on violators.\" Id. On April 10, 2020, Riverside County officials issued a similar statement, declaring that \"[d]rive - in religious services [would be] permitted [Easter] 391) App.349 14 purpose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. , San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1, 16 -17 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U.S. 330 (1972) . In their current form, the Shelter -In-Place Orders do not allow any gatherings undertaken for a religious purpose, even those that can take place while mainta ining CDC guidelines on social distancing. Exs. B -C. This is a substantial burden because it prohibits every Californian from attend ing religious services during this time of crisis; not all Californians own cars or have access to \" other technology\" needed to engage in communal worship while sheltering at home . Violators of the orders are liable for harsh criminal penalties including a fine of up to one thousand dollars and imprisonment for up to ninety days. The Shelter -In- Place Orders are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and under Article One, Sections One through Four of the California Constitution. This Court should therefore immediately enjoin enforcement of the orders as to soc ially-distanced religious practices for the duration of this appeal . 2. The presence of an emergency does not subjugate fundamental rights to executive whims. The district court improperly relied on J acobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (19 05) when 391) App.350 15 that during a state of emergency executive actions are reviewed with \"minimal scrutiny.\" Ex. A. However, Jacobson is inapposite to the facts at hand. In Jacobson , the Supreme Court upheld a conviction under a Massachusetts statute that criminalized the de fendant's refusal to vaccinate himself from smallpox, despite the defendant's assertion that the statute violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights. Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 12. Jacobson was decided decades before the First Amendment was held to apply to the St ates by incorporation ; it was not a case involving religious liberty . See Gitlow v. New York , 268 U.S. 652 (1925) (incorporating the Free Speech Clause against the States ); De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937) (Free Assembly Clause); Edwards v. South Carolina , 372 U.S. 229 (1963) (Right to Petition). As such, Jacobson does not, and could not, control this Court's analysis of Appellants' First Amendment claims. During th e 115 years since Jacobson was decided, the Supreme Court has developed a substantial and durable body of case law establishing, unequivocally, that a state's infringement of fundamental rights enshrined by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are subject to the most rigorous from of judicial scrutiny: strict scrutiny. See, e.g. , New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (\"The word 'security' is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.\"). The Court should not abandon this analysis here, for the first time. Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, App.351 16 Even under Jacobson , government action is still rendered unconstitutional if it \"has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\" Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 31 ; see also Robinson v. Marshall , No. 2:19CV365 -MHT, 2020 WL 1847128 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 12, 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order to abortion providers) (appeal pending) ; First Baptist Church , No. 20 -1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, at *3 (applying strict scrutiny to the plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations arising from Kansas' prohibition on public gatherings) . Appellees canno t meet even the more deferential standard applied in Jacobson ; their indefinite and total ban on gatherings undertaken for purposes of communal worship is beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of fundamental rights protected by the First and Four teenth Amendments. B. Appellants Face Imminent Irreparable Harm Absent Immediate Injunctive Relief . \"In a case like the one at bar, where the First Amendment is implicated, the Supreme Court has made clear that '[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury' for purposes of the iss uance of a preliminary injunction.\" College Republicans at San Francisco State University v. Reed , 523 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007) Sammartano v. Jud. Dist. Ct. , 303 F.3d 959, 973 -74 (9th Cir. 2002) , in turn citing Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) ); 1148 (9th Cir. 1998) . \"Unlike a monetary injury, violations of the First Amendment 'cannot be adequately remedied through damages.'\" Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Harris , 182 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1058 (C.D. F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009) ). Without an injunction preventing Appellees from further enforcing the Shelter -In-Place Orders , Appellants will suffer irreparable harm in the form of deprivation s of fundamental freedoms secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendment s to the U.S. and the California Constitution s.

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1657 , Fed. R. App. P. 27 , and Circuit Rule 27 -12, Appellants respectfully move in the alternative for expedited treatment of this case . Appellants request that the Court issue an order requiring simultaneous briefing on the merits. Alternatively, Appellants request that the Court set an expedited briefing schedule as follows: May 11, 2020 : Appellants file their opening brief; May 21, 202 0: Appellees file their responding brief; May 27, 2020 : Appellants file their reply brief. Appellants further request that the Court schedule oral argument for as soon as practicable thereafter. Pursuant to Circuit Rule 27(a), Appellants notified Appellee s of their intent to file this Motion, and counsel for Appellees have indicate d that they oppose any expedited treatment of this appeal . Appellants submit that their appeal warrants to be further expedited for the following reasons: 1. As an appeal follow ing the denial of temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, this matter is entitled to priority by statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1657. While the Court has already set an expedited briefing schedule pursuant to Circuit Rule 3 -3, standa rd for all appeals following an order granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief , the current 391) App.354 19 answering brief is due on June 23, 2020. Under the current schedule, Appellants will be deprived of their fundamental rig hts for at least two additional months. 2. This case presents constitutional issues of major and daily significance to millions of Californians . Recognizing the need for prompt review of constitutional issues relating to COVID -19, other courts have expeditiously reviewed those cases. See In re Abbott , 954 F.3d 772 (5th Cir. 2020) (granting writ of mandamus less than one week following the district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction). 3. As discussed above, Appellants continue to suffer irreparable harm with each passing moment. Appe llees have criminalized communal religious worship in violation of Appellants' fundamental rights. 4. The Parties presented full briefs and argument to the district court on an even more expedited basis. The transcript of the hearing at the district court has already been prepared and is available to counsel. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff s-Appellants respectfully request that this Court grant their Motion for injunctive relief pending their appeal, or, alternatively, expedite the appeal by requiring simultaneous or expedited briefing and setting oral argument for as soon as 3, 2020 Dhillon Harmeet K.

No. 8) (IN CHAMBERS) Before the Court is an Emergency Request for Temporary Restraining Order filed by Plaintiffs Patrick Scales, Wendy Gish, James Dean Moffatt, and Brenda Wood. (\"Request,\" Dkt. No. 8.) The Court held a hearing on the Request on April 22, 2020. After considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Request and argument presented at the hearing, the Court DENIES the Request. I. BACKGROUND On April 13, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their complaint against Defendants Xavier Becerra and Gavin Newsom (collectively, \"State Defendants\"); Chad Bianco, Jeff Hewitt, Kevin Jeffries, George Johnson, Cameron Kaiser, V. Manuel Perez, Karen Spiegel, and Chuck Washington (collectively, \"Riverside Defendants\"); Erin Gustafson, John McMahon, Robert A. Lovingood, Janice Rutherford, Dawn Rowe, Curt Hagman, and Josie Gonzales (collectively, \"San Bernardino Defendants\"). (\"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1.) The Complaint alleges eleven causes of action: (1) Violation of Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (2) Violation of Establishment Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (3) Violation of Free Speech Clause of First Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (4) Violation of First Amendment Freedom of Assembly Clause; (5) Violation of Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (6) Violation of Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (7) Violation of Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution; (8) Right to Liberty (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 1); (9) Freedom of Speech (Cal. Const. Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 1 of 2 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv Art. 1, \u00a7 2); (10) Freedom of Assembly (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 3); and (11) Free Exercise and Enjoyment of Religion (Cal. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 4). Plaintiffs filed the Request on April 13, 2020, the same day they filed the Complaint. (Request.) In support of the Request, Plaintiffs filed: Dkt. No. 8-6); Defendants opposed the Request 18.) In support of the State Opposition, State Defendants filed the Declaration of Todd Grabarsky. (Grabarsky Declaration,\" Dkt. No. 13-1.) In support of the Riverside Opposition, Riverside Defendants filed: xRequest for Judicial Dkt. No. 15-4.) In support of the San Bernardino Opposition, San Bernardino Defendants filed a request for judicial notice. (\"San Bernardino RJN,\" Dkt. No. 18-1.) The Court held a telephonic hearing on April 22, 2020. II. REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Riverside Defendants and San Bernardino Defendants separately submit unopposed requests for judicial notice. (See Riverside RJN; San Bernardino RJN.) A court may take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact not subject to \"reasonable dispute,\" either because it is \"generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court,\" or it is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose \"accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, \"[a] court must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2). Judicial notice is appropriate here. The documents at issue are publicly available and not subject to reasonable dispute. Moreover, Defendants request only that the Court take judicial notice of the contents of the documents, not of the truth of those contents. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Riverside RJN and the San Bernardino RJN. III. FACTS On December 31, 2019, China reported incidents of a pneumonia of unknown cause Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 2 of #:1018Case: 3 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv to the World Health Organization. Since then, that infectious disease, which came to be known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has swept the globe, infecting millions and killing nearly two hundred thousand people.1 Defendant Newsom, the Governor of California, declared a State of Emergency in California on March 4, 2020. (Complaint \u00b6 30; Grabarsky Declaration, Exhibit 1.) On March 19, 2020, the Defendant Newsom issued Executive Order N-33-20, which directed all California residents to heed the State's public health directives relating to COVID-19, including the March 19, 2020 Order of the State Public Health Officer (\"State Order\"). (Complaint \u00b6 31; Grabarsky Declaration, Exhibit 3.) The State Order requires \"all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors.\" (Grabarsky Declaration, Exhibit 3.) On March 22, 2020, the Public Health Officer designated a list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers,\" including \"[f]aith based services that are provided through streaming or other technology.\" (Grabarsky Declaration, Exhibit 4.) Defendant Kaiser, Riverside County's Public Health Officer, issued a Declaration of Local Health Emergency in Riverside County on March 8, 2020. (Kaiser Declaration \u00b6 10.) On April 6, 2020, Defendants Kaiser and Johnson issued an Amended Order of the Health Officer for the County of Riverside and of the County Executive Officer as Director of Emergency Services (\"Riverside Order\"). (Complaint \u00b6 62; Kaiser Declaration \u00b6 10, Exhibit I.) The Riverside Order prohibits \"[a]ll public or private gatherings . . . including, but . church, . . . or any other indoor or outdoor space used for any non-essential purpose including, but not limited to . . . church . . . .\" (Complaint \u00b6 63; Kaiser Declaration, Exhibit I.) Consistent with the State Order, the Riverside Order exempts essential business, including \"courts of law, medical providers . care . . necessary shopping at fuel stations, stores or malls,\" provided that a \"state and federal guidelines for infection control\" are observed. (Complaint \u00b6 64; Kaiser Declaration Exhibit I.) The County of San Bernardino Board of Supervisors declared a Local Health Emergency in San Bernardino County on March 10, 2020. (San Bernardino RJN, Exhibits F and G.) On April 7, 2020, Defendant Gustafson, the San Bernardino Health Officer, signed the Order of the Health Officer of the County of San Bernardino for the Control of COVID-19 (\"San Bernardino Order\"). (Complaint 36; The San Bernardino Order \"allow[s] faith based services that are provided through streaming or other technology, while individuals remain in their homes, but does not allow individuals to leave their home for driving parades or drive-up services, or for picking up non-essential items.\" (Complaint \u00b6 37; San Bernardino RJN, Exhibit I.) 1World Health Organization, Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation Report, April 23, 2020 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200423-sitrep-94-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=b8304bf0_4 Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 3 #:1019Case: 4 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv IV. LEGAL STANDARD The purpose of a temporary restraining order is to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable harm until a hearing may be held on the propriety of a preliminary injunction. See Reno Air Racing Ass'n, Inc. v. McCord, 452 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2006). The standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is identical to the standard for issuing a preliminary injunction. Lockheed Missile & Space Co. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 887 F. Supp. 1320, 1323 (N.D. Cal. 1995); see Stuhlbarg Intern. Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brushy and Co., Inc., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2011). \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\" Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Ninth Circuit employs the \"serious questions\" test, which states \"'serious questions going to the merits' and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.\" Alliance for Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). \"A preliminary injunction is an 'extraordinary and drastic remedy.' It should never be awarded as of right.\" Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (citation omitted). When seeking a temporary restraining order through an ex parte application, a plaintiff must further show that he is without fault in creating the crisis necessitating the bypass of regular motion procedures. See Mission Power Eng'g Co. v. Cont'l Gas Co., 883 F. Supp. 488, 492-93 (C.D. Cal. 1995). The propriety of a temporary restraining order, in particular, hinges on a significant threat of irreparable injury, Simula, Inc. Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999), that must be imminent in nature, Caribbean Marine Serv. Co. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988). V. DISCUSSION Plaintiffs request that the Court enjoin enforcement of the State Order, Riverside Order, and San Bernardino Order (collectively, \"Orders\") to \"Plaintiffs' engagement in religious services, practices, or activities at which the Center for Disease Control's social distancing guidelines are followed.\" (Request at 24.) To succeed, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on their claims that the Orders violate their constitutional rights and demonstrate that the other factors weigh in favor of granting the temporary restraining order. A. Success on the Merits or Serious Questions Plaintiffs assert that the Orders violate their constitutionally protected rights, including their right to the free exercise of religion. (Request at 9-21.) In response, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs will not succeed on their constitutional claims for two reasons: First, as acts of the executive in response to a national emergency, the Orders are subject to only minimal scrutiny, Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 4 of #:1020Case: 5 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv which they easily survive.2 (State Opposition at 7-14.) Second, even absent consideration of greater leeway afforded to executive acts during a state of emergency, the Orders do not violate Plaintiffs' rights under traditional constitutional analysis. (State Opposition at 14-19; Riverside Opposition at 16-34; San Bernardino Opposition at 11-17.) 1. Exercise of Executive Powers During State of Emergency State Defendants argue that because the Orders are temporary executive actions taken in response to a national emergency, they are entitled to substantial judicial deference and not subject to traditional constitutional scrutiny. (State Opposition at 7-14.) The Court agrees: Defendants have a right to protect California residents from the spread of COVID-19\u2014even if those protections temporarily burden constitutional rights to a greater degree than normally permissible. The Supreme Court held over a century ago that \"a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 27 (1905). The COVID-19 pandemic threatens the lives of all Californians: indeed, nearly 1,500 have already died.3 The virus has proven to be extremely contagious\u2014it is airborne and can linger on surfaces for days.4 Because asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus can infect others, a belief that one \"has never had or contracted the coronavirus . . . been at any time exposed to the danger of contracting it . . . and has never been in close proximity to any locality where said coronavirus has or have existed\" is largely meaningless. (See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 58, 79.) Anyone could be an unknowing, undetectable vector for the virus at any time. For these reasons, government and health officials have struggled to contain the virus. Without a vaccine, measures limiting physical contact between citizens, such as the Orders, are widely recognized as the only way to effectively slow the spread of the virus. Undoubtedly, the Orders\u2014and the similar orders in effect around the country\u2014restrict the rights and freedoms normally enjoyed by citizens. The residents of California are confined to their homes, unable to gather with friends and family, unable to attend political rallies, unable to enjoy art and recreation, and largely unable to work or go to school. The Orders also prevent Plaintiffs (and all other California residents) from gathering for in-person worship or laying hands upon each other. Because Plaintiffs' religious beliefs compel them to do these things, the Orders 2 Although only the State Defendants advance this argument, the Court will apply it to all three orders. 3 Tracking Coronavirus in California, Los Angeles Times https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/ (last accessed April 23, 2020.) 4 Neeltje van Doremalen, Ph.D., et al., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1 , N. England J. Med. 2020; 382:1564-1567 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973 (last accessed April 23, 2020.) Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 5 of #:1021Case: 6 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv do burden Plaintiffs' unrestrained exercise of their religion. But the Constitution does not guarantee \"an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 26. Indeed, \"[t]he right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community . . . to communicable disease.\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166-67 (1944). Recognizing that the need to protect the public may trump individual rights during a crisis, the Supreme Court has held that states and municipalities have greater leeway to burden constitutionally protected rights during public emergencies: In every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand. Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 29; see also United States v. Caltex, 344 U.S. 149 (1952) (acknowledging that \"in times of imminent peril\u2014such as when fire threatened a whole community\u2014the sovereign could, with immunity, destroy the property of a few that the property of many and the lives of many more could be saved\"). When responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, Defendants \"may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some 'real or substantial relation' to the public health crisis and are not 'beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.'\" In re Abbott, 2020 WL 1685929, at *7 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020) (quoting Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31). In other words, during an emergency, traditional constitutional scrutiny does not apply. Instead, any measures that limit or suspend constitutional rights (1) must have a \"real or substantial relation\" to the crisis and (2) must not represent \"plain, palpable\" invasions of clearly protected rights. Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31. The Orders easily meet that test. First, they have a substantial relation to the COVID-19 crisis: they require the physical distancing that is needed to slow the spread of the virus. Second, there is no \"plain, palpable invasion\" of Plaintiffs' free exercise of religion. While Plaintiffs are unable to gather together in-person, they are free to gather virtually or over the phone. They are also free to gather in-person with the members of their household. They remain free to practice their religion in whatever way they see fit so long as they remain within the confines of their own homes. Although physical contact with others is curtailed, a wide swath of religious expression remains untouched by the Orders. The Orders, therefore, do not represent a plain or palpable invasion of the general right to free exercise of religion. Accordingly, the Orders are likely a permissible exercise of executive authority during a national emergency. 2. Traditional Constitutional Analysis Because the Orders survive the minimal scrutiny required where executive action taken in response to an emergency, the Court need not determine whether the Orders likewise survive traditional constitutional analysis. But they do: the Request must also be denied because the Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 6 of 7 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv Orders likely do not impermissibly infringe on Plaintiffs' constitutional rights even when applying the traditional constitutional scrutiny. a. Free Exercise of Religion Plaintiffs argue that the Orders target religion and must therefore be subjected to a strict scrutiny analysis. (Request at 9-11.) Defendants respond that the Orders are neutral and generally applicable and therefore only rational basis review applies. (State Opposition 15-16; Riverside Opposition at 16-19; San Bernardino Opposition at 11-13.) \"In assessing neutrality and general applicability, courts evaluate both 'the text of the challenged law as well as the effect . . . in its real operation.\" Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1234 (9th Cir. 2020). The Orders are neutral on their faces: they \"make no reference to any religious practice, conduct, belief, or motivation.\" Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064, 1076 (9th Cir. 2015). While they do list faith-based gatherings as a type of in-person gathering that is prohibited, faith- based gatherings are referenced as an example\u2014they are not the target of the Orders. (See e.g., Kaiser Declaration Exhibit I (prohibiting all gatherings including those for \"church\").) Facial neutrality does not require freedom from any mention of religion, instead \"the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993) (emphasis added). Because the orders apply to both religious and secular gatherings, they do not discriminate, and are therefore facially neutral. The Orders are also neutral in operation: they apply to both religious and secular conduct and do not \"substantially underinclude nonreligiously motivated conduct that might endanger the same governmental interest that the law is designed to protect.\" See Stormans, 794 F.3d at 1079. The Supreme Court has long recognized that \"[o]fficial action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 534. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that the Orders target religious conduct over secular conduct. And a review of the Orders demonstrates that both secular and religious conduct are prohibited equally. The majority of the prohibited conduct is secular: schools are closed, restaurants are shuttered, concerts and sporting events are canceled; citizens cannot visit public recreation spaces or gather with friends who live outside of their household; non-essential workers fortunate enough to still have jobs must work from home. Far from singling out religious conduct for additional restrictions, the State Order identifies workers preparing religious videoconferences as essential workers\u2014an exception that facilitates religious conduct. Similar exceptions have not been made for sports, concerts, or non-essential work events. The Orders, therefore, are not restrictions against religion in disguise. They are generally applicable restrictions on gatherings of all kinds. Plaintiffs argue that the Orders are underinclusive of secular activities that may also contribute to the spread of COVID-19 because they allow grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and marijuana dispensaries to remain open. (Request at 10.) But these are all essential services: without access to the food and medicines sold at these locations, more citizens would become ill or die. And despite social distancing the virus is spreading at these locations\u2014grocery store Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed 04/23/20 Page 7 8 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv employees are falling ill and dying.5 If the state applies the same rules to in-person religious gatherings as it does to grocery stores, people will get sick and die from attending religious gatherings just as they are dying from working in grocery stores. Moreover, because the risk of transmission increases with every out-of-home contact, it is necessary to suspend non-essential activities so that essential functions can be less dangerous. Many older and immunocompromised people must leave their homes to purchase food and medicine. Grocery store employees, food preparers, delivery drivers, pharmacists, and other essential workers must go to work to ensure that California residents have what they need to survive. These individuals risk contracting the virus when performing these essential tasks. If those that they encounter engage in non-essential contacts, the risk of transmission increases. But if everyone limits their out-of-home contacts to only essential tasks, the risk decreases. When we all reduce our contacts to the minimum possible level, the rates of transmission go down. In sum, Californians need to stay home whenever possible to protect those who cannot. Finally, as Defendants argued at the hearing, constitutional analysis only requires that the Court compare the prohibited religious conduct with analogous secular conduct when assessing underinclusivity. See Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064, 1079 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that a law is only fatally underinclusive if it prohibits religious conduct but not \"comparable secular conduct\"). An in-person religious gathering is not analogous to picking up groceries, food, or medicine, where people enter a building quickly, do not engage directly with others except at points of sale, and leave once the task is complete. Instead, it is more analogous to attending school or a concert\u2014activities where people sit together in an enclosed space to share a communal experience. Those activities are prohibited under the Orders. Because the Orders treat in-person religious gatherings the same as they treat secular in-person communal activities, they are generally applicable. Because the Orders are facially neutral and generally applicable, they are subject to rational basis review. Stormans, Inc., 794 F.3d at 1075-76. And they easily survive rational basis: the social distancing measures implemented by the Order are rationally related to slowing the spread of COVID-19\u2014a state interest that is not only legitimate but compelling. Accordingly, the Orders likely do not violate the Free Exercise Clause. b. Establishment of Religion A government action violates the Establishment Clause if it lacks a \"secular legislative purpose\" or endorses religion. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971); see also Trunk v. City of San Diego, 629 F.3d 1099, 1106 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting that \"the Supreme Court 5 Dalvin Brown, COVID-19 Claims Lives of 30 Grocery Store Workers, Thousands More May Have It, Union Says , USA Today, https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/14/coronavirus-claims-lives-30-grocery-store-workers-union-says/2987754001/ (last accessed April 23, 2020.) (continued . . . ) Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 51 Filed #:1024Case: 9 of 9 CIVIL MINUTES\u2014GENERAL I nitials of Deputy Clerk iv essentially has collapsed the[] last two prongs [of the test articulated in Lemon] to ask whether the challenged governmental practice has the effect of endorsing religion.\") The Orders do neither. First, they serve the important secular purpose of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Second, they do not endorse any religion: the order bans gatherings for all religions along with secular gatherings. 6 Accordingly, the Orders likely do not violate the Establishment Clause. c. Other Alleged Constitutional Violations Plaintiffs make several other claims for violations of their rights under the U.S. and California Constitutions. (Request at 12 -20.) Each of these, however, is premised on Plaintiffs' argument that the Orders impermissibly restrict their religious exercise. (See, e.g., Request at 13 (arguing that the Orders are an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech because religious worship is protected speech).) Because the Court concludes that the Orders do not impermissibly restrict Plaintiffs' free exercise of religion, Plaintiffs' other claims likely fail as well. B. Remaining TRO Factors Defendants have shown that because the Orders are likely a proper exercise of executive authority in a state of emergency they are entitled to enhanced deference, even where they infringe on typically protected rights. Moreover, even applying a traditional constitutional analysis, Plaintiffs' claims are unlikely to succeed. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, and the Court need not consider the remaining factors. VI. CONCLUSION For the reasons above, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Request. IT IS SO ORDERED. 6 Plaintiffs argue that special accommodations were made by the Riverside Defendants and the San Bernardino Defendants for Christians celebrating Easter. (Request at 2.) However, they do not seek to enjoin enforcement of any Easter exception. And they could not: Easter has passed. Accordingly, the Court need not determine whether the Easter exceptions violated the Establishment Clause.

DHILLON: This is Harmeet Dhillon at the Dhillon Law Group appearing on behalf of all of the plaintiffs in thiscase. THE COURT: Good afternoon.MR. MEUSER: This is Mark Meuser on behalf of the Dhillon Law Group representing all plaintiffs. THE COURT: Good afternoon.MR. MICHAEL: Good afternoon, Your Honor. This is Gregory Michael also appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs. THE COURT: Good afternoon.Very well. Now, for the defendants, for the County of Riverside, who is appearing? MS. MORAN: Good afternoon, Your Honor. This is Kelly Moran on behalf of the County of Riverside. MR. PATEL: Good morning, Your Honor. This is Ronak Patel on behalf of the County of Riverside defendants. MR. BROWN: Good afternoon, Your Honor. Jeb Brown, Riverside County Counsel, on behalf of the Riverside CountyCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, defendants. THE COURT: Very well. And for the State of California? MR. GRABARSKY: Good afternoon, Your Honor. This is Deputy Attorney General Todd Grabarsky on behalf of the State defendants, Governor Newsom, and Attorney General Becerra. THE COURT: Very well. Any other appearances?MS. FOX: Yes, Your Honor. This is Deborah Fox of Meyers Nave on behalf of the various named County of SanBernardino defendants, Dr. Erin Gustafson, Sheriff JohnMcMahon, Supervisor Lovinggood, Supervisor Janice Rutherford,Supervisor Dawn Rowe, Supervisor Curt Hagman, and SupervisorJosie Gonzales. THE COURT: Thank you and good afternoon.MS. MORAN: Ms. Fox, do you plan on arguing or have you delegated the argument to anybody else? MS. FOX: I plan on arguing, Your Honor, and as well joining me is my colleague on the line, Ms. Margaret Rosequist. THE COURT: Very well.Who is going to be arguing for the County of Riverside? MR. PATEL: Your Honor, Ronak Patel and Kelly Moran.THE COURT: Very well. So I would prefer that only one person argue for each group of defendants. It makes iteasier, especially in a be in each other's presence so you might step over each other trying to speak. If that can't be helped andmore than one person wants to speak on behalf of any particulargroup of defendants, then it's going to get a little bitmessier, but if you feel compelled to speak up, you can do so. So do I understand that for the State of California only Mr. Grabarsky is going to argue? MR. GRABARSKY: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor. This is Todd Grabarsky. THE COURT: And for the San Bernardino officers, Ms. Fox and Ms. Rosequist, which one of you will argue? MS. FOX: Your Honor, I will be arguing. This is Deborah Fox.

So for others listening on the hearing, please remember that the normal prohibitionsagainst the recording of any proceeding stand in place andremain. So even though we are conducting this hearing throughat e l e p h o n e ,y o ua r ep r o h i b i t e df r o mr e c o r d i n ga n ya s p e c to fCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, this hearing. Very well. So the matter is on calendar today for the application for an emergency request for a Temporary Restraining Order by the plaintiffs in this case againstvarious officers from the counties of Riverside and SanBernardino as well as Governor Newsom and various Stateofficers. So I've read your submissions and I think that a good way to start or a good place to start might be the defendants,at least the California defendants we'll call them, the primaryargument that this ordinance or these orders should not besubjected to traditional constitutional analysis and insteadshould be viewed in the light of the wide latitude given toexecutive officers in the course of an emergency, a healthemergency primarily, so they're not subject to traditionalconstitutional analysis. So why doesn't the plaintiff please respond to that position and argue why this ordinance should be subjected toconstitutional analysis, or maybe you can argue that even if itis under an emergency state, that it's still invalid. Ms. Dhillon.MS. DHILLON: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you for that. Iw i l ls t a r tb ys a y i n gt h a t ,o fc o u r s e ,w ed i s a g r e ew i t ht h eproposition that this order -- these orders should be subjectedto rational basis review simply because of the state ofCase: 05/03/2020, I do not believe there is case law that supports the proposition that the normal constitutionalstandards that apply in cases analyzing burdens on religion,burdens on assembly, and burdens on speech, which are the FirstAmendment burdens that are implicated in this case, are waivedin an emergency setting. Iw i l la l s oa d dt h a tt h ee m e r g e n c yn a t u r eo ft h e orders here is evolving on a daily basis. Only earlier todaythe governor, in a press conference, amended theirrestrictions. So these restrictions are ongoing and they arerolling and they are being edited and amended on the fly. In areply brief -- in an opposition brief in this matter filed withthis Court last Friday, the Government amended its position. And so we have a real problem here with a lack of clarity in these orders, which is part of what we've attackedin our complaint and our brief. And that actually enhances theneed for this Court to bring some constitutional certainty tothis situation. Many of the cases cited by both parties, Your Honor, involve some type of emergency. In fact the Jew Ho case, which is discussed by all the parties, involving the attemptedquarantine of everybody in San Francisco's Chinatown on thebasis of a health emergency, was examined on the basis of thencurrent constitutional standards regarding disparate treatment.So I don't believe there is a compelling need here to suspendCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, analysis that would otherwise apply. And I think -- and to be very fair and in credit to the government, I think the fact that the attorney general on behalf of the governor responded in their brief last week that,in fact, drive-in services, which had widely been understood tonot apply in California, were, in fact, being allowed. I thinkthat is a concession by the government that they respect andunderstand that there are important needs being expressed hereby people of faith that are not being met. And, in fact, bothof the other defendants here changed their position immediatelyin response to that. And so even the government itself isrecognizing that these are important rights, they are simplygetting the balance wrong. And I also want to note, Your Honor, that there have been some comments in the briefs to suggest that we areaccusing the governor or the state officials of acting withmalice or in bad faith, and that is not true. I thinkeverybody here is acting in good faith, but it is importantgiven the fundamental nature of these rights and the fact thatthe governor himself has expressed that this emergency andrestrictions will go on into the fall. And after the time thatthe briefs were filed in this case, people of -- faith leadersin this state and the county that I'm sitting in right now, inSonoma County, Your Honor, were informed that church would notbe allowed to resume until September at the earliest. ThisCase: 05/03/2020, two-week or a four-week or a very limited restriction on faith, but it is potentially the better part ofay e a ra n dp o t e n t i a l l yi n t on e x ty e a r . T h i ss h a r p e n st h en e e dfor an immediate analysis of this situation and bringing someclarity to it under traditional constitutional norm. Your Honor then asked me to articulate our position with respect to if one were to apply the traditional, what webelieve should be strict scrutiny analysis here because we donot have a law of general applicability with the orders. Wehave numerous exceptions, numerous exceptions for every one ofthe 40 million Californians living under these orders, numerousexceptions exceeding, by my mathematics, over a millionessential workers who are permitted to ply their trades underthe current orders, and specific restrictions on religiouspractices, in the governor's order and in the orders of the twocounties, that make these laws clearly not laws of general andneutral applicability under the test and under the Church of the Lukumi Babalu ,t h e Santeria case out of Florida in 1993, which is the unanimous decision in the judgment by the UnitedStates Supreme Court. And so where a law lacks facial neutrality, as do all of the orders in question here, by referring to religiouspractices, which all of these orders do, and where they assigndifferent rights to citizens based on whether they are pursuingas e c u l a rp r a c t i c e ,i . e . ,g o i n gt ot h eg r o c e r ys t o r e ,g o marijuana store, going to the liquor store, going to the laundromat versus going to the church, going to the Sikhgurdwara, the temple or the mosque, these restrictions may bepermissible, but they must be analyzed under a strict scrutinyanalysis. THE COURT: Let me stop you right there.MS. DHILLON: Yes, Your Honor.THE COURT: Just so we're all on the same page, I think the defendants' arguments are that if this is deemed anemergency action by an executive, then the ordinances and theorders are not subject to either rational basis or strictscrutiny but, rather, should be evaluated under the standardsset out in Jacobson; and one, they must have a real substantial relation to the crisis and must not present a plain andprobable invasion of the protected rights. So I think that'stheir argument. Id o n ' tt h i n kt h e y ' r ea r g u i n gt h a ti ft h i si sa n emergency order, it goes down to rational basis. It's even amore lenient standard than that, and they have presented someauthority, especially in the Prince case by the Supreme Court in 1944, and the Jacobson case. This might apply, this emergency situation might apply to cases in which there is aninfringement of the practice of religion. And we'll talk aboutLukumi al i t t l eb i tm o r e . Ih a v em yv i e w so nt h a tc a s e ,b u tI think it's distinguishable.Case: 05/03/2020, the defendants respond to Ms. Dhillon. MS. DHILLON: Your Honor, if I may just address Jacobson for a moment. I'm sorry if I did not get your question correctly in the first instance, but I can respond tothat briefly, if I may. THE COURT: Let me have the defendants respond first and then you may respond to them. MS. DHILLON: Thank you.MR. GRABARSKY: Thank you, Your Honor. This is Todd Grabarsky for the State defendants. To respond to plaintiffs' counsel's contention that there's no case law covering this, we disagree with that, andwe've cited several cases in our briefs. In really anemergency situation, and this is a highly unusual,extraordinary, once in a century pandemic involving anextremely contagious and dangerous disease that reallythreatens to cause severe illness and death on a massive scale,on an unprecedented massive scale. In situations like this, the Supreme Court has instructed that states can protect themselves even where thosemeasures might infringe on freedoms and liberties that wouldotherwise be protected in normal times. That principle isderived from Prince and Jacobson. That principle has been applied in rulings from the Fourth Circuit, theUnited States v. Chalk case; the and the Fifth Circuit, in re Abbott, which deals directly with the present COVID-19 pandemic, all of which we've cited and discussed in our briefs. And I also draw the Court's attention to the routine upholding of mandatory vaccination laws. Like what was atissue in Jacobson against constitutional challenges in order to preemptively protect against disease epidemics like COVID-19.And those cases beyond Jacobson ,t h em a n d a t o r yv a c c i n a t i o n cases, they all rely on standards established in Jacobson and Prince . Quoting from Abbott, this is a settled rule that states facing emergencies are allowed to, quote, restrict, forexample, one's right to peaceably assemble, publicly worship,to travel, and even leave one's home. And that's the Abbott decision at page 1. And that's why in the face of such anextraordinary pandemic, courts recognize the necessity to deferto state executives' swift and decisive action to slow thespread of such a dangerous disease as long as those actions aremade in good faith and there's some factual basis for them. Plaintiffs' counsel appears to concede that the State's order was made in good faith, and that's ourcontention. And plaintiffs make no argument that thestay-at-home order lacks a factual basis. The order has -- inCalifornia has proven to be effective, especially when comparedto other states like New York or regions like northern Italy.Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, know, although there is a significant -- there is a death toll in California, it's significantly less than inother places. And I'll note that this is true even in highlydense areas like San Francisco, which is the second densestmajor city in the United States that has really done well tomitigate the effects of the virus due, in part, to thestay-at-home order. Plaintiffs' counsel also contends that this situation is analogous to the Jew Ho v. Williamson case. That case is readily distinguishable from the situation here. In Jew Ho the Government or the Court considered -- THE COURT: Mr. Grabarsky, I know that case. You don't have to argue that. Mr. Patel, anything you'd like to add?MR. PATEL: No, Your Honor.THE COURT: Very well. Ms. Dhillon, you may respond.MS. DHILLON: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. So in the Jacobson case, it is readily distinguishable from the circumstances here in a number of different respects. First ofall, that case in 1905 precedes the incorporation of the FirstAmendment's establishment and free clause jurisprudence to thestates in the Everson case in 1947. So a different standard applied there. Second, it was a facially neutral smallpox vaccination law. That is the factual circumstance there. So,Case: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, the religious plaintiffs in that case were seeking an exception from an undoubtedly facially neutral law. But ourfactual pattern is Jacobson and its progeny on its head. In fact, the state and the county laws have numerous exceptions,in fact, metastasizing, growing with exceptions every singleday. In every press conference there's a new exception, andthat's in good faith and I appreciate the increasing libertythat we're all getting. But, in reality, religion is continuing to be burdened under rules that are not being applied to the sameindividuals when they visit a Walmart or other commercialentities. They're allowed to go and visit them and practicesocial distancing. We all have experienced, those of us whohave gone to grocery stores, the six feet apart markings, theprotections for the clerk, the requirement in most counties nowand municipalities to wear masks, and in some instances peopleare also wearing gloves, and behaving responsibly. Yet while this is permitted for a large category of secular endeavor, laundromats are included, for example, petgroomers are now being allowed in some counties, it is barredfor people of faith to practice their faith inside a churchbuilding in a socially distanced manner. In fact, untilFriday's opposition brief by the attorney general, it wasconsidered to be barred to have drive-in 02:24 02:25 02:25 02:2515 And so that is a significant burden on people of faith that is not being imposed on the same people of faith pursuing secular things, because the Government has decided, ingood faith, that getting your marijuana or your liquor orgetting your laundry done or your food or getting your doggroomed, in some circumstances, is more important than beingable to have a religious service. And also due to the emergency nature of this proceeding, Your Honor, it was not fully briefed, that manypeople in California do not have access to the only type ofworship that the government permitted in its original orderwhich is video conferencing. There are many counties inCalifornia that have no -- have very limited bandwidth andlimited broadband access and no ability to do that. And so the Jacobson situation simply does not apply. People of faith in California, through this lawsuit, are not seeking a special dispensation to be exempt from theshutdown or stay-at-home orders. Instead, they are asking thatthe least restrictive aspects of those orders, i.e., socialdistancing and limited gatherings for limited purposes, bepermitted. And speaking on behalf of my clients in this case,and, of course, not on behalf of all people of faith inCalifornia, they have been willing to submit themselves toreasonable restrictions. But we are not dealing with a short outbreak or anCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, 6 02:2716 epidemic that is -- or a vaccination situation. We are dealing with, according to some analysis by the governor, a situationthat will last into the next year. So the Government's currentposition is, people cannot engage in any in-person enjoyment oftheir First Amendment rights of assembly or of speech or ofreligion if that involves a gathering, whereas assembly andspeech and certain types of other activities are permittedunder the orders for a broad swath of categories. And so we are simply asking that the least restrictive means necessary, as is required under strictscrutiny, be allowed. THE COURT: Very well. Let me hear from Mr. Grabarsky in response to that argument. So Ms. Dhillon's argument seems to be that they're not seeking special treatment, they're seeking to be treatedjust as the other exceptions are being treated, to be permittedto engage in those activities with the restrictions of socialdistancing. What is your response? MR. GRABARSKY: Yes, Your Honor. First I'll note that liquor stores are subject to the exemptions only wherethey sell food. And cannabis dispensaries are exempted underthe health care category of exemptions due to the medicinalstatus of cannabis. Second, Lukumi instructs us that when we're comparing activities, we must compare analogous activities. So comparingCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, gatherings of large amounts of people at places of worship for an extended period of time to picking up food attakeout restaurants, picking up food at restaurants via takeoutor picking up food at the grocery store, it's really a falseequivalent that isn't the right analogy. What plaintiffs here seek to have is large groups of people gathering indoors in close space sharing in a communalexperience. And they're looking for people to come that areinside at the same time for the same amount of time and in thesame enclosed space. Thus, the proper comparison is actuallywith similarly situated activities of communal experience liketheaters, schools, concert halls, sporting events, dining roomsat restaurants, jury trials, all of those secular gatheringsare prohibited by the State's order. In contrast, grocery stores and drive-through restaurants, picking up takeout or picking up medicine, aresingular and transitory experiences that don't involve groupsof people gathered together. For example, picking up takeoutis just a brief interaction. Often it's not even required tointeract -- for two people to interact with each other at all.At grocery stores individuals enter the store at differenttimes for different lengths of time, purchase various items.They move around individually. Grocery stores and restaurantsare subject to stringent health codes and regulations even innormal times and additional cleanliness guidelines in light ofCase: the present pandemic emergency. Individuals, they pay for the food and then they leave. So these exempted activities aren't gatherings in the same way that concerts or schools or jury trials in courthousesor court hearings or indoor worship services that plaintiffsare making a comparison, they're not like each other. Theanalogous secular conduct is also prohibited by thestay-at-home order. And also to respond to plaintiffs' counsel's point that the order is changing often, you know, I'm not sure whatis happening in Sonoma County, but the governor's order hasbeen consistent since March 19th when it was issued.March 27th -- March 22nd the executive order incorporated thelist of exemptions from the public health officers. And we'llnote that that list of exemptions specifically includesfaith-based workers. So, in other words, faith-based services are deemed as essential services in the executive order to the extent thatthey provide congregants with worship opportunities throughtechnology such as online streaming. They could doteleconferencing. There's various free platforms, Zoom, WeBex , Facebook ,Google ,t oa c c o m p l i s ht h i st h a tw o u l d n ' tr e q u i r e ,y o u know, spending any money, and through drive-in servicesprovided that congregants observe distancing and that the order is changing, the State's order is changing, is just not correct. It's been consistent since -- fortunately, since March when, you know,before things really started to take a toll on public healthand safety. THE COURT: Thank you.Mr. Patel, anything you'd like to add to that?MR. PATEL: Just very briefly, Your Honor. There was am e n t i o na b o u t Jacobson and it being a very early case that predated the incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment. I didwant to note for the Court that we have cited three cases inour brief, including Carroll, West Virginia ,a n dCollins ,t h a t all apply a clear and present danger sort of situation tolimiting peaceful assembly. I just wanted to make that knownfor the record, Your Honor. That's it. THE COURT: Very well. So let's move on.MS. FOX: Your Honor, if I might, this is Deborah Fox. Might I speak to this issue for the County of SanBernardino defendants? THE COURT: You may briefly.MS. FOX: Thank you so much. Your Honor, I join with the State's argument that the proper examination, in looking atthe State orders and the County orders at play, are whether ornot the distinction as to gathering are of general applicationhere. They apply both to private or public. They're restricted without regard to contact. So whether you want to have peopleover to your private home for a dinner party, a birthday party,ab o o kc l u b ,aB i b l es t u d y ,t h o s ea r ea l lt e m p o r a r i l yrestricted. Similarly, if you want to have public gatherings, whether it's at the Fontana Raceway, the Mission Inn, theCoachella Music Festival, the LoanMart Field, or any of thevarious faith communities, churches, mosques, synagogues in SanBernardino and Riverside County, those public gatherings arealso temporarily restricted. The denominator and the common denominator here is the gatherings. The various secular exceptions are differentqualitatively. I think the State has aptly noted that agathering is directed at activities which by design people cometogether for a communal experience at a set time and set place.The overall design is to spend time with the group. That'smarkedly different from going to pick up a prescription at CVSor to get milk and eggs at Ralph's. That is not a gathering.It's a single transitory event. As well, plaintiffs in their TRO application ask this Court and somewhat dismissively refer to the burger flippersand the baristas who are part of the food service industry.You are only allowed to go there and get items to go. Youcan't go in and sit inside a McDonald's and burger andCase: you go into Starbucks with your latte in hand and sit and read the New York Times .T h o s e a r e a l l e q u i v a l e n t to gatherings and they are all precluded under these particularorders. So there is no similar secular gatherings that are exempted from the orders. Theaters, restaurants, conventions,exercise classes, sporting events, concerts, they're allprohibited. And so, Your Honor, we think this very much meetsthe definition of restrictions of general application. THE COURT: Thank you.So we'll move on to, in the event that it applies, so let's have a brief discussion about traditional constitutionalanalysis and whether or not the orders should be subjected tostrict scrutiny or a rational basis. So the plaintiffs make the argument that, relying somewhat heavily on Lukumi, that this ordinance as to these orders are not to be analyzed under rational basis but understrict scrutiny because they single out religion and are notneurtral, even though they might be facially neutral because ofthe exceptions in the way it prohibits religious activitiesthat is not subject to a rational basis analysis. So, you know, just in reading Lukumi ,i t ' sv e r y obvious to me that that's a case in which, even though theordinance against animal sacrifices was neutral on its face,the object of the ordinance by the city council was very muchCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, aimed at the fact that the city council knew that there was going to be a new Santeria church established within itsjurisdiction, that they had leased land, and there was, inresponse to that, an emergency meeting which resulted in thepassing of the restriction on the animal sacrifice. So for me, I view Lukumi as standing for the proposition that even though an ordinance or law can befacially neutral if it is -- if it has as its object theinfringement or targets specifically the infringement ofreligion, it is not on -- it should not be treated as afacially neutral ordinance but is subject to a higher standard. So there are distinctive features in Lukumi which are not present here, i.e., the fact that the ordinance seems tohave targeted that specific prospective religious exercise, andthere was an emergency meeting, as I said, by the city council.And in his opinion, Justice Kennedy pointed all those factsout. So I guess the question turns to the plaintiff. Given those differences between what happened in Florida andhere, how do you think that Lukumi applies to the situation at hand? MS. DHILLON: Well, Your Honor, thank you for that question. And the point is taken that there appears to havebeen an animus against Santeria in that case; however, the caselaw does not rest on the animus, but rather, I believe, theCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, justices, of course, had different positions on that. But what came out of Lukumi was a rule that has been applied in numerous other circumstances. And in this situation, I think it is very clear from the face of the governor's orders taken together, including theexception provided for faith-based organizations to, you know,put on a performance, if you will, for streaming purposes oraudio purposes with ten or fewer people, that specificallycalls out and mentions religion and dictates the manner inwhich people may enjoy religious services in California. Now, it is interesting that the State has taken the position now that all along drive-in services were permittedbecause they are a technology; yet, in fact, nobody inCalifornia understood that to be the case, including two of thedefendants here who issued tickets as well as, you know,demands to disperse and not hold services for our plaintiffswho were contemplating only drive-in services at that time.And so these rules have been perceived by people of faith andlaw enforcement throughout the State of California to havespecial rules for religion. Iw o u l de v e nh a v es y m p a t h yf o rt h ec o n c e p tt h a tt h e s e were rules of general applicability if there were some sort oftemporal limitation or numerical limitation assigned to some ofthe secular activities that are permitted by these orders. Forexample, if one were limited to no more than ten minutes in aCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, grocery store or call it half an hour in a Costco or there was al i m i to ft e np e o p l ei na n ye s t a b l i s h m e n ta ta n yg i v e nt i m e ,but that is not the case. In fact, theoretically, a creativeperson of faith who wanted to hold a gathering but in a safeway could actually do it at a Costco and people could stand sixfeet apart, and they could stay there for an hour. There areno restrictions on that. In fact, I think if this Court andother courts that look at this issue do not right side thatsituation, we are going to see creative people making use ofsuch loopholes, vast loopholes in these laws. Nobody has argued for large, closely packed gatherings of people. And I want to be clear, none of myclients want their parishioners or each other to get sick.People of faith are no riskier or more or less caring abouthuman life than secular people are. And nobody wants to getsick. There are many ways that people of faith and the pastorsin this case can enjoy religious activities, but following thesame secular rules that permit people to spend an unlimitedamount of time in a Costco or a Walmart or have an unlimitednumber of people in those institutions so long as they aresocially distanced. For example, pastors could hold multiple services on aS u n d a y . P a s t o r sc o u l dh o l ds e r v i c e sl i m i t e dt oac e r t a i nnumber of people. There could be a statewide rule regardingtheir duration of time people are permitted to be in aCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, could be religious observances that are practiced outdoors for safety purposes. In fact, as the Stateconcedes, the science is evolving on these issues, the Statebears the burden of justifying these restrictions, by the way,not the plaintiffs. But the science is evolving. And, infact, there do not appear to be cases of outdoor transmission. So there are a number of ways that people could safely practice their faith without -- and in the same way asthe State has permitted secular people to practice theirinterest and their important endeavors without putting peopleat risk under current science. And I would also add that none of the cases under discussion involve emergencies stretching out, as we havebefore us, according to our governor, for the better part of ayear or well into next year. In fact, some people in thegovernment have suggested that we have restrictions on ourliberty until such time as a vaccine is developed for thisdisease, which could be 18 months or more. So what we are seeking is a uniform rule. If the State had a uniform rule regarding the nature of duration oroccupancy of secular institutions, I would have a harder timearguing that such restrictions should not apply to faithorganizations, but to say that there is one rule for churchesor gurdwaras or synagogues and a different rule for Walmart,simply does not pass either rational basis scrutiny orCase: THE COURT: Thank you. Any response by Mr. Patel or Mr. Grabarsky?MR. GRABARSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Plaintiffs' counsel isn't discussing the legal standard that the Ninth Circuit hasextracted from Lukumi .I n Stormans v. Weisman the Court was concerned in analyzing whether a law is generally applicablewhen concerned with substantial under-inclusion of analogoussecular conduct. Here, as I've discussed, the analogous conduct, gatherings at schools or schools or concerts or movie theatersor playhouses, that conduct is prohibited under thestay-at-home order. So we have to look at what the case lawinstructs, not to compare analogous secular conduct. With regard to plaintiff counsel's point that they could gather indoors in an enclosed space for worship and do soin a healthful way in light of the COVID disease, there'ssimply no evidence that they've presented confirming that. What we're dealing with is really a highly technical public health problem that -- really that the Government hasconsidered of what might be -- what's best. And in theemergency situation, deference is owed to the executivedecision that, look, it's an emergency. People need to refrainfrom being out there, from gathering in large spaces, remain home.Case: our briefing we discussed numerous examples of large gatherings, even in houses of religious worship where, unfortunately, they were -- there were claims for superspreaders of the disease. And we discussed that andplaintiffs' counsel haven't responded directly to thosesituations. So, in light of the fact that they aren't presenting evidence of that -- of the specifics of what precautionsthey're going to take and the effectiveness of thoseprecautions, deference must be owed to the State on thismatter. THE COURT: Very well.Mr. Patel, anything Your Honor.THE COURT: Ms. Fox?MS. FOX: Your Honor, just that I think that the Lukumi case yields the results that the position of the general application prevails here. The restrictions on gatherings hereis not based on the government deciding one religious activityis more important than another religious activity but, indeed,it stems from the singular motivation to control the spread ofthis highly contagious and many times deadly disease. THE COURT: Thank you. So I think I will give each side some minutes to sum up their arguments, if you wish. So, Ms. Dhillon, do you wish to sum up in a fewCase: 05/03/2020, MS. DHILLON: I do, Your Honor. I'll try to be brief. I think we've covered a lot of the points already. With regard to the point about super spreaders, that is notaddressed because, frankly, it did not merit response. But nowthat it's been brought up, I think it is clear that theincidents that are referred to by the government occurred priorto the governor's order, in most instances, and certainly priorto knowledge of the nature of this pandemic being known. Infact, many of those gatherings took place before there was anydeclaration of emergency in the United States. And so I don'tthink it's apposite at all. And, again, people of faith are nomore interested in dying than anybody else in this state. Iw i l la l s os a yt h a ti nr e g a r d st ow h a ti sa n a l o g o u s and what isn't, in fact, if you look closely at the governor'sorder, it allows, in its exemption of so-called essentialworkers, many types of gatherings that would be analogous towhat could be proposed here. So the State entities seem to becomparing a religious gathering to a concert, a Coachella, orsome sort of an optional frivolous entertainment, which is notthe case. In fact, religion is as central to people of faithas eating, as going to work, and even more so for many people.So it is not optional, it is not entertainment, it is notweekend for people, it is central. So many businesses that are described as essentialCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, California are allowed to operate and if you would like to call it congregate and gather in close quarters.For example, businesses that provide shipping services, youknow, people who are -- Amazon workers are gathering togetherin warehouses to ship and provide items to the public, thegovernment is deeming that necessary. But, in fact, to peopleof faith, gathering together with other people of faith in asafe manner is more important than those types of activities. The media from day one was given a free pass out of these orders without any restrictions. And, in fact, reportersare free to gather together, if they wish, and be in anewsroom. So many businesses are allowed to operate under theexceptions. And by my calculation, again, that's over amillion people in this state who are operating under thosecircumstances. So what we are seeking here in this situation, Your Honor, is that given the importance of faith, it is notentertainment, it is not optional, it is not for Sundays only,and it is not something that can be suspended legally forsix months or a year because, otherwise, you will definitely100 percent have churches going underground as they go incountries where religious gatherings are prohibited. And thatwill not be safe for the public. It h i n kw h a tw o u l db es a f ea n dr e a s o n a b l ea n d rational would be to allow limited coming together so peopleCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, 9 02:5030 can share fellowship and in a time where they need it more than normally. And I think that that is what we are asking forhere, reasonable restrictions that are no more onerous thanthose deemed important by the State. The State has deemed religious gatherings to be of a second tier of importance and has dictated to Californiaresidents what is permitted and what is not. The State's orderhas assumed that people have cars, has assumed that people haveWi-Fi, has assumed that people are interested in putting Google orZoom orWebEx or some other form of technology that may, in fact, be stealing their data on their computers, assumes theyhave computers. These are all false assumptions. But what is not a false assumption is that, if allowed, people of faith would like to come together and usethe same restrictions that are allowed for secular endeavors tosafely worship. And if there are temporal restrictions appliedto that, I think that the churches in question would be open tothat. If there are numerical restrictions that are appliedthat are reasonable within the safe that is allowed for thesepurposes, people would be willing and have submitted that thatis acceptable. And it is actually not the burden of theplaintiffs to prove that these practices are safe. We areactually submitting that whatever the restrictions are that thegovernment is allowing for secular endeavors, those are plaintiff.Case: government has been changing those restrictions on a regular basis, including today the governor allowed certain types of elective procedures to move forward,so he is allowing more people to be in hospitals and healthfacilities than he was yesterday, we similarly request that theState look at expanding the limited rights that are allowed toall citizens in this state for secular purposes to allow thosefor religious purposes; and, frankly, not to characterize themand treat them as if they are a concert for entertainment.That is not what they are. And under the applicable standards, Your Honor, I think it is clear that we do not have law of generalapplicability. And there are so many exceptions and so manyevolving exceptions, including in the opposition brief in thiscase on Friday, that it is important that there be a rule andthere be a rule of general applicability, and that rule ofgeneral applicability be applied to people of faith and allowthem to practice in the same way that secular endeavors areallowed. But even if it were a rational basis test, Your Honor, the government has not proved a rational basis to treatlimited, health-compliant, CDC-compliant, safe gatherings anydifferently than people gathering, if you will, at a grocerystore or at some of these other places, or at work places thatare deemed essential, including certain government offices,Case: workers, including others. So I think, Your Honor, I would submit that many people of faith, including, you know, people who practice my faith, the Sikh faith, would be satisfied with a short or alimited or some form of coming together, but streaming anddictating that we use technology that is not readily availableto all Californians is simply inadequate substitute. And wecannot go for six months or a year or eighteen months withoutenjoying our rights to practice our faith without, in fact,increasing the health risk on Californians by driving faithunderground. Thank you, Your Honor.THE COURT: Thank you.Mr. Patel or Mr. Grabarsky?MR. GRABARSKY: Yes, Your Honor. This is Todd Grabarsky. To respond first to the point about frivolousentertainment activities are prohibited, as I mentioned and aswe discussed in our brief, I also note that schools,courthouses, essential -- really fundamental essentialgatherings for society to operate would also be prohibited bythe stay-at-home order. Gatherings at those places areprohibited. Next, plaintiffs' counsel is suggesting that strict scrutiny were to be applied, if the Court, you know, as we'veargued, strict scrutiny is not the proper standard in theCase: 05/03/2020, Even under normal constitutional analysis, it's rational basis given the neutral and generalapplication of the State's order, but even if strict scrutinywere to be applied, it's narrowly tailored to fulfill-- tofurther the compelling interest. And plaintiffs don't argue that the government -- that the order doesn't further a compelling interest nor couldthey. This is really an unprecedented emergency healthsituation. The COVID-19 virus is causing severe illness anddeath on really a massive scale. And there is a wealth ofexamples demonstrating how the -- that the virus spreads ingatherings of all types. And what's particularly disturbingabout the way that the virus transmits is that it can transmitamong people, even those who don't exhibit symptoms. It wouldbe asymptomatic transmission. So taking plaintiffs' declarations that they haven't been in contact with someone who was exposed to Corona virusjust can't be given much weight given the asymptomatictransmission of the virus. And we've cited examples,unfortunate incidences of houses of worship having gatheringsand attempting to abide by distancing and cleanlinessprecautions, yet the virus has broken out, unfortunately, amongthe congregants. With regard to narrowly tailoring, it's important to note that the order is limited in scope. There is a temporalCase: 20-55445, 05/03/2020, 634 limit. It's only for the course of the pandemic. From the issuance of the order back in March, faith-based leaders andstaff have been recognized as exempted, essential, and criticalworkers. Those persons may leave their homes to set up andbroadcast services over online streaming. They can also do itover teleconferencing, over telephones, which even though theInternet in this day and age is really akin to a utility, it'sreally a utility akin to that of a telephone or electricity,but they can broadcast services over the telephone. And third, the order allows for drive-in services, again, provided that people remain in their cars and refrainfrom direct or indirect touching. So there is this narrowtailoring of the order. And just to emphasize how dangerous this situation could be, the statistics are changing on a daily or hourlybasis, but tens of thousands have perished in the United Stateswhere there's over 800,000 cases. I believe it's close to150,000 deaths across the world. And we need only look toplaces like New York or Northern Italy or Iran or other placesto really appreciate the deadliness that this disease poses andthe problems it causes for hospitals and healthcare systemsthat have been really overwhelmed in a frightening way by thedisease's effect. And, again, this is based on how the diseasespreads from person to person, even those who aren't exhibitingsymptoms. The virus is still And we'll note that, again, California has been fortunate to have done as best a job as they could in minimizing the effects of the disease, but that's due in largepart to the State's stay-at-home order. Lastly, just to comment on the remaining factors that weigh heavily against issuing a TRO in plaintiffs' favor, anyharm plaintiffs suffer is really significantly outweighed bythe harm to the public health that this disease provides. Thatharm being a significant risk of severe illness and death on amassive scale. We're dealing with a life and death situationof whole groups of people. And for those reasons, the Courtshould deny plaintiffs' TRO application. THE COURT: Very well.Mr. Patel, do you wish to add anything?MR. PATEL: No, Your Honor.THE COURT: Very well. So I have thought about this. I'll issue an order shortly. My intent is to deny theapplication. I do think that the State, the defendants, haveput forth some authority that during a state of emergency theexecutive powers are in effect and that they are empowered toprovide for emergency remedies which may infringe onfundamental constitutional rights. And even if that wasn't thecase, I think rational basis would apply and that it would passmuster under that standard.Case: a n tt oc o n g r a t u l a t eb o t hs i d e sf o rb o t hb r i e f i n g these issues very well and for arguing today very well. This is probably the best argument that I've had on a telephonicconference of all the hearings that I've had. So Icongratulate both sides on their fine performance. I'll issue the order probably tomorrow or the next day. And thank you very much. The matter is under submission. MS. DHILLON: Your Honor, if I may ask -- thank you for your comments. If I may ask a clarifying questionregarding our request for a hearing date on the preliminaryinjunction. In light of the fact that we do not have an enddate for these restrictions, I do think that we would like topursue that and I request that the Court may set a date forpreliminary injunction on the same matter. THE COURT: I'll consider that. Thank you.Thank you, counsel.MS. DHILLON: Thank 101112131415161718192021 22 23 242537 CERTIFICATE OF OFFICIAL REPORTER I, PHYLLIS A.

Clarification of religious services and face-coverings order Published April 8, 2020 | By County of San Bernardino The need has arisen for clarification of a Public Health Order and subsequent guidanceissued Tuesday regarding religious servicesand face coverings. The County acknowledges the manner in which the order and guidance were created and disseminated created unintended consequences and hardships. The County has taken steps to ensureappropriate notice and coordination will occur in the future as we address the complicated and fast-moving crisisfaced by our community and the entire world. \"We recognize the need to act quickly to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout San Bernardino County,\" said Board of Supervisors Chairman Curt Hagman. \"But we also recognize that we must take into consideration themyriad of impacts that can be felt in a large and diverse county, and be willing to provide clarification and makeadjustments while keeping our communities safe and healthy.\" The specific references to drive-in religious services so close to major religious observances taking place during the next four days, for which organizations had already conducted considerable planning and incurred expenses,are clarified as follows: Organizations that have planned such services for the coming weekend should proceedwith those services if they choose to do so and make every effort to prevent contact between congregants. Regarding the use of face-coverings while driving, there is no need for drivers traveling alone or with members of their households to wear face coverings unless they must lower their windows to interact with firstresponders, food service workers, or others who are not members of their households. Other clarifying guidance will be forthcoming.On the subject of enforcement, the public is advised that although violation of a health order is a violation of the California Health and Safety Code, the County does not expect law enforcement to broadly impose citations onviolators. The expectation is that law enforcement will rely upon community members to use good judgment,common sense, and act in the best interests of their own health and the health of their loved ones and thecommunity at large. The imposition of penalties on members of the public who willfully and grossly disregardpublic health orders by putting others at risk of exposure to this infectious disease is meant as a tool for lawenforcement to use as a deterrent. San Bernardino County has 547 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the deaths of 17 county residents have been associated with the disease. Various appropriate County departments and agencies have been working together since Jan. 25 to protect the community from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The California Department of Public Health finds the following: x A l l g a t h e r i n g s s h o u l d b e p o s t p o n e d o r c a n c e l e d . o This includes gatherings such as concerts, conferences, and professional, college, and school sporting events. x Gyms, health clubs, and theaters should be closed. x A \"gathering\" is any event or convening that brings together people in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, cafeteria, or any other indoor or outdoor space. This applies to all non-essential professional, social, and community gatherings regardless of their sponsor. Gatherings that do not meet the aforementioned criteria should only be conducted when they are essential\u2014that is, if the activity is essential and could not be postponed or achieved without gathering, meaning that some other means of communication could not be used to conduct the essential function. What will this achieve? The timely implementation of aggressive strategies that create social distance and those that reduce close contact of people not regularly together, including limiting gatherings, has proven effective in prior pandemics at delaying rates of transmission and reducing illness and death. By decreasing the prevalence of disease across California we will: x Reduce the number of Californians who contract COVID-19 before an effective treatment or vaccine is available.

How long will these limitations apply? This guidance will remain in place until further guidance is released by the California Department of Public Health. As with all guidance that relates to COVID-19 response, authorities will revisit this guidance on a regular basis to evaluate the continued public health need for it and to evaluate if any elements need to be changed. To stay informed, continue to monitor the California Department of Public Health's web page on COVID-19 guidance . Examples of Essential Events this Does Not Apply To The goal of this recommendation is to prevent people physically coming together unnecessarily, where people who have the infection can easily spread it to others. This guidance does not apply to activities such as attendance at regular school classes, work, or essential services. Please see the guidance for schools document for additional information. Certain activities are essential to the functioning of our state and must continue. Hence, this does not apply to essential public transportation, airport travel, shopping at a store, mall, or farmers' market, or charitable food pantries and distributions. Other specific guidance can be found on the CDPH website to help people take actions that can protect them in those settings. This does not apply to congregate living situations, including dormitories and homeless encampments. For more information on what can be done to protect homeless individuals, please see the Guidance for Homeless Assistance Providers on Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (PDF).

Krebs Director Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) As the Nation comes together to slow the spread of COVID-19, on March 16th the President issued updated Coronavirus Guidance for America that highlighted the importance of the critical infrastructure workforce. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executes the Secretary of Homeland Security's authorities to secure critical infrastructure. Consistent with theseauthorities, CISA has developed, in collaboration with other federal agencies, State and local governments, and the private sector, an \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce\" advisory list. Thislistisintendedto help State, local,tribalandterritorialofficials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. Decisions informed by this list should also take into consideration additional public health considerations based on the specific COVID-19-related concerns of particular jurisdictions. This list is advisory in nature. It is not, nor should it be considered, a federal directive or standard. Additionally, this advisory list is not intended to be the exclusive list of critical infrastructure sectors, workers, and functions that should continue during the COVID-19 response across all jurisdictions. Individual jurisdictions should add or subtract essential workforce categories based on their own requirements and discretion. The advisorylist identifies workers who conduct a range of operations and services that are typically essential to continued critical infrastructure viability, including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing operational functions, among others. It also includes workers who support crucial supply chains and enable functions for critical infrastructure. The industries they support represent, but are not limited to, medical and healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, COSB RFJN - PAGE 017Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 14-2 Filed 391) App.553and public works. State, local, tribal, and territorial governments are responsible for implementing and executing response activities, including decisions about access and reentry, in their communities, while the Federal Government is in a supporting role. Officials should use their own judgment in issuing implementation directives and guidance. Similarly, while adhering to relevant public health guidance, critical infrastructure owners and operators are expected to use their own judgement on issues of the prioritization of business processes and workforce allocation to best ensure continuity of the essential goods and services they support. All decisions should appropriately balance public safety, the health and safety of the workforce, and the continued delivery of essential critical infrastructure services and functions. While this advisory list is meant to help public officials and employers identify essential work functions, it allows for the reality that some workers engaged in activity determined to be essential may be unable to perform those functions because of health-related concerns. CISA will continue to work with our partners in the critical infrastructure community to update this advisory list if necessary as the Nation's response to COVID-19 evolves. Should you have questions about this list, please contact CISA at CISA.CAT@cisa.dhs.gov. Attachment: \"Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response Version 2.0\" COSB RFJN - PAGE 018Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 14-2 App.554GGuidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response Version 2.0 (March 28, 2020) THE IMPORTANCE OF ESSENTIAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKERS Functioning critical infrastructure is imperative during the response to the COVID-19 emergency for both public health and safety as well as community well-being. Certain critical infrastructure indu stries have a special responsibility in these times to continue operations. This advisory guidance and accompanying li st are intended to support state, local, tribal, territorial and industry partners in identifying the critical infrastructure sectors and the essential workers needed to maintain the services and functions Americans depend on daily and that need to be able to operate resiliently during the COVID-19 pandemic response. This document gives advisory guidance on defining essential critical infrastructure workers. Promoting the ability of such workers to continue to work during periods of community re striction, access management, social distancing, or closure orders/directives is crucial to community resili ence and continuity of essential functions. CISA will continually solicit and accept feedback on the list and will evolve the list in response to stakeholder feedback. We will also use our various stakeholder engagement mechanisms to work with partners on how they are using this list and share those lessons learned and best practices broadly. Feedback can be sent to CISA.CAT@CISA.DHS.GOV . CONSIDERATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS This list was developed in consultation with federal agency partners, industry experts, and State and local officials, and is based on several key principles: 1.Response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic are locall y executed, state managed, and federally supported. 2.Everyone should follow guidance from the CDC, as we ll as State and local government officials, regarding strategies to limit disease spread. 3.Workers should be encouraged to work remotely when possible and focus on co re business activities. In- person, non-mandatory activities should be delayed until the resumption of normal operations. 4.When continuous remote work is not possible, businesses should enlist strategies to reduce the likelihood of spreading the disease. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and/or social distancing. These steps can preserve the workforce and allow operations to continue. 5.All organizations should implement their business continuity and pandemic plans or put plans in place if they do not exist. Delaying implementation is not advised and puts at risk the viability of the business and the CONNECT WITH US www.cisa.gov For more information, Linkedin.com/company/cybersecurity- and-infrastructure-security-agency Document App.555 health and safety of the employees. 6.Reliance on technology and just-in-time supply chains means that certain workers must be able to access certain sites, facilities, and assets to ensure continuity of functions. 7.Government employees, such as emergency managers, and the business community need to establish and maintain lines of communication. 8.When government and businesses engage in discussions about essential critical infrastructure workers, they need to consider the implications of business operations beyond the jurisdiction where the asset or facility is located. Businesses can have sizeable economic and societal impacts as well as supply chain dependencies that are geographically distributed. 9.Whenever possible, jurisdictions should align access and movement control policies related to critical infrastructure workers to lower the burden of workers crossing jurisdictional boundaries. IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKERS The following list of identified essential critical infrastructu re workers is intended to be overly inclusive reflecting the diversity of industries across the United States.

Krebs Director Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) As the Nation comes together to slow the spread of COVID-19, on March 16th, the President issued updated Coronavirus Guidance for America. This guidance states that: \"If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.\" The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) executes the Secretary of Homeland Security's responsibilities as assigned under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide strategic guidance, promote a national unity of effort, and coordinate the overall federal effort to ensure the security and resilience of the Nation's critical infrastructure. CISA uses trusted partnerships with both the public and private sectors to deliver infrastructure resilience assistance and guidance to a broad range of partners. In accordance with this mandate, and in collaboration with other federal agencies and the private sector, CISA developed an initial list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\" to help State and local officials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. The list can also inform critical infrastructure community decision-making to determine the sectors, sub-sectors, segments, or critical functions that should continue normal operations, appropriately modified to account for Centers for Disease Control (CDC) workforce and customer protection guidance. The attached list identifies workers who conduct a range of operations and services that are essential to continued critical infrastructure viability, including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing management functions, among others. Th e industries they support represent, but are not necessarily limited to, medical and healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works. Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 04/17/20 Page 31 391) App.638 We recognize that State, local, tribal, and territorial governments are ultimately in charge of implementing and executing response activities in communities under their jurisdiction, while the Federal Government is in a supporting role. As State and local communities consider COVID -19-related restrictions, CISA is offering this list to assist prioritizing activities related to continuity of operations and incident response, including the appropriate movement of critical infrastructure workers within and between jurisdictions. Accordingly, this list is advisory in nature. It is not, nor should it be considered to be, a federal directive or standard in and of itself. In addition, the se identified sectors and work ers are not intended to be the authoritative or exhaustive list of critical infrastructure sectors and functions that should continue during the COVID-19 response. Instead, State and local officials should use their own judgment in using their authorities and issuing implementation directives and guidance. Similarly, critical infrastructure industry partners will use their own judgment, informed by this list, to ensure continued operations of critical infrastructure services and functions. All decisions should appropriately balance public safety while ensuring the continued delivery of critical infrastructure services and functions. CISA will continue to work with you and our partners in the critical infrastructure community to update this list as the Nation's response to COV ID-19 evolves. We also encourage you to submit how you might use this list so that we can develop a repository of use cases for broad sharing across the country. Should you have questions about this list, please contact CISA at CISA.CAT@cisa.dhs.gov. Attachment: \"Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response\" 2 Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 04/17/20 Page @uscert_gov Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID- 19 Response Version 1.0 (March 19, 2020) THE IMP ORTANCE OF E SSENTIAL C RITICAL IN FRASTRUCTURE WORKERS Functioning critical infrastructure is imperative during the response to the COVID-19 emergency for both public health and safety as well as community well-being. Certain critical infrastructure industries have a special responsibility in these times to continue operations. This guidance and accompanying list are intended to support State, Local, and industry partners in identifying the critical infrastructure sectors and the essential workers needed to maintain the services and functions Americans depend on daily and WKDW\u0003 need to be able to operate resiliently during the COVID-19 pandemic response. This document gives guidance to 6tate, local, tribal, and territorial jurisdictions and the private sector on defining essential critical infrastructure workers. Promoting the ability of such workers to continue to work during periods of community restriction, access management, social distancing, or closure orders/directives is crucial to community resilience and continuity of essential functions. CONSIDERATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS This list was developed in consultation with federal agency partners, industry experts, and 6tate and local officials, and is based on several key principles: \u0014\u0011Response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic are locally executed, 6tate managed, and federally supported \u0015\u0011Everyone should follow guidance from the CDC, as well as 6tate and local government officials\u000f regarding \u0003 strategies to limit disease spread. \u0016\u0011Workers should be encouraged to work remotely when possible and focus on core business activities. In- person, non-mandatory activities should be delayed until the resumption of normal operations. \u0017\u0011When continuous remote work is not possible, businesses should enlist strategies to reduce the likelihood of\u0003 spreading the disease. This includes \u000f but is not QHFHVVDULO\\\u0003 limited to \u000f separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days \u0003and/or social distancing. These steps can preserve the workforce and allow operations to continue. Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 04/17/20 Page 33 App.640Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce CONNECT WITH US email organizations should implement their business continuity and pandemic plans, or put plans in place if they do not exist. Delaying implementation is not advised and puts at risk the viability of the business and the health and safety of the employees. 6.In the modern economy, reliance on technology and just- in-time supply chains means that certain workers must be able to access certain sites, facilities, and assets to ensure continuity of functions. 7.Government employees, such as emergency managers, and the business community need to establish andmaintain lines of communication. 8.When government and businesses engage in discussions about critical infrastructure workers, they need toconsider the implications of business operations beyond the jurisdiction where the asset or facility is located. Businesses can have sizeable economic and societal impacts as well as supply chain dependencies that are geographically distributed. 9.Whenever possible, jurisdictions should align access and movement control policies related to criticalinfrastructure workers to lower the burden of workers crossing jurisdictional boundaries. IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKERS The following list of sectors and identified essential critical infrastructure workers are an initial recommended set and are intended to be overly inclusive reflecting the diversity of industries across the United States. CISA will continually solicit and accept feedback on the list (both sectors/sub sectors and identified essential workers) and will evolve the list in response to stakeholder feedback. We will also use our various stakeholder engagement mechanisms to work with partners on how they are using this list and share those lessons learned and best practices broadly. We ask that you share your feedback, both positive and negative on this list so we can provide the most useful guidance to our critical infrastructure partners.

PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER; MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER; [PROPOSED] TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER; CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER INTRODUCTION On April 8, 2020, the Public Health Officer for the County of San Diego promulgated and caused to be served on the Plaintiff an order titled \"Order of the Health Officer and Emergency Regulations\" promulgated by the Defendants on April 8, 2020 (hereinafter, the \"Order,\" attached to the Verified Complaint as Exhibit 1), which brings a sweeping ban on Assembly, and especially Religious Assembly, that (1) exceeds statutory authority, (2) is unconstitutional on-its-face and as applied, and (3) is arbitrary, unreasonable and oppressive. The Plaintiff, which is a Church, suing on its own behalf and to protect the interest of its members, respectfully asks this Court to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm that would otherwise occur on Easter Sunday, April 12, 2020, through this unlawful Order.

At the outset of this memorandum, Plaintiff's Counsel asks the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that Plaintiff and its counsel were made aware of this Order via e-mail at 6:19 p.m. on April 8, 2020, and due to the emergency and irreparable harm that would suffer from allowing it to stand unchallenged, Plaintiff's Counsel has had to work through the night to prepare this Verified Complaint and all other components of this Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. FACTUAL BACKGROUND As set forth in Plaintiff's Verified Complaint, Plaintiff ABIDING PLACE MINISTRIES is a Church (Hereinafter, the \"Church\"), which was founded and duly organized under the laws of the State of California on February 21, 1986, and has ever since assembled as a Church in San Diego County on every Sunday, without exception. Furthermore, the Church holds real and sincere religious beliefs that it must physically assemble in one place on the Lord's day, commonly referred to as Sunday, and that failure to assemble is an unconscionable violation of God's commands. The Church is a small congregation, normally having less than one hundred (100) persons at its Sunday meeting. The Church considers itself to be a family, and all its members work in close proximity with all other members during the week, being employed in essential sectors on their mission base and around the County. In response to Covid-19, the Public Health Officer for the County of San Diego promulgated the Order, after repeated efforts by the Church to find a way to hold an assembly while advancing the Government's interests. The Church has made it clear that they only seek to worship God freely but are willing to go to great lengths to enact measures that advance the government interests reflected in the Order. However, despite these efforts, the Public Health Officer for the County of San Diego, and the County of San Diego, have informed the Church that if they assemble, no matter what precautions they take, they will be in violation of the Order, and the Order will be enforced against Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.56 Page 2 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 3 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 them, including misdemeanor charges, and possible arrest, fine and imprisonment. The Public Health Officer and the County of San Diego have refused to meet with the Church to discuss possible alternatives, and have refused to consider extreme social distancing measures that the Church is willing to enact in order to uphold their supreme duty to obey God's command to assemble. This is a profound harm and goes to the heart of the First Amendment, as it is a prohibition of the Free Exercise of Religion and an abridgement of the right to peacefully assemble. Not only does the order impeded the Church's right to freely exercise their religion, on its face or as applied it also seeks to shame the Church for seeking to act according to the dictates of their conscience. It prevents the Church from conducting its assembly in any manner, and comes into effect and is directed right at the most important assembly of the year: Resurrection Sunday, commonly referred to as Easter, which is the anniversary of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and a time where the Church must assemble to rededicate their lives to God. The Church has made three explicit proposals to the Public Health Officer, and a number of ancillary proposals, including enforcing social distancing at its services, requiring congregants to wear protective gear (including hazmat suits), assembling in vehicles, assembling by family units spread out over a large area and not permitted to interact with any other family units. The three specific proposals are attached to the Verified Complaint as Exhibits 3, 4 and 5. The Church is not seeking to be allowed to meet in reckless disregard of the government's interest in slowing the spread of Covid-19, but rather with the willingness to go to great lengths to comport with that interest. All other relevant facts and documentary exhibits are included with the Verified Complaint, and concurrently filed with this motion. Suffice it to say, the Church is challenging this Order now, which was sent to them via e-mail late yesterday evening (at 6:19 p.m. on April 8, 2020) because of the extraordinary harm that would result if a temporary restraining order does not issue before this Sunday's service. /// /// Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 4 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ARGUMENT To obtain a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") or a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff must show that (1) it \"is likely to succeed on the merits;\" (2) it \"is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief;\" (3) \"the balance of equities tips in [its] favor; and\" (4) \"an injunction is in the public interest.\" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Plaintiff can show that his challenge readily rises to this standard. A. Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of their Claims. 1. The Order violates the Health and Safety Code, because it exceeds the authority given to the Public Health Officer under the sections of that code which are cited to justify its existence. The order states that it is made by the Public Health Officer pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5(b). However, a reading of those sections of that Code shows that this type of order is far outside the scope of the authority given to the Public Health Officer. Code Section 101040 states, in relevant part: \"(a) The local health officer may take any preventative measure that may be necessary to protect and preserve the public from any public health hazard during any... 'state of emergency...' (b) 'Preventative measure' means abatement, correction, removal or any other protective step that may be taken against any public health hazard...\" (emphasis added). Abatement is governed by Health and Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 2060 - 2067, and requires notice of a public nuisance and direction to abate the nuisance within a specified time. Correction and removal similarly require the existence of some readily defined public health threat that can be corrected and removed and is provided for by statute. As abatement, correction and removal are defined and limited by provisions of the Health and Safety Code, and ordinarily exercised by a board of trustees, but in case of emergency allowed to be exercised by the Public Health Officer, \"other protective steps\" must also be provided by statute. Similarly, Code Section 120175 allows the Public Health Officer to take \"measures... necessary... to prevent...\" Those are the same words as \"preventative measure that may be necessary,\" which is already defined in Section 101040(b), and described above. Neither of these Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.58 Page 4 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 5 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 two sections give the Public Health Officer the authority to promulgate countywide rules that affect a vast number of persons who have had no exposure to disease at all. Finally, then, we must look to section 120175.5(b), the last section cited, which states: \"...the local health officer may issue orders to other governmental entities within the local health officer's jurisdiction to take any action the local health officer deems necessary to control the spread of communicable disease\" (emphasis added). This section cannot be read to grant the local health officer the authority to issue orders to every person in the County, which is the scope of the order challenged in this motion. Therefore, the Public Health Officer has exceeded the authority of the statutes given to justify the Order, and the Order must be temporarily restrained. 2. The Order, on its face or as applied, violates the First Amendment Free Exercise and Assembly Clauses, and the Fifth Amendment Due Proess . i. Free Exercise Neutral laws of general applicability can burden the Free Exercise Right only when they are actually neutral, actually general, and do not implicate other fundamental Constitutional rights. See Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). If they are not neutral, not general, and/or implicate other fundamental Constitutional rights, then strict scrutiny applies, and the government must show that its actions are narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling objective. Id.; See also, Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963). The Order is not neutral because it singles out religious activity for special treatment. While allowing every other category of essential activity to be conducted with the simple requirements that they enact social distancing and increased sanitation standards, and having far more than one-hundred-and-fifty (150) other categories of exemptions, the Order singles out \"faith based services\" and only allows them to be provided \"via streaming or other technology.\" That is not neutral. The Order is not generally applicable because, as was just stated, there are over one- hundred-and-fifty (150) broad categories of exemptions where gatherings are allowed with only two restrictions: (1) the ability to enact social distancing, and (2) increased sanitation standards. Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.59 Page 5 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 6 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The Church has shown in its Verified Complaint, and the attached exhibits, that it can enact social distancing and santiation standards that go beyond what is required of any other business. Even if the Order were neutral and generally applicable, which it is not, the Supreme Court has held that \"the First Amendment bars application of a neutral generally applicable law to religiously motivated conduct... on the ground that... not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but that Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections.\" Employment Division v. Smith, supra, at 881. Here, as shown below, there are other constitutional protections implicated, especially considering that the Order singles out \"gatherings,\" which in themselves are protected by the Assembly Clause of the First Amendment, and Article I, \u00a73(a) of the California Constitution. That brings us back to the lease restrictive means test announced set forth Sherbert. Here, the Plaintiff has proposed several means that accomplish the government's interest and are less restrictive on their Constitutional Rights. As such, they are likely to succeed on the merits. ii. Assembly The right of the citizens of the United States of America to peacefully assemble cannot be abridged. And, the citizens of California have a right to freely assemble. This Order abridges that right by prohibiting all \"gatherings\" or one or more people. While the Supreme Court has allowed time, place and manner restrictions for gatherings on public property, it has held that those restrictions must be (1) content neutral, (2) narrowly tailored, and (3) leave open \"ample alternative channels.\" See Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal citations omitted). Here, the prohibition on gathering is not content neutral, as the Order arbitrarily decides what types of gatherings are \"essential\" and what type are \"not essential,\" and then arbitrarily decides that \"faith based\" gatherings are \"not essential,\" without clearly declaring the standard for that decision, and despite the fact that they should be entitled to a higher degree of protection because of the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause. Furthermore, the prohibition is not narrowly tailored, because it broadly bans all \"gatherings,\" and does not provide a less restrictive alternative for \"gatherings\" that are able to Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.60 Page 6 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 7 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 protect and advance the government's interest through alternative means, as were proposed by Plaintiff in this case. Furthermore, it broadly exempts over one-hundred-and-fifty (150) broad bulleted categories of assemblies. Finally, there is no alternative channel left open, as the ability to assemble for the purposes of Church is completely prohibited, whether the assembly takes place on private property, in an open field, or with all members confined to their vehicles. As set forth in the Verified Complaint, the Public Health Officer was unwilling to consider any kind of alternatives to an outright ban on the Church's Assembly. iii. Due Process Finally, for the section on its unconstitutionality, this order is a violation of the Church's Fifth Amendment Right to Due Process. Due to a scarcity of time, Counsel cannot fully brief this or the other issues preceding and following this but asks the Court to look at the Verified Complaint and see that a number of Due Process rights are implicated by this Order. Furthermore, when asked to meet with the Church and its Pastor to discuss alternatives, the Public Health Officer and County Counsel outright refused. There was no opportunity for a hearing before the deprivation of these rights, just an impermissible executive fiat. Counsel wishes to remind the Court that public safety has always been the justification for acts considered repugnant to the Constitution, including the incarceration of an entire race in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) (overruled by dicta in Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. __ [2018]). 3. The Order, on its face or as applied, is arbitrary, unreasonable and oppressive. Consider the following hypotheticals: Under the Order, on its face or as applied, an individual who is asymptomatic, but a potential Covid-19 carrier, who lives on one end of the County can travel across the County to pick up an item in stock at a home improvement store on the other side of the County, stopping to pick up food from a restaurant in one city, pumping gas at a fuel station and purchasing refreshments from a convenience store in another, then gather at his relative's house in even another part of the County, and then return home, stopping at the grocery store on his way, and Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.61 Page 7 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 8 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 although he has gathered and spread germs far and wide, he is not in violation of the Order, because all of his activities are exempted from the order even though none of his activities are explicitly protected by the Constitution. Under the Order, on its face or as applied, another man who is asymptomatic, but a potential Covid-19 carrier, can drop his clothes off at a public laundromat in the morning, go to work at an \"essential\" job selling cannabis at a cannabis retail distributor, alongside coworkers from other parts of the County, interacting with germs from a large number of customers arriving from different parts of the County, and then go for a walk in a public park near his home, before returning to the public laundromat, picking up and spreading germs at all of these places, and he is not in violation of the Order, because all of his activities are exempted from the order even though none of his activities are explicitly protected by the Constitution. Under the Order, on its face or as applied, an individual who is asymptomatic, but a potential Covid-19 carrier, can take public transportation around the County, go to a group therapy session, stop on her way home to donate blood, drop a prescription off at a pharmacy, step into a bank to open a new account, stop off at the post office to mail a package, and then start a job providing cleaning services to houses all around the County, picking up and spreading germs at all of these places, and she is not in violation of the Order, because all of her activities are exempted from the order even though none of her activities are explicitly protected by the Constitution. However, a woman who otherwise remains in her home cannot exercise her Constitutionally protected right to Free Exercise of Religion by attending Church (as demanded by her conscience), even if she maintains the strictest standards of social distancing and sanitization, including remaining in her vehicle during Church, or wearing a hazmat suit, and spreading her germs as little as possible. B. The Church is likely to suffer irreparable harm unless a temporary restraining order is issued as quickly as possible. Resurrection Sunday, commonly referred to as \"Easter,\" only happens once per year, and is considered the most important Assembly date by the Church. Unless a temporary restraining Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/20 PageID.62 Page 8 of 10Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 9 _________________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 order is issued, the Church's Constitutional Right to Assemble and Freely Exerci se their Religion will be violated, by an executive order that provides little notice and no possible alternatives. Among other things, the Order will hurt the Church and its members, prevent or disrupt them from acting according to the dictates of their conscience, not allow them to go to extraordinary lengths to protect the public interest in the exercise of the dictates of their conscience, interfere with a High Holy Day, Holy Convocation, and Sacred Ceremony when there are several less restrictive means of achieving the government's interest, and allow an unlawful, overbroad, vague and excessive administrative action to be enforced against the highest form of Constitutionally protected activities. These harms cannot be remedied through damages. C. The balance of equities weighs in the Church's favor because they have gone to great lengths trying to work out a solution with the County before being forced into seeking this temporary restraining order. The Church has done everything possible to avoid having to seek a temporary restraining order, even being willing to allow the Coun ty Health Officer to place any manner of restrictions on their assembly, and mere days before the planned Assembly, in the late evening hours, when any chance of relief was almost entirely extinguished, the County Health Officer promulgated a new order that seems to have been crafted as a response to the Church's proposals. Where the Church proposed to meet in socially distanced family units of less than ten (10), in accordance with the Public Health Officer's prior order, the Public Health Officer reduced the number allowed in a gathering to one. Where the Church proposed to meet in vehicles, the Public Health Officer explicitly forbade meetings in vehicles. While this might be coincidental, it does not change the fact that the Church has gone to extraordinary lengths, including extended negotiations with the Sheriff's Office prior to receiving their first communication from the Public Health Officer. And, on top of all of that, the Public Health Officer is likely overstepping her authority as provided by the statutes she cites justifying the Order, and the Church is seeking to uphold the highest type of constitutional right, two explicitly protected rights.

An injunction is in the public interest because it upholds the rights protected by the Constitution and prevents an unconstitutional and unlawful overreach by a Public Health Officer. \"[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\" See Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012). And, the Government's interest in slowing the spread of Covid-19 can be achieved through the same types of restrictions placed on other businesses and activities they exempt - businesses and activities that include \"gatherings,\" but are by and large not otherwise protected by the Constitution. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, and others that should be obvious to the Court and flow as the natural and apparent out currents from the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiff's application for a temporary restraining order.

The California Emergency Services Act, including but not limited to Government Code section 8630 and the County of San Diego Emergency Services Organization Ordinance (Code of Regulatory Ordinances, sections 31.101 et seq.) empower the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of San Diego as Director of Emergency Services, to proclaim the existence or threatened existence of a local emergency when said County is affected or likely to be affected by a public calamity and the Board of Supervisors is not in session; and R2. The Chief Administrative Officer of the County of San Diego as Director of Emergency Services, does hereby find that on February 14, 2020, conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property have arisen within San Diego County. A novel coronavirus, COVID-19, causes infectious disease and was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath; outcomes have ranged from mild to severe illness, and in some cases death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the virus to be a very serious public health threat. Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person to person. COVID-19 illnesses, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern.\" On January 31, 2020, United States Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. On February 2, 2020, the United States government suspended entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days. United States citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who were in the Hubei province and other parts of mainland China are screened upon their entry into the United States. Those without symptoms who were not in Hubei province are allowed to continue to their final destination, but are requested to self-quarantine in coordination with local public health officials for up to fourteen days. Quarantine of some such individuals returning from Wuhan is presently occurring in Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar. There are currently two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in San Diego County. Although these two cases are part of a federal quarantine at MCAS Miramar, due to the large population and geographic location of San Diego County, Page 1 of 3 County of San Diego -02-14-20 Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 6-1 Filed 04/10/20 16Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed App.690combined with the worldwide spread ofCOVID-19, there is a potential threat of the introduction of COVID-19 in San Diego County; and R3. The Board of Supervisors of the County of San Diego is not in session and cannot immediately be called into session; and R4. The Chief Administrative Officer of the County of San Diego as Director of Emergency Services, finds that these emergency conditions will require immediate action including additional resources, services, personnel, equipment, facilities and funding to contain a threat of danger to the public health; and RS. This Proclamation of Local Emergency will be ratified by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to law. PROCLAMATIONS AND ORDERS NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED AND ORDERED by the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of San Diego as Director of Emergency Services, as follows: 1. That a local emergency exists throughout San Diego County pursuant to Government Code section 8630 and as defined by Government Code section 8558 and shall be deemed to continue to exist subject to ratification, review and termination by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Government Code section 8630. 2. That during the existence of said local emergency the powers, functions, and duties of the emergency organization of this county shall be those prescribed by State law including but not limited to Government Code section 8634, County ordinances and resolutions, and the current Emergency Services Agreement and Operational Area Emergency Plan. 3. That a copy of this Proclamation be forwarded to the Director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (\"Director Cal OES\") requesting that Director Cal OES find this Proclamation acceptable in accordance with State law and forward this Proclamation to the Governor of the State of California for consideration and action on San Diego County's requests that: 3.1 The Governor of California proclaim a State of Emergency in San Diego County. 3.2 The Governor suspend those statutes, regulations, rules and orders that may hinder response and recovery efforts. 3.3 The Governor order that recovery assistance be made available to Page 2 of3 County of San Diego-02-14-20 Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 6-1 16Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 391) App.691San Diego County under the California Disaster Assistance Act to respond to and assist in prevention of potential spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and assist in treatment of those potentially affected. 3.4 The Governor order that the State expedite access to Federal resources and any other appropriate federal disaster relief programs for San Diego County. 4.

On February 14, 2020, the San Diego County Public Health Officer issued a Declaration of Local Health Emergency, pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 101080, as a result of the international COVID -19 outbreak. Additionally, on February 14, pursuant to California Government Code 8630, the Chief Administrative Officer serving as the County of San Diego (County) Director of Emergency Services and as the Coordinator of the Unified San Diego County Emergency Services Organization, issued a Proclamation of Local Emergency regarding COVID-19. While the current, local situation remains stable, today's recommended actions will provide the County additional powers to coordinate local efforts and identify resources that may be necessary to fully address the response in the event that the situation evolves. The virus is considered to be a very serious public health threat for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, the fact that much is unknown about the nature of the virus such as the exact modes of transmission, the factors facilitating human- to-human transmission, the extent of asymptomatic viral shedding, the groups most at risk of serious illness, the attack rate, and the case fatality rate. All these factors remain active areas of investigation. Additionally, there is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID -19 or specific antiviral treatment. What is known at this time is that the virus is spread between people primarily via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and infected individuals have experienced a range of outcomes, from mild sickness to severe illness and death. Based on experience with other coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently believes that symptoms appear two to 14 days after exposure.

Today's action requests the Board to ratify, and find that there is a continuing need for, both the Declaration of Local Health Emergency and Proclamation of Local Emergency. If approved, the Board's ratification of the Proclamation of Local Emergency will (1) further ensure legal immunities for emergency actions taken by the County; (2) facilitate requests by the County and other local governments for State and Federal assistance under the State and Federal Disaster Assistance Programs; and (3) allow the Chief Administrative Officer (or authorized official) to take preventive measures necessary to protect and preserve public health and safety. RECOMMENDATION(S) CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER 1. Ratify the attached Declaration of Local Health Emergency made by the Public Health Officer on February 14, 2020. 2. Find that there is a continuing need for the local health emergency until no longer needed, subject to the California Health and Safety Code Section 101080 requirements. 3. Ratify the attached Proclamation of Local Emergency made by the Chief Administrative Officer on February 14, 2020. 4. Find that there is a need for continuing the local emergency until no longer needed, subject to California Government Code 8630 review requirements. FISCAL IMPACT The estimated costs in responding to the international novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are currently being assessed. The primary costs being incurred by the County of San Diego (County) are for physician and other clinical and administrative support staff in the coordination, surveillance, communication and management of the COVID -19 local health emergency and local emergency, as well as related services and supplies, including requested ambulance standby and transport services. It does not include various hospital-related costs for patient care or for the shelter and basic care of those quarantined at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar location. Current County costs are being covered by existing department appropriations, including the use of Health and Human Services Agency Management Reserves, and are funded with General Fund fund balance, Realignment, and General Purpose Revenue. Staff will pursue federal and State reimbursement for all County costs incurred. There is no change in net General Fund and no additional staff years.

Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., declare and state as follows: 1. I am the Public Health Officer for the County of San Diego, and I am in 24 charge of the County's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 25 2. On April 8, 2020, I issued the Order of the Health Officer and Emergency 26 Regulations which Plaintiff Abiding Place Ministries seeks to enjoin. 27 I I I 28 / / / Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 6-2 Filed 04/10/20 PageID.105 Page 1 of 3Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 391) App.7001 3. During the last week, I exchanged correspondence with representatives of 2 Plaintiff regarding its intent to have a religious service in Campo on Easter Sunday. Such 3 a gathering of people would violate my April 8 Public Health Order and Governor 4 Newsom's Emergency Executive Order N-33-20. Both orders essentially require all 5 individuals in the state to stay at home or at their residence unless they are acting as 6 \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\" as identified under the orders 7 4. Congregants at in-person church services such as the one proposed by 8 Plaintiff are not acting as Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers. Faith based services 9 are allowed only if the services are provided through streaming or other technology. In 10 other words, people may participate in a faith based service, but they must remain at 11 home. 12 5. Plaintiffs proposal to hold Easter service for congregants sitting in their cars 13 in a parking area in Campo violates the stay-at-home Public Health Orders because, by 14 definition, the congregants must leave their homes and residences and drive to Campo in 15 order to park in the parking lot. Allowing people to leave their homes and drive to a 16 religious service puts everyone's health in San Diego County at risk because the COVID- 17 19 virus is easily spread. While driving to Campo, the congregants may stop to put 18 gasoline in their car, purchase food or use the restroom. Or they may get out of their cars 19 at the location of the service to use the restroom, or greet a friend. Any of these activities 20 by a person with the virus could cause a County \"hotspot.\" None of these activities and 21 the resulting health risks would occur if the church members follow the Public Health 22 Orders and stay at home. 23 6. The members of Plaintiffs church undoubtedly believe worshipping 24 together is important. However, the health risks associated with Plaintiffs \"drive-in\" 25 proposal are real. The same health risks do not exist if Plaintiffs congregants, and all 26 people of faith, stay home and participate in their services electronically. Temporarily 27 staying at home keeps all San Diego residents safe and furthers the critical County-wide 28 goal of \"flattening\" the COVID-19 curve. 2 20-cv-00683 Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 6-2 04/10/20 3Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed 391) App.7011 7. As of April 9, 2020, San Diego County had 1,628 individuals test positive 2 for COVID-19 and 40 have died from that virus. April is the critical month in San Diego 3 County to flatten the COVID-19 epidemiological curve by staying at home. Unless our 4 region successfully flattens the curve of COVID-19 illnesses through aggressive and 5 comprehensive measures, local hospitals will become overwhelmed with COVID-19 6 patients; and there will not be enough medical personnel, hospital beds, and ventilators to 7 treat all of the patients. For these measures to have success, the Public Health Orders 8 must have broad application and compliance. 9 I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Sheriffs Deputy Richard Phillips responded to 4 the complaint and observed that a church service was in progress in a tent, and the 50-60 5 people in attendance were seated closer than six feet apart. A true and correct copy of 6 Deputy Phillips' s Crime/Incident Report regarding this matter is attached to this 7 declaration as Exhibit 1. As indicated on the bottom of that report, I reviewed and 8 approved it on March 31, 2020 . 9 3. When I arrived at the church service location on April 5, I observed cars 10 driving onto the property. A church member, Jeremiah Graham, stopped each car as it 11 approached and told the occupants to stay in their cars during the church service, but that 12 they could leave their cars to use the bathroom. I left the area before the church service 13 began. 14 4. When I returned to the location of the church service about three hours later, 15 most of the cars had left the parking lot. However, 6-7 people were standing together 16 near a tent, less than six feet apart. When the group of people saw me, they walked away 17 from each other, and entered two vehicles which drove toward the exit. One of the cars 18 stopped when it reached me. Mr. Graham got out and told me that the church service 19 ended about an hour earlier, and 10-12 people had stayed to help break down the stage 20 due to the inclement weather.

Campo Truck Trail in Campo. Local residents called into the Sheriff's Department requesting enforcement of the current Social Distancing Ordinances. Abiding Place Ministries had a congregation of approximately 50- 60 parishioners during the services. A warning was given to staff members of the church of the violation but they refused to end the services and stated they were not violating any of the current orders. ORIGIN: On 03/29/2020 at approximately 1115 hours, I was dispatched to 2155 N. Campo Truck Trail in Campo regarding a state issued Ordinance Violation. The contact was captured on Sheriff's Department Body Worn Camera video and the following report is a synopsis of my contact. INVESTIGATION: Upon my arrival into the property, I immediately noticed approximately 20+ cars on the property. I drove onto an upper level where I noticed a large white tent with people inside of it. As I approached the tent and parked, one subject walked to my location to greet me. I noticed approximately 50-60 people inside the tent sitting in chairs and standing as one subject was on a stage delivering a sermon. I first spoke with the staff member who greeted me as I exited my vehicle. I asked the person if he was in charge and he told me currently he was the person in charge. I explained to him they were in violation I I I I I I I I I I I I Case 3:20-cv-00683-BAS-AHG Document 6-3 Filed 04/10/20 PageID.112 Page 5 of 8Case 5:20-cv-00755-JGB-KK Document 13-1 Filed San Diego County Sheriff's Department Crime/Incident Report 3 Page 3 of 3 Case No. 20115300 CAD Event No.: E6420459 Case Disposition: Active Primary Victim: State of California Report No. 20115300.1 Reporting Officer Division / Organization Reviewed By SH2270 - PHILLIPS, RICHARD Rural Enforcement RURAL CAMPO SH2212 - UELEN, BILL Report Date Detective Assigned Reviewed Date 3/30/2020 9:52:07 SH2270 - SH2212 Printed: April 9, 2020 - 2:13 PM of the state issued ordinance to not congregate with 10 or more persons. The staff member told me he believed the orde r did not pertain to their church and they were within the guidelines. The staff member told me they church was abiding by the recommendation to stay 6' apart from each other and some of the other orders. I pointed at the people sitting in chairs inside the tent and told the gentleman the chairs were at best 2 -3 feet apart and nobody inside the tent were at the recommended 6 foot distance. As I continued to speak with the staff member another male adult approached us. The gentleman I was speaking with in troduced the other male subject as his son, who later identified himself as Jeremiah Graham. Jeremiah told me he is the Secretary of the church and then told me he is a \"Civil Rights Attorney\". Jeremiah told that should I arrest anyone for attending the services I would be sued. I explained to Jeremiah there was an order issued by the State of California that restricts their right to congregate with 10 or more people. Jeremiah told me he has reviewed the order from the state and it would be a violation of their civil rights to arrest them based on the order. I explained to Jeremiah I was not current on the actual law that prohibits their right to congregate with more than 10 people as the residents in the area have all complied with the order and there has been no need to apply the law currently. I told Jeremiah I would contact my command staff regarding the order and the Sheriff's Department would be in touch to discuss the law. During our conversation, Jeremiah continuously attempted to argue their right to worship and suggesting I had no authority to enforce the current orders from the state. I tried to reason with Jeremiah and asked how long the church had been in the area. Jeremiah told me the church moved in to the location in June. I tried t o explain to Jeremiah this is a small community and he and his people are now upsetting their immediate neighbors and will eventually be causing turmoil within the community. I tried to appeal to them to be a good neighbor. I explained that people are ve ry concerned about the Covid 19 virus and even more concerned knowing the church is holding large gatherings with people coming from the large city areas of San Diego. Jeremiah told me the church held the cure for the Covid 19 virus. Jeremiah told me tha t should anyone be concerned about the virus the church would be happy to pray with them and it would keep that person from getting the virus or it would cure anyone with the virus. I ended my conversation with both subjects and let them know somebody f rom the Sheriff's Department would be in touch to discuss the lawful order. Jeremiah gave me his name and phone number and told me I could contact him and set up a meeting. While giving me his name and number Jeremiah felt it necessary to give me his sta te \"Bar\" number.

Campo Truck Trail, Campo, to do extra patrol for COVID-19 County Order compliance. When I arrived, I observed a male adult who I recognized as Jeremiah Graham standing near the main electronic gate onto the property belonging to Abiding Places Ministries. I exited my Sheriff's patrol vehicle and greeted Graham and watched as he addressed arriving worshipers. As vehicles approached, Graham stopped each one of them and explained to them that today's service (04/05/2020) would be a drive-in movie style setting, to remain seated in their vehicles and to tune their radio into 89.1 to listen to the service. Graham went on to tell them that the bathrooms would be open for use, but to please adhere to the current County Order regarding the social distancing guidelines, and that there would be someone directing each vehicle where to park. BWC video is available showing Graham give his speech to an arriving vehicle. I thanked Graham for his continued efforts to find a common ground for worship, while still trying to adhere to the county order. I left the area with no further incident. On 04/05/2020, at approximately 1410 hours, I returned to the property belonging to Abiding Place Ministries to check on the worshipers COVID-19 compliance. When I arrived, I could only see two vehicles and a small group of 6-7 people standing near the tent. When the group of people saw me, they walked away from each other and entered two vehicles. The vehicles drove towards the main gate to exit the property. One of the vehicle was occupied by Jeremiah Graham who stopped and exited his vehicle to talk with me. Graham said that the sermon ended right around 1300 hours and a group of 10- 12 remained at that time to help break down the stage due to the oncoming inclement weather. Graham said the other vehicle that I watched leave was the last of the group and everyone that remained on the property all lived there. Graham said Pastor Mark advised his congregation to drive straight home to their respective residences from Campo. Lastly, Graham added that after I left prior to the start of the service, he \"was kicking himself\" after failing to welcome me onto the property to watch the service to ensure their compliance to the health order. Graham passed along his gratitude to everyone involved in allowing this modified day of worship. There has been no further extra patrols or calls for service at 2155 N. Campo Truck Trail since I left on Sunday 04/05/2020.

Yet, for months , the Government's Orders have prohibited Appellants Wendy Gish, Patrick Scales, James Dean Moffatt, and Brenda Wood (\"Church Members\") and their congregations from engaging in communal worship .1 The Orders allow secular activities of an indistinguishable n ature to continue provided that social distancing 1 \"Orders\" hereinafter refers to the Stay -at-Home Executive Order issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom, ER 96 -97, the San Bernardino Order , ER 99 - 102, the San Bernardino Order Clarification, ER 197, the Riverside Order, ER 104 - 111, as modified by Gove rnor Newsom's May 4, 2020 Order detailing California's Reopening Plan, Executive Order N -60-20, RJN Exs. 1 -2. The Counties have since rescinded their orders, and now rely solely on the Governor's Executive Orders for purposes of enforcement. RJN Ex. 5. \"Government\" hereinafter refers to Defendants -Appellees Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of California; Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Attorney General of California; Erin Gustafson, in her official capacity as the San Bernard ino County Acting Public Health Officer; John McMahon, in his official capacity as the San Bernardino County Sheriff; Robert A. Lovingood, in his official capacity as a San Bernardino County Supervisor; Janice Rutherford, in her official capacity as a San Bernardino County Supervisor; Dawn Rowe, in her official capacity as a San Bernardino County Supervisor; Curt Hagman, in his official capacity as a San Bernardino County Supervisor; Josie Gonzales, in his official capacity as a San Bernardino County Superv isor; Cameron Kaiser, in his official capacity as the Riverside County Public Health Officer; George Johnson, in his official capacity as the Riverside County Executive Officer and Director of Emergency Services; Chad Bianco, in his official capacity as th e Riverside County Sheriff; Kevin Jeffries, in his official capacity as a Riverside County Supervisor; Karen Spiegel, in her official capacity as a Riverside County Supervisor; Chuck Washington, in his official capacity as a Riverside County Supervisor; V. Manuel Perez, in his official capacity as a Riverside County Supervisor; and Jeff Hewitt, in his official capacity as a Riverside County Supervisor . Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 10 of 56 App.725 2 protocols are observed, while denying religious communities the opportunity to meet under the same standards. For the duration of California's coronavirus lockdown, the Government has let the public stroll freely down the busy aisles of their local grocery store for an indefinite period of time ; go to the hospital for certain types of elective surgeries; and even arrange for plumbers, electricians, and exterminators to come into their homes for extend ed periods. Yet, the Church Members cannot not go to church; attend a baptism; gather to pray for the sick and dying; or even attend an outdoor funeral service for departed loved ones, regardless of the number of persons attending or the precautions they offered to take. As the Governor has now started to move toward a phased reopening, shopping malls, swap meets, hair salons, and dine -in restaurants will soon be allowed to open with social distancing, but churches, mosques, synagogues , and other places of worship will, at best, be subjected to cumbersome capacity and other restrictions applicable to religious activities only. At worst, communal worship will remain or revert to being altogether criminalized by the Government, which the Government h as indicated is a real possibility. RJN Ex. 9, p. 2 (\"[n]ot adhering to all of the guidelines in their entirely [sic] could result in . . . the re 20-55445, App.726 3 The Government's criminalization of communal worship violate s the Church Memb ers' fundamental rights to religious liberty, freedom of speech and assembly, and due process and equal protection under the law. Accordingly, the Church Members respectfully request that this Court reverse the district court's denial of interlocutory inju nctive relief, and remand to the district court for further proceedings . ISSUES PRESENTED 1. Did the district court err by creating an unprecedented \"minimal scrutiny\" standard for emergencies when reviewing the Church Members' claims for the deprivation of their fundamental rights ? 2. Are the Church Members likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Government's actual and threatened prohibition on communal religious worship violates the United States and California Constitutions? 3. Are the Church Members likely to suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction prohibiting the Government from further criminalizing communal religious worship? 4. Do the public consequences of a preliminary injunction weigh in favor of temporarily enjoining t he Government from further prohibiting religious worship on terms more restrictive than those applicable to comparable secular activities ? Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 12 of 56 App.727 4 STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION The district court had federal question subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(a) and supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. This Court has jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders of the district court that grant, continue, modify, refuse, or dissolve injunctions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) . An order denying a temporary restraining order may be appealable if it is tantamount to the denial of a preliminary injunction . Religious Tech. Ctr., Church of Scientology Int'l, Inc. v. Scott , 869 F.2d 1306, 1308 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing Envtl. Defense Fund, Inc. v. Andrus , 625 F.2d 861, 862 (9th Cir. 1980) ). This is so where the denial followed a \"full adversary hearing\" and if, \"in the absence of review, the appellant would be effectively forec losed from pursuing further interlocutory relief.\" Andrus , 625 F.2d at 862. Here, this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal because the order below is tantamount to the d enial of a preliminary injunction. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Appellants had moved for (1) a temporary restraining order and (2) an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue . ER 129. The district court denied their requests following a full briefing on the merits and a lengthy telephonic hearing, at which all parties were represented by ER 10-46. Case: 20-55445, 13 of 56 App.728 5 At the conclusion of the hearing, the Church Members' counsel renewed their request for a further hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue . ER 45:8-16. The Honorable Jesus G. Bernal responded by stating that he would \"consider that,\" and thereafter issued the order denying the Church Members' motion in full , and without setting any further hearing on the Church Members' request for a preliminary injunction . Id. By denying the Church Members' motion, the district court effectively decided the merits of the case and foreclosed the possibility of any further interlocutory relief. In the order, the district court erroneously held , for example, that \"as acts of the executive in response to a national emergency, the [Government's ] Orders are subject to only minimal scrutiny, which they easily survive.\" ER 4-5. The court further held that \"even absent consideration of greater leeway afforded to executive acts during a state of emergency, the Orders do not violate [the Chur ch Members' ] rights under traditional constitutional analysis,\" because the Orders survive rational basis review. ER 5. The district court's decision not only conclusively denies interlocutory injunctive relief , but it effectively decided the merits of the case, providing this Court jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to of 56 App.729 6 STATEMENT OF THE CASE I. STATEMENT OF FACTS On March 4, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency as a result of the threat of COVID -19. ER 274-78. He then issued Executive Order N -33-20 on March 19, 2020, requiring that \"all residents . . . heed the current State public health directives.\" ER 96-97. The state public health directive require s \"all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastru cture sectors . . . .\" Id. The directive provides that it \"shall stay in effect until further notice.\" Id. On March 22, 2020, the California Public Health Officer designated a list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers.\" 2 ER 285-98. Listed as a pa rt of the \"essential workforce\" were coffee baristas, grocery store workers , laundromats employees , workers supporting the entertainment industry, and workers supporting ecommerce . Id. The list also include d \"faith based services [] provided through streaming or other technology.\" 3 ER 295. Accordingly, the Executive Order 2 On April 28, 2020, state officials issued an amended \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers\" list, r evising slightly the list of allowable \"essential\" activities under the Governor's shelter -in-place order. RJN Ex. 4. 3 After the Church Members initiated this action, Governor Newsom stated in court filings that drive -in worship services were permitted u nder the Executive Order as Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 15 of 56 App.730 7 prohibit s religious leaders from providing communal religious services to their congregations , regardless of whether any non -technological measures might be taken to reduce or elim inate the risk of the virus spreading, such as offering socially -distanced seating for family units, or mask and glove requirements. ER 96-97. On May 4, 2020, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N -60-20, also called California's Reopening Plan. RJN Exs. 1, 2 . The plan allows schools, restaurants, factories, offices, shopping malls, swap meets, and others to operate with social distancing in Stage 2 of California's four-stage reopening process , but does not permit houses of worship to hold religious worship services until Stage 3, which may be several months from now . Id. The Reopening Plan permits counties to \"move through Stage 2 faster if they are able to show greater progress,\" through a \"variance and attestatio n\" procedure. Id; see also RJN Ex. 3. San Bernardino and Riverside Counties submitted variance and attestation forms that do not indicate that communal worship reopen earlier than Stage 3 . RJN Ex. 3. On May 19, 2020, the United States Department of Justic e Civil Rights Division sent a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom raising \"several civil rights a form of \"other technology.\" ER 17:2 -13. Thereafter, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties issued statements indicating that drive -in worship services would henceforth be permitted. Id. Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 16 of 56 App.731 8 concerns with the treatment of places of worship\" in Executive Orders N -33-20 and N -60-20 and documents relating to the California Reopening Plan . RJN Ex. 6. Four days later, on May 23, 2020, the CDC issued guidance declaring religious worship to be \"essential,\" and offering suggestions on how religious communities may practice their faiths while minimizing the risk of transmission of the virus. RJN Ex. 7. Despite the federal government's insistence that places of worship be allowed to reopen safely , Governor Newsom has refused to do so. Instead, on May 25, 2020, the Government issued guidance materials imposing additional constraints on religious activities . RJN Ex. 8. Under these new g uidelines, even if a county obtains a variance from the State's order s, religious observers must still comply with a laundry list of requirements that other variance -approved activities need not. Id. For example, under the Ma y 25 guidance, \"[p]laces of worship must [] limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower .\" Id. This is regardless of the size of the house of worship. No other sector of California's economy is subjected to such arbitrary burdens. See RJN Ex. 3 , p. 101 (establishing Stage 2 variances in San Bernardino County for, inter alia , retail stores to operate at 50% capacity and dine -in restaurants to operate at any capacity provided there is \"safe physical distance\" between patrons). Further, because such Case: 20-55445, ID: DktEntry: 24, Page 17 of 56 App.732 9 variances would be subject to review every three weeks, even if requested by th e counties and approved by the State , there remains a real possibility that the Government will simply reinstate its totalitarian ban on communal worship at any time through an unelected county bureaucrat revoking the government \"license to pray\" that vari ance renewals constitute . On May 25, 2020, San Bernardino County issued a News Release stating that religious services could resume in a limited capacity, subject to the State's May 25 guidance. RJN Ex. 9. In the release, the County threatens that \"[ n]ot adhering to all of the guidelines in their entirely [sic] could result in . . . the re - closing of places of worship.\" RJN Ex. 9, p. 2. Appellant Patrick Scales' church, Shield of Faith Family Church, Inc., is located in San Bernardino County. ER 234-236. He desires to hold in -person religious services for those congregants who desire to attend church. Id. Scales believes that he can hold such religious services and abide by social distancing tips recommended by the CDC by keeping congregants at least six fe et apart and providing masks and gloves. Id. He believes that religious services are essential for the spiritual health of the congregation so that the congregants may exhort one another during these difficult times. Id. Scales recognizes that most of his congregants will stay at home, but he wants to be available for those who are Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 18 of 56 App.733 10 healthy and feel that in -person church service can be safely attended with social distancing and other measures. Id. Appellant Wendy Gish atten ds Shield of Faith Family Church and would attend an in -person church service should it be made available to her. ER 232-33. She regularly attends church services and believes that she has a scriptural command to \"not neglect meeting together.\" Id. Appella nt James Moffatt's church, Church Unlimited , is located in Riverside County. ER 217-20. Upon learning about the coronavirus, he immediately had his church building cleaned and disinfected. Id. Moffatt ensured that sanitizing materials were available to eac h person who entered his church and encouraged family units to sit at least six feet apart. Id. He encouraged anyone who was uncomfortable with gathering to stay at home. Id. He also encouraged anyone experiencing symptoms of illness to stay at home. Id. On April 9, 2020, Moffatt was threatened with a fine of one thousand dollars for holding a church service on April 5, 2020, Palm Sunday. ER 218. But for the Orders , Moffatt would continue to hold in -person religious services in Riverside County, while taking the same social distancing precautions taken by the multitude of \"essential businesses\" that continue to operate in the county, despite any prevalence of COVID -19. He believes that it is important for Christians to come together, remember, and celeb rate all that Jesus has done for this world. Id. Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: App.734 11 Appellant Brenda Wood's church, Word of Life Ministries International Inc. is located in Riverside County. ER 237-39. Word of Life Ministries International Inc. has approximately 20 -30 regular attendees. Id. Wood believes Scripture commands her to provide opportunities for the believers to obey Hebrews 10:25 where the believers meet together and encourage one another. Id. During a drive -up Easter Sunday service at Wood's church , communion was served by an in dividual wearing a mask and gloves and the elements were pre - packaged. Id. The person serving Holy C ommunion used tongs to remove the communion cups from the pre -packaged box. Id. At this time, Wood has postponed all baptisms at her church. Id. She would like to hold drive -up church services every Sunday , including by following reasonable precautions while sharing Holy Communion with her congregation . Id. II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On April 13, 2020, the Church Members filed their Verified Complaint, followed by an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue on April 14, 2020. ER 56, 129 . The Government filed oppositions to the motion on April 17, 2020. ER 242, 378, 745 . The Church Members filed their reply and motion for leave to file the same on April 19. ER 999. On April 22, 2020, the district court Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 20 of 56 App.735 12 held a telephonic hearing on the motion, and later issued the order denying the motion on April 24, 2020. ER 1-46, 47 -55. The Church Members filed their notice of appeal on the following court day, April 27, 2020 . ER 1072. On May 3, 2020, the Church Members filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal with this Court, Dkt. 9 , which was denied on May 7, 2020. Dkt. 21. STANDARD OF REVIE W This Court review s a district court 's \"denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.\" All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). In deciding whet her the district court has abused its discretion, the Court employs a two -part test: first the Court \"determine[s] de novo whether the trial court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested; second, [the court] determine[s] if the d istrict court's application of the correct legal standard was (1) illogical, (2) implausible, or (3) without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.\" California v. U.S. Dep 't of Health & Human Servs. , 941 F.3d 410, 420 (9th Ci r. 2019) (citing Pimentel v. Dreyfus , 670 F.3d 1096, 1105 (9th Cir. 2012) ); Zepeda v. U.S. I.N.S. , 753 F.2d 719, 724 (9th Cir. 1983). The district court in this case based its decision on multiple erroneous legal standard s, and applied such standards in a manner that is illogical, implausible, and draws upon unreasonable inferences from facts in the record . Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 21 App.736 13 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT The Government's criminalization of gatherings for religious purposes violates multiple provisions of the U.S. and California Constitutions. 4 The district court abused it s discretion by holding that \"traditional constitutional scrutiny does not apply\" to constitutional violations in an emergency and creating a new, never before recognized \"minimal scrutiny\" standard to analyze the violations of the Church Members' constitu tional rights. ER 4-5. The district court invented this standa rd by misapprehended the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11, 27 (1905). When the Supreme Court has cited Jacobson over the last century , the case has been analyzed within the Court 's traditional tiered scrutiny analysis , not in the context of a \"minimal scrutiny\" standard for emergencies. 4 The Verified Complaint asserts the foll owing causes of action: (1) violation of the Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment; (2) violation of the Establishment Clause of First Amendment; (3) violation of the Free Speech Clause of First Amendment; (4) violation of the First Amendment Freedom of Assembly; (5) violation of the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment by reason of vagueness; (6) violation of substantive rights protected by the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment; (7) violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Am endment; (8) violation of the Right to Liberty (Cal. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 1); (9) Freedom of Speech (Cal. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2); (10) Freedom of Assembly (Cal. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 3); and (11) Free Exercise and Enjoyment of Religion (Cal. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 4). ER 56 -91. Case: 20-55445, 24, Page 22 of 56 App.737 14 The district court further abused its discretion in finding that the Government 's Orders are neutral and generally applicable, and therefore only considering the Church Members' free exercise claims under rational basis review. ER 5. The Orders are neither neutral , nor generally applicable . They single out religious gatherings for explicit restric tions when similarly situated secular entities may remain open while following social distancing guidelines. In its reasoning , the district court inserted its own value judgment that religious worship deserved lesser protection than going to the grocery st ore or picking up coffee , because there remains an inherent risk in any community gathering during the pandemic. In determining that the Church Members' fulfillment of deeply held religious beliefs was worthy of less protection than picking up fast food or marijuana, the Court lumped religious worship, a fundamental civil right protected by our Constitution since its inception, in a column with mere entertainment at concerts or sporting events. ER 6. Free exercise jurisprudence does not permit the government to allow some activities to proceed with risk, but then prohibit comparable religiously - motivated activities. Supreme Court precedent holds freedom of religion in much higher regard . Finally, the district court chose not to address the Church Members' other claims in detail, stating they fail because the Orders were neutral. The Church Members' other claims state independent bases for relief and should not have been Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 23 of 56 App.738 15 dismissed out of hand. For these re asons, the Church Members ask that this Court reverse the decision of the district court and remand to the district court for further proceedings . ARGUMENT This Court has established two sets of criteria for evaluating a request for injunctive relief. Earth Island Inst. v. United States Forest Serv. , 351 F.3d 1291, 1297 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the \"traditional\" criteria, a plaintiff must show (1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable i njury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) advancement of the public interest. See, e.g., Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Where the government is the opposing party, balancing of the harm and the public interest merge. See Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 43 5 (2009). Thus, the Court asks whether any significant \"public consequences\" would result from issuing the preliminary injunction. Winter , 555 U.S. at 24. Alternatively, injunctive relief may be appropriate when a movant raises \"serious questions going to the merits\" and the \"balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,\" provided that the plaintiff is able to show there is a likelihood of irr eparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest. All. for Wild Rockies , 24 of 56 App.739 16 For the reasons addressed below, the Church Members meet all the criteria for injunctive relief. They have proved a clear violation of their constitutional rights ; they will continue to be irreparably injured if relief is not granted ; the balance of hardships tips in favor of protecting the Church Members' constitutional rights ; and it is in the public interest to protect constitutional rights from government overreach. I. THE DISTRICT COURT IS NOT FREE TO INVENT AND THEN MISAPPLY A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD UNMOORED FROM ESTABLISHED SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT . A. Jacobson Does Not Establish a \"Minimal Scrutiny\" Standard for Reviewing the Government's Actions During an Emergency . The district court erred by determining that \"traditional constitutional scrutiny does not apply\" during an emergency and then inventi ng a new standard of \"minimal scrutiny\" out of whole cloth. ER 4, 7. No court has ever held that Constitutional rights give way to plenary state power wholesale in an emergency, and Jacobson , a case examining liberty interests in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment, does not suggest or require this result. Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 27; see also Ex parte Milligan , 71 U.S. 2, 39 (1866) (holding during the Civil War that civilians cannot be convicted by military tribunals while courts remain open); Korematsu v. U.S., 323 U.S. 214 (1944) (condoning internment of Japanese citizens during World Word II); Trump v. Hawaii , 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018) (\"Korematsu [v. U.S., 323 U.S. Japanese Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 25 of 56 App.740 17 citizens during World Word II,] was gravely wrong the day it w as decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and \u2014to be clear \u2014\"has no place in law under the Constitution.\"). The district court's analysis of Jacobson both misinterprets the case itself and fails to consider the last century of Supreme Court precedent both applying Jacobson and developing an established constitutional framework for analyzing potential violations of constitutional rights , sometimes in ver y trying circumstances . Jacobson did not create a \"minimal scrutiny\" standard for violations of constitutional rights in emergency situations and the Supreme Court has never recognized such a standard. Id. In Jacobson , the Supreme Court upheld a conviction under a Massachusetts statute that criminalized the defendant's refusal to vaccinate himself from smallpox, despite the defendant's assertion that the statute violated his liberty interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 12. Jacobson was decided decades before the First Amendment was held to apply to the States by incorporation. See Cantwell v. State of Connecticut , 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940) ; (incorporating the Free Exercise Clause against the States); Gitlow v. New York , 268 U.S. 652 (1925) (Free Speech Clause); De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937) (Free Assembly Clause); Edwards v. South Carolina , 372 U.S. 229 (1963) (Right to Petition). It was not a case involving Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 26 of 56 App.741 18 religious liberty, and therefore does not, and cou ld not, control this Court's analysis of the Church Members' First Amendment claims. Subsequent Supreme Court citations of Jacobson focus largely on questions surrounding interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, in Cruzan by Cruzan v. Dir. , Missouri Department of Health , the Supreme Court compared the liberty interest at issue in Jacobson with the liberty interest at issue in the decision to withhold life -sustaining treatment before applying traditional constitutional scrutiny to the Missou ri policy at issue. Cruzan by Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep 't of Health , 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990). Similarly, in Mills v. Rogers , the Court cited Jacobson in its discussion of how, under the applicable constitutional framework, individuals' liberty interests should be weighed against competing state interests. Mills v. Rogers , 457 U.S. 29 1, 299 (1982). The Supreme Court has frequently cited Jacobson in its discussion of the right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment in the reproduct ive rights context. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113, 154 (1973); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 857 (1992). When cited outside the context of Fourteenth Amendment violations, the Court has used it as an example of potentially permissible restrictions on rights if neutrally applied. See, e.g., Emp't Div., Dep't of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 878 -79 (1990) ; Everson v. Board of Ed. Ewing Tp. , 330 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 27 of 56 App.742 19 During the 115 years since Jacobson was decided, the Supreme Court has developed a substantial and durable body of case law establishing, unequivocally, that a state's infringement of fundamental rights enshrined by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is subject to the most rigorous from of judicial scrutiny: strict scrutiny. See, e.g. , Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) ; New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (\"The word 'security' is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.\"). The Court should not abandon this analysis here, for the first time. The Supreme Court cases citing Jacobson show the Court intends Jacobson 's analysis be incorporated within the Court's traditional tiered scrutiny framework for constitutional rights. Emergency use of the police power is to be considered in the context of the court's broader traditional constitutional tests, as evidence of the government's rational or compelling purpose , see Roberts , No. 20 - 5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *3 , not as a separate standard to be applied in emergency situations. None of the Supreme Court's citations to Jacobson in the last century suggest Jacobson established a separate tier of scrutiny courts shou ld apply in emergencies. The district court abused its discretion by dismissing the Supreme Court's traditional constitutional analysis in favor a Case: 20-55445, 28 of 56 App.743 20 B. The Church Members Are Likely to Prevail Even Under the District Court's F aulty Minimal Scrutiny Standard . Even under the district court's erroneous interpretation of Jacobson , government action is still rendered unconstitutional if it \"has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\" Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 31 ; see also Robinson v. Marshall , No. 2:19CV365 -MHT, 2020 WL 1847128 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 12, 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order to abortion providers) (appeal pending); First Baptist Church , No. 20 -1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, at *3 (applying strict scrutiny to the plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations arising from Kansas' prohibition on public gatherings). For reaso ns discussed in greater detail in Section II below, the Government cannot meet even this standard ; its indefinite and total ban on gatherings undertaken for purposes of communal worship is beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of fundamental rights . See Roberts , No. 20 -5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *4. Allowing the entertainment industry to continue business under CDC guidelines but restricting houses of worship from continuing under the same exact guidelines clearly singles out religion for disfavored treatment. All pretenses of neutrality found in the original Orders have been s hed in the Government's recently released plans for reopening as the State will allow restaurants, shopping malls, and swap meets to open , but will continue to restrict houses of worship from Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 29 of 56 App.744 21 meeting under the exact same standards , or at least threaten to do so . RJN Exs. 1-2, 8, 9. Under California's Reopening Plan, a church that has a coffee shop can serve coffee as long as people refrain from prayer and the barista refrains from distributing Holy Communion . The arbitrary Orders are a plain and palpable invasion of the Church Members' rights and do not satisfy even the district court's newly created Jacobson \"minimal scrutiny\" standard. The district court abused its discretion both in its interpretation of Jacobson as providing a free -standing tier of minimal constitutional scrutiny to be applied in emergency situations , and in its application of that standard to the facts of this case. Thus, this Court should reverse the district court's order denying injunctive relief. II. THE CH URCH MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS. A. The Government's Criminalization of Communal Religious Worship Violates the Church Members' Free Exercise Rights. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits government actors from enforcing any \"law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U. S. Const. amend. I. Fundamental to this protection is the right to gather and worship. See W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943) ; Cantwell , 310 U.S. at 304 . Because of this fundamental protection, \"a law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 30 of 56 App.745 22 application must und ergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 546. The requirements to satisfy this scrutiny are so high that the government action will only survive this sta ndard \"in rare cases,\" and the government bears the burden of proving they further a compelling interest and are pursued through the least restrictive means possible. Id. Similarly, Article I, Section 4 of the California Constitution provides that \"[f]ree exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.\" California Courts largely defer to the federal Free Exercise standard when examining potential constitutional violations. Catholic Charities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Su perior Court , 32 Cal. 4th 527, 562 (2004) (stating the California S upreme Court has thus far not decided whether an independent interpretation of California's Free Exercise clause exists apart from the federal standard articulated in Employment Division v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872 (1990) ). 1. The Orders are not neutral nor generally applicable because they restrict religious ly-motivated activity but not comparable secular activity . \"[I]f a law pursues the government's interest 'only against conduct motivated by religious belief,' but fails to include in its prohibitions substantial, comparable secular conduct that would similarly threaten the government's interest, then the law is not generally applicable. \" Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman , ID: 11701805, DktEntry: App.746 23 accomplish a \"religious gerrymander ,\" singling out religious practices while not restricting similar secular practices, are not generally applicable . See id. at 535 -37. The Free Exercise Clause \" 'forbids subtle departures from neutrality,' and 'covert suppression of particular religious beliefs .'\" Id. at 542. This is because \"an exception -ridden policy takes on the appearance and reality of a system of individualized exe mptions, the antithesis of a neutral and generally applicable policy and just the kind of state action that must run the gauntlet of strict scrutiny.\" Roberts , No. 20 -5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *3. Since t he Free Exercise Clause \"protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment ,\" id, prohibitions are not generally applicable if they \"substantially underinclude non -religiously motivated conduct that might endanger the same governmental interest that the law is designed to protect.\" Wiesman , 794 F.3d at 1079. Similarly, a n overinclusive law that includes more protected conduct than necessary to achieve its goal is not generally applicable . Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 579. The Governments' Orders are neither neutral nor generally applicable. Religious gatherings have been singled out for dis favored treatment. Executive Order N -33-20 (Marc h 19, 2020) ordered Californians to remain home but deemed \"faith -based services\" as essential only if the services can be \"provided through streaming or other technologies.\" ER 295; RJN Ex. 4. Yet Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 32 of 56 App.747 24 workers not restricted exclusively t o telework include d workers in the \"entertainment industries, studi os, and other related establishments\" and \"workers supporting ecommerce ,\" without reference to whether the goods provided are life- preserving . As noted by the United States Justice Departme nt in its May 19, 2020, letter to Governor Newsom raising civil rights concerns about the treatment of houses of worship, this sliding scale of \"essential worker\" that allows Hollywood and Amazon to maintain their activities with appropriate social distanc ing but prohibits churches , synagogues, and mosques from doing the same \"facially discriminates against religious exercise.\" RJN Ex. 6. Even more egregious is the disparate treatment of houses of worship in California's Reopening Plan. Localities moving to Stage 2 of the plan may reopen schools, restaurants, factories, offices, shopping malls, swap meets, and other general business with social distancing, but houses of worship are not permitted to hold religious services until Stage 3 , regardless of what so cial distancing measures they employ , unless special permission is acquired from the State . RJN Exs. 1 -3. A reopening plan that allows people to gather in schools, restaurants, shopping malls and swap meets, but excludes houses of worship from meeting under the exact same standards, is not neutral or generally applicable. The law does not permit a finding that activity undertaken for a secular purpose, can suddenly become criminal if undertaken for a religious purpose. See, Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 33 e.g., Roberts , No. 2 0-5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *3. The Orders criminalize activity when it is undertaken for a religious purpose and single out religious institutions for disfavored trea tment in violation of the Church Members' constitutional rights. The Orders are both underinclusive \u2014by permitting equally risky non - religiously motivated activities \u2014and overinclusive \u2014by restricting religious activities to a degree greater necessary . See Wiesman , 794 F.3d at 1079. The district c ourt's opinion effectively admitted the Orders were underinclusive when it declared there was inherent and unavoidable risk in having gro cery stores, pharmacies, and restaurants with takeout services remain open . ER 6. The Court made a n unpermitted value judgment on the worthiness of religious exercise in deeming the religious exercise in question \"nonessential\" in comparison to the permissible activities. Id. The Government clearly has a legitimate interest in mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Allowing businesses such as grocery stores, movie studios, and fast food restaurants to remain open endangers the governmental interest in flattening the curve of infection. The Constitution does not allow the Government to endanger its stated goal by allowing secular activity to continue while shuttering the doors of religious institutions under the same risk thresho ld. Wiesman , 794 F.3d at WL 1820249, at *7 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 11, 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order against Louisville's prohibition on religious gatherings); First Baptist Church v. Kelly , No. 20 -1102 -JWB, 2020 WL 1910021, at *6 (D. Kan. Apr. 18, 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order against Kansas State's prohibition on religious gatherings) ; Berean Baptist Church v. Cooper , No. 4:20 -CV-81-D, 2020 WL 2514313, at * 7 (E.D. N.C. May 16, 2020) (granting injunc tion). Similarly, the Orders are overinclusive because they restrict more religious activity than necessary to achieve the Government's stated goal s. See RJN Ex s. 7 (CDC guidelines for places of worship), 10 (finding that most states have religious exemptions to COVID -19 social distancing rules) . California's blanket prohibition on religious gatherings means there are lots religious activities prohibited which could be undertaken with appropriate safety measu res. The Government has provided no defense as to why a church could not gather for a religious service with a limited number of participants, or an outdoor baptism where individuals keep safe distances from one another. Because the Orders are neither neutral nor generally applicable, they violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 4 of the California Constitution unless the Government can prove they further a compelling interest pursued through the least restrictive means. The Government has not met that standard. Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 35 of 56 App.750 27 2. The district court impermissibly weighed the reasonableness of the Church Members' religious beliefs in coming to its determination that the Orders did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. Determinations as to the sincerity of religious belief \"[are] not to turn upon a judicial perception of the particular belief or practice in question.\" Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981). \"[R]eligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.\" Id. In applying the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment, \"courts may not inquire into the truth, validity, or reasonableness of a claimant 's religious beliefs. \" See United States v. Ballard , 322 U.S. 78, 87 (1944) . \"[T]he guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect ,\" and courts are not to be \"arbiters of scriptural interpretation.\" Thomas , 450 U.S. at 716. And as discussed above, when the government designs a law to further a particular government interest, the law is not permitted to allow secularly motivated condu ct endangering that interest while restricting religious conduct endangering the same interest. Wiesman , 794 F.3d at 1079. In its order, the district c ourt refused to apply the neut ral social distancing rules available for the operation of grocery stores and movie studios to houses of worship because , the court reasoned, if it applied \"the same rules to in -person religious gatherings as it does to grocery stores, people will get sick and die from Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 36 of 56 App.751 28 attending religious gatherings just as they are dying from working in grocery stores.\" ER 6. The Court then went on to determine that religious gatherings were \"non -essential activities,\" likening them to a concert or a sporting event, that must be suspended so that \"essential functions,\" as defined by the Orders, may be undertaken more safely. Id. In so doing, the district c ourt substit uted its own judgment of the level of risk the Church Members should be willing to take to follow the tenets of their faith for that of the faithful , including the Church Members . For the Church Members , following biblical commands to gather with believer s for communal worship is as essential , if not more so, than grocery shopping, picking up coffee, and going to the local hardware store. ER 217-19, 232-39. While the district c ourt judged fulfillment of their beliefs not worthy of the level of risk the Orders allow for similar secular activities , it is not a prerogative of the court to be the arbiter of what the Church Members' faiths require. This was not the court's judgment to make. If \"[w]orkers supporting the entertainment industries, studios, and othe r related establishments\" or \"supporting ecommerce\" are allowed to gather with some risk to themselves in order to perform the secular tasks they undertake on a daily basis, the fact that the court does not consider the Church Members' religious beliefs of similar import does not mean religious adherents should not have the opportunity to meet under the same standards. As Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 37 of 56 App.752 29 discussed by the Sixth Circuit in its recent decision striking down similarly unconstitutional restrictions on religious freedom, \"[a]ssu ming all of the same precautions are taken, why can someone safely walk down a grocery store aisle but not a pew? And why can someone safely interact with a brave deliverywoman but not with a stoic minister?\" Roberts , No. 20 -5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *4. The Free Exercise Clause is not limited to supporting religious freedom for faith decisions with which a Judge agrees. That the district court Judge does not find in -person religious worship \"essential\" is not the governing principle of the law, and is also contrary to guidelines issued by the federal government . RJN Exs. 6, 7. The Government has a right to enforce neutral laws to stop the flow of a virus. It does not have the right to declare that selected businesses may continue with a lessened risk of transmission but houses of worship may not. The Church Members only ask to be held to the same standards as the other secular activities in the Orders , as recommended by the CDC . 3. The Government does not have a compelling interest pursued through the least restrictive means for its disparate treatment of houses of worship. When a government practice restricts fundamental rights, it is subject to strict scrutiny and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. , Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 56 App.753 30 San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1, 16 -17 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein , 405 U.S. 330 (1972) . The Government does not have a compelling government purpose for continuing to restrict houses of worship from meeting when they are increasingly allowing comparable secular entities to open and meet with social distancing. In their current form, the Orders do not allow any gatherings undertaken for a religious purpose, even those that can take place while maintaining CDC guidelines. RJN Ex. 7. Further, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties have both stated in documents provided to the State that healthcare facilities are well -below surge capacity and the Counties have increased their readiness to respond to the crisis . RJN Ex. 3, p. 114 (\" hospitals within the County o f San Bernardino have additional surge capacity sufficient to handle current projections\"); p. 149 (\"Riverside County has sufficient hospital capacity, including Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators, and adequate PPE to handle standard healthcare needs, current COVID -19 cases, and a potential surge due to COVID -19.\"). The Orders substantial ly burden the free exercise of religion by prohibiting every Californian from attending religious services during this time of crisis . Not all Californians own cars or have access to \"other technology\" needed to engage in communal worship while sheltering at home , and not all religious practices may be observed remotely . Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 39 of 56 App.754 31 Even if the Government did have a compelling purpose for singling out religious worship in t his way, there are less restrictive means to achieve the same end. See, e.g. , Ex. 5, 8. The Government could limit the numbers of family units allowed in church buildings based on square footage , or allow churches to provide religious worship for those who may not have electronic access for remote participation. See, e.g. , Ex. 6. There are numerous other measures the government could pursue that would be less restrictive on the Church Members' Free Exercise rights. Rather than do so, the Government opted to criminalize communal worship altogether. 5 Accordingly, the Orders violate the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. and California constitutions. B. The Government's Orders Violate the Establishment Clause. The \"First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.\" McCreary Cnty., Ky. v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ky. , 545 U.S. 844, 860 (2005) (citing Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) ).6 If a secular group receives more favorable treatment than a religious group because they are secular, such treatment violates 5 While San Bernardino has indicated intends to reopen places of worship, RJN Ex. 9, it also threatens that it may revert to the Governor's Order to shutter such facilities at any time. Id. 6 The Establishment Clause applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Everson , 330 U.S. at 10. Case: 20-55445, DktEntry: 24, Page 40 of 56 App.755 32 the Establishment Clause. Id. Article I, Section 4 of the California Constitution also guarantees the \"[f]ree exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference.\" Cal. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 4 ; Okrand v. City of Los Angeles , 207 Cal. App. 3d 566, 571 (1989) (\" 'California's constitutional provisions are more comprehensive than those of the federal Constitution' \"). \"Notwithstanding the clear di fferences between the state and federal guarantees, California courts have recognized that an analysis of establishment claims under the California Constitution frequently produces the same results as one under the federal constitution.\" Id. (incorporating the federal Establishment Clause's Lemon test into state law analysis) ; see also Vernon v. City of Los Angeles , 27 F.3d 1385, 1396 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussing state and federal standards in religious liberty cases). Under the Lemon test, government action violates the establishment clause unless it (1) has a secular purpose; (2) has a \"principle or primary ef fect\" that \"neither advances nor inhibits religion\" ; and (3) does not foster \"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\" Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 (1971); but see Am. Legion v. Am Humanist Ass'n , 139 S. Ct. 2067 (2019) (writing for the plur ality, Justice Samuel Alito refused to apply the Lemon test, but failed to garner majority support for an alternate test.) Failure to satisfy any of these factors Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 41 of 56 App.756 33 renders the challenged state action unconstitutional. Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U.S. 578, 583 (1987). The Government's Orders violate the Establishment Clause and Article I, Section 4 of the California Constitution by favoring secul ar over religious activity and impermissibly subjecting the faithful the comprehensive, discriminatory, and continuous surveillance so as to excessively entangle itself with religion . See Vernon , 27 F.3d at 1399. The Stage 2 reopening plan sheds all suggestion of the Government's neutrality towards religious observance by reopening secular institutions like schools, restaurants, and shopping malls while singling out religious insti tutions for further restriction s. RJN Ex s. 1-2. Under Stage 2 reopening, a church could meet fo r a garage sale, but not for a funeral . It could host a spaghetti dinner, but not the Lord's supper. Further, if a county successfully obtains a variance from t he State to allow religious worship, the State will require places of worship to comply with a lengthy, detailed set of conditions. RJN Ex. 8. A subset of those conditions is applicable to religious gatherings, only. Compare RJN Ex. 8 (limiting religious services to the lesser of 25% of the facility's capacity or 100 persons, regardless of the size of the facility) with RJN Ex. 3 (establishing Stage 2 variances in San Bernardino County for, inter alia , retail stores to operate at 50% capacity and dine - in restaurants to operate at any capacity provided there is \"safe physical distance\" Case: 20-55445, 42 of 56 App.757 34 between patrons). In order to ensure compliance with these discriminatory conditions, the Government will need to continuously surveil places of worship in a manner wholly inconsistent with the Church Members' fundamental right to religious liberty . Thus, the Government's Order s violate the Establishment Clause and Article I, Section 4 of the California Constitution by favoring the secular over the religious and excessively entangling the government in the affairs of religious institutions. C. The Orders Ban All Public and Private Assembly in Violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and California Constitution. The Court erred in its one -paragraph dismissal of the Church Members' multiple alternate, independent, and free -standing grounds for relief. The First Amendment right to free speech and to peaceably assemble are fundamental right s protected by the U.S. and California Constitutions . U.S. Const. amend. I; Cal. Const. Art. I \u00a7\u00a7 2 -3; Whitney v. California , 274 U.S. 357, 373 (1927) ; People v. Chambers , 22 Cal. App . 2d 687, 706 (1937) (\"laws should not infringe upon our guaranteed freedom of speech and lawful assembly.\") . California courts treat the prior restraint and overbreadth do ctrine similarly to federal courts. See Wilson v. Superior Court , 13 Cal.3d 652, 658 -62 (1975) (relying mostly on federal citations to analyze prior restraint doctrine under California Constitution); In re J.M. , 36 Cal. App. 5th 668, 680 (2019) (citing some federal cases and par alleling Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 43 of 56 App.758 35 overbreadth doctrine analysis under California Constitution with that under the U.S. Constitution) . \"Religious worship and discussion are protected speech under the First Amendment.\" Widmar v. Vincent (\"Widmar \"), 454 U.S. 263, 269, n. 6 (1981). Accordingly, \"[t]he Constitution guarantees Appellants' right to associate for the purpose of engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment.\" Rober ts v. United States Jaycees , 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984). When a government practice restricts fundamental rights, it is subject to \"strict scrutiny\" and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purp ose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. , San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1, 16 -17 (1973) . The Government's Orders constitute a prior restraint on the Church Members' fundamental rights to freedom of speech and assembly and therefore fail to pass constitutional scrutiny. The Orders are also su bstantially overbroad, producing a chilling effect on the Church Members' ability to engage in religious worship safely, pursuant to federal guidelines and recommendations. RJN Ex. 7. As discussed above, the Government cannot overcome strict scrutiny . The CDC's social distancing guidelines are appropriate to limit the spread of COVID -19. Id. Imposing more restrictive requirements that target churches while at the same time allowing restaurants, coffee shops, and marijuana dispensaries 24, Page 44 of 56 App.759 36 is not the least restrictive means of achieving the Government's public safety goals. In this case , law enforcement officers have unfettered discretion in enforcing the law because they are provided no standards as to when to enforce, or exempt religious se rvices from the law. See, e.g. , Houston v. Hill , 482 U.S. 451 (1987) . Counties have already exercised that discretion to provide ad hoc exemptio ns for Christians, only. ER 211. Violators of the Orders are liable for criminal penalties , further raising the stake s. Requiring the Church Members to abstain from religious gatherings , under threat of criminal enforcement , and despite substantial modifications to satisfy the public health interests at stake (modifications that have been deemed acceptable in the cases of operations deemed \"essential\" by government decree , and by the federal government ), violates Church Members' constitut ional right s to free speech and peaceful assembl y. D. The Government's Orders Are Void for Reasons of Vagueness. A regulation is constitutionally void on its face when, as matter of due process, it is so vague that persons \"of common intelligence must necess arily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\" Connally v. General Const. Co. , 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) ; Peop v. 14 Cal.4th 1090, 1115 (1997). Vague \"trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\" of Case: 20-55445, Page 45 of App.760 37 Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 108 -109 (1972). If \"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.\" Id. The problem with a vague regulation is that it \"impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\" Id; see also Sessions v. Dimaya , 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1212 (2018). The Orders at issue in this case are so vague as to their scope and application as to run afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Embedded within Executive Order N-33-20 is a public health directive to shelter in place. The order itself merely directs the public to \"heed\" the public health directive, it does not appe ar to order compliance therewith; Webster's Dictionary defines the word \"heed\" to mean \"to give consideration or attention to\" \u2014not to \"adhere\" or comply. Despite this, state and local officials have widely reported the Governor's o rder to require complianc e with the public health directive by sheltering in place. ER 185. Given this ambiguity, and particularly in light of the fundamental rights at stake, neither the Church Members, nor any other reasonable person , can understand precisely what is being order ed, and what actions may result in criminal penalties, fines, or imprisonment. Statements by local officials ha ve muddled the Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 46 App.761 38 issue further. San Bernardino County , for example, has indicated that it \"does not expect law enforcement to broadly impose citati ons on violators\" and that \"the expectation is that law enforcement will rely upon community members to use good judgment, common sense, and act in the best interest of their own health and the health of their loved ones and the community at large.\" ER 179. As n o reasonable person can make sense of what conduct is permitted under the Orders and what conduct will result in criminal penalties , the Government's Orders are void for vagueness . E. The Orders Violate Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitutio n. All Californians \"are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy. Cal. Const . Art. I, \u00a7 1. Understanding the basic fundamental right of liberty, California courts have held that Public Health Officials' authority is limited. Before exercising their full powers to quarantine, there must be \"reason able grounds [] to support the belief that the person so held is infected.\" Ex parte Martin , 83 Cal. App. 2d 164 (1948). Public Health Officials must be able to show \"probable cause to believe the person so held has an infectious disease . Page 47 of 56 App.762 39 In a case that is somewhat analogous to what Californians are facing with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, California courts found that Public Heal th Officials could not quarantine 12 blocks of San Francisco Chinatown because of nine deaths due to bubonic plague. See Jew Ho v. Williamson , 103 F. 10 (C.C. Cal. 1900) ; Wong Wai v. Williamson , 103 F. 1 (C.C. Cal. 1900). These courts found it \"purely arbitrary, unre asonable, unwarranted, wrongful, and oppressive interference with the personal liberty of complainant\" who had \"never had or contracted said bubonic plague; that he has never been at any time exposed to the danger of contracting it, and has never been in a ny locality where said bubonic plague, or any germs of bacteria thereof, has or have existed.\" Jew Ho , 103 F. at 10. In Jew Ho and Wong Wai , the courts found that there were more than 15,000 people living in the twelve blocks of San Francisco Chinatown who were to be quarantined. The courts found it unreasonable to shut down the ability of over 15,000 people to make a living because of nine deaths. California courts have found that \"a mere suspicion [of a contagious disease], unsupported by facts giving ri se to reasonable or probable cause, will afford no justification at all for depriving persons of their liberty and subjecting them to virtual imprisonment under a purported order of quarantine.\" Ex parte Arta, 52 Cal. App. 380, 383 (1921) (emphasis added). Under prevailing law, the Church Members are presumed to be free of communicable disease unless and Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 48 of 56 App.763 40 until the Government establishes otherwise . Requiring the Church Members to abstain from all religious gatherings, despite substantial modifications to sati sfy the public health interests at stake, violates their California Constitutional liberty rights. F. The Government Violate s the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides that \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Equal protection requires the state to govern impartially \u2014not draw arbitrary distinctions between individuals based solely on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objection. City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr. , 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985). Strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause applies where, as here, the classification impinges on a fundamental right, including the right to practice religion freely, to right to free speech and assembly, and the right to travel, among others. Maynard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of California , 701 F. Supp. 738, 742 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (\"When a law disadvantages a suspect class or impinges upon a 'fundament al right,' the court will examine the law by applying a strict scrutiny standard\"), aff'd sub nom. Maynard v. U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of California , 915 F.2d 1581 (9th Cir. 1990). Under strict scrutiny review, the law can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose, and, even Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 49 of 56 App.764 41 then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. See, e.g. Mem'l Hosp. v. Maricopa Cnty. , 415 U.S. 250, 257 -58 (1974) . Here, the Government intentionally and arbitrarily categorize s individuals and conduct as either \"essential\" or \"non -essential.\" RJN Ex. 4; ER 285 . Those persons classified as \"essential,\" or as participating in essential services, are permitted to go about their business and activities provided certain social distan cing practices are employed. Id. Those classified as \"nonessential,\" or as engaging in non -essential activities, are required to stay in their residence, unless it becomes necessary for them to leave for one of the enumerated \"essential\" activities. Id. For reasons discussed above, the Government has not and cannot satisfy strict scrutiny; its arbitrary classifications are n ot narrowly tailored measures that further a compelling government interest . Indeed, the Government's Orders defy federal guidance , which provides that places of worship are \"essential\" across the country. RJN Ex s. 6, 7. Accordingly, the Government must pe rmit the Church Members to engage in equivalent constitutionally protected activities provided that the Church Members also adhere to the social distancing guidelines established by the CDC . Case: 20-55445, 05/27/2020, ID: 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 50 of 56 App.765 42 III. THE CHURCH MEMBERS FACE IMMINENT IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT IMMEDIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Preliminary injunctions in constitutional cases often turn on likelihood of success on the merits, usually making it unnecessary to dwell on the remaining three factors. Roberts , No. 20 -5465, 2020 WL 2316679, at *5. \"In a case like the one at bar, where the First Amendment is implicated, the Supreme Court has made clear that '[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury' for purposes of the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\" College Republicans at San Francisco State University v. Reed , 523 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007) Sammartano v. Jud. Dist. Ct. , 303 F.3d 959, 9 73-74 (9th Cir. 2002) , in turn citing Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) ); see also S.O.C., Inc. v. Cnty. of Clark , 152 F.3d 1136, 1148 (9th Cir. 1998) . \"Unlike a monetary injury, violations of the First Amendment 'cannot be adequately remedied through damages.'\" Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Harris , 182 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1058 (C.D. F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009) ). Without an injunction preventing the Government from further enforcing the Orders, the Church Members will suffer irreparable harm in the form of deprivations of fundamental freedoms secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. and the California Constitutions. Thus, irreparable injury is demonstrated and interim injunctive relief is proper and necessary . Case: 20-55445, 11701805, DktEntry: 24, Page 51 of 56 App.766 43 IV. THE REMAINING FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF GRANTING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Where the government is the opposing party, balancing of the harm and the public interest merge. See Nken , 556 U.S. at 435. Thus, the Court asks whether any significant \"public consequences\" would result from issuing the preliminary injunction. Winter , 555 U.S. at 24. \"[I]t is alw ays in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\" Melendres v. Arpaio Circuit] ha[s] little difficulty concluding that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in pl aintiffs' favor.\" Hernandez v. Sessions , 872 F.3d 976, 996 Cir. 1983) ). \"The fact that a case raises serious First Amendment questions compels a finding that there exists the potential fo r irreparable injury, or that at the very least the balance of hardships tips sharply in [movant's] favor.\" Sammartano , 303 F.3d at 973. Here, at a minimum, the balance of hardships tips strongly in favor of granting relief because the Orders raise serious constitutional questions concerning the Church Members' fundamental rights. G & V Lounge, Inc. v. Mich. Liquor Control Comm'n , 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (\"it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights\") ; see also Reed , 523 2d Page 52 of 56 App.767 44 Further, protecting religious liberty will result in positive consequences for the public. There is minimal increased risk to the public by allowing the Church Members to practice their faiths in accordance with federal guidelines issued by the CDC. RJN Ex. 7. Indeed, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties have both stated in documents provided to the State that healthcare facilities are well -below surge capacity and have acquired a measure of control over the situ ation . RJN Ex. 3, pp. 114 , 149 (\"Riverside County has sufficient hospital capacity, including Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators, and adequate PPE to handle standard healthcare needs, current COVID -19 cases, and a potential surge due to COVID -19.\"). As such, there is no public interest justification for allowing the continued suspension of the Church Members' fundamental rights , and this Court should reverse the district court's order . CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs -Appellants respectfully request that this Court reverse the district court's order denying injunctive relief and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
