Specific CD8+ T cells were induced but did not correlate with protection, and in one of the studies, CD8+ depletion experiments excluded any CD8-dependence of the protection. Rather, protection correlated with protective myeloid cells and inversely with suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Trained innate immunity of monocytes lasting at least 7 weeks after vaccination was confirmed by demonstrating the ability of monocytes from vaccinated animals to produce more IL-6, TNFa and/or Mip1a when re-exposed to virus than those from control animals. This trained innate response correlated with the number of exposures required to achieve infection. Trained innate immunity has been shown to be mediated by epigenetic changes in monocytes, and indeed, we have been able to detect such epigenetic changes. Thus, vaccine protection against rectal acquisition of SHIV or SIV can be achieved in the absence of anti-Env antibodies and even of CD8+ T cells, and can be mediated by trained innate monocyte immunity. These findings suggest a new mode of vaccine protection that needs to be investigated in future AIDS vaccine clinical trials. "}
