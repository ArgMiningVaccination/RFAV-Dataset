RESEARCH INTERESTS My particular area of interest involves the implementation of evidence -based phy sical activity and chronic disease programs by healthcare patients, in both low and middle -income communities. Within this area of interest, I am currently pursu ing the following lines of research : 1. Implementation of evidence -based interventions Engaging healthcare teams in developing and using referral schemes in healthcare settings that connect their patients to evidence -based programs in the community setting These referral schemes may include only physical activity programs, but can also be expanded to include resources for obesity and chronic disease prevention and treatment Adapting these referral schemes to special populations of individuals (i.e., older, frail adults, cancer survivors, individuals with physical d isabilities) 2. Physical activity in substance use treatment Investigating the efficacy of physical activity in d rug and alcohol abuse treatment Determining the current capacity of treatment centers to offer physical activity programming to their clients Expanding physical activity programming in residential and out -patient treatment centers as a standard part of the treatment paradigm "}
