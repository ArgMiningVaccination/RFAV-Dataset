[Visit Insider's Health Reference library for more advice.](https://www.insider.com/health-reference) Herd immunity is necessary for ending a global health crisis like COVID-19. In fact, some deadly diseases like [smallpox](https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/smallpox-origin.html) have been eradicated worldwide due to herd immunity. Here's what you need to know about the science behind this important public health term and how it can be safely achieved. What is herd immunity? [Herd immunity](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html) is when many people in a community become immune to a contagious disease, which makes it less likely to spread. This helps to protect the entire community, especially newborns and people with compromised immune systems, who are more at risk for dangerous health complications from diseases. To achieve herd immunity, the number of people immune to the disease \u2014 called the [herd immunity threshold](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808) \u2014 must outnumber the amount of people that can still get the disease. Usually, this takes about 50% to 90% of the population, depending on how contagious it is. \"The thinking is that even though not 100% of the population is immune, there aren't enough people left to spread it for the infection to sustain itself, meaning it simply disappears from the population over time,\" says James Wantuck, MD, an internal medicine specialist and chief medical officer of [ PlushCare](https://plushcare.com/doctors/). How to achieve herd immunity There are two main ways to reach herd immunity for any given disease: Vaccination. [Vaccines](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/what-is-a-vaccine) are the safest and most ideal way to achieve herd immunity, and they have successfully controlled diseases like [ polio, smallpox, and measles](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/most-important-vaccines). For example, the number of measles deaths worldwide dropped [79%](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-11-2015-measles-vaccination-has-saved-an-estimated-17-1-million-lives-since-2000) from 2000 to 2014, saving about 17.1 million lives. Vaccines usually contain inactive or weakened parts of the germ that is causing a disease. This allows your body to produce antibodies and develop memory cells that enable you to continue to fight off this germ in the future. \"If enough people are vaccinated against dangerous diseases, those who are susceptible and cannot get vaccinated are protected because the germ will not be able to 'find' those susceptible individuals,\" says [Connie Steed](https://apic.org/about-apic/leadership/connie-steed/), MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. But for this method to work, the vaccine must be taken by a large percentage of people. For example, to eliminate measles, about [95%](https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/2._target_immunity_levels_FUNK.pdf) of people must get vaccinated, which has not been fully achieved. For COVID-19, health experts are estimating that about [70% to 90%](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-up-to-90-population-needs-vaccine-for-herd-immunity-2020-12) of people must get vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Infection. Herd immunity can also be achieved naturally when people develop antibodies after being infected and recovering from a disease. Survivors of the [1918 H1N1 flu pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html), for example, became [ immune to the H1N1 flu](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2008/08/researchers-find-long-lived-immunity-1918-pandemic-virus). \"The antibodies wane as the virus leaves your body, but your immune system remembers,\" Wantuck says. \"If exposed to the virus again, the machinery of your immune system springs into action, mass-producing a defense against the threat.\" But relying on this method is disastrous for public health. Based on the COVID-19 estimates, up to 90% of Americans would have to be infected to achieve herd immunity. This would overwhelm our hospitals and lead to millions of deaths \u2014 and it's why vaccines are a much better option. \"The problem with the idea of encouraging herd immunity by allowing a majority of people to contract the disease and develop immunity is that people would have to suffer the very virus that we are trying to protect them against,\" Wantuck says. Why herd immunity is important Maintaining herd immunity to infectious diseases is essential, even long after a pandemic is over. That's because contagious diseases can [ quickly spread through a community](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/herd-immunity/) if the percentage of vaccinated people drops below the immunity threshold. For example, only about [ 45% of all US adults](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1819estimates.htm) received flu vaccinations during the 2018-2019 flu season, and that's why [34,200 Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) still died from influenza. At least [ 80% of adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22414740/) would have to be vaccinated each year to establish herd immunity against the flu. Because flu viruses [ change over time](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm), yearly vaccinations are necessary, as antibodies from a previous infection or vaccination may only provide partial immunity or protection for a short time period. \"Staying on schedule with vaccinations protects not only your health but also keeps your loved ones and your community safe through herd immunity,\" Steed says. \"Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases still occur when too few individuals in a population are vaccinated.\" Steed says you should check in with your doctor about your immunization status every year during a routine check-up. Insider's takeaway Ending a pandemic like COVID-19 will require herd immunity \u2014 and this can be most safely achieved through vaccination. To maintain herd immunity for contagious diseases, it is extremely important to stay up-to-date on your vaccinations. By doing so, you're not only protecting yourself, but also your family and other people in your community, especially those who are most vulnerable. Until a vaccine for a dangerous disease is available, the best way to protect yourself and others, Wantuck advises, is to take precautions like staying home, avoiding close contact with other people, washing your hands frequently, and wearing a mask.
