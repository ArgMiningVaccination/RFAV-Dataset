In a [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277626/) [type 2 diabetes](/health/type-2-diabetes) took 2 grams of ginger powder per day. A [2022 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031435/) The review looked at results from 10 trials, in which participants took 1,200-3,000 milligrams (mg) per day for 8-13 weeks. The results did not suggest that ginger supplements affected the lipid profile. After 12 weeks: - their fasting blood sugar was 12% lower - their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were 10% - their apolipoprotein ratio lower - were 23% lower A high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio and high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) can result from oxidative stress, a byproduct of oxidative stress. They are both risk factors for [heart disease](/health/heart-disease). However, this was one small study, and more research is needed to confirm these results.
