It focuses on scientific progress, rather than policy developments, in this important field. There now seems little doubt that genomics and its related fields will play an increasing role in medical research and practice in the future. Given the many complexities of disease it is not surprising that progress in some areas of this field has been slow. More rapid progress will be made towards the assessment of this approach to the common diseases of Western society by developing tighter partnerships between clinicians who have the day to day care of patients with these diseases and those who are studying them at the molecular level; lessons from several fields have made it absolutely clear that the phenotype must not be neglected as part of the basic investigations of the role of the genotype and related fields in the evolution of a more personalised approach to medical care.The Report was compiled by the following group: Professor Sir David Weatherall FRS (Chairman) Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford.

In 2005 the Royal Society produced a report entitled Personalised Medicines: Hopes and Realities . The Report was confined largely to the field of pharmacogenetics, that is the application of the better understanding of the human genome to its more logical application for drug development, and, in particular, their safer usage. As well as discussing the technology involved it made a number of recommendations for the broader aspects of the development of this field, including how it might be integrated into our health services and many of the educational and ethical issues that might be involved in the future. Although by 2005 pharmacogenetics had made relatively little impact on clinical practice, there were some new products resulting from its technology on the market, predominantly in the field of cancer, and some examples of the value of genetic testing for the safety of drugs. In short there were already indications of the likely benefit of the application of pharmacogenetics in the future. Over the last nine years there have been some remarkable developments in the technical aspects of genomics that are undoubtedly relevant to the further development of personalised medicine, or stratified medicine as it is also known. Sequencing the human genome was completed in 2001; it took 10 years to complete and cost $3 bn. Since then sequencing has reduced in price over 50% every year and the day of the $1,000 genome is now with us. This has led to major commercial pressure and there are now at least 10 biotechnology companies competing to develop a whole-genome sequencing platform that is commercially robust for both research and clinical purposes. Already, multiplexing technology makes DNA sequencing of a significant number of genes for relatively large numbers of people quite affordable for routine clinical-genetics services. Remarkable advances have also been made in a variety of fields relating to genomics and considerable progress has been made towards an understanding of gene regulation, particularly at the RNA level. These new disciplines include transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics and others. All these new areas of research offer the possibility of producing valuable biomarkers for different aspects of clinical practice. Despite this remarkable technical progress doubts are still being cast about the value of the relationship between genomics and personalised medicine and its likely role in the future. In this brief update of the further development of this field since 2005 we will focus first on particular areas that have been foremost in its clinical application and then try briefly to summarise the outlook for its future development in relation to its application for day-to-day clinical practice. Readers who are not familiar with the basic issues of inherited disease, the mechanisms of gene action, and recent advances in the study of the human genome are referred to the Glossary and several key references which are highlighted at the end of this paper.Recent developments in personalised medicine 3 Cancer In the application of personalised medicine to cancer it is very important to distinguish somatic from germ-line variation. Each cancer is the product of an independent somatic evolutionary process within a human body, in which changes in the expression of key genes, especially due to genetic mutations, are successively selected for their effect on the ability of the cells of the developing cancer to evade their normal growth controls and eventually expand and spread without limit. It is these genetic changes that define the biology of a cancer and which may be specifically targeted by appropriate drugs, and which largely determine the response of a cancer to treatment. These genetic changes are not inherited in the conventional sense of being passed on in the germ line (sperm and eggs) from parent to offspring. Pharmacogenetics, which was the main topic of the 2005 Royal Society Report, is concerned with germ-line inherited genetic differences in the response of an individual to specific drugs. These are properties with which an individual is born and which may also occur in that individual's relatives. Inherited susceptibilities to cancers are similarly the products of inherited germ line differences. There are, thus, three quite different aspects to personalised medicine and cancer:a) The treatment of a cancer as a function of its genetic constitution, b) The influence of an individual's genetic make up on the effectiveness of a particular cancer treatment, and c) The influence of an individual's genetic make up on the chance of them developing a particular type of cancer. The impact of the developments in molecular genetics for cancer personalised medicine since the publication of the 2005 report will be considered separately for each of these three aspects.The treatment of a cancer as a function of its genetic constitutionOver the last 5 years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cancers that have been fully sequenced and a corresponding increase in the number of selectively advantageous mutations identified. This, together with an increase in the amount of information about changes in gene expression in cancers, using both micro-array and cDNA sequencing techniques, has considerably increased the amount of information available on cancer properties that can be associated with response to therapy. At the same time, analysis of data from cancer cell-line studies and from clinical trials has revealed important properties that determine response to current and newly developed therapies. Thus, for example, it is now clear that the direct effects of therapy for colon cancer with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies are not associated with EGFR levels but depend on the absence of mutations in the KRAS and other oncogenes. It is now an essential requirement that only patients with KRAS non-mutant cancers are treated with anti-EGFR therapy, and this will soon be extended to requiring that the BRAF , NRAS and PIK3CA oncogenes are also non-mutant. The techniques of gene knockdown in cell lines were used to show that a specific class of inhibitors, called PARP inhibitors, was active on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and then on a subset of sporadic breast cancers called 'triple negatives'. It is becoming clear that resistance to some of the new targeted small molecular weight compounds directed against tyrosine kinase activity arises through mutations in the target genes in the cancer as well as in genes regulating the intracellular concentrations of the drugs through active influx and efflux, for example in transporters belonging to the multidrug resistance protein (MDR) family. These and other similar discoveries will require that many if not most cancers and even subclones of a single cancer will need to Recent developments in personalised medicine 4 be well characterised at the genomic level in order to optimise their treatment. This will become increasingly important as more drug combinations are used for cancer therapy in order to overcome the inevitable development of resistance to single or dual therapies. Such approaches to treatment, personalised to the cancer, are already being accepted by clinicians and undoubtedly will rapidly become more widely applied. The limiting factor to their application will therefore become the availability of the facilities and resources within the NHS for the necessary characterisation of cancers as a part of routine clinical management. Cancer Pharmacogenetics There has not been the extent of new developments in the area of individual genetic differences in responses to cancer chemotherapy that was predicted in the 2005 Royal Society report. This may, in part, reflect the types of new drugs that have recently been introduced into the clinic for cancer treatment which include the low molecular weight receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, already mentioned, that may not be so susceptible to modification by the P450 cytochrome enzymes as some of the more commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Especially prominent amongst the newer drugs is a range of monoclonal antibodies, starting with the well known herceptin antibody against HER2/NEU in breast cancers and the anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab. While the prevailing view so far has been that these act by directly blocking the activity of the receptors, there is increasing evidence for immune-mediated effects of therapeutic antibodies. The immune effects work by killing cells by antibody-directed cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and similar mechanisms, based simply on antibodies binding to their targets on the cancer cells. The efficiency of this binding is influenced by polymorphic genetic variation in the antibody-binding receptor on the immune cells that mediate ADCC. This is a novel form of pharmacogenetic variation that may be important to take into account when using antibody-based therapies. It also turns out that, for example, for the immune based effect of cetuximab against EGFR in the treatment of colorectal cancer, it is the level of expression of EGFR on the cancer cells that matters rather than being non-mutant for KRAS and the other oncogenes. As newer recombinant DNA techniques are being used to create more sophisticated antibody-based therapies, the requirements for the characterisation of both the patient's germ-line response and the cancers' properties will no doubt change. Though it seems that so far it has been hard to persuade both the clinicians and the pharmaceutical companies of the importance of pharmacogenetic evaluation of cancer patients before treatment, this may well change as it becomes apparent that, with newer combined therapies, such evaluation may lead to substantially improved outcomes. Inherited Cancer Susceptibility The last 7 years has seen a huge increase in the number and scale of genome wide association studies (GWAS) on cancers. Most recently, more than 200,000 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been tested on tens of thousands of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer patients in large internationally coordinated studies. These studies have identified many variants with statistically significant, but very small, effects. Few of the variants are even associated with as much a 10% increase or decrease in relative incidence. It seems doubtful that any, or perhaps at most a very few, of such variants will be useful either for identifying therapeutically relevant functions or, even in combination, for defining at risk subgroups appropriate for some form of increased prophylactic screening type intervention. However, they may lead to the identification of novel \"drugable\" targets. The most interesting development from the application of next generation high throughput DNA sequencing has been the ability to pin down quite rare but clearly inherited susceptibilities to cancers that have been found in only a few, even sometimes just one, families. This parallels, of course, similar studies in many other rare inherited syndromes. A good example of this for cancer is the recent description of clearly inherited susceptibility to colorectal cancer caused by very rare variants in two different DNA polymerase sub-units. Even though such cases are rare, they can provide valuable functional insights to disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic developments. Recent developments in personalised medicine 5 The DNA sequencing advances over the last 5 or so years have already made possible the provision of sequencing services for the more common, though still rare, clearly inherited cancer susceptibilities such as familial ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ). This is now being routinely done in many clinical genetics units. As further rare inherited susceptibilities are discovered, the demand for such services will inevitably increase. The advantage of finding cancer susceptibilities, whatever the mechanism, is that early discovery of a cancer nearly always leads to improved treatment, or sometimes even prevention when, as in the case of colorectal cancer, precursor lesions can be identified and removed by colonoscopy. It is very important that such work on rare cancer susceptibilities, a fair amount of which is done within the NHS, gets adequate support, both at the research and service levels.Recent developments in personalised medicine 6 Common non-communicable diseases Of course the genetic basis for the cause or susceptibility to a few relatively common non-communicable diseases was known before the era of the complete human genome sequence. For example, type I diabetes was clearly related to certain HLA-DR types and several genes had been identified as the cause of the rarer forms of juvenile diabetes; the latter had a dramatic effect on the management of these conditions. Similarly, several types of hypercholesterolaemia had been related to single gene mutations, again leading to their better management. But for the bulk of the common killers of Western society, although there was a hint of a genetic element in some of them, very little was known about their cause. Large numbers of GWAS have now been carried out in populations with common diseases such as cardiac or renal disease, major psychiatric disorders, gastrointestinal disease, and many more. With a few exceptions, where genes have been identified that might increase or decrease susceptibility to these particular diseases, the overall effect has been extremely small. An additional difficulty is that a high proportion of these GWAS associations locate at a distance from clearly defined genes so that it is not always clear which gene is affected by the association, let alone what the mechanism of the effect might be. This is particularly the case where these susceptibility loci have been determined by association with SNPs.Although these studies have produced a number of possible approaches to drug development for particular diseases, the extremely low additive genetic component in these associations seems to be unlikely to be of value for predictive testing at the personalised medicine level. Perhaps this is not surprising since in many of the studies the clinical phenotypes have not been analysed in great detail and it is possible that they have been examining more than one disease entity. Furthermore, many of the common non-communicable diseases have an extremely large environmental factor together with other important issues including lifestyle, diet, stress, not to mention the ill-understood effects of the biology of ageing. Another factor that is complicating this particular aspect of personalised medicine is the remarkable difference in susceptibility to many of these common diseases in different ethnic groups. There is no doubt that there is a global epidemic of type 2 diabetes and related disorders. Although this has increased over recent years it can be traced back to what was described as the New World Syndrome which became apparent after World War II and is characterised by very high prevalence of obesity at an early adult age, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones and gall bladder cancer, particularly in women. Particularly in the case of type 2 diabetes there are some extreme examples of these ethnic differences. For example, the population of Pima has a 19 - fold greater incidence of type 2 diabetes than Caucasian populations in other parts of the Americas. A similar picture has been observed in some of the island populations of Micronesia and Polynesia. For example, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes on Nauru Island reaches 60% of the adult population. Some years ago Neel, Weiss and others Recent developments in personalised medicine 7 suggested that these observations reflected a 'thrifty' genotype which had been selected to take advantage of sporadic food and long periods of privation in primitive societies. There is no doubt that westernisation of many diets in low-income countries has caused a rapid increase in the frequency of diabetes and related diseases. Given the increasingly large immigrant populations from many of these high-frequency regions to the USA and Europe it is likely that the genetic component of susceptibility to these conditions may reflect the action of different genes in their widely varied ethnic groups. While a number of international partnerships have been developed in the field of trans-ethnic disease it may be a long time before their studies provide information that is appropriate to the question of personalised medicine.In short, some progress is being made towards an understanding of the varying genetic components that underlie susceptibility to common diseases in Western society. However, because many of these components have only a small effect on susceptibility, and may well differ between different ethnic groups, it will be a long time before it is clear whether individual genome sequencing will be of genuine value in the control of these diseases. However, there is already promise that this approach may offer the pharmaceutical industry ways of developing new therapeutic agents provided that the functions of such biomarkers that are discovered are studied in detail.Recent developments in personalised medicine 8 Communicable disease There is no doubt that technologies derived from various aspects of genomics have had a major effect on the diagnostic aspects of communicable disease. This includes the early identification of new infective organisms, together with the increasing ease of diagnosis of infections due to known organisms, particularly those that are difficult to grow in culture. And whole-genome sequencing of both vectors and infectious organisms is beginning to disclose vaccine candidates, approaches to vector control, and prospects for new therapeutic agents. There are also hints that a more personalised approach to the control of some common infectious diseases may become possible. Malaria is a good example. Over many years the exploration of candidate genes, and more recently GWAS, have disclosed a wide range of mutations which result in relative resistance to malaria; the classical example is the sickle cell gene but many others have now been identified. Given the level of protection conferred by some of these genetic variants against different aspects of malarial infection it seems likely that in the future they will have to become part of clinical trials for testing potential vaccines or therapeutic agents. And the recent discovery of some of the remarkable epistatic interactions between some of these protective mutations promises to provide more information about the precise mechanism whereby they reduce the severity of different aspects of malarial infection and hence offer new approaches to drug design. A particularly good example of this type of interaction is evidenced by the observation that individuals who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene and those who are heterozygous or homozygous for a mild form of thalassaemia both have strong protection against P. falciparum malaria whereas if they inherit both these mutations the protective effect is completely abolished. Although less is known about protective polymorphisms in relationship to other infectious diseases there are increasing numbers of examples and hence the same principles will apply to them.Recent developments in personalised medicine 9 Single gene (Mendelian) disorders Further developments in genome technology are proving of particular value for the study of single-gene disorders. The vast majority of these conditions are extremely rare although there are a few that occur at a high frequency and are posing major health problems in different countries. There has been major progress towards identifying genes for rare disorders and there are now several large Rare Disease Consortia where DNA from patients in families with single gene defects are being sequenced. Indeed, in almost half of the cases collected by some Consortia, those focusing on disorders associated with cardiac defects for example, the underlying disease mutation has been identified in almost 10% of cases. A good example of the way that such information can be translated into novel therapy is the discovery of the mutations responsible for a rare form of hypercholesterolaemia. A form of this disorder was found to result from mutations in a gene which encodes an enzyme called pro-protein convertase subtilisn kexin type 9 (PCSK9 ). It was found that both normal and mutant forms of PCSK9 promote degradation of hepatic LDL receptors, which are involved in the removal of circulating LDL, suggesting that those that cause hypercholesterolaemia confer a gain of function. Later, loss of function mutations in PCSK9 were found to increase the number of receptors and decrease circulating LDL levels; they are associated with a reduction in LDL concentrations and a reduction in coronary artery disease. These findings suggested that the inhibition of PCSK9 function might be an approach to the prevention of coronary artery disease. Although no small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9 have been identified this objective has been achieved by developing monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 which have been extremely successful in reducing plasma concentrations of LDL. Phase 3 clinical trials showing the effect of these antibodies as add-on therapy on LDL-C lowering have already been published, but there is a need for longer-term trial evaluating their effect on clinical outcomes.Clearly the analysis of rare single gene disorders has important implications for the future of personalised medicine. First, there is increased ability to integrate gene mutation with sophisticated studies of disease pathogenesis in order to design targeted therapeutic strategies; and, second, the definition of these conditions at the molecular level, and at least in some cases, the similarity to some of the common diseases of western society, offer possible approaches both to determining the underlying basis of the latter disorders together with the development of agents for their better management. There are some single gene disorders that occur at relatively high frequencies in different populations. The prime example are the inherited disorders of haemoglobin, notably the sickle cell disorders and the thalassaemias. It is estimated that between 300,000 and 400,000 babies are born each year with these diseases, over 90% of the births occurring in low- or middle-income countries. One of the major features of these conditions is the wide phenotypic diversity associated with the same or similar mutations at the loci which control the synthesis of the or chains of adult haemoglobin. Originally by the candidate gene approach and more recently by GWAS it has been possible to define some of the reasons for the remarkable variation in clinical phenotypes associated with the same genetic defects. In the case of the thalassaemias for example, it has been possible to classify these genetic modifiers into three classes; primary, which describe the action of different mutations of the or globin genes reflected by variation in the resulting reduction in globin chain production; secondary, which involves genetic modifiers which have a direct effect on ameliorating the degree of imbalanced globin chain Recent developments in personalised medicine 10 production, and tertiary, which represent a wide range of genetic modifiers of the many complications of these disorders which are not related directly to haemoglobin production. There has also been considerable progress towards an understanding of why there are differences in the way in which patients are able to adapt to the low haemoglobin levels which occur in these conditions and at least a start has been made at studying the neglected topic of the effect of the environment on these monogenic disorders. At least in some forms of thalassaemia it has been possible to detect the reason for approximately 50% of the heterogeneity of disorders due to the same genetic defect and a start has been made to use these modifiers as an approach to defining better forms of management for individual patients. For example, some of these modifiers result in unusually high levels of fetal haemoglobin which compensate for the defect in adult haemoglobin caused by the thalassaemia mutations; some progress is already being made towards attempting to raise levels of fetal haemoglobin in patients who carry these modifier genes. Similar progress is being made towards a better understanding of the remarkable clinical diversity of sickle cell disease. There is no doubt that much of this progress has followed careful repeated observation of the phenotypes of the different forms of thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. The importance of long term and detailed clinical follow up of patients with these conditions has been accentuated by the finding of relative instability of the phenotype in younger patients. The lessons learnt from this detailed clinical phenotyping are probably applicable to many other studies, including searches for the genetic component of common disease.Remarkable progress has been also made in the development of population screening for carriers of the severe haemoglobin disorders in high-frequency populations followed by prenatal diagnosis and the termination of affected pregnancies. This approach was first carried out by developing methods to study haemoglobin synthesis in fetal blood samples and by 1990 over 14,000 successful prenatal diagnoses had been carried out in different high-frequency countries. Later it became possible to carry out prenatal diagnosis earlier in pregnancy using DNA obtained by chorion-villus sampling and this is now applied widely, not just in the richer countries but in increasing numbers of the developing countries where these diseases occur at such a high frequency.Recent developments in personalised medicine 11 Methods to enhance protein expression Particularly (but not exclusively) in recessive disorders, various ingenious methods are being developed to target the defect in protein synthesis that causes particular single-gene disorders. In many cases this is dependent on knowledge of the specific causative mutation and the intricate details of the cellular process that give rise to the disease phenotype. A good example is provided by new therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is caused by very many different mutations of the DMD gene that lead to loss of function of the protein. However, overall 83% of mutations are potentially amenable to correction by driving the skipping of specific exons and hence restoring the reading frame of the messenger RNA that encodes the protein. For specific mutations, proof-of-principle has been achieved using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) in Phase II clinical trials, but there are still major challenges for efficient delivery to heart and skeletal muscle. Moreover, success with this approach raises challenging regulatory issues because the therapy is highly personalised - requiring the development of multiple AONs, with direct cost and regulatory implications if each individual AON was classed as a novel drug. Similar exon skipping approaches are achieving promising results in other diseases including spinal muscular atrophy and cancer. It should also be noted that this is only one of several strategies to tackle protein deficiency - others include viral gene therapy (replacement of the missing gene using specifically engineered viruses), read-through of premature termination codons, and pharmacological methods to increase the expression of a compensatory protein. It is very unclear at this stage which will be the \"winning\" technology; only considerable investment in all potential therapeutic avenues will enable the multiple, but different challenges of each approach to be identified and, hopefully, overcome.Recent developments in personalised medicine 12 Pharmacogenetics and its relationship to the increasingly broader technology of personalised medicine The report of the Royal Society in 2005 on the future of personalised medicine focused almost entirely on the personalisation of the efficacy and safety of drugs based on genetic studies. Since then this field has rapidly extended beyond this approach to improving the dosing and choice of drugs or other interventions for patient care. For example, molecular imaging modalities are now able to identify metastases which may help to inform clinical decision-making about the level of intensity of particular therapy. There is also increasing emphasis on the value of protein biomarkers. For example, periostin appears to have the potential to be used in the stratification of different asthma phenotypes and, in particular, to assess response to steroids and to agents such as anti-IL13. We have discussed earlier some of the new approaches and usage of biomarkers for the discovery of new therapeutic agents. The field of drug safety has undoubtedly improved quite dramatically since our last report. Apart from the agents already mentioned in the cancer field there have been a number of other areas of advance, particularly in evaluating the major histocompatibility locus ( HLA) for this purpose. For example, it has been found that HLA-A*31:01 is an important pre-disposing locus for carbamazepine hypersensitivity. HLA-B*57:01 is now routinely used to prevent hypersensitivity to abacavir; the need for this particular genetic test is included in the drug label and recommended in all clinical guidelines. This has already led to a fall in the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity from 5 - 7% to less than 1%. HLA-B*1502 genotyping has also been shown to prevent carbamazepine induced side effects in the Chinese population and, again, is also now recommended in the drug label. Indeed, there are now 24 strong HLA associations known to be related to different forms of idiosyncratic drug toxicity. There are many more examples of knowledge of genes which predispose towards drug toxicity. For example, response to interferon-alpha in patients with hepatitis C is dependent on genetic polymorphisms in IFNL3 (IL-28B). This particular relationship has now been confirmed in many different studies and in many different populations. The field of hepatitis C therapeutics has seen major advances in recent years with the introduction of a number of novel compounds; all trials currently being conducted by pharmaceutical companies which use interferon-alpha therapy as a comparator or as part of combined therapy now require IL-28B testing. Although this will become less common as the new interferon-free therapies become more commonly used, it nevertheless provides an excellent example of how genomic investigations can provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of therapies. Another interesting development relates to the relationship between pharmacogenetics and single gene disorders. The relatively common condition cystic fibrosis has been found to result from several different mutations in the CFTR gene. One particular mutation, G551D, which affects only a low proportion of patients, has been found to be responsive to the agent ivacaftor, a small molecule that increases the time that activated CFTR channels remain open. The response to this agent has been found to be significantly greater than from attempts to deal with this condition by the recently developed methods of somatic gene therapy. The FDA has recently Recent developments in personalised medicine 13 expanded the indication for ivacaftor to encompass in this area with drugs such as lumecaftor targeting the most common CF mutation (Phe508del) are expected. Industry The number of therapeutic agents that are now being developed by Pharma in which the development of the drug is accompanied by the development of a diagnostic test has increased over the last few years; reported figures from the large companies range from 60% to 75%. At least 50% of these new drug-diagnostic combinations are for cancer. A recent report from one of the large companies suggests that the attrition rate has fallen from over 50% to less than 13% since the introduction of personalised healthcare approaches. Furthermore, their latest anti-cancer drug was licensed by the FDA based on only about 200 patients in a definitive phase III trial, while approval for vemurafenib was amongst the fastest in regulatory history, taking only four months. This tendency has been reported in several other cases and suggests that the use of this approach will considerably reduce the cost of clinical trials for new therapeutic agents. Recently the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) issued a report entitled The Stratification of Disease for Personalised Medicines . The report concluded that the ability to classify individuals into sub-populations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease or their response to a specific treatment means that interventions can be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not. There certainly appears to be a move away from the block-buster model of drug development to a niche-buster model.Regulation The regulatory agencies have started issuing guidances on the use of pharmacogenetics in drug development. For example, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued guidance on the need for dosing advice based on genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzyme genes. And in the UK the National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) has formed a Diagnostics Panel Committee that will assess diagnostics for stratified medicine approaches. They are considering an Oncotype diagnostic test for women with breast cancer. This is a test that evaluates the expression of 21 genes in a tumour sample and quantifies the likelihood of disease recurrence in women with early-stage estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive-only breast cancer (prognostic significance) and assesses the likely benefits from certain types of chemotherapy (predictive significance). A number of professional clinical bodies are also beginning to take a major interest in the applications of personalised medicine including some of their more practical ethical issues. For example, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) have recently published an important paper regarding the procedures to be followed with incidental findings that are discovered after human genome sequencing. Their advice is to feed this information back to patients and their families. In particular, genetic information on children must also be fed back to families. Some aspects of this guidance remain controversial in a European setting however.Recent developments in personalised medicine 14 Funding This field has been highlighted as an area for further research which has led to some specific funding calls, including the MRC Stratified Medicine Initiative, TSB Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform, NIHR Stratified Medicine Competition and the alliance between AR-UK and TSB. In December 2012, the UK government announced that the genomes of up to 100,000 patients or infections in patients will be sequenced over the next five years. This will improve understanding, leading to better and earlier diagnosis and personalised care. Based on expert scientific advice, the Department of Health (DH) has initially prioritised sequencing of lung and paediatric cancer, rare diseases and infectious diseases. The project will be run by Genomics England, an organisation entirely owned by DH. Genomics England which will manage contracts for specialist UK-based companies, universities and hospitals to supply services on sequencing, data linkage and analysis. It will set standards for obtaining patients' consent and also strictly manage storage of personal data in accordance with existing NHS rules designed to securely protect patient information. It will have the independence and influence to drive innovation across systems and healthcare economies. Up to \u00a3100 million of funding pledged by the government will be made available not only to sequence the 100,000 genomes but also to train a new generation of British genetic scientists to develop life-saving new drugs, treatments and to train the wider healthcare community to use the technology. The aim is to build secure NHS data linkage to ensure that this new technology leads to better care for patients.Broader IssuesMany of the issues that have been considered briefly in this section are covered in more detail in a recent report from the UK Academy of Medical Sciences. Recent developments in personalised medicine 15 Conclusions Overall, there is no doubt that considerable progress has been made in the field of personalised medicine. At least in part this has resulted from the extraordinary developments in the speed and accuracy of genome sequencing combined with equally remarkable progress in the disciplines related to genomics, notably transcriptomics and proteomics. These, and related fields, are producing large numbers of novel biomarkers for the application of research directed at the cause or prevention of disease. Largely because it has been the main practical success story we have focused this update on the cancer field and emphasised the different roles of biomarkers relating either to the prevention or treatment of malignant tumours. As well as some of the successes in other diseases we have also emphasised the value of the new sequencing technology with regard to both rare and common monogenic diseases which, as well as being of extreme value to individual families, are starting to produce lessons for the study of the common killers of western society. There is abundant evidence that the pharmaceutical industry and the medical research community have taken on these new developments and that the field is in a very much more active state than it was ten years ago. Not surprisingly, there have been disappointments and criticisms of the reductionist approach that is being applied to personalised or stratified medicine. Overall, the results of extremely large GWAS involving thousands of patients have, with a few exceptions, not disclosed anything more than multiple, individually minor genetic components to these conditions. These findings have raised questions about the potential clinical value of genome sequencing, however cheap it becomes, for the better control of many of our major non-communicable diseases. Recently published reviews on this topic arrive at widely different conclusions. Some suggest that, within the foreseeable future, sequencing a patient's genome will become a routine part of day to day clinical practice, while others, because they estimate that the risk of developing these common diseases will be little different to that of the general population, suggest that genome sequencing will not be a major determinant for better patient care in the future. But it is early days, and there is still a definite possibility that some of the genetic markers for these conditions, even though they occur at a low frequency, will provide biomarkers in the future for a better understanding of the mechanism of these conditions and hence how they may be attacked with various forms of therapy more effectively. It is not surprising that many of the major disorders of Western society have proved disappointing so far as regards defining a genetic basis for them. A key issue in this respect is the quite remarkable phenotypic variation of what are thought to be the same basic disease. It is inevitable that, by the very size of many of the GWAS it has not been possible to describe in detail the phenotypes of all the patients involved. These vary very much from case to case and many environmental factors are involved together with stress, individual reaction to disease, the social environment of the patient and, in particular, the very limited knowledge of the biology of ageing. Most of the common disorders of the advanced countries occur at an increased frequency as the population ages and we still only have the most limited knowledge of the effect of ageing on key issues like drug metabolism and the effect of age on the efficacy and toxicity of different forms of treatment.Recent developments in personalised medicine 16 There is an even more fundamental reason why patient phenotypes have been neglected to some degree in the early stages of gene hunting by GWAS. In many advanced societies the medical profession has become less concerned with the basic details of clinical history taking and detailed and regular patient examination. The reasons for this are diverse and relate to changes in medical and nursing education together with reorganisations of health services which do not allow doctors to spend enough time with their patients or, and this is of particular importance, to follow up their course sufficiently. For this reason it seems vital that this aspect of medical practice can be analysed in more detail and put right so that it will be possible in the future for a much closer collaboration between clinicians and research workers, with greater input of phenotypic data into studies related to a more personal approach to medical practice. However, the biggest challenge of whole genome sequencing still remains the analysis and interpretation of the data. It is also acknowledged that for many diseases it will be necessary to share data on both phenotype and genotype in order to elucidate novel disease mechanisms. In recognition of this, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), has been formed which is an alliance of 148 of the world's leading biomedical research institutions, healthcare providers, information technology and life science companies, funders of research, and disease and patient advocacy organizations. This is a world-wide effort to responsibly aggregate and analyse large amounts of genomic and clinical information - seeking best practices where they exist, and developing new approaches where needed - in order to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment for cancer, inherited diseases, infectious diseases, and drug responses. The challenges of delivery of genomic information into the clinic remain numerous. In the UK, Genomics England Ltd is a company owned by the Department of Health (DH) which has been established to promote good practice and public engagement in this field. The aim is to generate of 100,000 genome sequences focussing initially on rare disease, cancer and infectious disease.

BRAF has been shown to be mutated in some human cancers BRCA1/BRCA2 Human tumour suppressor genes which encode for proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 respectively. BRCA2 and BRCA1 are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they either help to repair damaged DNA or destroy cells where DNA cannot be repaired. If BRCA1 or BRCA2 are themselves damaged by mutation, damaged DNA (eg in breast cells) cannot be repaired properly and hence the risk for breast cancer is increasedRecent developments in personalised medicine 20Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant which can cause various forms of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe blistering reactions Cell-line studies Experiments with populations of cells (for example, certain types of cancer cells) grown outside of the body ( in vitro ) Cetuximab A monoclonal antibody which binds and inhibits epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and is used in the treatment of bowel cancer The cystic CTFR, a transporter protein/ion channel responsible for regulating salt and water movement between cells.
