interest in the role of local social determinants of health at the local level. Federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and commun ity organizations are in creasingly recognizing the need to understand and address the so cioeconomic contexts within which people work and play in order to improve their health and welfare. There is renewed emphasis on implementing interventions aimed at improving socioenvironmental conditions. Such in terventions have the potential to produce wide-ranging health benefits (see the April 2003 supplement of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine ) and could reduce marked health disparities that remain a high-priori ty concern for public health (USDHHS 2000). It is critical that decisions regarding how to improve health and eliminate health disparities are integrated into the larger picture of community characteristics that promote or enda nger health. A recent theme in the literature and in meetings of interested parties around the country is the need for improved conceptualization and availability of data on how the social environment impacts the health of populations (Pickett and Pearl 2001; Macintyre and Ellaway and Cummins Miringoff and M.L. Miringoff 1999; Howell et al. 2003). This Data Set Directory of Social Determ inants of Health at the Local Level is a response to those needs. The directory contains an extensive list of existing data sets that can be used to address these determinants. The data sets are organized according to 12 dimensions, or broad categories, of the social environment. Each dimension is su bdivided into various components. This directory grew out of a project based at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Investigators from the United States and Europe were invited to a workshop to review an initi al list of dimens ions important for understanding social determinants of h ealth. Participants represented a wide range of disciplines including epid emiology, sociology, geography, medicine, demography, economics, developmental psychology, education, and toxicology. Others with interests and e xpertise in the eff ects of community contextual characteristic s on health were also in vited, including government experts on data sources and geographic information systems, public health practitioners, and experts on commun ity consultation and processes. Continued on next page 1 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Structured discussions among the works hop participants led to consensus on a core set of 12 dimensions. Participants then generated detailed lists of components within each dimension, along with suggestions for possible data sources and specific variables that might be used to measure the components of each dimension. Based on the results of the workshop, the lists of components and data indicators were re fined by the University of Michigan staff, taking into consideration both con ceptual relevance and availability of appropriate data at the local level. An extensive search for data sets that address each of the dimensions a nd components was conducted-including both traditional and non-traditional sources . The results of this search are presented in this directory . We focused primarily, but not exclus ively, on data sets that contain information for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). We chose to focus on MSAs primarily because there is a broad range of data for MSAs that is routinely collected and geocoded. We r ecognize, however, that there is no single ideal level for measuring social de terminants of health in relationship to health-damaging and health-promoting factors. In fact, different characteristics may operate at different levels. An argument can be made that using more localized units, such as c ounty, zip code, census tract, and census block, increases the likelihood of measuri ng certain aspects of the social and physical environment actually experienced by individuals. Conversely, considerably more richly detailed cont extual data sources are available for larger units such as states. Given th e inevitable trade-offs between data availability and proximity to lived e xperience, we chose to focus on MSAs. 2 Dimensions of the Social Environment This table lists the 12 dimensions of the social environment. Each section begins with a brief overvie w of the literature for each dimension. These reviews are not exhaustive, but rather provide some of the background that led to them being in cluded in this directory. Each dimension is divided into severa l components. Each component has one or more indicators, and for each indicator at least one data set is listed.

Signifi cant associations have been shown between health status and community economic characteristics including income (Anderson et al. 1997; Diez R oux et al. 1997) and inequality in income distribution (Lynch et al. 199 8; Kennedy et al. 1998), wealth (Diez Roux et al. 1997; O'Campo et al. 1997), poverty (Yen and Kaplan 1999; Shaw et al. 2000), and the geographic concentration of poverty (Waitzman and Smith 1998a,b). The fact that data for most of these economic indicators are readily available for small areas in census data is undoubt edly an important factor accounting for their widespread use (Mitchell et al. 2000). Our consultants encouraged a broadened perspective to more fu lly assess the economic status of communities. On one hand, this involved identifying a more diversified set of indicators for commonly studied compone nts, such as considering various types of income (earnings, investment s, and transfers) in addition to the overall mean or median income in an area. On the other hand, a number of additional components of economic we ll-being were also suggested for inclusion. For example, the opportunities for community residents to obtain financial resources would be influe nced by characteristics of economic development in an area, including productivity, industrial mix, and amount of area business lending, as we ll as by the exchanges of goods and services through the informal economy. The availabi lity of financial services such as banks and other sources of credit were considered important, as were local costs of living, patte rns of redistributi on through taxes and transfers, and the fiscal capacity of the area. One othe r seldom-considered aspect of the economic milieu concerns the degree to which segments of the community are differentially exploited, and ther eby constrained in their access to monetary resources. Indicators of exploitation include the ratio of wages to corporate profits, as well as issues related to location of jobs such as length of commute and commuter taxation. 4 Economy Data Sets This table presents the components and indicators of the economic dimension. Nine economic components are identified: 1. Income 2. Wealth 3. Poverty 4. Economic Development 5. Financial Services 6. Cost of Living 7. Redistribution 8. Fiscal Capacity 9.

Adverse outcomes have generally been found to be positively associated with higher community levels of unemployment (Guest and Almgren and Hussey 1998; LeClere and Rogers and Peters 1998), as well as with larger proportions of employed residents working at lower so cial class occupations (Armstrong et al. 1998; Cubbin and LeClere and Smith 2000). Unemployment rates and/or occupational status measures are also frequently combined with other indicators of areal depr ivation, including median income, car ownership, education level, and overcrowded housing, to form summary measures that are associated with poorer health (e .g., Townsend and Phillimore and Beattie 1988; Carstairs and Morris 1989). In addition to the usual employment indicators, we include a number of other measures. Looking in detail at characteristics of the workforce, for example, along with the area business capacity a nd the geography of job growth would facilitate assessment of job access, as well as the degree of spatial \"mismatch,\" which may adversely a ffect the employment opportunities of central city residents (Holzer 1991; Mouw 2000). Racial, gender-based, and anti-gay discrimination also limit access to employment and can cause stress-related consequences for h ealth (Williams 1999; Krieger and Sidney 1997; Yen et al. 1999). The degree to wh ich occupational safety regulations and policies are in place and enforced is likely to influence the frequency and severity of work-related injuries (McQuiston and Zakocs and Loomis 1998), while aspects of job quality, including wage equity, family-friendly policies, and demand/control characteristics of jobs, can reduce or exacerbate job-related stress and its sequelae (Cheng et al. 2000; de Jonge et al. 2000; A. L. Saltzstein and Ting and G.H. Saltzstei n 2001). The presence of labor unions is also associated with more opt imal working conditions and employee compensation (Hirsch and Macpherson 2001). 11 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Employment Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the employment dimension. Seven employment components are identified: 1. Employment/Unemployment Rates 2. Workforce Characteristics 3. Area Business Capacity 4. Job Access 5. Occupational Safety 6. Job Quality 7.

High school noncompletion rate a nd median educational level have also been used in combination with other areal economic and employment measures to form aggregate socioecono mic scores that are correlated with adverse health outcomes (Diez Roux et al. 2001; Roberts 1997). In these studies the contextual educati onal variable tends to be treated as a marker for a more generalized concep t of community socioeconomic status and resources, rather than being consid ered in its own right. Our consultants suggested that a focused assessment of as pects of education that are likely to vary among communities is warranted. Mu ltiple measures of the population's educational attainment and functioni ng are included in the recommended indicators. Moreover, the levels of f unding, characteristics of school systems and curricula, and learning-related aspects of community life such as prevalence of television viewing and nu mbers of library books per capita, can provide insights into the priority placed on educati on and corresponding investment within an area, which itself may be related to health outcome. Specific aspects of the curriculum also have implications for the health of children at school ages a nd throughout their lives. For instance, bullying and violence is a serious problem among ch ildren and adolescents (Nansel et al. 2001), and the presence of violence prev ention programs has been found to be effective in decreasing phys ically aggressive behavi or (Twemlow et al. 2001; Grossman et al. 1997). Similarly, obesity in children is approaching epidemic proportions and is related to adult obesity; levels of lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and blood pressure; and risk of coronary heart disease (Styne 2001). Incorporation of nutri tion modification programs and optimal physical education curricula in schools can be effective in modifying these risks (Stone et al. 1998; Snyder et al. 1999). 17 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Education Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the education dimension.

Davey Sm ith and Dorling (1996), for example, showed that in England and Wales, mort ality rates in electoral constituencies were negatively correlated with Cons ervative voting patterns and positively correlated with Labour voting. Area deprivation was also negatively associated with Conservative voting bu t positively associated with Labour voting. The authors concluded that in ar eas with better material circumstances and more optimal health, voters were mo re likely to support leadership that favors reducing public assistance programs . In the United States, Blakely and colleagues (2001) studied disparit ies among states in voting across socioeconomic status groups. Individuals living in states with the highest voting inequality were shown to have increased odds of fair or poor self-rated health relative to those in other stat es. They reasoned that disproportionate political participation by the more ec onomically well-off skews subsequent policy-making towards their interests, a conclusion supported in the political science literature (H ill and Leighley 1992). More broadly, political participation has b een of recent interest as an indicator of embeddedness in the instit utions of civil society. As such, it is considered to be a reflection of social capital within a community (Kawachi 1999). Social capital, measured in several di fferent ways, has been associated with positive health outcomes (Subramanian and Kawachi and Kennedy 2001; Kawachi and Kennedy and Glass 1999a ; Kawachi et al. 1997) (see the Psychosocial Dimension, page 51, for furt her discussion of the social capital concept). Within the political contextual dimension, we include aspects of political participation such as voting and polit ical party membership, as well as donations to parties and candidates, which are known to influence public policy (Ferguson 1995). Likewise the degree to which elected officials are representative of their areas in terms of gender and race/ethnicity may be an important factor in their responsivene ss to constituents' needs (Whitby 1997; Bratton and Haynie 1999). The percent of the local budget devoted to public health investments can be considered an indication of the priority placed on health by the community as well as a m easure of available fiscal resources. We also include the number and infl uence of various politically active community groups. 23 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Political Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the political dimension.

Passchier-Vermeer and W.F. Passchier 2000; Schell 1991). These exposures are known to vary by area and to be disproportionately concentrated amo ng disadvantaged populations (American Lung Association 2001; Brown 1995). In addition, this contextual dimension encompasses structural features of communities such as physical design of streets, sidewalks, and safety structures that are associat ed with level of injury risk (Navin and Zein and Felipe 2000; Agran et al. 1996). Aspects of land usage are also considered, such as public spaces and parks that may facilitate greate r physical activity levels (French and Story and Jeffery 2001), as are services related to environmental quality like waste di sposal and recycling programs. 27 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Environmental Data Sets This table describes the components a nd indicators of the environmental dimension.

Most concretely, physica l characteristics of housing have been linked to adverse outcomes. For example, the presence of dampness and mold leads to increased risk of respirator y and other illnesses (Platt et al. 1989; Packer and Stewart-Brown and Fo wle 1994). Dilapidated and abandoned housing in the local area increases th e risk of accidental injury among residents (Gielen et al. 1995), is associated with increased emotional stress (Ellaway and Macintyre 2000), and may provide situational opportunities for high-risk behaviors (Cohen et al. 2000). Population density and overcrowding have also been associated with increa sed chances of contracting infections and sustaining injury (Agran et al. 1996; Acevedo-Garcia 2000). Home ownership has been associated with reduced morbidity and mortality risk (Filakti and Fox 1995; O'Campo et al. 1997). In most cases this housing variable is regarded as a marker for general material well-being. It has been suggested, however, that long-term expos ure to specific health promoting or damaging characteristics of housing itself is likely to account for some of the observed health effects (Macintyre et al. 1998; Ellaway and Macintyre 1998). There is also some evidence that poor housing conditions during childhood can adversely affect health in later lif e. For example, Barker and colleagues (1990) found an association between domestic crowding during childhood and later stomach cancer mortality rate s, suggesting that overcrowding may promote the transmission of causativ e organisms among children that exert negative health effects la ter in life. Similarly, Dedman et al. (2001) noted aspects of poorer childhood housing conditions were associated with increased mortality risk from common diseases in adulthood. Our consultants suggested that we incl ude these characteristics of housing in our framework, as well as other aspect s of residential patterns within communities. Homelessness, for example, has known associations with differentially poorer health (Barrow et al. 1999; Hwang 200 1). Segregation by race has been associated with adve rse health outcomes among blacks (Williams and Collins 2001; Jackson et al. 2000), as well as among whites in some cases (Collins and Williams 1999) . Similarly, concentration of poverty has been found to be associated with elevated mortality risk (Waitzman and Smith 1998a). Continued on next page 31 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level We also include two other components within the housing dimension. Regulations such as zoning and industria l/residential segregation can affect the degree to which residential areas are exposed to industrial pollution and other health threats such as increased traffic. Financial issues specific to housing, such as housing costs, the ava ilability and characteristics of low- income housing, mortgage lending practices, and community reinvestment initiatives are also considered. 32 Housing Data Sets This table describes the components a nd indicators of the housing dimension. Four housing component s are identified: 1. Housing Stock 2. Residential Patterns 3. Regulation 4.

The medical cont extual dimension encompasses a range of health care se rvices, including primary care, specialty care, emergency services, home health care, emergency services, mental health services, long-term care, oral he alth care, and alternative care. We also look specifically at aspects of access to health care services, which is related to health status and know n to vary among population groups (USDHHS 2000). Some of th e factors included, such as insurance coverage and the availability of indigent care, are well-known determinants of access (Baker and Shapiro and Schur 2000; Ne wacheck et al. 1998; Nelson et al. 1999). The racial/ethnic make up of medical staff in relation to the patient population and the cultural competence of providers and institutions may also be important in encouragi ng utilization of health care resources that are present in an area (Flores et al. 1998; Langer 1999). In addition to traditional measures of access, we also include rates of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are cond itions considered to be manageable on an outpatient basis, given access to high-quality primary care, and therefore higher hospitaliza tion rates can be used as an indicator of poorer access to appropriate care (Institute of Medicine 1993). 37 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Medical Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the medical dimension. Eight medical components are identified: 1. Primary Care 2. Specialty Care 3. Emergency Services 4. Home Health Care Services 5. Mental Health Care 6. Long-Term Care 7. Oral Health Care 8.

Levels of funding ar e assessed, as well as the relative contributions from various revenue sour ces. Policies and legislation that have potential health effects, such as obst acles to unionization and living wage or minimum wage ordinances and employer requirements for provision of health benefits, are included. The nature and quality of local governmental services are also considered. Another aspect of local governance with potential he alth relevance concerns the degree to which there is municipal fragmentation. This term refers to a situation in which large nu mbers of smaller government al entities exist within a metropolitan area. It has been argued that in cases where there are high levels of municipal fragmentation and no single government empowered to act for the good of the entire region, a host of problems result, including resource and public service imbalances within the area and the protection of privilege (Mitchell-Weave r and Miller and Deal 2000; Ross and Levine 1996). 41 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Governmental Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the governmental dimension. Four governmental components are identified. 1. Funding 2. Policy/Legislation 3. Services 4.

We focus on three primary areas of interest. First, th ere are a variety of programs aimed at prevention, early detection, and optimal management of a range of health problems. Local public health depart ments may provide these services directly or oversee their implem entation by other organizations, both governmental and private sector. The ne xt category concerns development, regulation, and enforcement of standard s, which has become a salient issue because provision of traditional public he alth services is increasingly being privatized (Beauchamp 1997). Thirdl y, funding issues including budget allocations and financial arrangements fo r service provision are of interest in gauging the priority given to public health issues in the community. 45 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Public Health Data Sets This table describes the components a nd indicators of the public health dimension.

Research in the 1970s on social support suggested a health- enhancing role for social relationships in buffering the ill effects of stress (Cassel 1976), and subsequent studies confirmed an inverse relationship between social relationships and mo rtality risk (House and Robbins and Metzner 1982; Schoenbach et al. 1986). More recently, aspects of social interactions and relationships have been increasingly conceptualized as forms of social capital, although there is widespread disagreement about the m eaning of the term and the level of aggregation at which it operates (Lyn ch et al. 2000b; Woolcock 2001). Portes (1998) defines social capital as \"the ab ility of actors to secure benefits by virtue of membership in social networks or other social structures.\" Coleman (1988) sees social capital as a re source for organizations as well as individuals: \"Social capital is defined by its function. It is not a single entity but a variety of different entities, with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social struct ures, and they facilitate certain actions of actors\u2014whether persons or corporat e actors\u2014within the structure. Like other forms of capital, social capit al is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be possible.\" Putnam et al. (1993) considers social cap ital broadly as \"features of social organization, such as trust, norms, and networks that can improve the efficiency of society by faci litating coordinated actions.\" Social capital has been operationalized in different ways in health-related empirical research. Per capita membersh ip in groups and associations has been used to assess civic engagement (Kawachi et al. 1997; Kawachi and Kennedy and Glass 1999a), as has polit ical participation (Blakely and Kennedy and Kawachi 2001). Several studies have considered greater mistrust to be indicative of lower levels of social capital (Kawachi et al. 1997; Kawachi and Kennedy and Glass 1999a; Subramanian and Kawachi and Kennedy 2001). Mistrust is generally define d as the percent of persons in an area who agree with the second part of the following question: \"Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?\" Continued on next page 49 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level A related indicator is perceived lack of fairness, indexed by the percent of persons who agree that \"most people w ould try to take advantage of you if they got the chance\" (Kawachi et al. 1997) . Perceived helpfulness/reciprocity has also been used as a gauge of so cial capital, based on answers to the question, \"Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful, or are they mostly looking out for themselves?\" (Kawachi et al. 1997). It has also been hypothesized that crime level is an indicator of collective well-being that is influenced by the degree of cohesiveness in social relations or social capital (Sampson and Raudenbush and Earls 1997; Kawachi and Kennedy and Wilkinson 1999b). Within the psychosocial dimension, we include theorized aspects of social capital such as civic engagement via political participation, membership in voluntary organizations a nd unions, and charitable giving. Crime as a marker for social cohesion is assessed throug h expenditures on jails and incarceration rates. Collection of information on laws uits and the presence and utilization of protective services was also suggested as an indicator of the level of trust in communities. 50 Psychosocial Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the psychosocial dimension. Seven psychosocial components are identified: 1. Political 2. Volunteer Organizations 3. Union Participation 4. Charitable Giving 5. Jails 6. Lawsuits 7.

Downloadable data in SAS and ASCII formats. 52 Behavioral Overview As mentioned earlier, there has been increasing recognition that aspects of social, physical, and cultural context can affect health status in a community by facilitating or inhibiting behaviors that impact well-being (Macintyre and Ellaway and Cummins 2002). We focus on behavior ar eas that are among the nation's leading health indicators and that have been repeatedly cited as major determinants of premature morbidity and mortality\u2014tobacco use, physical activity, diet/obesity, alc ohol and illicit drug use, and violence (USDHHS 2000; McGinnis and Foege 1998; Wilson 1994). For each of these behaviors, we examine specific characte ristics of communities that might influence the degr ee to which they will be adopted by residents. In the case of tobacco use, these characterist ics include current smoking rates, the presence of cessati on and preventive e ducation programs, workplace smoking restrictions, the cost and accessibility of cigarettes, and targeted advertising. In the area of physical activity, we include reported activity levels, physical e ducation requirements in schools, participation in local sports and recreational activities, as well as availa bility of exercise facilities in the workplace and in the area more generally. We also consider indicators of sedentary activities such as television viewi ng patterns and video game sales and use. Regarding diet and obesity, we look at consumption patterns of healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables as we ll as high-fat and high-sugar foods. The quality, availabilit y, and cost of a range of different foods is of interest, as is the availa bility of generally less nutritious \"fast food\" as indexed by the number of such establishments in the area. We also include aspects of nutrition in the schools, including the prevalence of subcontracting to vendors of non-nutri tious items and the presence of nutrition education programs. In the area of alcohol and illi cit drug use, we consider availability as indicated by the number of li quor stores, as well as marketing laws and the nature of public advertising. We also include drug and alcohol treatment service availability and the presence of syringe laws and exchange programs. Violence in the comm unity is indicated by factors such as the availability of guns and the leve l of exposure to violence perceived by residents. 53 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Behavioral Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the behavioral dimension. Five behavioral components are identified: 1. Tobacco Use 2. Physical Activity 3. Diet/Obesity 4. Alcohol and Illicit Drug Use 5.

See Psychosocial Dimension, Protective Services, page 54. 56 Transport Overview The transportation system in place in communities has multiple implications for the health of residents. Most direc tly, motor vehicles are the leading cause of injury in the United States and are responsible for about one-third of all injury deaths (Fingerhut and Warner 1997). The nature of the transportation modes and the volume of use also in fluence the types and magnitude of pollution introduced into the environment (Sharpe 1999). A third consideration is the degree to whic h employment patterns and therefore economic well-being are determined by the accessibility of jobs through adequate and affordable tr ansportation systems (Pugh 1998). In our framework we include measures within each of these health-related aspects of transportation. Vehicle occupant and pedestrian safety factors are included, as well as characteristics of the infrastructure of roads, sidewalks, and bike lanes. We examine character istics and numbers of vehicles and aspects of the public tr ansportation system. Finally, we include economic issues such as government transporta tion spending priorities, funding for public transportation, and pe rsonal insurance rates. 57 Social Determinants of Health at the Local Level Transport Data Sets This table describes the components and indicators of the transport dimension. Six transport components are identified: 1. Safety 2. Infrastructure 3. Traffic Patterns 4. Vehicles 5. Public Transportation 6.
