My seizures are easily controlled with medication, but the medicines always leave me feeling run down, sleepy and lazy. It was one of the best things I've ever done. She was so helpful. She did of course encourage me to stay on my medication, but recommended dietary changes that would be good for my brain and also give me more energy. Her biggest concern with my diet was lack of essential fatty acids and too many carbs. Carbs cause fluctuation in blood sugar glucose, which can increase seizure activity and cause brain stress. She recommended a diet full of protien, dairy, fresh fruits and vegetables, limit carbs and avoid sugar. She recommended a teaspoon of MCT Oil per day (which is a medium chain triglyceride - easiest essential fatty acid for your brain to use). She also discussed the importance of hydration with me. She mentioned one of her patients once could not gain seizure control at all. Even a ketogenic diet didn't eliminate the seizures. She recommended the woman stop wearing makeup to see what would happen. That's what was causing her seizures. She was simply allergic to something in her products all along. I feel fantastic and have even started running again. Yes, I recommend a naturopath. Make sure they're licensed. Yes, I went to see a licensed naturopath about 2 months ago.

There is a naturopath right here in my town not far from me and I may just think about stopping in. I have a question though, how much do these doctors cost (since they are not covered by insurance)?

I just did a little research and it looks like MCT oil isn't safe if your child is allergic to coconuts, coconut oil, medium chain triglycerides or any other ingredient used in the supplement. It seems to be used as part of the ketogenic diet used for some children with epilepsy. But before putting your child on this supplement, please talk to your doctor. Jessica Hi Addibaby!

I was given numerous tinctures to take and the typical nutritional advice my doctor gives me (low carbs, no alcohol or coffee, more sleep) and after 3 months of trying it with no success, I called it quits. I found it was expensive and time-consuming, however it sounds like other people have success with these doctors--I hope you do too.

Teresa Re: Naturopathic Doctors Submitted by pdqbach69 on Fri, 2011-05-27 - 13:01 Hi there, I am open to using certain forms of complementary medicine such as naturopathy and accupuncture for general health concerns but I suspect that the advice of a naturopath wouldn't help much (if at all) in controlling your seizures. I saw an accupuncturist for several years who trained at a very well regarded accupuncture school in San Francisco and didn't see any reduction or increases in my seizure activity (they don't happen very often to me anyway). He was also a medical doctor. A lot of the \"epilepsy cure\" stories are based on anecdotal stories and not well designed medical studies. Perhaps one day there will be a study on the effectiveness of using accupuncture or naturopathy for seizure control but I seriously doubt it. I will say that I did feel better overall after accupuncture treatment and that advice from a naturopath could be helpful for general health. Accupuncture visits are covered by certain health insurance plans but I'm not sure if any of them cover visits to a naturopath. From what I've heard an initial consultation with a naturopath could cost between $200 to $300. Good luck!

Re: Naturopathic Doctors Submitted by godcares on Fri, 2011-06-10 - 19:38 The cream absorbs into your skin and gets into your system better than taking a pill.(just from what I have read) I have myoclonic jerks in my leg which I am medicated for and it still doesn't completely help but it is nothing like having a full blown seizure. I can handle that. It is a little embarrassing though. At my last chiropractor visit he suggested another doctors name that does specialize in chiropractor neurology, because this is the first time he had seen my spasms in my leg. I go to him next week and let's see how it goes. I just keep digging for an answer. If you notice my login id. God is in control of the situation, no matter what it is. I'll be seizure free one of these days and what a day that will be.
