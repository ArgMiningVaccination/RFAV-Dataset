Those who are more immune face mild symptoms, whereas those with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory issues, have weakened immunity. It makes them more prone to such easy-to-spread diseases. [ Best Homeopathic doctor in Delhi ](https://www.hariomhomeo.com/delhi/homeopathy-clinics-in-greater-kailash/) , such as Dr. Nitish Dubey, emphasize that the homeopathic medication system is the solution for the new-age need of boosting immunity. It becomes more necessary as outbreaks of such diseases will be more frequent in the future. The Link Between Homeopathy And Immunity As we all know, living beings acquire immunity through various means. We get our natural immunity through inheritance, a healthy diet, good habits, and mild/ non-deadly infections. Artificially, we acquire immunity with vaccines and several medications. However, these are limited means, and there is more scope to improve our natural immunity. Homeopathy is a medical system based on Like treats Like. Invented in Germany 200 years ago, it believes in the principle that a body can heal itself with the material that got it infected in the first place. In this system, a patient is given tiny doses of medicines for a very long time to cure a disease. Hence, both the patient and the doctor have to wait for the results. Allopathy Vs. Homeopathy Unlike the allopathy/ modern medicine system, homeopathy medicines have little to no side effects, due to their tiny doses. All allopathy medicines have the aim to cure current diseases. If the patient doesn't complete the whole course of allopathic medicines, they may not find it effective, as the pathogen has developed a defense mechanism against the medicine. Homeopathic medicines don't work on this principle. The end goal is to completely get rid of the disease and leave no chance for its reappearance by making the body immune to such illness. Hence, you stay safe from the disease for a long time. Homeopathic Treatment For Holistic Development If we keep the aspect of an illness aside, we will find out that homeopathy still plays a phenomenal role in boosting immunity. It is highly suitable for the general strengthening of someone's health, in particular, empowering the natural defenses to protect the body all the time. Hence, people can consult a homeopathic specialist, if they have a long-term immunity-strengthening goal in mind, and get treatment as soon as possible. Integrating Homeopathic Therapy With Aggressive Treatments It is a medicine system that can go parallel with other treatments. For example, currently, oncologists are using homeopathic medicines for their cancer patients. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy drain a patient out of immunity, and homeopathic medication can help deal with such situations. Hence, there is a scope to integrate this system with other treatments to improve immunity, encourage a speedy recovery, and reduce the virulence of symptoms. Conclusion Homeopathy is a new-age science that encourages the natural enhancement of immunity. It is compatible with aggressive treatments, can compete with allopathy, and provides scope for holistic development. Combined with good habits, and a balanced diet, it can provide astonishing results for a patient. It is also a solution to the current antibodies resistance problem, that pathogens have developed over time due to allopathic medication systems. By consulting a homeopath, individuals and those more prone to immunity-related diseases can get a long-lasting treatment. "}
