[Hudson, 978-568-9700, www.ygrr.org.] Trainers With pets, as in business and dating, manners are everything. A good trainer can make a gentleman out of a mutt, a lady of a tramp, and a beloved companion of a wild beast. These trainers come highly recommended, and with years of experience. American Dog Training Centers Owner Jeff Maranhas has a secret strategy for obedience training: a program that stresses trust and patience rather than treats and choke chains. And while he won't divulge the exact proportions of conventional wisdom and homegrown know-how that go into his lessons, his (human) clients will say this much: They work. [402 Bridge St., North Weymouth, 781-331-5331.] Canine College Pedigrees aside, nothing smacks of canine sophistication quite like a degree from Canine College. An indoor training center and 55 acres of woods provide the staff with ample space to refine rambunctious dogs. Eager alumni often continue their education and rank in national competitions. [One White Rock Spring Rd., Holbrook, 781-767-3908, www.caninecollege.net.] Canine University In a city full of stodgy academics, it's nice to find instructors who still know how to cut loose.

This conditioning technique results in obedient dogs that don't beg for Milk-Bones every time they're told to sit. Specialized classes are the focus here, with options from puppy socialization to the \"Rowdy Rovers\" course for dogs that need to bone up on leash etiquette before they hit Boston Common. [53B Ayer Rd. (Route 2A), Littleton, 978-486-9922, www.geminidogs.com.] Happy-Dog Training Individual behavioral problems call for individual solutions.

The Abington-based staff holds training sessions at various Boston-area locations; call for times and details. [398 Ashland St., 617-789-3647 or 781-878-4343, www.happydogtraining.com.] Jacot unlimited Behaviorist Susan Farlow's business is for the birds. Disgruntled humans and their ruffled-feathered friends flock to her unique classes (\"Bird Care 101,\" \"Avian Reform School\") to learn how to become better roommates. Farlow's authority on behavioral issues such as biting, screaming, and feather abuse is unrivaled. Home visits are an integral part of this guru's diagnosis, but phone consultations are also available. [Gloucester, 978-282-3287, www.gis.net/farlow.] MasterPeace Dog Training Stress-free training for dog and owner is the goal of every course at MasterPeace; trainers use only positive reinforcement, plus lots of encouragement. Once class is dismissed, wind down with a game of Flyball or chill out in MasterPeace's indoor training ring for some quality time with your best (four-legged) friend. [264 Fisher St., Franklin, 508-553-9300, www.masterpeacedog.com.] The Pawsitive Dog If she can train you, then training your dog will be a breeze, asserts Pawsitive Dog owner Jenifer Vickery, who designs her obedience lessons to be learning experiences at both ends of the leash. The result? Owners emerge in control of even the most misbehaving pooches. One of the most popular classes is \"Real Life Field Trips,\" in which Vickery takes dogs and owners out to bookstores, subways, miniature golf courses, and open caf\u00e9s to teach them how to behave in public. [70 Southampton St., Boston, 617-541-1000.] Grooming If it's true that pets look like their owners, then good grooming is as much a reflection on you as on your pet. Far more important, a groomer will keep your charge tangle-free and healthy. And, yes, gorgeous. Belinda's Groomobile Belinda Lim Tang studied dog grooming in London and worked in grooming salons for 14 years before launching her mobile grooming business out of a van that covers the western suburbs. She'll bring her sudsy operation to your driveway (as long as you're within a 30-minute drive of her Dedham-based operation), saving time and making the grooming experience less stressful on your poor pet. The state-of-the-art van is home to a hydro-massage bathing system and adjustable dryers for sensitive pets. [Dedham, 617-817-3338, www.belindasgroomobile.com.] DogSpa Here, monogrammed terrycloth robes swaddle your pooch, and the master groomers make sure she looks tressed to kill. The 2,700-square-foot spa and grooming facility opened last spring, including an attached boutique that puts the \"up\" in upscale. Just beware \u2014 you may soon find yourself walking in the shadow of your creatively coifed dog. [45 Enon St., Beverly, 978-922-9227, www.dogspa.net.] JP Paws mobile pet grooming Suburban animal owners are a time-starved breed, so it's no surprise when pet grooming takes a back seat. JP Paws owner John Daly will pick up your dog or cat and give her the personal attention she deserves in one of his professional grooming vans, which are outfitted with all the perks of a salon. [22 Wiltshire Rd., Newton, 617-558-7297, www.jppaws.com.] Pet Shops Today's pet shop is part high-end boutique, part learning center, part community hangout. Here are some of the best. Dewberry's Dogs A South Boston destination for the free-thinking pup (and his human companion), Dewberry's spotlights the grooming talents of owner Jennifer Jensik, a line of fresh-baked dog treats, plus aromatherapy and homeopathic remedies for, among other things, separation anxiety. One, called \"Loneliness Home Alone,\" is meant specifically to relieve feelings of abandonment. [357 W. Broadway, South Boston, 617-269-1507.] Especially for Pets All the usual products (California Natural, Wysong, and the Sherpa bag) are here, but there's a whole pet university, too: Every year experts on Reiki, Tellington Touch, and magnetic therapy come to lecture at one of Especially for Pets' five Boston-area accupressure locations.

Be sure to pick up a box of peanut butter-flavored biscuits on the way out. [472 Shawmut Ave., Boston, 617-262-7387, www.thepetshopgirls.com.] Skipton Pet Center Pets of almost every stripe find one-stop shopping at this friendly, family-owned store: toys for small house pets, high-end dog foods, bird supplies, and upwards of 100 fish tanks.

[70 Southampton St., Boston, 617-541-0520.] Pet Food, Treats These health-conscious pet food shops should put Fluffy on the road to clean living. Bite Me! Biscuits If Fluffy gets puffy when she eats mass-produced treats, take advantage of the custom recipe service at Bite Me! Biscuits. There, co-owner Pam Rutter whips up special, all-natural recipes for dogs with allergies (as she does for her own Irish setter, Dublin, who is allergic to beef). Bring in your dog and let him sample and choose his favorites from the bakery's assortment of handmade biscuits, birthday cakes, and muffins. Bite Me! sends its four-legged customers samples of cookies and coupons in their birthday month. [687 N.

The boutique peddles stylish collars, leads, toys, bath products, and canine clothing. [256 Shawmut Ave., Boston, 617-338-5155, www.polkadog.com.] Boarding, Transportation Most humans have trouble sticking to their own schedules \u2014 never mind their pets'. When you can't give Spot your full attention, these services can be man's best friend. The Common Dog Remember when mom used to stand at the end of the driveway and wave as the bus took you to school? The same scenario unfolds for dogs every day, courtesy of the Common Dog's white doggie bus. (Dogs are even safety-belted into their seats so they can peek out the windows like schoolkids.) Once at daycare, they scamper around (indoors and out) and nap on cedar-filled dog beds, couches, and pillows. The Common Dog also offers grooming and a shop with gifts for both dogs and their owners. [22 Park Terr., Everett, 617-381-6363, www.commondog.com.] Decadent Dog Decadent, indeed. They'll walk your dog (rain or shine), take her to and from the groomer or the vet, and provide full-time pet-sitting in your home while you're away.

[1011 Harrison Ave., Boston, 617-442-2682, www.dogdayafternoons.org.] Doggie Daytrippers Almost every dog fancies himself a rugged explorer, and Doggie Daytrippers obliges with regular group field trips to Boston's parks, woods, and beaches, where pooches run around, play, and socialize in the fresh air.

[295 Devonshire St., Boston, 617-426-7387, www.doggieday.com.] Fetch 4-Legged Limo Last summer, pet lover Terry Riccio saw a hole in the pet-pampering industry and filled it with this, Boston's first full-service pet taxi service. For a fee of $45 roundtrip plus tolls, Riccio drives pets to and from the groomer, airport, or vet. Planning is under way for a Boston-to-Provincetown shuttle for vacationing animals, a pet errand-running service, and a line of pet lunch boxes, collars, leashes, and beds.

[472 Shawmut St., Boston, 617-338-8178, www.morningpaws.com.] PAWS and the wagging tail Since certified animal trainer Stephanie Spooner created PAWS eight years ago, word has spread faster than a greyhound on caffeine about her top-notch South End pet care facility.

[24 Halifax St., Jamaica Plain, 617-983-5434, www.pawstoconsider.com.] Pet Companions bed & biscuit The civilized alternative to kennels, Pet Companions occupies a 15-room Victorian house where dogs lounge on furniture, listen to classical music, cavort with other canines, and have the option of cooling off in the doggie pool outside. Judy Basteri began the business in 1985, and opened a second location two years ago. The best part? The \"Pajama Party\" for overnight stays, when dogs sleep in various-sized beds scattered throughout the house. [191 Broadway, Somerville, 617-623-2758; 271 Main St., Reading, 781-944-5445, www.petcompanionsinc.com.] Pet-Estrian Services As the name implies, Pet-Estrian is all about walks (or \"daily aerobic exercise\"). Dogs love the regular \"Leader of the Pack\" play group sessions, too, in which they get exercise and a shot of social interaction with fellow pooches. [Belmont, 617-484-2489, www.pet-estrian.com.] Pooch Palace Sure, there's a huge outdoor playground and indoor romp space. But the heart of Pooch Palace is its sleeping quarters: Dogs bed down in one of the house's six bedrooms, where they're grouped according to size, age, and energy level. Grooming and training services are also available. [Watertown, 617-924-7790, www.thepoochpalace.com.] South Shore Pet Nannies Owner Nancy Labriola has been surrounded by animals for her entire life, which explains the menagerie of pet owners attracted to her and her team of \"nannies.\" South Shore Pet Nannies cares for dogs, cats, horses, frogs, birds, fish, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, even goats.

[Hingham, 781-749-4357, www.the petnanny.com.] Veterinarians Boston's wealth of human emergency medical resources is available at all hours, but let's face it: Your pet has fewer options at 3 in the morning. These fully staffed clinics are always open to provide pets with care when they need it most. Animal Emergency Center One of suburbia's larger animal hospitals, the Animal Emergency Center sees and mends hundreds of animals every week, including dogs, cats, birds, and some exotics (ferrets and gerbils and snakes, oh my!).

Center St., West Bridgewater, 508-580-2515.] Angell Animal medical center A full-service animal care facility may be a no-brainer these days, but back when Angell opened in 1915, it was an unheard-of concept. Since then, the hospital has stayed at the cutting edge of veterinary medicine, with departments for emergency medicine and surgery, cardiology, radiation, dermatology, neurology, and nutrition, to name a few. Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [350 S. Huntington Ave., Boston, 617-522-7282.] Roberts Animal Hospital A team of general-care veterinarians and specialists runs the show at Roberts, treating small animals in a handful of departments: emergency care, surgery, cardiology (including ultrasounds), and dental.

Boston Cat Hospital Your cat is neurotic enough in the veterinarian's waiting room without having to contend with dog snouts pressing up against his carrier. That's why there's Boston Cat Hospital, where the \"d\" word is seldom heard. The hospital has two full-time veterinarians, six technicians, and a cardiologist who visits twice a month. Board-certified specialists in radiology, dermatology, and dentistry are also available. [665 Beacon St., Boston, 617-266-7877.] Boston Mobile Veterinary Clinic Can't get your arthritic beagle in the car for a checkup? Veteran veterinarian John de Jong makes house calls.

[595 Columbian St., Weymouth, 781-760-6560; 334 Chestnut St., Needham, 781-251-9131.] Pet Alternative Therapy Let debates on the philosophy of the consciousness rage on; lack of any consensus won't stop owners from sending their pets to mental therapists, fortune tellers, and homeopaths. In fact the number of experts offering alternative therapies for pets is rising, not falling. Here's a local sampling. Beverly Animal Natural Health Center In addition to traditional treatments for heartworm, obesity, and Lyme disease, doctors Nancy Crowley and Lynne Ricketts offer homeopathy and flower essence therapy for dogs and cats. We can't comment on its effectiveness. But if your dog comes out smelling like chicory and honeysuckle instead of wet fur and garbage, who can really object? [409 Cabot St., Beverly, 978-927-3622, www.banhc.com.] Dr. Cookie Yes, that really is what she goes by. Dr. Stefanie Schwartz, a board-certified veterinary behavior consultant for 20 years, tackles the entire gamut of pet psychological disorders.

[VCA South Shore Animal Hospital, 595 Columbian St., South Weymouth, 781-829-2299, www.dr-cookie.com.] Katz & Dogz Why should people get all the physical therapy? On the other hand, why should pets? Katz & Dogz owner Arnold Katz offers human and animal packages that will leave everyone purring. \"Doggie Massage\" deluxe party packages come with a massage for each pet in attendance and cake from the Polka Dog Bakery (see \"Pet Food and Treats\").

Deren, animal Communicator Go ahead and titter. Susan Deren's intuitive sense of what's ailing cats and dogs (or horses, boaconstrictors, and cockatiels) is hard to deny, given her track record of healing. While she specializes in older pets, Deren will also work with puppies or kittens, and claims to be able to predict their personalities and propensity to illnesses. She also teaches owners the fundamentals of communication. [64 Auburn St., Haverhill, 978-373-5977, www.susanderen.com.] Cemeteries At the end of their lives, your pets deserve a resting place worthy of the companionship they provided while they were alive. Here are some places that promise to give them just that. Angel View Pet Cemetery and crematory At this grassy Middleborough park, your pet will be laid to rest in a 25-acre space with flower beds, shade trees, and a heart-shaped pond.

[76 Liberty St., Plymouth, 508-746-5550, www.petrestofplymouth.com.] Taxidermy For pet owners who have, well, a little trouble letting go, taxidermy has emerged as an alternative to burial or cremation. Most Massachusetts taxidermists won't work on pets, or will jack up their prices to discourage extreme requests. (One local taxidermist tells us he was once asked to turn a tabby into a weighted doorstop; another confides that a customer wanted his dog's head mounted on a wall.) But for a select few pet owners, the process is one way to keep their best friends around \u2014 forever. 10 Point Taxidermy This taxidermist won't work on most domestic animals but has handled smaller critters such as ferrets. [222 Main St., Gloucester, 978-282-1979.] All Points Taxidermy studio Wild animals are the specialty here, but this company also mounts parakeets, iguanas, guinea pigs, and cats.
