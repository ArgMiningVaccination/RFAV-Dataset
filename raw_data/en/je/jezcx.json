This is true unless they have a valid medical exemption to immunization. This includes all public, private, and religious schools. A medical exemption is allowed when a child has a medical condition that prevents them from receiving a vaccine. There are no nonmedical exemptions to school vaccine requirements in NYS. For more information about Medical Exemptions visit the [Child Care Programs, Schools and Post-Secondary Institutions](/prevention/immunization/schools/). The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) establishes the recommended vaccine schedule and determines when vaccines are due. Important school immunization information Within 14 days of the first day of school or day care, parents must: - Show proof of their child's up-to-date vaccinations, OR - Provide a valid medical exemption from vaccination. In order to attend or remain in school or day care, children who are unvaccinated or overdue must receive at least the first dose of all required vaccines within the first 14 days. They also must receive subsequent vaccines in the series within a 14-day period of when they are due to complete the immunization series.

Yes! Scientific data show that [getting multiple vaccines at the same time is safe](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html). It also means fewer doctor's office visits which can be less stressful for your child. - How do I know vaccines are safe? The U.S. has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in its history, and [vaccine safety systems](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/)to ensure that vaccines are as safe as possible. - Why are so many doses needed for each vaccine? Depending on the vaccine, your child will need more than one dose to build high enough immunity to prevent disease or to boost immunity that fades over time. Every dose is important because each protects against infectious diseases that can be especially serious for infants and children. - Is it more natural for my child to get the disease than a vaccine? Some diseases give your child future protection from that disease, but they also can make your child very sick, and they could spread it to other loved ones.
