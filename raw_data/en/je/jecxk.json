After taking a 6 medical residency, I took a fel lowship in allergy and 7 clinical immunology. Since 196 3, I've been on the 8 faculty of the University of Pe nnsylvania, School of 9 Medicine, where I'm currently a n emeritus professor of 10 medicine and neurology. For 24 years, I was chief of 11 the Division of Allergy and Cli nical Immunology at 12 that institution. 13 I also founded and he lped supervise for many 14 years the laboratory that perfo rms autoantibody 15 determinations in our medical c enter, and have done 16 research related to that as wel l as neuroimmunology. 17 Q Are you board certifi ed? 18 A Yes, in internal medi cine and subspecialty 19 of allergy and immunology as we ll. 20 Q And do you treat pati ents? 21 A I did until very rece ntly when I'm emeritus 22 status, but I still consult wit h my colleagues about 23 patients in which the diagnosis is under 24 consideration. 25 Q And are you a member of any professional Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 7 of 289 571A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 organizations? 2 A Yes, a number of them . I'll mention just a 3 few. The American Association of Immunologists, the 4 American Federation of Clinical Research, the American 5 Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology of which I 6 was president, and a number of other immunologically- 7 related organizations. 8 Q And have you received any honors or awards? 9 A Yes, a number of spec ial awards from the 10 American Academy of Allergy, As thma and Immunology, 11 distinguished service awards, s imilar to that, as well 12 as teaching awards from my univ ersity. 13 MR. JOHNSON: Special Master, at this time 14 we would offer Dr. Zweiman as a n expert in the area of 15 immunology. 16 THE COURT: Any objec tions? 17 MR.

Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 9 of 289 572 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 (The d ocument referred to was 2 marked for identification as 3 Respon dent's Trial Exhibit 4 No. 2. ) 5 BY MR. JOHNSON: 6 Q Dr. Zweiman, there ha s been some testimony 7 in this case so far regarding a utoantibodies to myelin 8 basic protein or anti-MBP. Can you first explain to 9 the Court what myelin is? 10 A Yes. As you can see in the first slide, 11 myelin is a fatty material whic h coats processes that 12 extend from neurons. These pro cesses are called 13 axons. The myelin coating arou nd the axon protects 14 it, insulates it, allows a fast er induction of the 15 electric current, if you will, that goes down, a 16 process from one neuron to anot her. It also prevents 17 the electrical charge from leak ing off the process 18 into the surrounding tissue. 19 Q And what is myelin ba sic protein? 20 A Well, I pushed the up button, but it 21 didn't -- try pushing another o ne. 22 If one sees a myelina ted fiber -- 23 Q And we're now looking at slide 2 of 24 Petitioners' Trial Exhibit 2. 25 A Which is shown in the upper portion of this Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 10 of 289 573 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 slide. This is the myelin shea th around an axon drawn 2 figuratively, and the electrica l current going from 3 neuron down the axon. This mye lin can be damaged in a 4 number of ways, both on an immu ne basis, on an 5 nonimmune basis, and when that happens components of 6 the myelin, including myelin ba sic protein, can leak 7 out from this area. 8 Myelinated fibers can sometimes be 9 remyelinated and they are done so by a cell, a glial 10 cell, you've heard about glial cells discussed 11 yesterday. This particular gli al cell is called the 12 oligodendrocyte shown over here which sends out from 13 its membrane material that beco mes part of the myelin 14 sheath on surrounding axons. 15 Q And we're now looking at slide 3, and you 16 were pointing to the circle fou nd in the middle of the 17 slide and then the -- 18 A That's the oligodendr ocyte, and the membrane 19 is from that becoming part of t he myelin sheath that 20 surrounds the axons. 21 If one looks, as you can see in the lower 22 left-hand portion of this slide , this is a cross- 23 section, this is the axon in th e middle and then 24 wrapped around it in concentric circles is the myelin. 25 It's important to emphasize tha t myelin basic protein, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 11 of 289 574A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 as I'll mention in a minute, is one of the major 2 proteins present in myelin, is on the internal aspect 3 of these layers is not so easil y displayed to the 4 outside as some other proteins that I will mention as 5 well. It's on the internal asp ect of these layers of 6 myelin. 7 Q So given that backgro und, describe what and 8 more specifically what myelin b asic protein is? 9 A Myelin basic protein is one of the most 10 abundant proteins within myelin , thought to be about 11 30 percent of the total protein in the myelin 12 membrane. It's thought to play a role in the 13 formation and the maintenance o f the myelin sheath. 14 It has a very strong positive c harge. The reason it's 15 called \"basic\" is not because i t's so simple, but 16 because it's very alkaline. It has a very high what 17 we call PK value. 18 The reason why this i s important to mention 19 is that because it is so highly charged when one tries 20 to measure antibodies against i t one has to be very 21 careful because there is a lot of nonimmunologic 22 findings of certain proteins to this very highly 23 charged molecule called myelin basic protein, and one 24 has to take care in running imm uno assays that one is 25 not just measuring an electrica l attraction rather Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 12 of 289 575A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 than immunologic binding. 2 As I mentioned earlie r, it's on the inside 3 of the membrane, less accessibl e to immune attack than 4 is myelin oligodendrocytes glyc o protein, or it's 5 abbreviated called MOG as compa red to MBP which is an 6 abbreviation for myelin basic p rotein. 7 It is one of the prot eins that can leak out 8 in the cerebral spinal fluid or occasionally gets into 9 the blood when there is extensi ve myelin damage. 10 Q And Dr. Zweiman, you just mentioned 11 antibodies and I was wondering if you could explain 12 just generally how antibodies a re formed? 13 A I think this -- 14 Q Looking at slide -- w e're skipping to slide 15 9. 16 A So most adaptive immu ne responses resulting 17 in the formation of an antibody the steps look 18 something like this. An antige n presenting cell here, 19 abbreviated as APC, and a good example of that is a 20 macrophage or dendritic cells w ill ingest the antigen, 21 most of which are protein. The y digest the antigen, 22 break it up into what they call peptides, and present 23 that peptide fragment of the an tigen on the cell 24 surface along with a major hist ocompatibility complex, 25 which is necessary for presenta tion, effective Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 13 of 289 576A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 presentation of the antigen. 2 A helper T-cell recog nizes this particular 3 antigen by a cognate receptor w hich is specific for 4 that antigen. If it stops righ t there, one does not 5 get a very good immune response . Indeed, sometimes 6 one may actually induce toleran ce, but a second signal 7 that is required in most situat ions is what we call 8 costimulation, that leads to ac tivation of the T-cell. 9 It elaborates the cytokines whi ch then act on another 10 population of lymphocytes calle d B-lymphocytes, which 11 are then converted into antibod y-producing cells. 12 Q And this process that you've just described, 13 is this process what happens wh en antibodies to myelin 14 basic protein are formed? 15 A I believe so, yes. T here is good evidence 16 that T-cells play a very import ant role in the 17 production of antibodies agains t myelin basic protein. 18 Q And, Dr. Zweiman, wha t is happening in the 19 brain when there are elevated l evels of anti-MBP or 20 antibodies to myelin basic prot ein? 21 A Will this take me bac k? Let's see. I am 22 going back -- 23 Q Go back to slide 4. 24 A That I'm trying to do but I think I'm going 25 to need some assistance. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 14 of 289 577A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 Q Someone will assist y ou. 2 (Pause.) 3 A Yes. 4 Q There we go, it's sli de 5. I apologize. 5 A This is a picture tak en from a side view of 6 an MRI study of a normal indivi dual, and one can see 7 the various different component s of the brain, and the 8 important thing to remember is that everything looks 9 pretty much gray and blackened here. There are no 10 high intensity signals. 11 When one has myelin d estruction as shown in 12 this side view of the brain of a patient with multiple 13 sclerosis -- 14 Q We're now looking at slide 6. 15 A One sees these high i ntensity, very bright 16 white areas. These are so-call ed plaque areas. In 17 multiple sclerosis from which t his study was done, 18 they tend to be concentrated pa rticularly around 19 spaces within the brain called the ventricle, 20 periventricular areas right ove r here. This indicates 21 areas of myelin damage, the so- called white matter of 22 the brain is damaged. These ar e the plaques of 23 multiple sclerosis. 24 I should mention also just for reference 25 that it's been found that in th ese plaques there are Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 15 of 289 578 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 immunoglobulins, that is, Ig, t hat contain antibodies. 2 In contrast, I'm no e xpert in the MRI of 3 autism, but from everything I h ave been told and read 4 one does not see these areas of demyelination in the 5 brains of individuals who have autism, even of some 6 years duration. 7 Q So I take it from the se slides that you've 8 just shown that myelin damage i s typically or almost 9 always visible on an MRI? 10 A If one has a sufficie ntly sensitive one, it 11 is seen in the large majority i f not almost all 12 individuals who have it. 13 Now, the question com es up could one have 14 leakage of myelin in the absenc e of visible evidence 15 of myelin damage, and that's a matter of some debate 16 at the present time, but since one can find even in 17 normal individuals the presence of anti-myelin 18 antibodies in some normal indiv iduals, one does not 19 have to see this in every case, although one sees 20 that's the most common pattern that one sees. 21 Q And I believe you men tioned earlier that you 22 have done some research and run , I think, a lab that 23 does antibody testing. 24 Have you personally t ested for anti-MBP? 25 A Yes, we have. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 16 of 289 579A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 Q Is that testing easy to do? 2 A We certainly found th at it was not easy to 3 do. We were one of the first g roups in the United 4 States to do such testing, and it required some 5 particular laboratory manipulat ions and controls in 6 order to get specific immunolog ic finding of anti-MBP 7 measures. 8 Q And from what you hav e seen in your 9 practice, are anti-MBP levels v ariable? 10 A They certainly are va riable from time point 11 to time point in individuals in which they are 12 present. I should mention and perhaps I could mention 13 this in one of the next slides, that anti-MBP 14 antibodies are measured by a nu mber of different 15 approaches, and that's why it's difficult at times to 16 compare findings from one repor t to another. 17 Anti-MBP antibodies o f a group of antibodies 18 against different components of the neuro or the 19 central nervous system, they ar e generally by very 20 sensitive binding techniques. By that I mean what the 21 call Western, W-E-S-T-E-R-N, bl ot techniques or very 22 sensitive ELISA, E-L-I-S-A, I b elieve, these are very, 23 very sensitive and it does not necessarily prove that 24 you have a lot of antibodies be cause they are so 25 sensitive, so therefore one doe s not necessarily find Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 17 of 289 580 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 the same results reported by on e technique as by 2 others. 3 Myelin basic protein and myelin 4 oligodendrocytes protein, nerve filament proteins have 5 all been used as targets for me asuring of these 6 antibodies. Some groups use ti ssue sections of brain, 7 either brain taken from animals , brain taken from 8 human fetuses, occasionally fro m adult human brain, 9 and therefore again that's anot her reason why one 10 finds difficulty sometimes in c omparing the results 11 from one group to another. 12 The techniques genera lly are not 13 standardized laboratory techniq ues. These are not 14 like a blood sugar determinatio n where if you had it 15 done in 100 laboratories, proba bly 95 laboratories 16 would come up with quite simila r results. These are 17 more what I call a research typ e technique. 18 Therefore, I have to look very carefully 19 when you say the results vary f rom time -- they 20 certainly are -- I didn't know whether it's the 21 technique, whether or not it's a natural course of the 22 antibodies in the body. 23 Q Doctor, are you famil iar with research that 24 suggests that elevated anti-MBP levels have been found 25 in patients with ASDs? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 18 of 289 581A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 A Yes, I am. Anti-MBP antibodies have been 2 reported in the serum of patien ts with the ASD 3 spectrum. The frequency of suc h antibodies being 4 reported has varied reports, ag ain possibly related to 5 the techniques being used, as h igh as 50-60 percent in 6 some series, but they have also been reported in other 7 neurodegenerative diseases, and Connolly's group has 8 reported present in a sizable p ercentage of those with 9 epilepsy. Berger has found ant i-MBP and anti-MOG in 10 62 percent of those with multip le sclerosis. It's 11 been reported in normals in one series, about 25 12 percent of normal sera, and ant i-MBP antibodies. One 13 group was found in 50 percent f or patients with active 14 rheumatoid arthritis. 15 So the presence of su ch antibodies is 16 certainly not specific for auti sm or ASD. It's not 17 found in all patients with ASD. 18 Q And when you say that it's sometimes found 19 in normals, what do you mean by normals? 20 A Well, individuals who -- most institutions 21 what they use are age match ind ividuals who are coming 22 to donate blood, for example, a nd have no ostensible 23 clinical disease of any sort. 24 Q So do I understand yo u to mean that elevated 25 anti-MBP levels are not always a sign of neurological Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 19 of 289 582A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 dysfunction? 2 A That is correct. 3 Q Doctor, is there any relation between the 4 MMR vaccine and anti-MBP antibo dies? 5 A Well, let me mention one thing before I 6 answer that question if I may. 7 Q Sure. 8 A The question that has been raised, what is 9 the clinical relevance of findi ng anti-MBP antibodies, 10 and several groups have comment ed on this. Most 11 recently the group at Davis, wh o have been studying 12 ASD from several aspects, whose comment in a review by 13 Wills, et al., that they emphas ize that there is no 14 evidence that the anti-MBP anti bodies are associated 15 with pathology in ASD. 16 They comment that stu dies have not found 17 such antibodies in the tissues in a number of cases 18 where they have had tissues to examine in the central 19 nervous system, and they have a cknowledged the 20 possibility that the presence o f antibodies might be a 21 marker of myelin damage due to other reasons, that it 22 certainly is not pathogenic. 23 We know that taking a nti-MBP antibodies and 24 injecting them in sizable amoun ts into experimental 25 animals does not by itself indu ce neurologic disease, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 20 of 289 583A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 and some individuals, some auth orities have even 2 raised the possibility that the formation of anti-MBP 3 antibodies may actually be part of a healing process. 4 Therefore, I think it 's still an unanswered 5 question of what the clinical r elevance of the 6 presence of anti-MBP antibodies are. 7 Q Okay. And then getti ng back to my question 8 of whether there is any relatio n between anti-MBP and 9 an MMR vaccine. 10 A If one speculates or postulates that the MMR 11 vaccine in some way induces the formation of anti-MBP 12 antibodies, one could postulate several possible 13 reasons. One is that there mig ht be some MBP as a 14 contaminant in the vaccine itse lf, and that one is 15 inducing an immune response to such a contaminating 16 MBP protein. After all, the vi ruses are grown in 17 tissues and one could speculate that maybe some myelin 18 basic protein was in the cultur e medium, et cetera. 19 This has been looked for extens ively by several groups 20 and no MBP has been found in va ccine. 21 Another possibility i s that there is some 22 sort of molecular mimicry betwe en the measles virus 23 proteins and myelin basic prote in. Again, this has 24 been looked at and investigated extensively, and 25 indeed the Institute of Medicin e Immunization Safety Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 21 of 289 584 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 Committee concludes that there is no evidence of 2 molecular mimicry between these viruses and myelin 3 basic protein. 4 Anti-MBP antibodies t aken from individuals 5 who have anti-measles antibodie s have shown no cross- 6 reactivity. By that I mean in individuals who have 7 SSPE, they typically have very high levels of anti- 8 measles virus antibodies. They also sometimes have 9 antibodies against myelin basic protein. Yet if you 10 take these antibodies and do wh at they call cross- 11 absorption studies, there is no evidence that they're 12 binding the same components. T hey are both there, but 13 they are not cross-reacting to one another. 14 Bernard and his group also showed that 15 antibodies taken from individua ls with more garden 16 variety type of measles virus i nfection do not cross- 17 react with myelin basic protein . 18 So therefore one cann ot postulate that the 19 measles virus itself is inducin g antibodies against 20 myelin basic protein. 21 And the last line of evidence that I know of 22 is that, to my knowledge, when they looked at the 23 serum of individuals who receiv ed MMR vaccines, that 24 this does not induce the format ion of anti-MBP 25 antibodies. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 22 of 289 585 ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 Q Doctor, are you aware of the value of the 2 elevated anti-MBP level of 46 t hat Colten had in this 3 case? 4 A I'm aware of it, yes. 5 Q Is that value suffici ent evidence to 6 conclude that Colten experience d brain inflammation or 7 some kind of brain damage as a result of his April 23, 8 1998, MMR vaccination? 9 A No, I don't think it does. The value 10 reported by Specialty Labs, I t hink it was in January 11 of 2000, does seem quite high. It's a puzzle to me 12 why it's so high when all the o ther values were not. 13 Indeed two months after that 46 was recorded by them 14 Dr. Singh's lab, which has, I t hink, been mentioned by 15 the Petitioner on a number of o ccasions, did not find 16 any evidence of anti-MBP antibo dies in the serum. 17 The techniques were n ot the same, but yet it 18 seems quite unusual to me to se e what was reported at 19 such a high level reported from the Specialty Labs and 20 two months later to find it abs ent in Dr. Singh's 21 analysis. So I think its clini cal relevance is so 22 uncertain in my mind. 23 Q Doctor, do you know w hether Colten's CSF was 24 ever tested for anti-MBP? 25 A Yes, it was in 2002, I believe, and it was Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 23 of 289 586A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 absent in the CSF that was anal yzed by Singh's lab. 2 Q In your mind, what co nclusions can you draw 3 from that test? 4 A Well, the presence of antibodies against 5 anti-MBP in the CSF would be mo re direct evidence of 6 damage to the white matter or s ome processes causing 7 damage to the white matter of t he brain because CSF 8 more closely reflects those loc al events within their 9 axis. 10 I should also mention that there were no 11 antibodies found against measle s virus in that CSF 12 specimen by Dr. Singh. 13 Q So just to wrap up th is topic, in your 14 opinion, in the absence of any other evidence is an 15 elevated anti-MBP level a relia ble marker for a 16 measles infection in the brain? 17 A I do not think it is. One has to understand 18 that if you're talking about a measurement in the 19 serum or in the cerebral spinal fluid. 20 A And I guess in the CS F. 21 A Well, one generally d oes not obtain cerebral 22 spinal fluid specimens unless o ne suspects that there 23 is something going on in their axis, such as the rare 24 instance of SSPE, for example. But if you're asking 25 me in a routine measles virus i nfection, for example, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 24 of 289 586B ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 would one expect to see anti-MB P antibodies as a Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 25 of 289 587A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 marker of measles virus infect ion -- 2 Q If that was the only evidence that you had, 3 if the elevated anti-MBP level was the only evidence 4 that you had, would that be suf ficient to conclude 5 that there was a measles infect ion of the brain? 6 A Oh, certainly not. N o. 7 Q Doctor, moving on to my next topic. Dr. 8 Bradstreet mentioned that Colte n had a decreased IgA 9 level. Do you agree with that? 10 A No, I do not. May I take a minute just to 11 explain to the Court what IgA i s, and what IgA 12 deficiency is? 13 Much as I want to say -- maybe I should have 14 said earlier that there is a bi g difference between 15 autoimmunity and autoimmune dis ease, meaning that 16 autoimmunity is not a rare even t. Many of us around 17 the room may have low levels of autoantibodies that 18 are kept under control so that we do not develop 19 disease. 20 The same thing applie s to a degree with 21 immunoglobulin A. Immunoglobul in A is a class of 22 immunoglobulin that functions m ainly by its protective 23 effect at mucosal surfaces, tha t is, around the mucous 24 membranes of the respiratory an d GI tracts. When one 25 says that an individual is IgA deficient, it means Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 26 of 289 588A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 that one has essentially no IgA . In most laboratories 2 this is defined as levels eithe r less than 10 or less 3 than seven milligrams per decil iter, depending on the 4 laboratory. 5 About one in every fi ve or six hundred of us 6 is IgA deficient. That is, we have IgA levels that 7 are that low. Most such indivi duals are perfectly 8 healthy, the findings turns out to be an incidental 9 one that comes up because the a ssay was done as part 10 of a panel for another diagnost ic purpose. 11 When it is associated with diseases, mostly 12 associated with an increased in cidence of infections 13 of particular types, and that i s infections like 14 chronic and persistent sinusiti s, inflammation of 15 sinuses, middle ear, pharyngiti s, but talking about 16 very frequent infections, more than the average number 17 which commonly occur in young c hildren, particularly 18 if they have older siblings and particularly if the 19 older sibling is in school, or in daycare when they 20 bring home viruses. 21 The IgA deficient ind ividual is not 22 particularly prone to getting m ore typical colds than 23 usual. It's particular types o f infection. 24 And so in Colten's ca se, he had a modestly 25 decreased serum level of IgA. It was not down in the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 27 of 289 589A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 range that would be called IgA deficiency. 2 Furthermore, subsequent studies done in other 3 laboratories showed perfectly n ormal IgA levels in 4 Colten. For example, one done in the University of 5 Florida, Shands Medical Center. 6 Q Doctor, there has bee n some testimony in 7 this case regarding the issue o f immune dysregulation. 8 As an immunologist, have you se en any evidence that 9 Colten had a dysregulated immun e system prior to his 10 April 23, 1998, MMR vaccination ? 11 A In my opinion, the te rm \"immune 12 dysregulation\" has been used ve ry loosely. It's 13 almost as if you're watching yo ur television news and 14 it seems every other ad these d ays is for some product 15 that purportedly boosts your im mune responses, and I 16 think that these statements are made by the people 17 where they do not fully underst and or overstate what 18 immune responses really are. 19 An individual can be immunodeficient. They 20 can be deficient in one of the major components of the 21 immune response, and an individ ual can have immune- 22 based abnormalities, but to say that such individuals 23 have immune dysregulation witho ut having firm evidence 24 of it, I think is overstated. 25 For example, it has b een stated and we heard Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 28 of 289 590A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 in this hearing that individual s who get measles 2 vaccine are immunosuppressed. Our group, my 3 colleagues and I were one of th e first in the United 4 States to show the immunologica l effects of 5 immunization with the attenuate d measles vaccine. 6 What happens is that one sees a moderate 7 transient decrease in cell-medi ated immunity that is 8 expressed by delayed hypersensi tivity skin testing. 9 In our series, it was about hal f of the individuals 10 exhibited this. Along with thi s was a decrease in 11 cellular reactivity to certain antigens. 12 The humoral immune re sponse, that is, the 13 antibody formation to measles v accine, the virus 14 itself, and to other antigens w as perfectly normal, 15 and indeed Dr. Diane Griffin, a n expert in immunology 16 confirmed these findings, and e xtended them after we 17 did our studies, and said very well in her testimony 18 in the Cedillo case, which I th ink is on file, in 19 which she said that one paradox is that there is this 20 modest nonclinically relevant d epression of delayed 21 hypersensitivity cellular immun ity and a very vigorous 22 humoral immune response, includ ing to the measles 23 virus. 24 And I think the most important point is that 25 I was able to personally observ e individuals who got Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 29 of 289 590B ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 the measles vaccine and exhibit ed decreased delayed Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 30 of 289 591A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 hypersensitivity and they were perfectly fine. There 2 was no evidence that these indi viduals had more 3 infections, or were more predis posed during the five 4 to six weeks period of time whe n they exhibited this 5 transient decrease in delayed h ypersensitivity. 6 So one has to be very careful in 7 differentiating what I just des cribed seeing a much 8 more profound decrease in cell- mediated immunity that 9 occurs with wild measles virus infection and which has 10 been associated with an increas ed predisposition to 11 infection. In fact, as Dr. Gri ffin pointed out in her 12 testimony, this is a major caus e of morbidity in wild 13 measles virus infection. That is not the situation 14 with the attenuated measles vac cine. 15 Q And based on the info rmation that you just 16 provided, do you believe that C olten Snyder 17 experienced any clinically sign ificant 18 immunosuppression either before or after his MMR 19 vaccine? 20 A I saw no evidence of that. 21 Q There has been some t estimony about an 22 article by Dr. Weible. Do you know Dr. Weible? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Who is Dr. Weible? 25 A Dr. Robert Weible was a former faculty Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 31 of 289 592A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 member at the Children's Hospit al of Philadelphia, 2 well respected in pediatric inf ectious diseases. He 3 is currently associated with th e VICP. He was the 4 first author in the paper to wh ich you referred and 5 which has been mentioned severa l times during this 6 hearing. 7 I read Dr. Weible's p aper very carefully 8 when I was reviewing the medica l records of Colten 9 Snyder, and it didn't sound to me as if Colten 10 Snyder's clinical presentation was similar to that as 11 described by Weible, et al. Ho wever, I am not a 12 pediatric infectious disease pe rson. So I called Dr. 13 Weible up and discussed the sit uation. He reviewed 14 the clinical information and sa id this is not what we 15 would describe in a group of pa tients that we 16 reported. 17 Q And, Doctor, yesterda y the Special Master 18 asked Dr. Kinsbourne if he coul d identify any markers 19 for a persistent measles infect ion other than a 20 finding of measles virus RNA. Dr. Kinsbourne 21 mentioned anti-MBP, which we ha ve already discussed. 22 Can you think of a ne gative marker for 23 persistent measles infection? 24 A Well, I first should say that I am not a 25 measles virus expert. There wi ll be people who are Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 32 of 289 592B ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 expert in this area who can com ment much better than Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 33 of 289 593A ZWEIMAN - DIRECT 1 I. But I would like to quote a comment made by Dr. 2 Robert Fujinami, that's F-U-J-I -N-A-M-I, who is a 3 highly respected neurovirologis t and viral 4 immunologist, who made the poin t that if one is 5 postulating persistence of a me asles virus in the 6 central nervous system of an in dividual, one should 7 see evidence of an immune respo nse against that virus, 8 particularly within the cerebra l spinal fluid. 9 We know that in Colte n Snyder's case there 10 was a serum immune response fou nd in the serum a 11 measles virus. Dr. Singh's lab oratory reported that 12 in 2002. It wasn't a huge resp onse. Dr. Fujinami 13 would say that with persistent infection one should 14 expect an enhanced, very high i mmune response, but 15 there was an immune response in the serum, but there 16 was none found in the cerebral spinal fluid. And in 17 my mind, as a nonmeasles expert , I would think that 18 would suggest that there was no t an ongoing 19 persistence in proliferation of the vaccine measles 20 virus in the central nervous sy stem of Colten Snyder. 21 Q Okay. Just to make s ure I'm understanding 22 you, is it your testimony that the absence of 23 antibodies to the measles virus in Colten's CSF 24 suggest that there is not persi stent measles infection 25 in his brain? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 34 of 289 594 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A Well, in this regard I am trying to 2 paraphrase what Dr. Fujinami wo uld say in the 3 situation. I am not an expert in that area, but that 4 would raise that possibility in my mind. 5 MR. JOHNSON: Thank y ou very much. That's 6 all I have. 7 THE COURT: You may c ross. 8 CROSS-EXAMINA TION 9 BY MR. POWERS: 10 Q Dr. Zweiman, my name is Tom Powers. I am 11 one of the attorneys representi ng Colten Snyder and 12 Petitioners in the omnibus proc eeding. 13 My records indicate t hat the last expert 14 report you filed in this matter was in April 2004. Is 15 that accurate? 16 A I believe that's the last one. 17 Q So in the last three years, you have not 18 submitted any other filings tha t are relevant to 19 Colten's case or the omnibus pr oceedings as far as you 20 know? 21 A I don't think I have been requested to 22 submit anything, no. 23 Q In that report of Apr il 2004, the focus of 24 your report is responding speci fically to comments 25 made by Dr. Bradstreet, is that correct? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 35 of 289 595 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A That's what I was req uested to do, yes. 2 Q And that is in fact w hat you did in the 3 report in 2004, correct? 4 A Yes. 5 Q I didn't hear your an swer. 6 A Yes. 7 Q Okay. At the time yo u prepared that expert 8 report over three years ago, at that point was it your 9 understanding that Dr. Bradstre et was the causation 10 expert who would be testifying in Colten Snyder's 11 case? 12 A I had no understandin g one way or the other. 13 I was just asked to respond to comments made by him. 14 The matter of him testifying ne ver was raised. 15 Q And in that expert re port that you prepared, 16 the comments that you are addre ssing are the 17 autoimmunity issues that Dr. Br adstreet raised in his 18 series of reports preceding you rs, is that correct? 19 A Well, certainly that was the major focus of 20 what his comments were at that time. 21 Q Subsequent to the fil ing of Drs. 22 Kinsbourne's and Kennedy's expe rt reports in this 23 case, you have not prepared any additional report for 24 use in this proceeding, have yo u? 25 A Not to my knowledge, no. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 36 of 289 596A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 Q You made some comment s about anti-MBP. This 2 is not in the report, so I'm no t going to be referring 3 to something specifically. In your testimony here, 4 you mentioned the presence of a nti-MBPs in what you 5 would describe as normal people . Do you recall that 6 testimony? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And by \"normal\", what you mean to say is 9 people who are not presenting w ith any clinical 10 symptoms of immune-mediated dis ease? 11 A As best I can tell fr om the papers that I 12 have read, these were normal co ntrols, normal healthy 13 individuals. 14 Q And normal, I'm just trying to get to what 15 normal means. If there are ant i-MBPs found in those 16 people, the definition of norma lcy is based, if you 17 know, on the presentation of cl inical symptoms or the 18 lack of clinical symptoms? 19 A I cannot speak for th e authors of those 20 reports exactly how they chose the normal controls, 21 but I can tell you what most sc ientific studies that 22 are well carried out, they use as normal controls 23 people who are coming in to don ate blood, in the case 24 of children, there are pounds o f sera obtained from 25 well children visits, things li ke that, are used as Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 37 of 289 596B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 normal controls. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 38 of 289 597A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 Q And all I am trying t o get to is a normal 2 control would be an assessment that's made in the 3 clinical presentation because i f they found anti-MBPs 4 and the presumption is that the normal would have 5 none, it sounds like somebody w ho had anti-MBPs, if 6 that was the definition of norm al, would not be 7 normal? 8 A I think your reasonin g is circular. A 9 normal individual is one who in scientific studies the 10 individual is clinically normal . If you find a 11 particular immunologic finding, that does not make 12 them abnormal. It means that t hat finding is present 13 in some normal individuals. 14 Let me emphasize for the Court that an 15 antibody assay is not a black o r white situation, 16 particularly with these very se nsitive binding 17 techniques. I'll give you a co ncrete example. 18 A disease called syst emic lupus, that is 19 characterized by the presence o f anti-nuclear 20 antibodies. It's a very sensit ive technique the way 21 our laboratories do it these da ys. But because of 22 that, it is not unusual to find such antibodies 23 present in a one to 40 dilution of serum from normal 24 individuals, maybe 40 or 50 per cent of normal 25 individuals will have that anti body present in the one Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 39 of 289 597B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 to 40 dilution of the serum. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 40 of 289 598A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 So one has to go out to either one to 80 or 2 one to 160 dilution before you get a cutoff between 3 that found in normal individual s and that found in 4 patients with systemic lupus, a nd the same thing 5 applies when one talks about th e anti-MBP antibodies. 6 Dr. Sinclair, who is frequently quoted by the 7 Petitioners, what they do is th ey find it in plenty of 8 normal individuals, but if they dilute out serum far 9 enough they find they can find a distinction between 10 their study population and othe rs, and other groups 11 have found that they can dilute out the serum and find 12 it in normal individuals. 13 So it's not is it the re or not, it's how 14 much you have in there, and wit h the Western blot 15 techniques used by a number of laboratories, it is not 16 a quantitative measure. It's m ore of a semi- 17 quantitative measure of whether how much is there. 18 So when you say to me does the presence of 19 anti-MBP mean that somebody is abnormal, the answer is 20 it depends. If the individual is clinically normal, 21 it's normal. 22 Q And actually the orig inal question was much 23 simpler, which is that when you use the term \"normal\", 24 did it refer to clinically norm al. It sounds like the 25 answer to that question is yes -- Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 41 of 289 599 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A That's what -- 2 Q -- it's clinically no rmal? 3 A That's what all the c linical studies have 4 done. 5 Q All right. 6 A Is clinically normall y control. Now, there 7 are other control populations, but clinically normal. 8 Q Right. Yes, and that 's all that I was 9 asking. 10 Now, if there are MBP s in samples taken from 11 clinically normal people, the a nti-MBPs would have to 12 come from somewhere, is that co rrect? 13 A In the first place, i t's not MBPs. You said 14 if the MBPs are normal. 15 Q Anti. 16 A Oh, anti-MBP. 17 Q If I did say, that's what I meant to say and 18 that's what I thought you said, but yes, if you have 19 anti-MBPs that are present in n ormals, those would 20 have to come from somewhere, is n't that right? 21 A If one gets around th e technical aspects, 22 there are nonimmune binding of immunoglobulin to this 23 highly charged molecule called MBP. It would be 24 present in serum from normal -- it has to be made. 25 The reason for it being made is not clear. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 42 of 289 600A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 Q And the reason for th eir being made in your 2 slides was that because of the damage to the myelin 3 sheath? 4 A That is the most like ly situation one finds. 5 I'm not saying that's the only one. 6 Q Understood. So if yo u have anti-MBPs found 7 in a clinically normal person, it still does suggest - 8 - 9 A Anti-MBPs. You keep saying MBPs. 10 Q Yes. If you have the presence of anti-MBPs 11 in samples from clinically norm al people, it would 12 strongly suggest that even in t hose clinically normal 13 people there has been damage to the myelin sheath? 14 A No. 15 Q What would it suggest then? Where would 16 these anti-MBPs come from? 17 A I just said that dama ge to the myelin sheath 18 is the most common reasons, but I didn't say it was 19 the only thing that could happe n. 20 Q Well, I will ask in a second what other 21 sources there could be, but wou ld it be fair to say 22 that if not exclusive, if the p resence of anti-MBPs in 23 normals is not exclusively deri ved from the damage of 24 the myelin sheath, it would be consistent with myelin 25 sheath damage. Is that a faire r statement? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 43 of 289 600B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A I would want to see o ther evidence that Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 44 of 289 601B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 there was demyelination before I conclude that this 2 was indicative of myelin sheath damage. 3 Q What kind of evidence would you look for? 4 A Well, one is highly s ensitive MRI, the 5 evidence of demyelination just as I have showed you 6 seen in multiple sclerosis and found in some other 7 demyelination disorders. Some groups actually measure 8 the MBP in the spinal fluid as a measure of myelin 9 damage. This is done by some g roups to follow 10 multiple sclerosis patients. 11 Q And let me interrupt you for just a second 12 on the MRI response. You're ta lking about very 13 sensitive MRIs. Are you aware of MRI imaging of 14 peoples' brains who were clinic ally normal that show 15 the type of myelin damage that you would see in say a 16 multiple sclerosis patient with plaques? 17 A No. That's the reaso n why I concluded that 18 evidence of myelin damage is th e most likely scenario, 19 but not the only one in which o ne can see evidence of 20 anti-MBP antibodies. 21 Q Okay. I understand, but the question was 22 are you aware of say peer revie w-published studies 23 where MRI imaging was done of t he brains of clinically 24 normal people that found eviden ce of myelin damage 25 similar to what you would find in multiple sclerosis? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 45 of 289 601B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A Not in taking a popul ation of normals, but 2 it's been -- Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 46 of 289 602A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 but one can get areas of demyel ination without showing 2 up on the MRI without having ev idence of clinical 3 manifestations to go along with that. 4 A classic example is in multiple sclerosis 5 where an individual will presen t with an acute episode 6 frequently involving the eye, a nd when they do an MRI, 7 they find a area of demyelinati on that corresponds 8 with the clinical symptoms at t hat time because they 9 find an older area in another p art of the brain that 10 was made six months or a year e arlier, at which time 11 the individual had no symptoms. It's one of the 12 things they have learned about multiple sclerosis. 13 You can get these asymptomatic involvement areas. 14 So it's conceivable, to answer your 15 question, that an individual at that time may have had 16 some disease. So I think that two parts answer your 17 question. One says in that sce nario just as I 18 described it, but there may be other reasons why you 19 can have a stimulus to the prod uction of anti-MBP 20 antibodies. I think my final c onclusion would be the 21 same. The clinical relevance o f it in some 22 individuals is still uncertain. 23 Q On slide 8, if you co uld -- I don't have the 24 numbers in front of me, but if you could - 25 // Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 47 of 289 603A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 A What's the title of t hat one, please? 2 Q The title of slide 8 is \"Antibodies Against 3 Myelin Basic Protein.\" 4 In that slide you ref erred -- it's on a 5 slide, you mentioned it in your direct testimony, the 6 finding that antibodies against myelin basic protein 7 are found in the serum, blood s erum in several 8 disorders, including in epileps y, correct? 9 A Dr. Connolly's group has found it in 10 epilepsy, yes. 11 Q And understanding tha t you're not putting 12 yourself out as an expert in au tism spectrum 13 disorders, do you have any info rmation that would 14 allow you to conclude that the incidence of epilepsy 15 among autistics is higher than the incidence of 16 epilepsy among nonautistics? 17 A I'm not an expert eno ugh to say 18 definitively, but I should tell you that Dr. Connolly 19 and her colleagues specifically in that report 20 emphasized that these bases for epilepsy were looked 21 carefully for evidence of ASD a nd found not to be 22 present. These are individuals in which there was no 23 evidence of ASD, according to t hem, and I gather that 24 her group is respected for thei r studies in this area. 25 Q You also mentioned th e possibility that the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 48 of 289 603B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 presence of anti-MBP might be e vidence of what you Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 49 of 289 604A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 describe as a healing process. Do you remember that 2 statement? 3 A Yes. That's not my i s a hypothesis or 4 postulate. Some authors have d escribed that as a 5 possibility, that that might be part of it. I don't 6 know if they have firm evidence for it. I pointed 7 that out only to say that there is still considerable 8 uncertainty about the pathophys iologic significance of 9 anti-MBP antibodies. 10 Q Sure, but my question is going to be 11 relatively simple, I think, by this idea that it might 12 be part of the healing process, at least to me raises 13 the question healing from what. Do you have any sense 14 of what those authors or other authors or yourself 15 would think that a person who w as demonstrating the 16 presence of anti-MBPs as a heal ing process, what they 17 are healing from? 18 A Well, again, I don't want to speculate what 19 these authors intended when the y made those 20 statements. I could say that I can give you a 21 possible scenario, and that is that if we found in 22 some what they call white matte rs strokes, that there 23 are in some individuals increas ed levels of anti-MBP 24 antibodies. 25 I had mentioned earli er that there is Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 50 of 289 604B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 attempt at remyelination, not a lways successful in Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 51 of 289 605A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 individuals with new myelin lay ed down by the 2 oligodendrocytes, and that coul d be part of the anti- 3 healing process, remembering th at the -- what I said 4 earlier that MBP is not externa lly displayed on coils 5 of myelin. It's internally on a cytoplasmic aspect of 6 the coils of myelin. So it may be that when you are 7 laying down new myelin maybe yo u expose it. This is 8 all speculation on my part. 9 Q And I understand that . I appreciate the 10 fact that you're allowing for t he uncertainty of what 11 might be going on here. 12 The question though c omes back to if new 13 myelin is being laid down, if m yelin sheath is being 14 reconstructed in the brain, one would need to assume 15 that something damaged or destr oyed the myelin in the 16 first place in order to initiat e or requiring a 17 healing process. Isn't that co rrect? 18 A I would assume so. 19 Q So something would ha ve had to happen in the 20 brain for these anti-MBPs to be present somehow? 21 A I'm not sure exactly where you're going with 22 the question, but if you're try ing to imply that there 23 is some myelin damage that init iated this response, 24 I'll have to defer to those lik e Dr. Wiznitzer who 25 knows a lot more than I do abou t the neuropathology of Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 52 of 289 606 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 ASD. 2 But my understanding is that myelin damage 3 has not been an impressive find ing in the limited 4 number of, you know, autopsy or other pathologic 5 sources of information about th e abnormalities in ASD. 6 Q Yes, and I wasn't eve n speaking specifically 7 of ASD. It was just the curios ity of whether if you 8 have, again, evidence of anti-M BPs, there are at least 9 postulates that might be part o f the healing 10 process -- 11 A I should tell you bef ore I -- 12 Q Please let me -- I wi ll have a question. 13 But if you have evidence of ant i-MBP production in the 14 body and you've explained that that's a result of 15 damage to the myelin sheath, so some people have said 16 it might be part of the healing process, my question I 17 think is relatively simple. Do esn't that require that 18 some sort of damage to myelin m ust have occurred at 19 some point? And I'm not asking you to limit it to a 20 particular cause, but doesn't i t mean there has to 21 have been some damage to myelin in the brain? 22 A No, because I said at the very beginning 23 that myelin damage appears to b e the most common one 24 would describe, but not the onl y one, and I'll give 25 you a concrete example of that. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 53 of 289 607A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 Q And again, let me -- you answered the 2 question. Allow me then to nar row that question. I 3 said would it necessarily mean. Based on your answer, 4 it's the most common. So it is more likely than not 5 that -- 6 A I'll give you a scien tific answer. I'll not 7 give you a legal one. 8 Q Well, actually when y ou say \"common\" -- 9 A No, it -- 10 Q Explain to me what yo u mean by it's the most 11 common reason. 12 A I'll give you an exam ple of where it's not. 13 One group has reported that whe n they find anti-MBP 14 antibodies, this is highly sugg estive that it's due to 15 homology with certain bacteria chlamydia for example, 16 and even they found homology in those cases with serum 17 reacting against cow's milk com ponents. Maybe that's 18 the stimulus for the production of anti-MBP 19 antibodies. It has nothing to do with myelin 20 destruction, and that's a recor d, I think, that's been 21 filed in this case. 22 MR. POWERS: It has. Well, I don't have any 23 further questions but before I step down, Special 24 Master, I do want to note one t hing that I am a little 25 troubled by.

So I just want to 7 raise it as a flag here that I hope that Respondent's 8 experts are not going to be put up here to be talking 9 about things that would be prec luded by your 10 prehearing order, and I think w e bumped up really 11 close against that line on this direct. 12 THE COURT: I'm not f ollowing you. My 13 prehearing order was designed t o ask the parties to 14 call to my attention articles t hat had been filed but 15 that had not been referenced in particular expert 16 reports. I think the Fujinami article had actually 17 been filed in Cedillo, and then refiled here. But the 18 new article is here. 19 In other words, don't give me a list of 150 20 new articles without having a r eference to them in the 21 expert's opinion or something e lse that you filed to 22 tell me why it's significant. 23 MR. POWERS: So just because you have an 24 expert report three years ago c iting articles to then 25 be pulling in phone conversatio ns and things like that Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 56 of 289 609A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 to sort of bolster those articl es, I know the Rules of 2 Evidence don't apply, but I jus t raise that as an 3 issue of concern that expert te stimony be within the 4 scope of the materials that hav e been filed, and the 5 reports that have been filed. 6 THE WITNESS: Special Master, may I respond 7 to that? 8 THE COURT: I would b e happy to hear what 9 you have to say, Doctor. 10 THE WITNESS: Thank y ou. In the first 11 place, so far as the Weible art icle, I filed that as 12 part of my report, and the reas on why I mentioned my 13 telephone conversation with Dr. Weible is that the 14 Petitioner has repeatedly raise d the Weible report as 15 an example where Colten Snyder' s case would fit in 16 within the framework of that re port, and I thought it 17 would be helpful to the Court t o give the comments of 18 the first author of that report about whether or not 19 this was similar or not. 20 Now, if that went bey ond the bounds, I don't 21 know, but I'm just saying that' s the truth as I know. 22 THE COURT: Well, and I know the Weible 23 report was also cited by Dr. Wa rd and discussed by 24 him. 25 No, I don't consider it to be out of bounds Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 57 of 289 610 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 particularly given that we've h ad considerable 2 discussion of that report. My concern is that I do 3 not want to have happen in this case what happened in 4 Cedillo, at the last day, the l ast hour of the last 5 day of trial we're handed a med ical journal article 6 that no one had ever seen befor e, and witnesses are 7 being asked to comment on it. 8 I do not want trial b y ambush. So if an 9 article has been referred to or discussed by a 10 witness, whether on the stand o r in an expert report, 11 that is, your witness discusses the Weible article 12 even if Dr. Zweiman had not pre viously mentioned it, 13 he would be free to discuss tha t article as well if 14 his understanding of it were di fferent from that of 15 another witness. 16 What I did not want i s somebody dumping 17 textbooks of 18 or 20 inches a part and citing the 18 textbook merely and not telling me what part -- or 19 anyone else -- what part of tha t textbook supported 20 their opinion, nor did I want p eople attaching 20 or 21 30 or 40 articles to an expert opinion citing only six 22 of them in the opinion, and the n expecting to walk 23 into the courtroom and all of u s having read the other 24 40. I like to read the article s before the witnesses 25 testify about them so I have an understanding of Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 58 of 289 611 ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 whether their testimony matches up with my reading of 2 the article, and so that's wher e we stand. 3 I have certainly read and digested the 4 Weible article. I asked questi ons about it yesterday. 5 So Weible is certainly fair gam e. 6 If we get to somethin g that's been out there 7 that nobody has mentioned but s uddenly becomes the 8 crucial article in the case, an d if that is the 9 intention of anyone out there, bring it to our 10 attention now. No trial by amb ush. 11 It's very difficult f or me then to have to 12 go back and read the article an d not have any experts 13 I can ask questions about it to ensure that my 14 understanding comports with tha t of the people who are 15 trained in that field. Clear? 16 Don't get me wrong, M r. Powers. I 17 appreciate your raising the con cern, but that was not 18 what I intended by the pretrial order, to say that if 19 you are going to file new stuff reference it, talk 20 about it.

They are not particularly tricky or 3 difficult. They are just to en sure that I understand 4 what we're talking about. 5 As I hear your testim ony you are saying the 6 46 finding of anti-myelin basic protein in Colten 7 appears to you to have no parti cular significance. 8 THE WITNESS: I would use the term of 9 uncertain significance. 10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 THE WITNESS: And it' s very puzzling to me 12 in view of the fact that the se rum obtained two months 13 later was completely negative, and subsequent analyses 14 have shown that the levels wher e he was slightly 15 elevated or were normal. Both run in the same 16 laboratory that obtained the 46 value. 17 THE COURT: Okay. 18 THE WITNESS: To say something happened 19 clinically that were different, certainly the one from 20 two months later, at least in m y perusal of the record 21 it was hard for me to distingui sh if things had 22 changed that dramatically, so I 'm not sure what that 23 46 meant. 24 THE COURT: Well, we have the first finding 25 of 46 anti-myelin basic protein antibodies to myelin Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 60 of 289 612B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 basic protein in January of 200 0.

There is a 15 serum sample drawn on 3-8-00 th at is sent to Dr. 16 Singh. 17 THE WITNESS: Right. 18 THE COURT: And that would be Petitioners' 19 Exhibit 207, page 1. Unfortuna tely, those were some 20 of the labs that didn't make it into my chart. So 21 that may have been taken again at the same time. 22 THE WITNESS: That wa s -- 23 THE COURT: At the be ginning of the IVIG. 24 Then there are subsequent IVIG tests -- excuse me -- 25 subsequent IVIG administration and subsequent myelin Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 62 of 289 614A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 basic protein results which ten d to be negative or low 2 range. I think there is one th at's isolated at 14. 3 So what would happen then if this specimen 4 is in fact taken before the adm inistration of IVIG? 5 Why did we have a drop from 46 to negative in a period 6 of two or three months? 7 THE WITNESS: The dif ference between January 8 result of 46 from Specialty Lab s and the negative 9 results of Dr. Singh's lab bein g the specimen of March 10 8th, is a puzzlement. 11 There was, as best as I could tell, nothing 12 going on therapeutically in tha t interval that would 13 have converted an otherwise str ong positive to a 14 negative result. 15 THE COURT: Would Sec retin in -- 16 THE WITNESS: I don't think that would. 17 THE COURT: Okay. 18 THE WITNESS: If you' re asking me does IVIG 19 therapy, would that convert a l aboratory test, one 20 aspect I already alluded to and that is that one has 21 to know when to draw a blood sp ecimen and that should 22 be at least three to four weeks after the last IVIG 23 administration to avoid any art ifactual effects on it. 24 I cannot tell you how the timing was of 25 those specimens, and the IVIG a dministration. So I Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 63 of 289 615A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 cannot comment about that. 2 THE COURT: Well, let me ask a question this 3 way then. Would you expect tha t IVIG would be an 4 appropriate therapy to treat MB P antibody level that 5 was high? 6 THE WITNESS: No, it is not -- in the first 7 place, I should say, that, and this may not be exactly 8 an answer to your question -- t hat the recent 9 consensus report, and I'm not t rying to throw 10 something new to you, but this just came out, the 11 recent consensus report from a group of experts in 12 Canada about indications for th e treatment of 13 neurologic disease with intrave nous IG did not 14 recommend the use of IVIG in au tism. 15 In direct answer to y our question would I 16 use IVIG to decrease the level of anti-MBP antibodies, 17 I would not use that as a marke r of whether I'm going 18 to use IVIG therapy or not. 19 The measurement of pa rticularly anti-MOG 20 antibodies is recently reported as a possible 21 indication for other types of t reatment of multiple 22 sclerosis, but it did not menti on intravenous IG 23 therapy. 24 THE COURT: How long does it take, let's say 25 after an event that might trigg er the production of Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 64 of 289 615B ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 anti-myelin basic protein antib odies to having those Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 65 of 289 616A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 antibodies show up in blood or CSF? 2 THE WITNESS: It's di fficult to say with 3 certainty because there has not been systematic 4 sequential studies, but my supp osition based on what I 5 have read is within say two to three weeks, something 6 like that. 7 THE COURT: Okay. An d once elevated, do 8 MBPs stay elevated or are they cyclical? 9 THE WITNESS: They ar e variable, remembering 10 that when you measure the serum you're measuring it, 11 if you will, in some distance, anatomic distance from 12 where the presumed action if yo u're postulating it's 13 some event in the central nervo us system. You have 14 heard from others that there is a blood brain or blood 15 CNS barrier that keeps the plas ma protein systemic 16 compartment away from the compa rtment within the 17 nervous system so that, if you will, what you're 18 measuring in the serum is comin g sort of indirectly 19 from what is coming say from th e nervous system. 20 So that it's not surp rising that one could 21 find variable levels of anti-MB P antibodies. It's not 22 a constant from week to wwek an d from month to month. 23 THE COURT: So I take it from your 24 testimony, Doctor, that you don 't consider that there 25 is any treatment necessary for an elevated myelin Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 66 of 289 617A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 basic protein and that it is no t a marker for guiding 2 other treatment? 3 THE WITNESS: By itse lf, if that was the 4 only thing that was present, it certainly in my 5 opinion would not warrant treat ment for that. 6 I mentioned a few min utes ago in certain 7 settings there is suggestive ev idence that the 8 presence of an anti-MBP, and pa rticularly anti-MOG, 9 that's a myelin oligodendrocyte s protein antibodies, 10 it might be a marker of potenti al problem in multiple 11 sclerosis. There is a recent r eport in the New 12 England Journal of Medicine tha t pointed that out as a 13 possibility. 14 But just to use anti- MBP as an indication of 15 treatment would not be warrante d, in my opinion. 16 THE COURT: Did any o f Colten's tests 17 suggest to you that he had a se rious immune 18 deficiency, and if so, when? 19 THE WITNESS: I did n ot see any evidence 20 that he had a serious immune de ficiency as evidenced 21 by either the pattern or severi ty or frequency of 22 bacterial infections, or unusua l infections. 23 I should mention, by the way, if this is 24 helpful, that in wild virus, wi ld measles virus 25 infection the suppression of im munity is mainly Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 67 of 289 618A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 directed against cell-mediated immunity, not antibody 2 production immunity. I believe I alluded to that 3 earlier. 4 Dr. Diane Griffin des cribed it very well in 5 her testimony in the Cedillo ca se, and as I told with 6 the individuals who get the mea sles vaccine, in our 7 experience these people were pe rfectly healthy, had no 8 increased incidence of infectio ns during the time when 9 there was a decrease in their d elay in 10 hypersensitivity with cell-medi ated immunity. 11 THE COURT: There are medical tests that 12 show Colten had an elevated IgE levels several times. 13 What does that tell you? 14 THE WITNESS: As I co mmented in one of my 15 reports, there was a single det ermination and a very 16 high level, although some indiv iduals have reported 17 increased serum IgE in some ind ividuals who have ASD. 18 The levels reported here are st rikingly elevated, and 19 I commented in my report that t his appears to have not 20 been followed up on but that wa s certainly warranted 21 because in the absence of any s kin manifestations of a 22 topic dermatitis or other reaso n for the IgE being so 23 high one would want to make sur e that the child did 24 not have a parasitic infection that could be 25 responsible possibly for chroni c diarrhea that was Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 68 of 289 619A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 described in his case. 2 However, I did not se e results of a repeat 3 serum IgE. This does not mean that he was 4 immunodeficient. There is a co ndition called hyper, 5 H-Y-P-E-R, IgE syndrome, or som e people call it the 6 JOB's, J-O-B apostrophe S, synd rome named after the 7 figure in the Bible, but these individuals have a 8 particular pattern of infection which was not present 9 in Colten, and therefore I thin k it's unlikely that 10 that is a reason for the quite elevated IgE level in 11 this case. But I think the fir st step would be 12 obviously to have it repeated t he test repeated. 13 THE COURT: So that's what you would expect 14 a doctor who got those serum re sults to do? 15 THE WITNESS: I do. If I had seen that, I 16 certainly would have had it rep eated. 17 THE COURT: All right . After repeating it 18 if it's still high, what would you do? 19 THE WITNESS: Investi gate for parasitic 20 infection, number one. The chi ld had, and I may be 21 going yet beyond the bounds of my expertise, but what 22 was commented yesterday about t he reports on 23 intestinal biopsy, the child ha d, it sounds like 24 impressive numbers, and I would want to have an 25 experienced pathologist look at that, but there is a Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 69 of 289 620A ZWEIMAN - CROSS 1 condition called -- I have to s pell this one out -- 2 eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

I think 21 you mentioned that the administ ration of IVIG through 22 a dilution process may have som e effect on lowering 23 anti-MBP levels. Did I underst and that correctly? 24 A If a specimen is obta ined within three to 25 four weeks after the IVIG admin istration, obviously Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 70 of 289 621A ZWEIMAN - REDIRECT 1 depending what dose of IVIG use d, but I'm making 2 assumptions that it's a sizable dose of IVIG. 3 Q So knowing that, if y ou're going to take a 4 serum sample and send it for te sting for anti-MBP 5 levels, it wouldn't make sense to do that following 6 the administration of IVIG, you would want to do that 7 beforehand, is that accurate? 8 A Well, before and afte r for an individual who 9 is getting IVIG on a regular ba sis. What the usual 10 practice is in people who use I VIG therapy on is if 11 they do an assay, a serum marke r of the disease, or in 12 the case of immunodeficient to measure total IVIG 13 levels, you always obtain a spe cimen at least three or 14 four weeks after the last infus ion, and it's typically 15 done right as you're putting th e needle in to 16 administer the IVIG. You get a serum specimen at that 17 time, a blood specimen, and the n hook up the IVIG 18 therapy. 19 Q And you do that becau se you're trying to get 20 the most accurate reading? 21 A You're trying to get what is the reflection 22 of the person's own biology. 23 Q Okay. 24 A And not donated by or affected by the IG 25 that's being administered.

I 4 thought you meant when does one seeing production of 5 the anti-MBP response, and that would be within 6 several weeks, I believe, maybe somewhat longer before 7 one sees appearance of that in CSF/serum. 8 THE COURT: And detec tible levels? 9 THE WITNESS: Detecti ble levels except in 10 the serum, it might be several weeks after that 11 because of some of the factors I mentioned. You have 12 a point source of production of it, and the fusion 13 away from that area, so it migh t be -- this is 14 speculation on my part because I have not studied this 15 myself, but you know, it could be up to six weeks, 16 something like that. 17 BY MR.

Do you Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 86 of 289 632A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 agree with that? 2 A Yes, he did. 3 Q Doctor Kinsbourne, du ring his examination 4 yesterday, talked about letharg y as one of the first 5 signs of autism that he noted. Do you agree with Dr. 6 Kinsbourne's assessment on the issue of lethargy? 7 A No. May I explain? 8 Q Please do. 9 A Dr. Kinsbourne repres ented to the Court, and 10 I'm going to paraphrase his wor ds, that in his opinion 11 the description of lethargy as given over the Memorial 12 Day weekend in 1998 -- it may h ave been at least the 13 Monday of Memorial Day, then th e following day, the 14 Tuesday is when I think it was when Colten Snyder was 15 actually admitted to the hospit al -- that there was a 16 description of Colten Snyder be ing lethargic, and Dr. 17 Kinsbourne stated that lethargy could be a 18 misinterpretation of the beginn ing of the social 19 withdrawal or the inward in-tur ning as the words that 20 he used to describe the social behavior of a child 21 with autism. 22 However, the formal d efinition of lethargy 23 and I'm quite familiar with it because when we do 24 EEGs, which I do on a weekly ba sis, that's one of our 25 diagnostic codes that we use wi thin the EEG reading, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 87 of 289 633A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 the formal definition of lethar gy is actually an 2 impairment in consciousness. I n other words, you're 3 not fully alert and awake. Let hargy means that there 4 is a mild diminution or decreas e in your level of 5 consciousness, but you're still able to be aroused. 6 You're still able to be respons ive, but if I leave you 7 alone, you will go back down to that decreased level 8 of consciousness. 9 By definition, a decr eased level of 10 consciousness is not part of th e diagnostic criteria 11 of any autistic spectrum disord er. In fact, if there 12 were an impairment in conscious ness in a child, we 13 would be looking for alternate diagnoses. Therefore, 14 the use of the word \"lethargy\" to define the social 15 behavior of a child with autism is not really the 16 appropriate word to use. 17 Q Based on what was goi ng on with Colten at 18 the time, is there in your mind a more likely 19 explanation for the cause of hi s lethargy? 20 A Yes, there is. 21 Q What is that? 22 A The medical records t ell us that he clearly 23 had a viral illness, and the me dical records also 24 document that he showed clinica l evidence of 25 dehydration, the description th at was given there, and Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 88 of 289 634A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 one of the things we know is th at when he was put in 2 the hospital he was given IV hy dration. He was 3 discharged, he was described as awake, and obviously, 4 you can't be awake and lethargi c at the same time 5 which means at that point there was a significant 6 improvement in his level of con sciousness, back to the 7 level that you would expect it to be, otherwise he 8 wouldn't have been discharged f rom the hospital, and 9 that is inconsistent with the b ehavior that you would 10 see of the social changes, the social behavior in 11 autism where once it starts it will become clinically 12 evident. It doesn't go away in two days. 13 Q Doctor, we have alrea dy talked about the 14 Weibel article a little bit thi s morning, and how that 15 has been used in support by Pet itioners to support the 16 idea that Colten somehow fit th e framework that's 17 outlined in the Weibel article. 18 Have you had an oppor tunity to review the 19 Weibel article? 20 A Yes, I have. 21 Q And can you just desc ribe your understanding 22 of the framework that's set out in the Weibel article? 23 A If you will just give me one second because 24 I know I have it in here. 25 (Pause.)

They 5 looked at the children, but the y had exclusionary 6 criteria in that paper, and if you read the methods 7 section the exclusionary criter ia was that the authors 8 did not accept a case if there was an alternate 9 explanation for the features th at were present at that 10 time. 11 Clearly in Colten Sny der's case the events 12 that occurred around Memorial D ay of 1998, the medical 13 records tell us that there is a n alternate 14 explanation. He had an acute v iral infection with 15 fever with pharyngitis, and wit h dehydration, and 16 basically when he was treated h e improved. This is 17 not a case that would have been accepted within the 18 criteria as defined in that pap er. 19 Q Doctor, there have be en a number of videos 20 that have been provided by the Snyder family. Have 21 you had an opportunity to revie w those videos? 22 A Yes, I have. 23 Q Can you just describe generally for the 24 record what is on those videos? 25 A What was provided to me was videos of Colten Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 90 of 289 636A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 Snyder, and of course we also h ave other members of 2 his family, starting at age thr ee weeks to age 13 3 months.

When one bas ically watched Colten 2 Snyder in action during this ti me period either he 3 doesn't make any sounds, he scr eeches, he makes some 4 nonspecific noises, and he extr emely rarely says 5 either ba, ma, or maybe a two-s yllable sound like a 6 baba or mama, but it's not a lo t. There is no 7 interpersonal babbling that I c an see. 8 In other words, there is plenty of 9 opportunities, his siblings com e up and talk to him, 10 he doesn't talk back to them in the way a baby would. 11 He doesn't seem to sustain any kind of a language 12 interaction that's there, and w hat's most impressive 13 to me -- actually one of the po ints that's impressive 14 to me on the video is that we h ave the opportunity to 15 have a - if you want to thin of it as a control, and 16 if I may identify, there is a p ortion of the video 17 when he is seven months old whe re there is another 18 child going around his playpen, basically babbling, 19 and it's not Colten, because wh en we look at Colten, 20 you watch his mouth, it's not m oving, and I played 21 that section back multiple time s, but there is another 22 baby who is basically making a lot of baby noises 23 around there, and this is not t he behavior that Colten 24 manifests anytime in the video, whether it's at seven 25 months, whether it's at 11 mont hs, which is Christmas Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 92 of 289 638A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 time, whether it's at 13 months when we're taping him 2 here. 3 He looks at the camer a, he plays with the 4 camera lens cover multiple time s. He has inconsistent 5 responses to voice. Sometimes when he was called he 6 responds, sometimes he doesn't, and what I take from 7 that, because I also have evide nce afterwards of his 8 language that's given to us, an d just for people to 9 reference things, and I will re ference the points for 10 you, the one at seven months is basically on what's 11 called Title 6 on the video, an d it's part of what's 12 called Chapter 2 if anyone wish es to look at that, but 13 later on when looking at in por tions of the video you 14 can look at Title 9, Title 10, Title 11, Title 12, no 15 babbling. Title 13, no babblin g. Title 14, no 16 babbling. 17 He does make during t hese times -- for 18 instance in Title 12 he makes s ome nonspecific sounds, 19 but again there is just no babb ling. That just raises 20 a concern to me that there is a n underlying problem 21 with language. 22 Q And did you see anyth ing in the medical 23 records that caused you to thin k that or that 24 corroborated what you saw in th e videos? 25 A Yes, I did.

In ot her words, there's data 6 telling us that this happens. 7 Q And do kids respond e ither better or worse 8 to speech therapy based on thei r intelligence or 9 intellectual capabilities? 10 A Well, I thought that the speech therapist 11 gave a wonderful quote, and I'm going to again 12 paraphrase her, that with the a ppropriate intervention 13 children improve to their own i ntellectual and 14 cognitive abilities, and that i s basically the mantra 15 that we try to push; that if yo u do the appropriate 16 intervention children hopefully will get to the point 17 that they were supposed to get to. 18 Obviously in Colten S nyder it was a very 19 good point that he got to, and I'm glad that he did, 20 so that it does not surprise me the gains that were 21 present had occurred, did occur . 22 Q And just so I'm under standing you, are you 23 saying that his great improveme nt is based in part on 24 his excellent intellectual capa bilities? 25 // Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 97 of 289 642A WIZNITZER - DIRECT 1 A In part, it's based o n what he has available 2 to him; in other words, where h is cognitive potential 3 is. He clearly has a cognitive potential to be in the 4 normal range, and he showed tha t, that that was there, 5 and that's important because if cognitively you are 6 destined to have an IQ of 50, y ou can do all the 7 therapy that you wish and you'r e not going to get to 8 an IQ of 125. 9 And while we look at the records, and in the 10 records you can see that there is testing done 11 initially which shows that he d oes not have good 12 skills, this is the typical pat tern of kids with ASD. 13 First of all, the cog nitive testing that was 14 done is limited because of leve ls of cooperation that 15 were present so you can't get t he best picture in the 16 world. 17 Secondly, all that th at testing tells us is 18 where his language is at that p oint in time, where his 19 function is at that point in ti me. It does not 20 necessarily tell us where he is going to end up two, 21 three, four years from now. It tells you where you 22 need to start your intervention , and I think that his 23 situation explains it very well because we see there 24 is good growth in his developme ntal skills and his 25 language skills from at least J uly 1999 onward.

Obviously we had a 3 colloquy on your direct and my cross during the 4 Cedillo case, and I do want to follow up on maybe a 5 couple of issues that were addr essed in Cedillo that 6 were not covered today, but I w ill primarily focus on 7 your expert report and the dire ct testimony that you 8 have given here today. 9 I first want to talk a little bit about your 10 expert report. Early on in the report you talk about 11 some identifiable biologic unde rpinnings. Do you 12 recall that portion of your rep ort? 13 A Can you show it to me where it is? 14 Q Yes. Well, yes, it's on page 1. It's down 15 at the bottom. 16 Q Which report, sir? I have two reports. 17 Q I'm sorry. It's the most recent one. I 18 think it was described as a sup plemental report. 19 That's the one dated September 28, 2007. 20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q Okay. So now that we know the report we're 22 talking about, the page we're t alking about is page 1, 23 and just down there at the bott om there is a 24 discussion that you have about identifiable biologic 25 underpinnings. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 100 of 289 645A WIZNITZER - CROSS 1 Now, you list marker chromosome 15 syndrome, 2 Fragile X, tuberous sclerosis, and then certain in- 3 born errors of metabolism. I w as just curious what 4 you were referring to by certai n in-bred errors of 5 metabolism. 6 A The classic one is un treated 7 phenylketonuria, or PKU. 8 Q PKU. 9 A That's the classic. There is a 10 representation that some childr en with mitochondrial 11 disorders also will have an aut istic spectrum disorder 12 phenotype, so that's basically two groups. 13 Q Are there any others? 14 A There are some others , but whether it's 15 directly linked to autism or wh ether it's just because 16 of the severe impairment in cog nition that's present 17 that they also show autistic fe atures is less well 18 defined. 19 Q Again, the reason tha t it's less well 20 defined is that there are other morbidities associated 21 with the condition that are bey ond what you would find 22 in ASD? 23 A No. The more you hav e -- the more retarded 24 you are the more likely you are to just show autistic 25 features, even if you don't hav e autism.

Are these underpinnings, b iologic underpinnings, 6 are these genetically based, th e ones that you list 7 here? 8 A Yes. 9 Q So they are pretty mu ch genetically 10 determinative. If one has mark er chromosome 15 11 syndrome, one would be autistic , would fall in the ASD 12 -- 13 A No. You may be autis tic. 14 Q You may be autistic. 15 A Yes, there is more to it than just that. 16 Thans just having marker chromo some 15. 17 Q Okay. But marker chr omosome 15 is an 18 entirely genetic issue? 19 A Yes, it is. 20 Q For the ones that you list here in this 21 sentence about the disorders th at begin with marker 22 chromosome 15 syndrome, are the re any environmental 23 contributions that would be a b iological underpinning 24 to the presentation of ASD in c hildren with any of 25 those disorders?

It 's really linked more 15 to the early onset of seizures which is not 16 environmental in itself. It's due to the underlying 17 condition. 18 Q Yes. So the seizures are caused by the 19 underlying condition, and the s eizures then can create 20 the conditions under which one might be autistic? 21 A Well, it's more compl icated than that. 22 Q I was afraid it was. 23 A But there is an assoc iation. 24 Q Okay, thank you.

You describe Thalid omide, rubella or 3 cytomegalovirus. Are there any other in utero 4 exposures that you identify as a biological 5 underpinning to ASD? 6 A I know there is a few more. I don't recall 7 what they are off the top of my head. 8 Q Aside from what you'v e listed here in total 9 in this paragraph, are there an y other identifiable 10 biological underpinnings? 11 A There is a gigantic l ist, sir.

It's illustrative. 22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q If you added up all t he biological 24 underpinnings, the ones you hav e listed, the multitude 25 of ones that are out there, is there a way that you Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 105 of 289 649A WIZNITZER - CROSS 1 can identify among all children with autism spectrum 2 disorders what percentage of th ose autism spectrum 3 disorders are caused by this en tire constellation of 4 identifiable biological underpi nnings? 5 A The number that's pro ffered nowadays where 6 you can do testing or there is testing available in 7 order to identify it is probabl y as a minimal estimate 8 25 to 30 percent. 9 Q And that estimate of 25 to 30 percent, is 10 that an estimate that you agree with? 11 A Yes. It depends obvi ously on the child. In 12 other words, if I have a child who comes in with 13 significant cognitive impairmen t, mental retardation 14 is the relative term for that. If there were obvious 15 more features, the number is mu ch higher. Yet even in 16 children who don't show those b ecause of advances in 17 technology we are finding more and more genetic 18 underpinnings that are identifi able. 19 Q And that was actually a question I was going 20 to ask. Has that percentage go ne up over time? 21 A Yes, it has. 22 Q Okay. 23 A And it's expected to go up even more as some 24 of the identifiable causes from the lab, if you want 25 to say it that way, are transfe rred into the clinical Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 106 of 289 650A WIZNITZER - CROSS 1 arena and the testing is made a vailable to the general 2 practitioner. 3 Q And so the identified biological 4 underpinnings in 25 to 30 perce nt range, are those 5 essentially genetic contributio ns to the appearance of 6 autism spectrum disorders? 7 A Yes, and that does no t account, for 8 instance, the rare cases of cut omegalo virus, or I 9 don't think we have seen congen itally developed, at 10 least I haven't seen it in two decades. 11 Q Well, yes, and I wasn 't trying -- 12 A No, no, I -- 13 Q -- about that. 14 A Outside of things lik e prenatal viral 15 illness, we're talking about pu re genetic. 16 Q Exactly. 17 A Yes, that would proba bly be a reasonable 18 number. At this point in time the number will go up. 19 Q Do you expect that nu mber to reach 100 20 percent? 21 A I don't think anythin g reaches 100 percent, 22 and let me explain why. That e ven if we state with 23 certainty that you know that so mething is a genetic 24 underpinning, it does not mean that we have the 25 technology available to prove t he exact genetic Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 107 of 289 651A WIZNITZER - CROSS 1 disorder, the exact genetic pro blem. 2 Q And when you say \"und erpinning,\" are you 3 using that in the same sense as the word \"cause\"? 4 A Yes. 5 Q So when we're talking about the biological 6 underpinnings to autism spectru m disorders, we're 7 talking about identifiable biol ogical causes? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q And at this point it' s your testimony that 10 we have identified -- we -- I s ay that as a lawyer -- 11 as a doctor, I should be saying it as a doctor you all 12 have identified that 25 to 30 p ercent of ASDs can be 13 related to these identifiable c auses, and aside from 14 Thalidomide, rubella or cytomeg alovirus, they are 15 pretty much all genetic. Is th at a fair statement? 16 A Yes. There is probab ly some in-utero 17 exposures that makes contributi ons, but we know the 18 ones such as Thalidomide. Peop le talk about the 19 contribution of things like val proate, especially in 20 animal models, and perhaps some human data. There is 21 other data suggesting some asso ciations but no proven 22 causation at the present time, but I expect that there 23 very well may be some -- we'll say acquired in utero 24 phenomena that would cause the autism.

Not by itself, no. 6 Q What do you mean by \" not by itself\"? 7 A Well, there is data t elling us that there 8 are some epilepsies that presen t very early on, second 9 year of life, third year of lif e, that will have 10 autistic phenotype and that wit h intervention and with 11 treatment of the epilepsy you c an basically make the 12 autistic phenotype disappear. In my own practice, I 13 have a handful of children who have been successful 14 with this kind of management. 15 I don't know that the re is any proven 16 certainty of any postnatal expo sure by itself that 17 will cause an autistic spectrum disorder. 18 Q Do you believe that t here are postnatal 19 environmental exposures that in the presence of a 20 genetic anomaly might cause aut ism spectrum disorders? 21 A Well, let's not use t he word anamoly 22 Q What word are you com fortable with? 23 A Well, I think when pe ople talk about this, 24 they say a genetic predispositi on, or genetic 25 difference, whatever terminolog y you want to use.

I have read a 14 lot of articles, and all it tur ns out to be is 15 personal opinions with no data, and it's a problem 16 when people do this. I don't k now if in science 17 whether that is always the righ t thing to do. All you 18 want to do is give your persona l opinion and because 19 of your name it carries some we ight.

But the 3 thing is we know that that's ge netic, and there is a 4 group of individuals, probably an additional 5 percent 5 or so, some people quote a high er number, I'm being 6 conservative, there is an addit ional 5 percent that 7 you can add to the other number that I gave you before 8 that clearly fall within that g roup, then in addition 9 to that we've got the larger fa mily unit of what's 10 called the broader phenotype wh ere there clearly are 11 the relatives -- might be that there is an 12 idiosyncratic cousin or uncle w here you may not have 13 full-blown features but enough that we call it the 14 broader phenotype, and there is increased risk also 15 shown further and children with autism that would not 16 be surprising because there see ms to be something 17 running in that family that see ms to be genetically- 18 based, and that adds an additio nal number.

There were no 19 words. There were some syllabl es that you could count 20 on one hand the number of times that you document 21 despite interactions with multi ple individuals, 22 interaction by multiple individ uals in the 23 environment. So there was just no -- nothing. 24 Q And that's based on y our review of the 25 videos?

Do you recall that test imony? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Word use of vocabular y between 15 and 20 10 words by the age of 13 months. 11 A Fifteen months. 12 Q Fifteen months, yes, we're talking about 13 your view of the video is 13 mo nths. 14 A Yes, sir. 15 Q By 15 months, 15 to 2 0 words, is that in the 16 range of appropriate vocalizati on? 17 A If the words are used for functional 18 purposes, the answer is yes. 19 Q And as you sit here t oday, you don't know 20 one way or the other whether th ey were used 21 functionally as you would just describe it? 22 A Assume that that hist ory is accurate, yeah, 23 I don't know. 24 Q And so what you then see is the use of two 25 to three words at 13 months.

I he ard some syllables, a 5 ba, a ma, and a baha. If you p lay back the video and 6 watch it, and you're welcome to do so, sir, you will 7 notice that there is no real sy llabic babbling or 8 polysyllabic or multisyllabic b abbling such as I would 9 expect in a child of that age. 10 Q So a child at the age of 13 months then, two 11 months later is being described as having between 15 12 and 20 words. 13 A It's interesting, the description is the 14 description we heard in the cou rtroom in 2007, the 15 description is not what's docum ented in the medical 16 records of 1998. 17 Q You then went on to t alk about the lack of 18 words, at this point two to thr ee words and language 19 arrest that were noted in the r eports of Dr. Otegbeye 20 and his developmental referral, and then by Dr. 21 Bradstreet's initial intake. 22 A Dr. Otegbeye did not st ate anything about 23 language arrest. Dr. Otegbeye just basically 24 documented a three-word vocabul ary, and this would 25 have been at age 17 months.

And more i mportant, Dr. Otegbeye 3 did not document any history th at was given of a loss 4 of language. 5 Q And the fact that he didn't write it down, 6 the lack of any note of his is not dispositive as to 7 whether it had actually occurre d or not. 8 A Well, I would agree t hat one note would be 9 telling, but when you look at t he note from the week 10 before on the nursing admission to the hospital when 11 he was admitted on May 26th, th ere is no documentation 12 in the nursing admission of any loss of language 13 either. 14 Q And he was going to D r. Otegbeye for the 15 possibility of juvenile rheumat oid arthritis. Is that 16 one of the bases for the referr al? 17 A Yes, sir. 18 Q So it's conceivable t hat on intake they were 19 not asking questions related to the entire history of 20 this child's communication and language histories? 21 A I was impressed that he actually took a 22 history of development, and I t hink at that time it 23 would be an opportunity that if there was a concern 24 about the loss of skills, it wo uld have been 25 articulated.

I think everyone 5 would agree. They are allowed to get colds not, it's 6 caused by the autism. They are allowed to have 7 allergies that are not caused b y the autism. They are 8 allowed to have food intoleranc es that are not related 9 to autism, and we can keep goin g on and on.

There is two possible 2 reasons. One is it could be a placebo effect. If you 3 look at the Levy's work in Phil adelphia, she actually 4 documented the placebo effect t hat Secretin engendered 5 in the population because she w ent back and 6 interviewed parents about this later on. 7 We also saw a placebo effect in the work 8 that we did. Parents want to s ee improvement, or the 9 child was showing improvements from the natural 10 history of the disorder -- we'r e talking about the 11 autism -- that were proscribed a treatment that was 12 done temporally at the same tim e. 13 Now, I'm not talking at all about Secretin 14 doing something for your bowel, or if you have some 15 diarrhea illness and Secretin. I'm talking about 16 treating actually the autism it self. 17 Q Which then brings me back to this definition 18 of core symptoms. So the core symptoms of autism 19 would be those symptoms that gi ve rise to a diagnostic 20 conclusion across one of those three domains? 21 A Yes, sir. 22 Q So it would be your t estimony that none of 23 the treatments that are elicite d here that you 24 describe have any effect on the core symptoms? 25 A None, and if I also m ay state, for chelation Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 145 of 289 678A WIZNITZER - CROSS 1 therapy there is no data one wa y or the other to state 2 whether it does or doesn't do a nything, and number 3 two, there is not good biologic model to support that 4 the issue of heavy metal, \"pois oning\" or elerated 5 heavy metals in the blood have a causal relationship 6 to autism. 7 When it comes to the issue of IVIG, there is 8 no good data to support its use . There is just no 9 good data.

POWERS: 14 Q Welcome back, Dr. Wiz nitzer. We spent a 15 good chunk of the morning, obvi ously, asking a number 16 of questions. I'm going to pic k up with some more 17 questions. 18 At the outset though I did want to go back 19 to an issue that you had talked about before and that 20 was the issue of language delay s and communication 21 delays that you believe were pr esent in Colten Snyder 22 before he received the MMR. Do you recall that line 23 of questioning and discussion? 24 A Yes, sir. 25 Q Do you recall a medic al record that was Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 152 of 289 684A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 created by Dr. Sahai where he a ctually received the 2 MMR, and this is Petitioners' E xhibit 8,115. 3 A 8? 4 Q Yes. It's page 115. I think there are a 5 lot of pages in that exhibit, b ut it's page 115. 6 A Give me a second. Ok ay, what page, 115? 7 Q Right. 8 A I have it. 9 Q Okay. And under \"obj ective\" you do see that 10 Dr. Sahai noted that there were no signs of any 11 receptive language disorders, c orrect? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q So that is a medical chart note reflecting 14 at some point in Colten's devel opment the lack of 15 disorders and at least part of the domain of 16 communications, correct? 17 A That is in the office because that is the 18 objective portion. In the offi ce, that was the 19 observation of Dr. Sahai, yes, exactly. 20 Q And then I hadn't tho ught to ask this 21 before, but up above there the head circumference is 22 the 45th percentile. I know th at there were 23 discussions in the Cedillo case about head 24 circumference and accelerated h ead circumference 25 growth.

It just r eminded me to ask. You 3 don't see any dysmorphologies w ith Colten Snyder based 4 on a review of his records sugg estive of an 5 association with ASD? I saw no thing in your report 6 indicating that. 7 A I wrote nothing about that, but children 8 dysmorphology is not that certa in. Dysmorphology is 9 appearance. 10 Q Yes. I should have me ntioned that in two 11 separate questions. There is n othing about the head 12 circumference to suggest the ra pid growth of the head? 13 A There is no informati on available telling us 14 that there was any kind of acce leration in this case. 15 Q Okay. And since I di dn't see that in the 16 report, we wanted to confirm th at that's not part of 17 your assessment of this case, a nd I saw in the report 18 that there were no notes of any dysmorphology. So you 19 haven't noticed any dysmorpholo gy that would be a 20 basis of your opinions? 21 A I found no comment ab out that. 22 Q I want to now talk ag ain related to this 23 language issue. In your clinic al practice, and this 24 is something we talked about in Cedillo so I don't 25 want to go through it at length , but if you recall, we Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 154 of 289 686A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 discussed a procedure that you use to examine and 2 diagnose children in your pract ice. Do you remember 3 that discussion? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q Specifically, I would just like to ask you, 6 focusing on your diagnostic met hod in your practice 7 for giving an exam to children, what sort of tests do 8 you do to make a decision about communication skills 9 and language development? 10 A Test scoring or just inquiries and 11 assessments? 12 Q I was using the tests , there were test 13 variable, inquiries and assessm ents, questionnaires, 14 whatever it might be. 15 A I take languages -- a nd I think you made a 16 good observation here that on A pril 23, 1998, there is 17 no sign of any receptive langua ge disorders. Mine 18 would actually be documentation in the subjectively 19 historical portion -- what the child's language 20 function is in terms of how man y words this child is 21 using, what kind of words they are, and what the use 22 is, that's number one. 23 Number two is questio ns about comprehension, 24 level of comprehension, sophist ication of 25 comprehension and used specific ally based on ages.

I us ually refer them to our 21 early -- because we're talking about preschooler, I 22 refer them to the early interve ntion team simply 23 because it's a free assessment and they give me the 24 information that I want. If th ey are a little bit 25 older, I get them assessed in t he school system.

You don't do any of 6 that type of workup of Colten S nyder for the obvious 7 reason that you weren't seeing him as a patient, 8 correct? 9 A You're talking about at that time, in 1998? 10 I did not do that in 1998. 11 Q And your review of hi s case and your 12 assessment of his development i s based entirely on the 13 video that you saw, the medical records that you 14 reviewed in their entirety. An ything else that you're 15 basing that on? 16 A No, I'm basing it -- and the testimony that 17 I heard in the court. 18 Q That would include Dr . Bradstreet, Colten's 19 mother, Colten's caregiver and the speech therapist? 20 A And specifically when you mention Dr. 21 Bradstreet because I know that he stated during his 22 testimony how specific he is ab out making sure he gets 23 good and accurate environmental information, and 24 that's what I was pointing out in the mother's 25 questionnaire that the mother f illed out in the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 157 of 289 689A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 office. There are no comments and quotes on the side 2 in the margin that Dr. Bradstre et -- that he's 3 questioning the language histor y that she provided to 4 them. 5 Q Actually, I was just looking to make sure 6 that we understand exactly what you're relying on to 7 provide your opinion, and it so unds like we pretty 8 comprehensively covered that. 9 A Yes, sir. 10 Q Okay. I now want to turn to this issue that 11 you discuss at some length in y our report, your 12 critique so to speak of Dr. Kin sbourne's mechanism, 13 the excitatory and inhibitory m odel that Dr. 14 Kinsbourne describes at length in his report. 15 I see your summary of it and you obviously 16 disagree with the conclusion, b ut I want to go to Dr. 17 Kinsbourne's report, and find o ut from you what 18 elements of that report, specif ically what mechanism 19 that you specifically agree wit h or disagree with. So 20 it might help here if you have -- do you have Dr. 21 Kinsbourne's report? 22 A I'm pulling it out as we speak. 23 Q Let me know when you have that out and I 24 will try to -- 25 THE COURT: And you'r e referring to Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 158 of 289 690A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 Petitioners' Exhibit 29. 2 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma 'am.

If you go to t he very, very bottom of 12 the page there is a fragment of a paragraph, and the 13 first word in that paragraph is \"Glutamate\". 14 So what I want to ask you is do you agree 15 with the statement that Glutama te is the predominant 16 excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and the chief 17 inhibitory neurotransmitter is GABA? 18 A Yes. 19 Q Dr. Kinsbourne then g oes on to say that the 20 balance of the levels between t hese two 21 neurotransmitters is a main fac tor determining the 22 level of excitation/inhibition balance in the brain. 23 Would you agree with that statement? 24 A Yes. 25 Q He then goes on to sa y that the excess Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 160 of 289 692A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 glutamate is harmful, the level s are normally tightly 2 controlled in the synapse. 3 Is that accurate? 4 A Yes. 5 Q He then goes on to sa y further that 6 excessive glutamate flow, on th e other hand, depressed 7 GABA flow can lead to an overex citation and at the 8 local level cytotoxic that can cause brain cells, 9 including neurons, to die. 10 Is that an accurate s tatement? 11 A No. 12 Q What about that state ment do you believe is 13 inaccurate? 14 A Depressed GABA flow i s not really what leads 15 to cell death. It's excessive excitation of 16 glutamine. 17 Q So would it be your b elief that GABA flow -- 18 let's say that glutamate flow r emained the same and 19 GABA flow went down. Would tha t lead to 20 overexcitation? 21 A No. Not overexcitati on of the type that 22 would be cytotoxic. 23 Q Okay. But would you agree with the part of 24 the statement that says \"excess ive glutamate flow 25 would lead to overexcitation -- Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 161 of 289 693 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 A I don't know what flo w means, but we'll say 2 excessive glutamate in the post adaptive region. In 3 other words, too much glutamate that is overexciting 4 the cell, the neuron is specifi cally what we're 5 talking about here, will cause cell death, yes. 6 Q He then goes on to sa y that pyramidal cells 7 are particular vulnerable targe ts for cytotoxic damage 8 due to glutamate. 9 Would you agree with that? 10 A I don't know of any d ata telling me that 11 pyramidal cells are more or les s vulnerable than any 12 other neuron. 13 Q Aside from the presen ce of any data that you 14 may or may not know about, does that sound like a 15 reasonable statement to make me dically? 16 A No, I would just say that the vulnerable 17 targets, and any neuron exposed to excessive amounts 18 of glutamate, in fact, especial ly when they have the 19 problem with glutamate receptor s, can have a sudden 20 toxic death, yes. 21 Q He then goes on to sa y that the depletion in 22 the number for purkinje cells i n the cerebellum and 23 frontal cortex that has been de monstrated in the brain 24 of individuals with autism may represent the cytotoxic 25 effect. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 162 of 289 694A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 Do you agree with tha t statement? 2 A No. 3 Q What about that state ment do you disagree 4 with? 5 A I think there is no d ata to support his 6 conclusion that it represents a cytotoxic effect. 7 Q Do you disagree -- 8 A If I can just finish. The purkinje cells 9 basically hang on the cerebellu m. The frontal cortex 10 is not a typical neighborhood f or it. 11 Q Do you agree with tha t portion of the 12 statement that says, \"depletion in the number of 13 purkinje cells in the cerebellu m and frontal cortex 14 have been demonstrated in the b rains of autism\"? 15 A No. A decrease in th e number of purkinje 16 cells in the cerebellum hasn't been demonstrated in 17 the brains of individuals of au tism, yes. 18 Q So you would agree wi th that part but you do 19 not think it represents the cyt otoxin? 20 A I think that that is conjecture and 21 speculation. 22 Q Is there any evidence that you're aware of 23 that would argue that it does n ot represent a 24 cytotoxic effect? 25 A There is no evidence one way or the other. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 163 of 289 695 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 Q Okay. 2 A The evidence that we have about this kind of 3 cytotoxic effect is that there is no evidence of 4 scarring in the region, suggest ing that more likely 5 than not, the phenomenon may oc cur prior to birth 6 before the scarring system is i n place in the brain. 7 Q And the work that you 're describing on 8 there, have you filed that in C edillo or in this 9 matter? 10 A It's listed in et al. Any pathology that's 11 written about this, this is com mon knowledge to anyone 12 who works with autism. Of cour se, I'm blanking on the 13 man's name from UCLA who wrote a paper that actually 14 describes the absence of cerebe llum purkinje cells in 15 the autopsies of individuals wi th autism. 16 Q And the reason that y ou don't think it 17 represents the cytotoxic effect is the lack of 18 scarring, is that correct? 19 A No, there is no scarr ing, and number two, we 20 just don't know whether or not they are there. It's a 21 presumption that it's due to cy totoxicity. 22 Q Dr. Kinsbourne contin ues that the same may 23 apply to the loss of synaptic c onnections and 24 diminished dendritic growth in the hippocampus in 25 autism. Do you agree with that statement? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 164 of 289 696 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 A No. 2 Q What about that state ment don't you agree 3 with? 4 A Well, if you get enou gh cytotoxic effect, 5 you're going to kill the cell. It's not going to 6 change the number of synaptic c onnections. It's not 7 going to decrease the amount of dendritic growth. 8 You're going to kill the cell. 9 Q And that actually the n leads into the next 10 statement I want you to take a look at where Dr. 11 Kinsbourne says that \"Assuming a lower level of 12 imbalance, few, if any, cells m ay actually die, but 13 overexcitation will have predic table effects on the 14 functioning of the brain.\" Do you agree or disagree 15 with that statement? 16 A I disagree only becau se I think that it's 17 speculative with no data to sup port it. 18 Q Are you aware of any data that would address 19 that issue that contradicts it? 20 A Let me just say it th is way. In science, 21 it's not that I have to contrad ict someone else's 22 hypothesis or speculation. The y need to prove it to 23 me. 24 Q I understand that, bu t all I'm asking is are 25 you aware of any studies that h ave looked at this Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 165 of 289 697A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 issue and reached a negative co nclusion? 2 A No. As far as I have looked at this issue, 3 let me explain that the idea th at somehow you can and 4 a, balance is conjecture; that there is going to be 5 excessive glutamate in the syna ptic cleft just enough 6 to overexcite the cell but not enough to kill it 7 doesn't make sense. 8 If you really have a fine-tuned mechanism, 9 which is what he says has been lost, that control 10 mechanism that has been lost, y ou're going to get too 11 much glutamate building up, and there is going to be 12 cell death period. It's not go ing to stay at a 13 certain level. It's going to g et worse and worse and 14 worse because there are no clea nup components there, 15 because he stated that it's mis sing. 16 And we know that the glutamate transporters 17 that are in the neurons are ins ufficient to pick up 18 the slack because the predomina nt glutamate recovery 19 system that is in the brain is in the astrocyte, not 20 in the neuron. That's the one that keeps the area 21 safe. His statement that the a strocytes are no longer 22 doing what they are doing would mean that sooner or 23 later poison is going to build up, it's going to kill 24 the cell. 25 Q And we'll get to the astrocytes in a moment, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 166 of 289 698 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 but with this particular point then, you just don't 2 think that cells would survive this overexcitation 3 process? 4 A Well, my impression h ere is that the chronic 5 overexcitation, you're not talk ing about an acute 6 stressor. If you just have an acute stressor, the 7 answer is yes, cells do survive . 8 Q Okay. 9 A An acute stressor. B ut his explanation that 10 I heard was not that of an acut e stressor but of a 11 chronic process. Please correc t me if I'm wrong. 12 Q I'm taking the answer s based on your 13 understanding. 14 Now we move on to tal k about \"The obvious 15 effect is to render the brain m ore apt to generate 16 epileptic discharges.\" Do you agree with that 17 statement? 18 A Yes. Excessive gluta mate will do that. 19 Q And you would also ag ree the epilepsy as 20 well as subclinical disturbance s of the EEG are common 21 in autism spectrum disorders? 22 A Yes, but there is a c aveat, and it's 23 important to bring the caveat i n that he's 24 representing to the Court that this is due to some 25 glutamate imbalance. If this w as due to glutamate Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 167 of 289 699A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 imbalance where we do have some unfortunate, what's 2 the word, experiment of nature that occurred in 3 children where this happens, it doesn't take years for 4 the seizures to happen. They h appen right away. 5 And in autism, the on set of seizures is not 6 at age one year, it's not at ag e two years, it's not 7 at age three years. In the cla ssic, we'll call it the 8 primary autism population that we're talking about, 9 the onset is at adolescence and young adulthood. That 10 is far too long a time period f or this overexcitation 11 to occur and no seizures to be present. 12 Secondly and another important point in that 13 matter is that you have to ask yourself a question who 14 are the individuals that are mo st susceptible to 15 seizures. In other words, if I look at the entire ASD 16 population, who are the individ uals who are most 17 likely to develop seizures in a dolescence and young 18 adulthood, and the individuals who are most apt to do 19 so are the ones with mental ret ardation. 20 In other words, the l ower the IQ, the more 21 likely you are to have seizures , suggesting it's not a 22 glutamate phenomenon at all, bu t it's a wiring issue 23 that's directly related to the intellectual impairment 24 associated with mental retardat ion. 25 If we look at those i ndividuals with normal Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 168 of 289 700 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 intelligence, their risk of sei zures while slightly 2 above the general population is not that high. 3 Therefore, there is a good alte rnate explanation. 4 Actually not even an alternate. There are good 5 explanations why seizures occur , that we don't have to 6 posit a speculative hypothetica l model such as Dr. 7 Kinsbourne has provided. 8 Q But given the caveat, you would agree that 9 epilepsy and subclinical distur bances are present in 10 ASD children? 11 A But the subclinical d isturbances, and Dr. 12 Kinsbourne comments on subclini cal disturbances, the 13 majority of the subclinical dis turbances on the EEG 14 are not epileptical discharges. It's really back on - 15 - which has nothing to do with glutamate. In fact, if 16 you are going to argue that it' s because that part of 17 the brain is underexcited and t hat's why it's behaving 18 in that manner, it's only on ol der individuals who 19 have the epileptical discharges . 20 Q Now moving along, you started talking about 21 the astrocytes, and we're going to discuss it right 22 here. Obviously Dr. Kinsbourne does. He says that 23 \"One of the functions of astroc ytes is the regulation 24 of levels of glutamate at the s ynapse.\" Would you 25 agree with that statement? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 169 of 289 701A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 A Yes. 2 Q Also that glutamate t ransporters are 3 expressed on the astrocytes. I s that something you 4 agree with? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And further the astro cytes form a sheath 7 around the glutamatergic synaps e, and the glutamate 8 transporter intercepts and mops up spare glutamate. 9 A Well, I wouldn't norm ally use the word \"mop 10 up\". 11 Q I knew that you would n't, but do you agree 12 with just the statement? 13 A Let's use the word \"r ecycle\". The body is 14 the original glutamate recycler . It recycles because 15 it does not like to waste it. 16 Q So if we substitute t he word \"recycle\" for 17 \"mop up\", you would agree other wise with that 18 statement? 19 A Yes. 20 Q And that by doing so, it prevents it from 21 spreading to other synapses, th at is, the glutamate 22 spreading to synapses? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And this is a way tha t the astrocyte -- 25 A Let me say it's not o nly that it prevents it Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 170 of 289 702A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 from spreading to other synapse s, it prevents the 2 excessive buildup of glutamate at that synapse that 3 could lead to a cytotoxic death . 4 Q Okay. So it both pro tects that local 5 synapse but also prevents the s pread to other areas? 6 A And certainly it prev ents waste. 7 Q Because it recycles? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Now, \"When the astroc ytes malfunction or 10 die, glutamate flow may become excessive, shifting the 11 balance in the direction of ove rexcitation as well as 12 suppressing GABA inhibition.\" Do you agree with that 13 statement? 14 A No. 15 Q What about that state ment do you disagree 16 with? 17 A GABA is actually also dependent to some 18 degree on astrocytes. If you d on't have the astrocyte 19 that's present, the formation o f GABA, it may actually 20 be too much that's there, too l ittle that's there. 21 It's making an assumption. GAB A actually is only two 22 steps down from glutamate, or a ctually GABA is made 23 from glutamate. And therefore if the cell is making 24 glutamate, it's also making GAB A depending on the 25 enzyme, and therefore, I think that statement is very Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 171 of 289 703 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 simplistic and somewhat an inac curate representation 2 of what actually happened in th at local -- 3 Q But it is one of it s ounds like several 4 outcomes that could be happenin g at that local -- 5 A No, it's not. That's why I said it's not an 6 accurate representation. It's much more complicated 7 than that. 8 Q And the part that's i naccurate is the idea 9 that as astrocytes die, it supp resses GABA inhibition? 10 A Yes. And also the as trocyte dies, but the 11 problem with astrocyte death is that the glutamate 12 doesn't stick around in the are a, because as Dr. 13 Kinsbourne identified, he says that one of the jobs of 14 the astrocyte a few lines up is it blocks the extra 15 synapse and spreads to other sy napses. The glutamate 16 may just drift away. It's not necessarily going to 17 hang on just in that neighborho od, and if it drifts 18 away, there is no glutamate. 19 And the problem is th at if the astrocyte 20 dies off, there is no source of the precursor for 21 glutamate, for the neuron to do its job, so that whole 22 system isn't going to work righ t period. It's not 23 going to be a low level of hype rexcitation period of 24 time. Again, that's too simpli stic thinking. There 25 are so many more things that ma y happen. I don't Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 172 of 289 704 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 believe that this hypothetical model would ever occur 2 in reality because of all the o ther things that would 3 ensue. 4 Q So that's why we'll t alk about your 5 conclusion that we will get to. I really want to walk 6 through the specifics here. No w proinflammatory 7 cytokines attenuate the astrocy tic clearance of the 8 extracellular or cellular gluta mate, is that correct? 9 A Presumptively, I don' t know -- functions, so 10 I assume that this is one of th e functions that might 11 be modulated. 12 Q And then he goes on t o say that astrocytes 13 can release glutamate themselve s. That's correct? 14 A Theoretically yes, th ey can release 15 glutamate themselves in a neuro modulatory mechanism. 16 Q And then the interact ion of the aggravated 17 microglia can substantially amp lify glutamate release 18 from astrocytes. Do you agree with that? 19 A No. 20 Q Now that is something from published 21 literature, so you disagree wit h the folks who wrote 22 the paper there cited? 23 A Number one, I think i t's taken out of 24 context from the paper. If you have the paper, I'm 25 happy to read it because I have n't looked at this Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 173 of 289 705 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 paper for quite awhile, but I'm happy to read it and 2 tell you the context in which t hat statement was 3 actually made. 4 Q The questions I'm ask ing are based on your 5 knowledge stated here today to the best of your 6 recollection, so if you can't r ecall the paper, that's 7 fine. 8 A I think that that is not an accurate 9 representation of what the pape r is actually telling 10 us. 11 Q And then he goes on t o say that \"Because of 12 glutamate excess, adjacent circ uitry becomes activated 13 in a manner that escalates over time.\" Do you agree 14 or disagree with that statement ? 15 A If there truly is glu tamate excess that's 16 present, yes, and as I stated b efore, it will escalate 17 over time to cell death. I agr ee with that. 18 Q Okay. And then the f inal part of his, and 19 it's a quote from a paper, and I think that the paper 20 speaks for itself and both side s are debating the 21 significance or the conclusions one can draw, so I'm 22 not going to ask you whether th at is correct because 23 again the paper is the paper. So we've walked through 24 step by step your assessment an d your critique, so to 25 speak, of Dr. Kinsbourne's mode l. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 174 of 289 706 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 Stepping back away fr om this glutamate-based 2 model in a way, do you believe that there is any 3 excitatory inhibitory process t hat's occurring in the 4 brain? 5 A Well, everyone's brai n has an excitatory 6 inhibitory process. It's alway s present. 7 Q And will you agree th at it would be a 8 problem if, however it's caused -- we're not trying to 9 talk about vaccines or any part icular cause -- that if 10 you have overexcitation of the brain, it potentially 11 can present with neurological s ymptoms, things that 12 would be clinically significant ? 13 A Oh, yes. Neurologica l symptoms or signs to 14 be exact. Symptoms may be subj ective, dealing with 15 the complaint that the person h as. Sign is the 16 physical manifestations that th ey show. 17 Q And whether symptom o r sign, these would be 18 things that would be clinically significant in some 19 cases? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Now, given an excitat ory process in the 22 brain, overexcitation and a dis equilibrium if you will 23 between excitation and inhibiti on, if you assume that 24 that has taken place, again not in reference to the 25 cause because obviously we are not going to spend the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 175 of 289 707 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 afternoon coming to an agreemen t of what might be 2 causing these things, but given that state, would it 3 be reasonable to think that a c hild in that state 4 would avoid very stimulating ci rcumstances in his or 5 her life? 6 A No, I don't think tha t you can come to that 7 conclusion. 8 Q Why is that? 9 A Well, you already men tioned to me that you 10 have symptoms or signs, but the re wasn't basically 11 seizures. You basically have s eizures. And we know 12 that that happens, as I said, f rom unfortunate 13 experiments of nature, that tha t's what happens when 14 the GABA is out of whack. 15 And to my recollectio n, for children who 16 basically get excessively distr essed by the 17 environment, this is not a mode l that to my knowledge 18 has been proffered as the reaso n why the environment 19 stresses them, and I think a go od example of that is 20 anxiety disorders, especially, for instance, you're 21 asking about social contact and things of this nature, 22 which would be an avoidance beh avior. That's not a 23 model that's been proffered. 24 Q The overexcitation mo del. 25 A The overexcitation mo del is not one that's Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 176 of 289 708 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 been proffered. 2 Q And in your experienc e and your familiarity 3 with the literature, the overex citation model applies 4 primarily to seizures? 5 A To seizures. And the reason why Dr. 6 Kinsbourne used his presentatio n and his hypothetical 7 in this situation, the example he gave specifically 8 was starring, the mannerisms or the self-stimulated, 9 whatever terminology you wish t o use for autism, and 10 he stated that these behaviors are done because of 11 overexcitation, and when they g et overly excited, they 12 do it more. 13 And it made me think back to my clinical 14 practice and the complaints tha t parents have many 15 times where the parents will sa y that the kids do it 16 when they have nothing better t o do, and actually if 17 the parents were being more pro mpt or engaged them or 18 if they are in an office and we see these kind of 19 behaviors and I engage them, th ey stop. 20 But there I'm stimula ting them by social 21 engagement, the exact scenario that Dr. Kinsbourne 22 said should provoke the behavio r, but I stopped the 23 behavior in that manner. The p arents are able to stop 24 the behavior, which means that from the clinical or 25 functional standpoint, the mode l doesn't have any Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 177 of 289 709 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 legs. 2 Q And when you say that the parents can 3 interrupt to change behavior, y ou're familiar with the 4 presentation of symptoms of pat ients where children 5 are nonresponsive to either cli nical or parental 6 intervention on things like sel f-stimulatory behavior? 7 A I mean, there are som e children that have 8 symptoms that present in a way that they are 9 unresponsive and avoid contact with the person that's 10 attempting to very directive be havior. 11 The issue in autism i s simply that the 12 social issue of autism is not a voidance of contact. 13 That's not a core criterion. A nd if you look at the 14 core criteria for the social de ficit, avoidance of 15 social interaction suggests mor e social anxiety I 16 believe than the social behavio r of a child with 17 autism. In autism, it appears that they have little 18 to no interest in social intera ction. 19 But when I approach t he child, the child is 20 not interested in interacting w ith me. In fact, when 21 parents say to me that when kid s come in the room, my 22 child will move to the other en d of the room, I don't 23 think of autism. 24 Q Now, in looking throu gh your CV and looking 25 through your list of publicatio ns and the abstracts, I Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 178 of 289 710 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 was looking to see if any of th e papers in there were 2 papers that were descriptive of causation of autism 3 spectrum disorder. Have you pu blished papers that 4 address the potential causes of autism spectrum 5 disorder? 6 A Probably within eithe r my book chapters or 7 one of the papers we wrote abou t the work that we 8 would have a comment on attenti on causes when we're 9 talking about diagnostic evalua tion, and we also talk 10 about the differential diagnosi s. 11 Q Yes. Understanding t hat, have you done any 12 original research investigating , so, for example, 13 postulating or hypothesizing a potential cause of 14 autism and then conducted a res earch project to test 15 that hypothesis? 16 A No. 17 Q Have you ever worked on teams of people that 18 have conducted research? Even if you haven't 19 published, have you participate d in that work? 20 A We have in a roundabo ut sort of way. We 21 have studies done on preschoole rs and then school-age 22 kids to differentiate the featu res of autism and what 23 we hope will be some of the cor e reasons on imaging 24 and electrophysiology from chil dren with medical 25 retardation and children with l anguage disorders. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 179 of 289 711A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 Q Was your participatio n in that project to 2 basically supply the subjects o f the research? 3 A No. I actually ran t he project, the second 4 study, the school-age study. I ran that at the 5 center. I was the local invest igator that ran it. I 6 also evaluated all the children , made sure all the 7 data got submitted. The electr ophysiology data, the 8 imaging data, so forth and so o n was submitted to the 9 central study. 10 Q But nothing that gene rated a published -- 11 A Oh, there were public ations that came out of 12 it. It's been so long I can't remember. I just know 13 the most recent one was the one that's in my CV that 14 David Mandelbaum was the first author. It had to do 15 with sensory and other issues. 16 Q So that Mandelbaum pa per went to issues of 17 causation and ASD? 18 A I don't know if it we nt to causation there. 19 There were other ones that expl ored that issue. I 20 remember I was listed as an aut hor, and I don't know. 21 Q And then just a few m ore questions. I know 22 that you participated in the Ce dillo case. You 23 prepared an expert report and y ou showed up to 24 testify. I know in this case, you've submitted two 25 expert reports and obviously ar e here today Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 180 of 289 712 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 testifying. Have you participa ted in any other 2 vaccine program cases involving autism aside from the 3 Cedillo matter and this matter? 4 A Yes. 5 Q What would those be? 6 A Without giving names? 7 Q Yes. 8 A I can't do that. One was actually the 9 question of the timing of onset of the autism. 10 Q How long ago was that ? 11 A I think last year. A nd I think the issue 12 that was there was more a legal issue of whether the 13 submission for claim was too la te. 14 Q The timeliness of the claim and onset of 15 injury? 16 A That's beyond me. Th at's a legal issue. 17 Q Which side were you a ppearing for? 18 A I reviewed it on beha lf of the government, 19 and I know I have a few records at home of other 20 children that I was told to sta y my hand because I 21 think they were put in the omni bus program, and I 22 never even generated a report. 23 Q That's what I was goi ng to ask, have you 24 generated a report or testified . So you reviewed 25 medical records or you have med ical records that you Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 181 of 289 713 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 would be capable of reviewing. These were at the 2 request of the government also? 3 A Yes, sir. And I woul d be happy to review 4 for petitioners who have ever c ontacted me. I'm 5 sorry. I am wrong. I got cont acted by one petitioner 6 attorney about the feasibility of actually filing, and 7 they asked me to review the inf ormation, which 8 included a videotape of the chi ld, and then I gave a 9 review. 10 Q And then finally, hav e you appeared in any 11 civil cases involving claims of autism outside of this 12 vaccine program? 13 A Yes. There was a cla im, Doe v. I guess it 14 was McNeil or Johnson & Johnson or one of those 15 companies, that was in federal court in North 16 Carolina. 17 Q Was that the Rhogam c ase? 18 A That was the Rhogam c ase where there was a 19 claim of autism. It was a Daub ert hearing. The 20 plaintiff's experts were exclud ed by the Judge. 21 Q But my question is yo ur participation, did 22 you prepare an expert report in that case? 23 A Yes, I did. 24 Q Did you testify at de positions? 25 A I testified at a depo sition. I must have Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 182 of 289 714 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 given a deposition because I kn ow I actually testified 2 in court, but I don't remember. Whether I gave a 3 deposition, I don't remember, b ut I remember I 4 testified in court. 5 Q And that would have b een during the Daubert 6 hearing? 7 A That would have been during the Daubert 8 hearing, yes, sir. 9 Q And then aside from t he Rhogam case, any 10 other civil cases that you have been involved with 11 where the claim at issue was au tism? 12 A No, not to my recolle ction. 13 Q And then the North Ca rolina case, presumably 14 you were an expert witness bein g paid by the drug 15 companies that were involved or their lawyers? 16 A I don't remember whic h. I know I was 17 contacted by the lawyers. 18 Q But the check did com e? 19 A It did come, yes, sir . 20 MR. POWERS: No furth er questions. 21 THE COURT: One momen t. 22 (Pause.) 23 THE COURT: Doctor, I don't know how much of 24 this was mentioned but, let me try. You've described 25 that in about 25 to 30 percent of kids on the autism Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 183 of 289 715 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 spectrum, we can identify some cause. 2 THE WITNESS: Yes. 3 THE COURT: Is that c orrect? 4 THE WITNESS: Yes, we have the test 5 capabilities to show cause. 6 THE COURT: So we sho w that the child has 7 tuberous sclerosis or we show t hat there is Fragile X 8 or we show Rett syndrome or we show something like 9 that. 10 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma 'am. 11 THE COURT: Or we hav e a history of 12 congenital rubella or a history of Thalidomide use in 13 pregnancy? 14 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma 'am. 15 THE COURT: And those children are all 16 classified as having the same d isorder, I won't call 17 it a disease, the spectrum diso rder. 18 THE WITNESS: They sh ow similar clinical 19 features. 20 THE COURT: Okay. An d that's what I was 21 working for. 22 THE WITNESS: Which r eally gets to the point 23 if I may be presumptuous. 24 THE COURT: Go ahead. 25 THE WITNESS: What it really is, you're not Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 184 of 289 716A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 talking about autism, you're ta lking autisms. In 2 other words, there are several ways to get to the same 3 end result. 4 THE COURT: You are t alking about a group of 5 behaviors, some core behaviors must exist in each case 6 in order for children to receiv e this diagnosis? 7 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma 'am. 8 THE COURT: But there may be a wide variety 9 of behavior outside those core behaviors. In other 10 words, people may have some soc ial avoidance. You can 11 have two children, for example, that have the same 12 core behaviors, but one might b e on the -- end of it, 13 that is, mentally, intellectual ly functioning well, 14 and one might be -- one of the poor children with IQs 15 of 70 or below? 16 THE WITNESS: Yes. A nd what happens there 17 is if you actually look at thos e children, it doesn't 18 matter if they have Asperger's Disorder or they have 19 autistic disorder, say 50 becau se it's a nice, easy 20 number to use. 21 THE COURT: Okay. 22 THE WITNESS: You're going to still find the 23 same core deficits, but the man ifestations are subtly 24 different because it depends on their intelligence. 25 They are both going to have iss ues with social Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 185 of 289 717 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 interaction, but I would expect a child on the lower 2 end to have greater impairment, in other words, the 3 quantity is more, not the quali ty, the quantity is 4 more than a child with Asperger 's Disorder, who still 5 have a social deficit as descri bed quantitatively. 6 While it's still an impairment, it's not as severe. 7 If you come to my off ice and see the 8 children march through, I mean, I can see 10 kids in a 9 day and you will see different levels of social 10 ability, but they are all signi ficantly impaired in 11 the same way. They have proble ms with initiation and 12 maintenance of the social inter action. They have 13 problems with the use of social abilities and social 14 cues. There are not verbal asp ects of language, of 15 socialization, reading peoples' actions, reading 16 faces, reading body language. It's not enough. 17 I mean, there are som e people who just have 18 no interest in socialization. The other ones when you 19 approach them will interact wit h you, but they don't 20 maintain interaction after you break off that social 21 contact. But it's all within t he spectrum of social 22 dysfunction that we know occurs within the autistic 23 disorders. 24 The reason is that ju st taking some -- all 25 these problems are not only sev erity, but they are Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 186 of 289 718 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 also age-dependent, because I t hink you had asked that 2 question does the brain continu e to develop. Of 3 course, it does, and therefore, the manifestation at 4 two years is not the same manif estation that you would 5 see in say seven years, but the y are still going to 6 show a qualitative impairment i n socialization. Does 7 that answer? 8 THE COURT: Yes, it g ets me a little closer 9 to where I am trying to go. Wh en, for example, we 10 have a child with Rett syndrome , a girl who engages in 11 the hand-wringing that we see c lassically in Rett 12 syndrome, and we have a child, let's say a boy who 13 engages in some similar conduct , some stereotypic 14 behavior with his hands, it may not be the wringing, 15 it may be something else, we ha ve two children who 16 have diagnoses on the same spec trum. 17 We have a cause for o ne, and I use \"cause\" 18 in the sense that we identify t he Rett's child with a 19 genetic defect, the specific ge netic defect. And then 20 we have a similar behavior by a child who does not 21 have that genetic defect. Say it's a boy and we've 22 tested him just to be on the sa fe side. 23 Well, from that, we k now that something in 24 the brain besides simply having this misformed or 25 malformed or extra copies of th e genetic defect is Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 187 of 289 719 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 causing the brain to develop in such a way that these 2 children display the same or ve ry similar stereotypic 3 behaviors. 4 THE WITNESS: If I ca nnot use the Rett girl. 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 THE WITNESS: Let me explain why. But girls 7 with Rett syndrome are actually social, they are 8 interactive. They are very fri endly, and they all 9 come up to me and they stare at me and they want to 10 interact with me. They are jus t incapable because of 11 their -- 12 THE COURT: Sort of t he eye expressive. 13 THE WITNESS: Yes, th ey are very expressive 14 with their eyes. One of my pat ients now is in the 15 hospital and one of the reasons she is in is because 16 her behavior changed. We know she's sick, and we have 17 to figure out why. 18 And the hand-wringing in Rett syndrome 19 probably has a sensory base to it because when they 20 wring their hands, you can meas ure EEG discharges. If 21 you do some sensitive testing, there is some feedback 22 that goes there and we don't qu ite understand what is 23 it that drives that behavior, b ut let's just take a 24 stereotypic behavior in childre n. They might have 25 finger-flicking in front of the eyes. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 188 of 289 720 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 I'm not presumptive e nough to say because a 2 boy does this and a girl does i t that it's the same 3 biologic mechanism. That boy m ay have a neurologic 4 deficiency that's driving that behavior, and the girl 5 may have tuberous sclerosis tha t's driving the 6 behavior. We're just seeing th e same physical 7 manifestation for whatever reas on that it occurs. 8 THE COURT: The physi cal manifestations we 9 see, the signs if you will of b ehaviors, core 10 behaviors of the autism spectru m, may have a variety 11 of causes. 12 THE WITNESS: There i s a variety of 13 underpinnings, but it's probabl y somewhat similar 14 areas of the brain that are dys function for driving 15 it. I think, as Dr. Kinsbourne already stated, there 16 were these very simplistic mode ls in the old days that 17 it's a problem with inflammatio n going from the brain 18 stem up to the brain, the upstr eam deficit, but that 19 was proven not to be true. 20 Then there was the do wnstream deficit and 21 that was proven that it was too simplistic. Then 22 there is the limbic system dysf unction, and that's 23 proven not to be sufficient. A nd probably the 24 prevailing model nowadays is th e neuro network model 25 that's been known for quite awh ile. I have known Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 189 of 289 721 WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 about it for about 10 years, bu t now it's becoming 2 more familiar to the rest of th e world. 3 What it means is that some of the nerve 4 cells won't talk to each other and can't synchronize 5 their activity taking simple th ings. For instance, I 6 can move my finger, that's a si mple thing, but to 7 coordinate the whole hand use i s a much bigger issue 8 because they involve multiple a reas of the brain 9 working together. 10 And the same thing wi th social behavior. I 11 might be able to see you, but t he social behavior 12 responding in an socially appro priate manner, which is 13 a much more sophisticated thing , is a bigger problem. 14 The simple test to be done is t he more complex task 15 that requires synchronization o f the brain engines, of 16 the neuro network. One, that's the impairment, and 17 there are lots of ways of getti ng there, and there are 18 lots of different things that y ou can interrupt with 19 the appropriate formation of a neuro network. 20 The brain is very sop histicated. Just to 21 give you an idea, I can interfe re with dendritic 22 development, which is the recep tor side where an axon 23 will end up. If that dendrite is not as well- 24 developed as it should be, it's not going to function, 25 and we see that in Fragile X sy ndrome where the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 190 of 289 722A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 dendritic development isn't rig ht. I may not be able 2 to have good -- and it doesn't go where it's supposed 3 to go, and we know that because of some of the 4 neuroimaging work that's been d one when you measure 5 volumes and you look at things. 6 There may be issues w here there is too much 7 brain tissue, in other words, t here are too many 8 synapses that are present, and therefore, I call it 9 too much static, and therefore, systems don't work 10 right. 11 Someone mentioned min i-column yesterday. 12 The mini-columns are the wrong size, and therefore, 13 they are not doing the job they are supposed to do 14 because the system wasn't built right. 15 THE COURT: And one t hing doesn't have to 16 cause that mini-column. 17 THE WITNESS: There a re a lot of different 18 reasons why that mini-column -- there is a lot of 19 things that are -- let me give a simple example. The 20 brain is too complex. In the h eart development, there 21 are oodles of different signals that are sent to the 22 heart to develop, and if any of those signals go awry, 23 you're going to get heart malfo rmation. There are 24 lots of different signals durin g brain development. 25 THE COURT: And that heart development could Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 191 of 289 723A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 happen congenitally? 2 THE WITNESS: It's on ly congenital. By the 3 time you are born, the heart is developed. 4 THE COURT: All right . I'm getting at you 5 may develop a valvular defect, for example, rheumatic 6 fever. 7 THE WITNESS: Yes, th at would be an acquired 8 problem. But looking at the br ain, there are lots of 9 signals that have to be sent, a nd there has to be a 10 cascade of signals. There is a sequence of signals 11 that occur. Destruction of tha t sequence in different 12 locations, for instance, in neu rolike disorders, these 13 are actually scaffolded in prob es. These are probes 14 that hole up into the nerve its elf and it's supported. 15 There are lots of different sca ffolding probes, any of 16 which if it's dysfunctional the oretically can lead to 17 the same result. But that's pr edestined in terms of 18 if you don't -- it's set up in that the signals aren't 19 going to be sent. 20 And I think you used the example of Rett 21 syndrome. The reticulars are d oing perfectly okay, 22 but signals aren't being sent r ight, and the signals 23 do involve the Rett's picture b ecause biologically you 24 were predetermined to get there . 25 Fragile X, when we lo ok at the kids, the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 192 of 289 724A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 milder kids, initially you can' t tell the difference. 2 It's only as they get older tha t these features show 3 themselves. 4 THE COURT: I recall reading a couple of 5 case studies, and I apologize t hat I can't turn them 6 off the top of my head here, bu t of individuals who 7 developed autisticlike symptoms in adulthood. What's 8 going on there? 9 THE WITNESS: Well, I think your wording is 10 correct, ma'am. I think it's a utisticlike, and the 11 real question is if one of us c ame along with some of 12 the DSM IV criteria and we rigo rously applied it to 13 that individual, would they act ually apply? 14 THE COURT: Okay. 15 THE WITNESS: And may I explain? 16 THE COURT: Sure. 17 THE WITNESS: First o f all, the one you're 18 describing classically is indiv iduals with herpes 19 simplex encephalitis. It's a v iral encephalitis. Big 20 holes, big holes, anterior temp oral holes are wiped 21 out, don't make new memories. We know that because 22 there is a congenital model, an d I have a few patients 23 with this. 24 THE COURT: Right. 25 THE WITNESS: And the y are just Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 193 of 289 725A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 developmentally not right. Whe n I look at these kids, 2 they are autisticlike, but they feel different. Do 3 you understand what I mean from a microcondition 4 stand? 5 THE COURT: Yes. 6 THE WITNESS: They ar e not like the rest of 7 my autism patients, but they ma nifest some of the 8 behaviors. And I think we are seeing the same thing 9 in here. Because of the damage , they can't process 10 certain signals. 11 Another example would be if you develop an 12 intractable epilepsy, or let's call it epileptic 13 encephalopathy. There is a lot of static that's 14 there, and people that use the determinative autism 15 spectrum disorder features, the issue there is that 16 the epilepsy all goes away. Th at's a superficial 17 glaze. To me, actually they lo ok dull and glazed. 18 They are not bright-eyed and bu shy-tailed like my 19 typical autism patients. So th ere are subtle 20 differences to me. 21 THE COURT: Although some of the behaviors 22 are the same. 23 THE WITNESS: Some of the behaviors are the 24 same, but they are not exactly the same. And that 25 leads to the whole issue of how rigorous you need to Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 194 of 289 726A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 be in order to define things in the literature, and it 2 was interesting. Dr. Zweiman's point is that it 3 depends on the lab that runs th e tests and the 4 methodology as to how you are g oing to be able to 5 interpret the information. 6 The same thing here. Medical Center A may 7 have much looser criteria for d efining autism spectrum 8 disorder than Medical Center B even using standard 9 tests, the ADI and the ADIS. I have seen individuals 10 who had these tests electricall y -- these scales 11 filled out for them. Everyone agrees they don't have 12 ASD, they have some other condi tion, but the 13 individuals who used it were mu ch looser in their 14 criteria and inadvertently clas sified them that way 15 until we were able to reverse i t, and it was simple to 16 virtually treat the underlying condition and make it 17 just go away. 18 Therefore, I have to stick to my simple 19 autistic, this kid has autistic disorder. Those kids 20 are clear to define. When you get out to those 21 borders, it gets a lot of contr oversy on how you 22 define them. 23 THE COURT: So a find ing that herpes 24 encephalitis can introduce auti sticlike behavior in an 25 adult does not mean that it is a viral influence that Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 195 of 289 727A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 causes -- 2 THE WITNESS: Oh, tha t's pure brain damage. 3 THE COURT: Okay. 4 THE WITNESS: It's no t viral influence. 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 THE WITNESS: If you read the articles, they 7 will tell you. 8 THE COURT: Yes. 9 THE WITNESS: That's actually what these 10 individuals are left with. The y are left with 11 assistic encephalable dysplasia , just holes where 12 brain tissue used to be. 13 THE COURT: And I und erstand that. What I 14 was getting at, however, the po int I'm trying to 15 understand is that the behavior s that people with 16 autism demonstrate, those behav iors can be mimicked in 17 some way by people who do not h ave autism, and I'm not 18 making it clear. 19 THE WITNESS: Let's t ake the epilepsy. 20 THE COURT: Okay. 21 THE WITNESS: Epilept ic encephalopathy kids 22 who even though they classify t hem as having it, I 23 don't think they really do. Th ey can be mimicked by 24 things that adversely affect th e brain, yes. 25 THE COURT: Now let's move to strict autism. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 289 728A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 We're not talking about these b ehaviors that mimic it. 2 Within autism, you've talked ab out the classic 3 autistic child, the regressed a utistic child, and you 4 recognize, do you not, that the re are differences or 5 do you not recognize difference s? 6 THE WITNESS: Differe nces of? 7 THE COURT: Well, in terms of how the 8 disease manifests and the progn osis for the children. 9 THE WITNESS: Yes. W ell, if I will take a 10 child with classic autism and I will take a child with 11 regressive autism at two and a half years, they will 12 be exactly the same. That's wh y it's important to 13 have a history. And I think yo u are right, prognostic 14 is -- 15 THE COURT: And then at age 10, how are they 16 going to look different? 17 THE WITNESS: The chi ldren with regressive 18 autism classically don't do as good. They just don't 19 do as well. That's the traditi onal teaching. The 20 children with regular autism, t he children still don't 21 do well. I mean, you only have less than 10 percent 22 who will have a functional outc ome even though about 23 30 percent will probably have n ormal intelligence but 24 not enough to have a good funct ional outcome. Do you 25 understand what I mean by that? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 197 of 289 729A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 THE COURT: I do. I understand. 2 THE WITNESS: Because the autistic features 3 may be of sufficient severity e ven in an individual 4 with normal intelligence to fun ction adequately in 5 society. 6 THE COURT: Someone c an sit in a room and 7 calculate prime numbers but can 't manage to make 8 dinner for himself? 9 THE WITNESS: Yes, ma 'am. 10 THE COURT: Okay. An d we do not know 11 anatomically, brain anatomicall y, what differentiates 12 that classic autistic child fro m the regressed 13 autistic child? 14 THE WITNESS: No. Fi rst of all, we don't 15 even know if there is a differe nce. We don't have 16 enough information. For all I know, their problems 17 are the same. There are differ ent ways you can build 18 up models. One model will be t hat you're talking 19 about two totally different con ditions that perhaps 20 affect some different areas of the brain and manifest 21 at different times. 22 Number two is that th e problem is in the 23 same areas of the brain, but ju st whatever goes awry 24 goes awry later in the regressi ve form compared to the 25 classic autistic form of their symptoms. They are Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 198 of 289 730A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 easily identifiable at 12 to 18 months, and when you 2 look at them, you will see that there were issues that 3 were present, and that's why I was stating that in 4 reading the more recent literat ure, people are raising 5 questions that in these childre n with regressive 6 autism at least some of those k ids have more than a 7 common disorder. 8 It might contra the e nergy boxes in the 9 cell, and if you have a battery in your flashlight, it 10 may die tomorrow, it may die in two weeks or it may 11 take a year to die. It depends on when the battery 12 dies. The same thing as the en ergy boxes not working 13 right. They can function mecha nically up to a point 14 and then get overwhelmed with d emands and the cell 15 dies. 16 And it's believed tha t at least a group of 17 regressive kids have some sort of mitochondrial 18 dysfunction that produces this regression where 19 previously he looked okay. I t hink that is a biologic 20 possibility because that makes sense because it fits 21 the other mitochondrial disorde rs we see, but it gets 22 percolated. If you don't mind my giving you an 23 example. 24 THE COURT: No, go ah ead. 25 THE WITNESS: I admit ted a girl to the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 199 of 289 731A WIZNITZER - CROSS ( CONT'D ) 1 hospital last week. She has a family history of 2 mitochondrial disorder. She wa s actually doing pretty 3 good. Then if you examined fro m a neurology 4 standpoint, the girl's examinat ion was good until she 5 had her first stroke at 19 year s due to the 6 mitochondrial disorder. Now sh e has balance issues 7 and such, but we know the genes . It just took awhile 8 for her gene to express itself. There was no outside 9 influence. This is just the wa y in her it happened, 10 and it has to do with how much of the mutated genes, 11 mutated mitochondria in the cel l, how much normal 12 mitochondria in the cells as to when things will prove 13 up and lead to problems. 14 Yet her cousin, the s ame genetic 15 predisposition but a much more adverse mitochondrial 16 load of mutated mitochondria, w e weren't able to test 17 it, presented in the first few years of life with 18 scrofula and unfortunately subs equently died. It's 19 the same condition that has var iability in 20 presentation. That's just to g ive you one model of 21 what may be causing the regress ive.

Could you p lease explain or just 14 give us a brief overview of you r educational 15 background, starting with your undergraduate 16 education? 17 A Yes. I received a Ba chelor of Science in 18 biology from Siena College. It 's a small college 19 outside of Albany, New York.

I've been there ever since. 21 Q What is the field of immunotoxicology? 22 Could you describe for me what it is? 23 A Sure. Immunotoxicolo gy, as the name 24 implies, is the merger of two d isciplines, immunology 25 and toxicology, and the scope o f that area, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 205 of 289 737A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 particularly subdiscipline rese arch, involves research 2 involving examining adverse eff ects of environmental 3 chemicals, occupational exposur es, drugs, other 4 immunomodulators on immune resp onse. The scope 5 includes issues relevant to mec hanistic research to 6 understand how these agents wor k, to exposure 7 assessments, risk assessments t o try to understand how 8 can some of this work be extrap olated, translated into 9 issues relevant to human popula tions. 10 Q When did you begin yo ur work in the field of 11 immunotoxicology? 12 A I think I began my wo rk in the area of 13 immunotoxicology when I was in graduate school, 14 whether I realized it or not, a nd I say that because I 15 went to Albany Medical College and was working in the 16 Department of Microbiology and Immunology. I was 17 attracted to that particular de partment because I 18 wanted to receive training in c ellular immunology, so 19 I think I was trained as a cell ular immunologist. 20 I was working in the lab, interested in the 21 effects of heavy metals and the use of heavy metals as 22 tools to modulate effects. It wasn't really until I 23 came back from the Karolinska a nd started working at 24 my first faculty position charg ed with deciding what I 25 want to be when I grew up, and write my own grants and Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 206 of 289 738 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 start writing my own lab that I think I stepped and 2 thought this would be a niche b ased on my experiences. 3 Since I had been trai ned as an immunologist, 4 it would be an easier fit for m e to work in the area 5 of immunotoxicology trained as an immunologist rather 6 than trained as a toxicologist. So that's essentially 7 where things started. 8 MR. MATANOSKI: This is not directed to you. 9 I have to apologize f or the record because I 10 just realized that Special Mast er Hastings is sitting 11 here, and I made that offhanded comment about Detroit. 12 THE COURT: You forgo t that I too grew up -- 13 (Laughter.) 14 MR.

MATANOSKI: 20 Q Doctor, I'm sorry for that side comment. 21 Right now working in the field of 22 immunotoxicology, you are in th e department -- what's 23 your posting right now at the U niversity -- 24 A Department of Environ mental Medicine. 25 Q What work does that d epartment do? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 207 of 289 739 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 A It's a relatively sma ll department. There 2 are around 10 to 15 investigato rs researching in a 3 number of different areas I wou ld describe as areas in 4 neurotoxicology. University of Rochester and its 5 department has a longstanding e xpertise of 6 investigators in that particula r area. We have 7 interests and faculty working i n the area of 8 immunotoxicology. Those are my colleagues. They are 9 all my colleagues. 10 But we have a group i nterested in 11 osteotoxicology, influences of toxic chemicals on 12 bone. This is probably the onl y group in the country 13 working in that area. And we h ave another group 14 interested largely in pulmonary function, pulmonary 15 biology, pulmonary toxicology, particulate matters and 16 things of that nature. 17 Q What attracted you to the University of 18 Rochester? 19 A So in addition to a l ongstanding program in 20 neurotoxicology, and I should a lso mention the 21 pulmonary group has historicall y been strong at the 22 University of Rochester, the im muno group, the osteo 23 group are merging within the de partment at the 24 university. But the University of Rochester has had 25 longstanding expertise, investi gators working in the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 208 of 289 740 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 area of metal toxicology. 2 Also in the last few years, the last decade 3 or so, the immunology group at the University of 4 Rochester has become very stron g, stronger. I think 5 it would be a detraction to inf er that it wasn't 6 strong prior to that. But it's a very strong group of 7 investigators working in the ar ea of immunology. 8 So remember I told yo u that my area of 9 expertise is immunotoxicology w ith a particular 10 emphasis on metal toxicology, s o coming to a 11 university and having colleague s that I could talk to 12 about issues of metal toxicolog y as well as issues 13 relevant to immunology made it an attractive place for 14 me to be. 15 Q Do you teach in your current position? 16 A I do. 17 Q What do you teach? 18 A I teach several areas to graduate students, 19 topics related to metal toxicol ogy, topics related to 20 immunotoxicology, so topics rel ated to my expertise. 21 I lecture on autoimmunity, intr oductory lectures on 22 autoimmunity to toxicology grad uate students. I 23 lecture to medical students on issues relevant to lead 24 toxicity and lead poisoning. I also run a colloquium- 25 style course that comes up as a n elective for graduate Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 209 of 289 741 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 students in the spring every ot her year, and that's a 2 topics survey course in the are a of immunotoxicology, 3 so this is a paper discussion t ype course with 4 graduate students. That's usua lly a lot of fun, a lot 5 of back and forth on that type of venue, different 6 than deductive lecturing. 7 Q Do you run any labora tories? 8 A I do. I run my own l aboratory, and I am the 9 principal investigator and chie f of that laboratory. 10 Q And what work does th at laboratory do? 11 A We work in the genera l area under the 12 umbrella of metal immunotoxicol ogy. We have several 13 projects ongoing. So my backgr ound interest has 14 always been in lymphocyte activ ation, lymphocyte 15 signaling modeling. So as you heard from the 16 testimony this morning, lymphoc ytes, B-cells and T- 17 cells are the cells that are ma inly responsible for 18 adaptive immunity. 19 So my longstanding in terests, I am trained 20 as an immunologist, have been s tudying and 21 understanding signal transducti on about the guard and 22 function of these cells, the si gnal transduction being 23 how is the information transmit ted from outside the 24 cell through the biochemical re actions that allow 25 information to be transmitted f rom outside the cell Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 210 of 289 742 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 into the cell, to the direct ce ll to express the genes 2 to divide, to differentiate. 3 So my lab has been in terested in how are 4 these processes modulated by ex posures to metals, how 5 we can use metals as tools to p rovoke changes in these 6 signaling patterns. 7 One project in partic ular focuses on mercury 8 and it analyzes how does mercur y interfere with T-cell 9 syndrome, how does it interfere -- first of all, does 10 it, and it does, and how does i t interfere with depth 11 receptor signals, the processes of physiological cells 12 that are still working in the i mmune response. 13 Another project with arsenic deals with 14 understanding how arsenic modul ates the cell cycle. 15 Arsenic is used as a chemothera peutic agent, so we're 16 interested in how does arsenic dysregulate the control 17 cell. 18 Q How is your time divi ded between the various 19 duties at the university? 20 A I would say I spend a bout 50 percent of my 21 time as a researcher. Unfortun ately, as I've 22 progressed, that time as a rese archer is not spent in 23 the laboratory at the bench but still as a researcher 24 in terms of reading papers and writing papers and 25 writing my own grants and desig ning experiments, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 211 of 289 743 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 things of that nature. 2 About 15 percent of m y time is spent 3 teaching as I described to you. Another 15 percent of 4 my time is spent on administrat ive duties, other 5 scholarly activities, going to meetings both within 6 the building and outside the bu ilding nationally, 7 reviewing other peoples' work, reviewing manuscripts 8 and grants. 9 Then I would put a ca tegory -- if I'm 10 following my math in my head co rrectly, it should add 11 up to about 100 percent -- abou t 20 percent of my time 12 is spent mentoring graduate stu dents, postdocs, 13 technicians, and that mentoring crosses teaching 14 responsibilities because it's a form of teaching, but 15 it also crosses research becaus e it crosses into the 16 research realm as well. 17 Q Just cleaning up and then we'll go forward 18 from educational, let's talk ab out some of your 19 professional involvements. Are you on the editorial 20 boards of any journals that wou ld be appropriate to 21 the issues we're discussing her e? 22 A Yes, I am. I am asso ciate editor of 23 Toxicology and Applied Pharmaco logy. I'm also on the 24 editorial board of the Journal of Immunotoxicology. 25 Q Just a second. You s aid associate editor Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 212 of 289 744 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 and editorial board. Is there a distinction? 2 A Yes. I've been on th e editorial board of 3 the Toxicology and Applied Phar macology since late 4 1990s, and I believe it was in 2002 I was invited to 5 be associate editor. So it's a peg up from the 6 editorial board. 7 Q I see. I'm sorry. 8 A And the importance of that is that 9 Toxicology and Applied Pharmaco logy is one of the two, 10 arguably one of the two leading journals in 11 toxicology. I am also a member of the editorial board 12 of a newer journal called the J ournal of 13 Immunotoxicology, a more specia lized journal. And 14 just last week, it's not on my CV because this just 15 happened, I was invited to join the editorial board of 16 Toxicological Sciences, and I'm very happy to do that, 17 the reason being that Toxicolog ical Sciences is the 18 second, arguably the second of the two leading 19 journals in toxicology. 20 Q As part of your work on the editorial board 21 of these journals, do you work as a peer reviewer for 22 any special journals? 23 A Yes, I do. I review papers, peer review 24 manuscripts for about a dozen d ifferent journals, 25 probably on the order of about one a week, so it comes Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 213 of 289 745 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 out to be 40 or so a year. I g et a few breaks every 2 now and again. A few of them o f relevance in addition 3 to the three journals that I ha ve already mentioned I 4 of course review papers for. I also review papers for 5 toxicology letters, other toxic ology journals. I 6 review papers for the Journal o f Immunology, 7 Environmental Health Perspectiv es on parthenogenesis 8 as examples. 9 Q And are you a member of any national or 10 international special organizat ions that deal with 11 immunology and toxicology? 12 A Yes, I am. 13 Q It's probably listed on your rsum. Why 14 don't you actually just tell us a couple. 15 A A couple of them. So one that comes to 16 mind, currently I am on a Natio nal Academy of Sciences 17 National Research Council Commi ttee charged with 18 establishing a safety standard for beryllium exposure, 19 beryllium being an important me tal of occupational 20 relevance. In August of 2005, I was on a U.S. EPA 21 panel charged with reviewing do cuments establishing 22 air quality criteria for lead. And I've been on 23 numerous NIH, National Institut e of Health and 24 National Institute of Environme ntal Health Sciences 25 grant review panels.

It's an award know n as the Young 10 Outstanding Immunotoxicologist Award. I am 11 particularly proud of that awar d for two reasons. 12 The first is that was the first year that 13 that award was given, so I took some pride knowing 14 that there were some of my peer s waiting in the wings 15 and I was selected first, and s o it was a Sally Field 16 moment, \"They like me.\" 17 And the second reason being at the age of 38 18 it was a \"young\" outstanding in vestigator award, so 19 that's the reason for that. An d I have the plaque on 20 my wall still. 21 Q To remind yourself th at you're young. 22 A I'm young at least at heart. 23 Q Have you ever been in vited to present at 24 national professional meetings on immunology? 25 A Yes. I've presented my work. Every year I Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 215 of 289 747 AMCCABE - DIRECT 1 go to the annual Society of Tox icology meeting and 2 present my work in some form, w hether as a poster or 3 as a platform presentation. On a number of occasions, 4 I've presented at symposia. I' ve been invited to 5 institutions around the United States to present my 6 work in departmental seminar se ries and so forth. 7 Q And with respect to w hat you have 8 contributed to the literature i n the field of 9 immunotoxicology, can you give me an estimate of about 10 how many papers you have contri buted? 11 A I would have to look at my CV. The 12 majority, if not all, the paper s touch on topics 13 dealing with, directly dealing with immunotoxicology 14 or related to toxicologies. So it would be 35, 40 15 papers. 16 Q We'll turn now. We'r e shift focusing again 17 and now we're going to shift to your report that you 18 prepared in this case, and I ju st want to briefly 19 touch on your comments about Dr . Byers in the report. 20 Now most of the state ments are fairly 21 straightforward in this report. There is one that I 22 want to draw your attention to to explain what you 23 meant by that statement, and th at is in your 24 discussion of T-cells and T-reg ulatory cells in 25 particular, you described what Dr. Byers was saying Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 216 of 289 748 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 with respect to that as \"highly provocative.\" What 2 did you mean by that? 3 A Yes, I did, and what I noted from Dr. Byers' 4 testimony, that in addition to the comment about the 5 regulatory T-cells was her comm ent that she was 6 astonished by the number of pap ers dealing with the 7 topic of mercury in the immune system. 8 Keeping in mind that this is the area that I 9 work in and this is the literat ure that I -- I wasn't 10 astonished by it. This is the literature that I 11 contribute to. This is the lit erature that I read. 12 These are the grants that I rev iew prior to those 13 papers coming out and being pub lished. These are the 14 papers that I download to my la ptop and they're 15 scattered over the desk in my o ffice, so I have a 16 pretty good handle on what the literature is in this 17 area. 18 The statement that sh e made about the T- 19 regulatory cells is provocative because you have to 20 understand that T-regulatory ce lls are an emerging 21 population of T-cells, emerging in that it only 22 started to be discussed in the last five, six, seven 23 years, provocative because it t urns out that these T- 24 regulatory cells are very impor tant in or appear to be 25 very important in controlling a utoimmune diseases, at Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 217 of 289 749A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 least one mechanism that contro ls autoimmune diseases 2 as well as other hyperresponses or hyperactivities in 3 the system, including asthma an d allergies. So there 4 is great interest in mainstream immunology in this 5 topic of T-reg cells. 6 So I think any time i n this discipline that 7 there is an intersection, this discipline being 8 immunotoxicology, but there is an intersection of 9 toxic agents on an emerging con cept in immunology, 10 that's a pretty hot topic. It' s a hot topic in 11 immunology. It's something tha t's discussed in 12 immunotoxicology circles. 13 So if there was a siz able literature, I 14 think any literature on mercury specifically targeting 15 these T-reg cells, I would know about it, and these 16 papers just do not -- there are no papers that 17 specifically say that mercury t argets T-regs. 18 Q On that same theme, i n another part of your 19 report, you essentially say the re is no literature to 20 support her statement that merc ury influences 21 autoimmunity, causes autoreacti vity in T-cells in 22 humans. 23 A That's correct. 24 Q And I believe you hav e taken, in fact, I 25 know that you have a number of areas of dispute with Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 218 of 289 750 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 Dr. Byers with respect to the s tudies that she was 2 looking at, but I believe you s ynthesized your main 3 areas of dispute with respect t o one issue in 4 particular that you wanted to d iscuss here today, and 5 that would be -- 6 A It would be our slide 2. 7 Q If we could go to sli de 2. 8 THE COURT: And when we say slide 2, you're 9 referring to Respondent's Trial Exhibit No. 3, page 2. 10 THE WITNESS: Correct . 11 MR. MATANOSKI: Yes, ma'am. 12 THE COURT: All right . 13 BY MR. MATANOSKI: 14 Q Could you turn to tha t, Doctor, and could 15 you tell me, please, what you w ere trying to discuss 16 there with respect to your conc erns about the use of 17 this literature that Dr. Byers had put forward? 18 A In my opinion, I felt that Dr. Byers failed 19 to understand. She is correct, there is a sizable 20 literature that reports on merc ury modulating the 21 immune response in animal model s. Individuals who are 22 working in that area are intere sted in using mercury 23 as a tool to cause the immune m odulation to study 24 immune modulation. It's the ou tcome that they are 25 interested in. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 219 of 289 751A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 Remember that I told you earlier that the 2 scope of immunotoxicology encom passes research. It 3 encompasses research that can b e applied to risk 4 assessment issues. The people who are working in the 5 animal models, the mouse models of mercury modulation 6 of immunity, their work cannot readily be applied to 7 risk assessments, and I think D r. Byers didn't have an 8 appreciation for that. She had an appreciation of the 9 outcome. It's the attributes o f the disease that are 10 being studied. The individuals who are working in 11 this area are well aware that t hey are using very high 12 doses of mercury to elicit thes e changes. 13 Q They are interested i n studying, as you say, 14 the immune condition that they' ve created. They are 15 using the mercury as a means to create conditions they 16 can study the immune conditions . 17 A Exactly. And the rea son why it's a relevant 18 model outside the realm of risk assessment is because 19 it's an inducing model. It's n ot a genetic model. 20 Q Okay. Now you mentio ned dose with respect 21 to that, high dose. What kind of doses are we talking 22 about here that they are using in these mouse models? 23 A Page 2 provides -- th is is essentially in a 24 lot of papers where the approac hes are similar, and 25 it's a model of mercury and imm une disease where the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 220 of 289 752 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 dose of mercury, and if I'm tal king too close to the 2 microphone, how is that? 3 Q I think it's because you get close to the 4 microphone and you get more int erested in the topic. 5 But when I get off talking abou t your qualifications 6 and started talking about immun otoxicology, you 7 started zeroing right in on the microphone. 8 A In these studies, the approach is to inject 9 mice with relatively high doses of mercury. You see 10 there is a dose here of 1.6 mil ligram or kilogram. 11 This dose typically is given su bcutaneously to mice 12 two or three times a week over the course of four 13 weeks to 10 weeks, depending on the particular study 14 that's under investigation. 15 This graph takes a co nservative approach. 16 It makes an attempt to take the toxicology -- remember 17 we're talking about immunotoxic ology here, so just 18 take the toxicology component, how much mercury would 19 an 11 kilogram child at 15 mont hs need to be injected 20 with over a four-week period or how much would that be 21 over a four-week period twice a week. So it's a 22 conservative application, extra polation of what's in 23 the literature for the animal s tudy and then comparing 24 that to what they were exposed to for vaccination over 25 the course of the first 15 mont hs of life. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 221 of 289 753 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 So it's a comparison if I remember 2 correctly. For vaccination, it 's around 122.5 3 micrograms of mercury in Thimer osal in comparison to 4 1,000-fold to translate from th e mouse studies. 5 Q So, in other words, t he mouse studies that 6 she is looking at the dose ther e were essentially 7 1,000 times the dose -- 8 A That's correct. 9 Now, before we move o n here, just remember 10 again to be careful to talk abo ut the 11 immunotoxicology. What I mean by that is here I've 12 just offered an intellectual ex ercise that gets at the 13 issue of the toxicology, the do se of mercury. I 14 wouldn't accept even if exposed to human beings to 15 this high level of mercury that we use the same 16 features of the disease that we see in mice. It 17 simply has not been shown. 18 Nor would I accept th at over a long period 19 of time where an even lower dos e of mercury in 20 sensitive populations, what it means, that it would 21 elicit the features of the dise ase. Again, it just 22 simply hasn't been shown in hum an beings. 23 Q Now turning to Dr. By ers' discussion, she 24 did discuss the study by Goth, and you focused on that 25 paper in your expert report. I understand that that Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 222 of 289 754A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 is a particular area of interes t for you, what Dr. 2 Goth is doing. Could you expla in? 3 A Yes, I can explain wh y I'm interested in it 4 and in explaining why I'm inter ested in it hopefully 5 captures the appeal of this stu dy. 6 Interested in it beca use, as I told you, I 7 have a longstanding interest in signal transduction, 8 and Dr. Goth studied calcium si gnals as proven by ATP 9 as an agonist to elicit a chang e in the signaling 10 pathway in dendritic cells. So it's an in-vitro 11 approach to examine the signali ng pathway and show 12 that it was modulated by Thimer osal. 13 And I'm interested in that because I'm 14 generally interested in signali ng pathways, 15 particularly interested in it, including calcium 16 signaling pathways, and in fact have been doing 17 research on examining influence s of inorganic mercury 18 on lymphocyte signals. 19 What was important in that study and that 20 the senior author, as you menti oned, is Isaac Pessah 21 at the University of California at Davis, what was 22 done that was important in the study was to link these 23 changes in signal transduction, those changes in 24 signal transduction elicited by Thimerosal to a change 25 in cellular function, which was production of Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 223 of 289 755 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 interleukin 6, a single cytokin e. Goth linked A to B, 2 and what was novel was -- 3 Q In-vitro? 4 A In-vitro. And what w as novel was that it 5 was dendritic cells. We have k nown for some time that 6 Thimerosal provokes changes in calcium and other types 7 in other studies in-vitro. Aga in, remember that I 8 told you that we could use many of these chemicals as 9 tools. Thimerosal proves to be a good tool to elicit 10 changes in intercellular calciu m, and we've known that 11 for sometime. That was not new in Goth's study. He 12 showed it -- I have to apologiz e, I don't even know if 13 Goth is a he -- showed it in de ndritic cells and 14 linked A to B. 15 I commented on it fro m Dr. Byers' testimony 16 because from my reading of what she was doing, she was 17 linking A to B to Z, and to me as a scientist, I'm not 18 quite ready even to go to C. I accept the limitations 19 of the model, the in-vitro mode l that Goth and 20 colleagues were using. So what might seem like B, 21 show me that these changes in i nterleukin 6 production 22 have any outcome. Often cytoki nes are produced in 23 abundance.

Can you a sk me that question 20 again. 21 Q Sorry. Are you aware of any evidence that 22 would indicate that exposure to mercury would inhibit 23 the immune response to a measle s vaccine? 24 A No, I don't. 25 Q Now shifting focus ag ain, turning to the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 225 of 289 757 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 medical records in this case, d id you review the 2 records of Colten Snyder? 3 A Yes, I did. 4 Q And turning now to Dr . Bradstreet and his 5 report and testimony. Since yo u are involved in 6 immunotoxicology, I don't expec t you to step out of 7 that. Dr. Bradstreet talked ab out certain tests that 8 were done with respect to mercu ry in Colten Snyder, 9 and I would like to take you th rough those tests and 10 have you comment on them, pleas e. 11 The first such test - - well, it looks like I 12 guess you would classify four d ifferent category of 13 tests that were done -- blood, hair, urine and 14 porphyrin. Let's take the bloo d first. Can you tell 15 me what you can with the blood tests that were done 16 with Colten Snyder? 17 A If you turn to page 7 , you can see that over 18 the course of six and a half ye ars, this table 19 captures three of those categor ies that you just 20 mentioned, mercury in hair, uri ne, and blood. On five 21 occasions, blood samples were s ubmitted to the lab, 22 and on each of those occasions, the findings were that 23 the mercury level in the blood was essentially normal 24 in comparison to the reference range. Colten Snyder's 25 blood mercury levels were norma l in comparison to the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 226 of 289 758 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 reference range and oftentimes on the low end of the 2 low end of the normal spectrums . 3 Q What does that tell y ou? It doesn't tell 4 you anything necessarily? 5 A It tells me on those days, over the span of 6 six years or more, on those occ asions, he had a normal 7 level of mercury in his blood. 8 Q You were here to hear the testimony of Mrs. 9 Snyder in terms of the dietary intake? 10 A Yes. 11 Q Was there much mercur y mentioned in the 12 dietary intake? 13 A I'm not surprised tha t these levels are low. 14 The level of mercury they recei ved via vaccination is 15 low, and as Colten's mother tes tified on Monday, she 16 doesn't eat fish, which would b e a main dietary 17 source, maybe environmental sou rce of exposure to 18 methyl mercury and mercury, and so I'm not surprised 19 that the levels were low. 20 Q I don't think those w ere discussed very much 21 by Dr. Bradstreet, so we'll mov e on to something he 22 did spend a little bit of time on, and that was hair 23 tests as a measure of mercury. We had a little 24 discussion on that I believe, a nd Dr. Bradstreet, 25 there were some questions asked of him. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 227 of 289 759 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 First of all, can you tell us what does a 2 hair test for mercury measure? What does it actually 3 measure? Just to direct your c omments a little bit, 4 it seems to be postulated by Dr . Bradstreet that hair 5 can measure body level of mercu ry and perhaps the 6 excretion of mercury, whether t he body excreted 7 mercury properly. Now what doe s the measurement of 8 mercury in hair tell you? 9 A The measurement of me rcury in the hair is a 10 measure of exposure to an organ ic form of mercury, 11 either methyl mercury or ethyl mercury, typically not 12 falo (ph) mercury, there is ano ther form of organic 13 mercury, falo (ph) mercury that is usually metabolized 14 so quickly that it's not found in hair. So you're 15 talking about organic mercuries , methyl mercury, ethyl 16 mercury. Thimerosal, for examp le, can be metabolized 17 to ethyl mercury, so you might expect ethyl mercury to 18 be found in hair. 19 It's a proxy for merc ury found in blood at a 20 particular time. What do I mea n by that? Well, 21 remember that hair in some peop le, not me, grows at 22 about a rate of 1 centimeter pe r month, so you sample 23 the hair strands, maintain the orientation of that 24 hair strand so that you know wh ich end came proximate 25 to the scalp and which end is d istal to the scalp, and Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 228 of 289 760A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 then you can measure the mercur y content of the hair. 2 Typically, because of issues, h aircuts, things like 3 this, you'd be interested in se eing the hair that's 4 proximal to the scalp, and it g ives you a proxy for 5 measure mercury in blood at tha t particular time. 6 Now remember that hai r grows, then you 7 extend from that, and based on how far you go down on 8 the hair strand, you can get an assessment of 9 historical exposure. 10 Q Is hair a major sourc e, major route of 11 excretion of mercury from the b ody? 12 A It's a route of excre tion, but I don't think 13 it's a major route of excretion . 14 Q How are organic mercu ries excreted from the 15 body? 16 A Typically, they are e xcreted in the feces. 17 They also undergo what's called enterohepatic 18 circulation, and through that p rocess, the organic 19 mercury is converted to an inor ganic form of mercury 20 that can then reenter the blood stream and then be 21 excreted via the kidney. To be clear on this, the 22 mercury that you find in hair a nd other sites of 23 characterization, fingernails a nd toenails, is an 24 organic form of mercury, becaus e the methyl mercury 25 sistine complex mimics amino ac id, carotene being a Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 229 of 289 761 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 protein that puts a high demand on amino acids, and 2 that's why the organic material s appear in these 3 carotene places. 4 Q So, if I understand w hat you've been telling 5 us, you look at hair. It's alm ost like a history to 6 take a strand of hair. 7 A It can be used as a h istory. That's not 8 always the approach that's take n. Oftentimes it's 9 used to just give an indication of recent exposures. 10 And if I could just -- 11 Q Sure. 12 A It's well standardize d. We have good 13 reference values that we can th en relate that hair 14 level to blood levels of mercur y. 15 Q So it relates to bloo d levels too? 16 A It's a proxy for bloo d levels of mercury. 17 Q And does it tell us a nything about 18 necessarily what the body level of mercury is? 19 A Not necessarily. It tells us -- at that 20 point in time. 21 Q What point in time? 22 A Which that hair sampl e is representing. If 23 it's close to the scalp, then i t's within the last 24 month or so. If it's more dist al, then there are 25 calculations that would be made to try to determine Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 230 of 289 762 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 where in time are we talking ab out. So it can be used 2 as a measure of acute exposure. It also can be used 3 as a measure of -- which I thin k is the main reason -- 4 it can also be used as a measur e of the steady state 5 distribution of mercury between the tissues and the 6 blood. 7 Q Now the last area -- well, actually you've 8 compared the slide I believe. 9 A I did want to turn to page 3 if I could. 10 Q Yes. We prepared a s lide about what the 11 values were, and page 3, that's the Great Plains 12 Laboratory value for mercury. Now Dr. Bradstreet, as 13 I recall this, he stated he was surprised that this 14 was a low value. That was his view, and I guess it is 15 low on the reference range ther e, within the normal 16 range, right? Could you commen t on the absolute, in 17 absolute terms about these valu es? 18 A I'm not sure if I und erstand what you mean 19 by \"absolute values,\" but I wil l tell you that I agree 20 with Dr. Bradstreet's interpret ation that this is a 21 low value for mercury in hair b ased on the test 22 results. Every indication here , as you prepare that 23 mercury value of .1 part per mi llion to the reference 24 range, based on what I know abo ut other reference 25 ranges and other laboratories a nd what we expect, that Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 231 of 289 763 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 is indeed low. So I agree with his interpretation of 2 this particular data set. 3 He also noticed there is a variety of other 4 metals that are being analyzed here, but let's just 5 focus on mercury because that's what's at issue here. 6 If we turn to the nex t page, page 4, I have 7 prepared somewhat of a yardstic k to place this all 8 into perspective. So I agree w ith Dr. Bradstreet's 9 interpretation. What I don't a gree with is that Dr. 10 Bradstreet indicated that he wa s surprised by this 11 outcome, and I'm not surprised at it. Again, there is 12 no mercury going in. There is no exposure to mercury, 13 appreciable exposure to mercury via the diet as far as 14 we know from eating fish, and t he dose of Thimerosal 15 is not adequate to produce a hi gh mercury content in 16 hair. 17 Q And just to that last point, the dose of 18 Thimerosal, how many years are -- 19 A If I remember correct ly, Colten received his 20 MMR when he was 15 months old, so that would have been 21 in April of 1998, so two years before, and all other 22 vaccines that contained Thimero sal would have been 23 prior to that event. 24 Q Now, just getting bac k to hair, it's a 25 measurement of mercury in the c irculating blood, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 232 of 289 764 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 correct? 2 A Correct. 3 Q And it's based on whe re you're sampling the 4 hair from what time you're look ing at in terms of the 5 circulating blood. So unless y ou are looking at it I 6 guess two years ago, for exampl e, talking about 7 Thimerosal, it's not really rel evant to what you're 8 talking about and understanding ? 9 A That's correct. So i t's not a measure of 10 excretion of mercury into the h air. It's reflective 11 of what we have already seen in the blood data. All 12 right, the blood data, hair is a proxy for mercury in 13 blood. There is low levels of mercury in the hair. 14 There is low levels of mercury in the blood. The data 15 match. There is no mercury goi ng in as far as we can 16 tell, and so the data match. 17 Q Now, on this chart, y ou've plotted out some 18 other values. These were taken from other references 19 I take it primarily. 20 A That's correct. 21 Q On that chart, I want to draw your attention 22 to the 90 percent by U.S. child ren. 23 A Yes. 24 Q That's an average of what you would find in 25 mercury -- U.S. children, do yo u know what age range Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 233 of 289 765A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 this was? 2 A It's not average, it' s 90th percentile, and 3 it's from a study of U.S. child ren. I believe the age 4 ranges of those children were s ix to eight years old. 5 Q So in other words, in that study, 90 percent 6 of the U.S. children -- 7 A .4 parts per million are below. 8 Q Ninety percent of chi ldren in that age range 9 had .4 parts per million. And on the high end, you 10 listed some, another exposure o f -- 11 A The Iraqi Grain accid ent of the 1970, is 12 that what you're referring to? 13 Q Yes. 14 A I'm orienting myself to what you mean by 15 high. I would call it wicked h igh just so you know. 16 Q A common New England term. 17 A Yes. So yes, and I b elieve we heard about 18 this through the transcript fro m the Cedillo case. 19 Dr. Aposhian mentioned this and putting this in 20 perspective. It was an unfortu nate accident that 21 occurred in the 1970s where the grain, the seed was 22 coated with methyl mercury as a preservative. The 23 intent was to plant it, but the grain grew, and 24 unfortunately the people were h ungry and they ate what 25 was sent to them, and so it's a massive exposure as Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 234 of 289 766A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 you can see by this chart, expo sure to mercury. 2 You also see a peg do wn a value of 170 parts 3 per million. These are typical values that you would 4 find in sustenance fishing, peo ple who eat extreme 5 amounts of fish or have extreme amounts of fish in 6 their diet. And the point to m ake there is that it's 7 a dose issue again, right. Tho se are the extremes of 8 what we see in rare occurrence in select human 9 populations. The majority of p eople as you can see at 10 the bottom there, right, are do wn much lower, and a 11 point to make is Colten Snyder based on his hair 12 analysis is down on that. 13 As we walk up the yar dstick, we can see that 14 the majority of people, there i s a very tight 15 distribution of the amount of m ercury you would expect 16 to find in hair, anywhere from undetectable to 1.5 17 parts per million. Dr. Bradstr eet indicated that he 18 expected Colten's hair levels w ould be one, maybe 10 19 parts per million, and I took n ote of that. I just 20 didn't expect -- I was surprise d that that was his 21 expectation. 22 Let me tell you about 10 to 20 parts per 23 million. Ten to 20 parts per m illion based on some 24 ongoing epidemiological studies , which is the 25 Seychelles studies, also the Fa roe Island studies, Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 235 of 289 766B MCCABE - DIRECT 1 these are Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 236 of 289 767A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 studies examining nerve behavio ral outcomes in 2 children whose mothers are eati ng large levels of fish 3 and in some cases may produce h air mercury levels 4 again reflective of the mercury found in the blood, in 5 the 10 to 20 part per million. 6 The issue of 10 to 20 as you see as I've 7 written here is that that's whe re we begin to be 8 concerned about neurological de ficits due to prenatal 9 exposures. Ten to 20 means abo ut a 5 percent increase 10 in risk of some cognitive defec ts. High-level 11 exposures in sustenance fish, t he Iraqi Grain accident 12 in the '70s, different story. That's just toxic. 13 Ten to 20, you see mo re subtle effects, but 14 the issue is that it's mom's ex posure. These are 15 levels of mercury found in mom. Remember, it's a 16 measure of mercury in blood tha t methyl mercury can 17 even cross the placenta, placen tal barrier, and the 18 child is exposed, the fetus is exposed. 19 Q In that range, how mu ch mercury were they 20 taking in? 21 A I'll do it this way i f you will accept this 22 answer. I mean, there are stud ies showing, for 23 example, in a Swedish populatio n eating four fish 24 meals a week over an extended p eriod of time, that 25 would reflect a hair mercury le vel of around 6.6 parts Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 237 of 289 768 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 per million, 6 or more, I think it's the same thing, 2 about 6.6. I believe it was 6. 6 parts per million in 3 that particular group. So agai n, and if you follow 4 this issue at all, just the lay literature of the 5 issue of restricting your fish intake during 6 pregnancy, that makes sense. 7 Q So just to sum up the n and make sure I 8 understand it, essentially what 's going on is where 9 intake of mercury is reflected at the time in 10 circulating blood and therefore they sample the hair 11 close to the scalp, you can use the hair to measure 12 what's going on in the circulat ing blood which you 13 needed coming in in order for i t to be reflected in 14 the hair at all, and what these are telling you, what 15 I'm taking for your testimony i s the more you have 16 coming in the higher it is in t he hair. The less you 17 have coming in the lower it is in the hair. 18 A Exactly what I would expect. Correct. 19 Q The third test that w as mentioned by Dr. 20 Bradstreet was the urine test f or mercury, and turn to 21 this now, turn to slide 5 that you prepared. What 22 does the value there indicate? Dr. Staterly had done 23 tests, and I think there is a l ittle bit of background 24 you need to talk about here to understand this. Was 25 this mercury test sort of a ste ady state like usual? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 238 of 289 769A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 A Sure. So let me ask you to take a quick 2 peak at page 7 again just to re mind us. We talk about 3 an individual test, but let's l ook at the big picture 4 at the same time. 5 Q Okay. 6 A That there were three different tests of 7 mercury in the urine. The one back on page 5 is 8 notable because this is the onl y test, analysis of 9 mercury in Colten Snyder that t he Petitioners claim 10 was abnormal. So that's why I call it out on slide 11 No. 5. 12 The test involves mea suring mercury. This 13 is a measure of mercury ion in the urine, and you can 14 see down at the lower left-hand corner, which is 15 comments that this is a postpro vocative challenge, 16 meaning that he was chelating. In all of these tests 17 for the urine mercury analysis, the appropriate 18 procedure would be to establish a baseline, establish 19 a baseline in the absence of ch elation. What does a 20 chelator do? A chelator is pul ling the mercury out of 21 the kidney and it's showing up in the urine. 22 That's not what they did here. They didn't 23 provide us with a baseline leve l of mercury, but 24 provide a drug that we would ex pect to increase the 25 mercury in the urine. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 239 of 289 770 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 THE WITNESS: Special Master, on Monday, you 2 asked a question about the calc ulation, the 3 conversion. 4 THE COURT: I wasn't so far off as I thought 5 I was. 6 THE WITNESS: So I pr ovide that for you, and 7 it's based on normalizing the 1 1 micrograms per 8 gramian (ph) to the gramian (ph ) levels, which are 9 also given on the data. We hav e the doctor's data 10 asterisked down on the bottom l eft-hand corner of the 11 chart. It calculates out to be about 2.2 microgram 12 per liter, which if I remember my analytical chemistry 13 correctly, a part per million i s a milligram per 14 liter, which would make this 2. 2 parts per billion. 15 THE COURT: And if yo u were converting that 16 to parts per million? 17 THE WITNESS: It woul d be a thousandfold. 18 It would be 2,000 -- sorry, the other direction. Move 19 the decimal point three places to the left, so it 20 would be .00022 parts per milli on. 21 THE COURT: Which are lower than the 22 prechelation level in hair. 23 THE WITNESS: Sure. But we can't compare 24 levels in hair to the levels in urine. 25 THE COURT: Understan d. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 240 of 289 771A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 THE WITNESS: Right. So having made that 2 calculation and having describe d my reservation about 3 how they went about doing this as they didn't do a 4 before and after, if we turn to page 6, this is a 5 table taken from a publication of Dr. Woods, James 6 Woods. I believe it's cited as reference No. 5 in my 7 report, and you can see just to orient you to this 8 table, there is a measure of ur inary mercury levels, 9 urinary porphyrin levels both b efore and after 10 chelation. The chelation time period here was six 11 hours, or rather the time perio d before and after was 12 around six hours. 13 What's important abou t the table is that 14 there is a comparison between a n expected occupational 15 exposure to mercury of the dent al technicians versus 16 presumed normal members of the population, nondental 17 personnel. If we borrow the ur inary mercury levels in 18 the nondental population, you s ee that it's reported 19 to be 3 micrograms per liter. 20 And if we take that d ata and we compare it 21 to what we find in Colten Snyde r postprovocation, 22 postchelation, it gives us a va lue, a comparison of 2 23 micrograms per liter at the tim e of what's being 24 claimed to be the single test s howing evidence of 25 heightened mercury exposure wit h other presumably Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 241 of 289 772 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 normal people. 2 You can also see from this table the 3 approach that I'm asking for, a before and an after 4 approach, and you can also see that if we use this 5 value of 3 micrograms per liter in the before column 6 for nondental personnel, the no rmals, and we apply 7 that to the doctor's data value s on page 5, my 8 suspicion is that the reference range used by the 9 doctor's data is not a postprov ocative challenge 10 reference range. The value of Colten Snyder's mercury 11 isn't really all that high afte r challenge. It's 12 certainly not high if you apply the correct reference 13 range to interpret the data. 14 BY MR. MATANOSKI: 15 Q As far as reference r ange, you were pointing 16 out that you actually -- I take it that you're 17 pointing out that if you chelat e somebody, you expect 18 to be drawing out mercury. 19 A Chelate someone, I ex pect to be drawing out 20 metals, including mercury. 21 Q I'm sorry. Thank you . And it appears 22 that -- 23 A May I? 24 Q Sure. 25 A Expect to be drawing out metals, including Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 242 of 289 773A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 mercury independent of whether or not there is a 2 problem with the normal excreti on of mercury from the 3 kidney. 4 Q Now this value then w ould seem actually -- 5 again, it's not surprisingly hi gh. 6 A Correct. 7 Q In fact, if anything, it's lower. 8 A I'm not impressed wit h that telling us there 9 was even a single measurement s howing heightened 10 mercury in the urine. 11 Q Is it consistent with what we know in terms 12 of the essentially fairly low i ntake of mercury by 13 this child? 14 A Yes, it is. It's con sistent with all of the 15 other nine measures of mercury in hair, urine and 16 blood, so it's not an outlier. It's not. 17 Q Turn to the last test that we discussed, 18 porphyrin. In toxicology, are urinary porphyrin 19 profiles used to measure the le vel of mercury? 20 A No, they are not. 21 Q Now, to prepare for a response to Dr. 22 Bradstreet, I understand you re viewed some of the work 23 of Dr. Woods that he had refere nced. I think at the 24 end of your report, you list th e three articles of Dr. 25 Woods that you were reading. C an you describe to me a Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 243 of 289 774 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 summary of what those articles say to you? 2 A Yes. Dr. Woods' rese arch represents a work 3 in progress. This is something that is ongoing. I 4 know he's been at it for quite some time. At least 5 one of these references goes ba ck to 1991. I believe 6 he's been working in this area prior to then. Much of 7 his work deals with the use of urinary porphyrins and 8 the measurement of urinary porp hyrins using HPLC 9 detection method. 10 The use of the measur e of urinary porphyrins 11 following prolonged high exposu res to mercury in an 12 animal model, rats, and human p opulations, as you saw 13 the table that I showed, high o ccupational exposures. 14 Two modifiers that are importan t. Long exposure, high 15 exposures to mercury. 16 Q What else has the stu dy shown us or these 17 series of studies shown us in t erms of what he's 18 finding in his study of the pop ulation? 19 A Well, a few things, m uch of it interesting, 20 but there appears to be a signa ture profile as I think 21 you described it for porphyrins found, unique 22 porphyrins found in urine, one of which particularly 23 emphasizes -- there is a unique porphyrin called 24 precoproporphyrin, and it appea rs that this particular 25 porphyrin does serve as a marke r of the urinary Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 244 of 289 775A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 mercury level and presumably th e kidney mercury level, 2 again under the constraints of these high, prolonged 3 exposures, and you see that act ually in the table that 4 I borrowed to make my other poi nt. 5 If we go back to page 6, then you can see 6 that there is somewhat of a cor relation between 7 urinary mercury levels measured on the left-hand side 8 and the urinary porphyrins meas ured on the right-hand 9 side. You can see the before-a nd-after approach is 10 important, before-and-after app roach that he's taken, 11 that these porphyrin measuremen ts are responsive to 12 chelation and that -- again, th e porphyrin bodies can 13 reflect the mercury burden in t he kidney, presumably 14 the mercury burden of the kidne y because we're looking 15 at mercury in the urine as an i ndication of what that 16 burden would be. Again, high e xposures, prolonged 17 exposures. 18 Q So looking at the pop ulation, high exposure 19 long term is finding a signatur e porphyrin profile, 20 primarily precoproporphyrins. 21 A Yes. 22 Q And he's also noticin g after chelation there 23 seems to be a correlation of ch elation drawing out 24 some of the mercury from the ki dney, it's a 25 correlation between the levels of mercury and the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 245 of 289 776 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 precoproporphyrins. 2 A Correct. So he's doi ng all the things that 3 I would expect him to do to dem onstrate that this is a 4 reliable marker of mercury burd en in the model systems 5 that he's working with. 6 Q So essentially it bec omes one of the tests 7 then to use as a marker? 8 A It may. 9 Q Now I'm going to ask you to assume, because 10 this is what Dr. Bradstreet did , okay, and I'm going 11 to ask you to make the same ass umptions Dr. 12 Bradstreet, what Dr. Bradstreet assumed, that the work 13 of Dr. Woods with respect to po rphyrins is valid, 14 okay, that there is a link betw een burden at least in 15 kidney, and I have no doubt you 'd restrict it to a 16 certain population. Dr. Bradst reet applied it to 17 Colten Snyder, so it applies to Colten Snyder. Dr. 18 Woods' work is applicable here. It's accurate, so 19 that we could expect that the p recoproporphyrins or 20 the porphyrin profile in Colten would behave the same 21 way as in the population that h e -- 22 A Let me make sure I un derstand. 23 Q Okay. 24 A And make sure that yo u understand what my 25 reservations are in answering y our question. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 246 of 289 777 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 Q All right. 2 A So, first of all, I d on't have any issue 3 that Dr. Woods' work is valid. I believe his work is 4 valid. You're asking me have I seen anything in his 5 work that says that this approa ch is applicable to low 6 level mercury exposures. 7 Q Actually I'm not, and I'm sorry I confused 8 you. What I want you to do is essentially step in the 9 shoes of Dr. Bradstreet. 10 A Okay. 11 Q What I would like you to do is to 12 essentially say, I'm going to a ccept that 13 precoproporphyrins, I can look at them in Colten 14 Snyder and figure out something about his mercury body 15 burden, and I can make calculat ions or conclusions 16 about it based on Dr. Woods' wo rk. 17 Now that requires you as I understand not 18 only to make that leap, make th at assumption with 19 respect to Dr. Woods' work as u sed in this case, but 20 also it means that you're going to have to take the 21 values that we have here as acc urate. 22 A Right. So you're ask ing me to make this 23 assumption, but also I offer th at I do have 24 reservations about the lab. I' ll make the assumption, 25 put those reservations aside. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 247 of 289 778 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 Q The reservation about the lab. 2 A About the lab side. Can we learn anything 3 from the porphyrin profiles, th e three porphyrin 4 profiles conducted on Colten Sn yder? 5 I'm not so sure that we can if I apply Dr. 6 Woods' findings to the porphyri n data, and the 7 porphyrin data appears on page 8, 9 and 10 of the 8 handout, and I believe these ha ve been placed in 9 chronological order beginning w ith the measurements 10 that were taken on the 11th of July of 2002 on page 8. 11 Page 9 is the 15th of September in 2006, and the last 12 page is reported as July 26, 20 07, but my 13 understanding is the actual sam ples were taken in 14 January of 2007. 15 So over the course of , what would that be, a 16 year and a half, a year and a h alf, over the course of 17 a year and a half, there were t hree samples sent to 18 his laboratory in France to per form what appears to be 19 a fairly specialized test. Thi s is not something 20 that's done in many laboratorie s, which perhaps 21 explains the samples being sent to this laboratory in 22 France. 23 Based on Dr. Woods' w ork, in the 24 precoproporphyrin measurements over time, what he 25 showed was you take his animal studies -- again, the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 248 of 289 779 MCCABE - DIRECT 1 rats were exposed typically to 10 parts per million 2 methyl mercury for six weeks if I'm remembering 3 correctly his 1991 paper that I cited -- exposed for a 4 long period of time to these hi gh levels of methyl 5 mercury, and then the exposure was stopped. Then the 6 urine samples were collected an d the porphyrin values, 7 the porphyrins were measured. 8 Over time, you would expect based on his 9 research that the porphyrin val ues would decrease, 10 particularly for the signature porphyrin, 11 precoproporphyrin. I mentioned a signature porphyrin 12 a couple of times here, at leas t I think I did, the 13 signature precoproporphyrin. Y ou will notice on each 14 of these tests, the three dates that I am referring 15 to, is that not only does the s ignature porphyrin 16 change, but all of the porphyri ns were changing, so in 17 the data, I'm not seeing the si gnature. That's one 18 issue. 19 The other issue is th at over the course of 20 time, I'm not seeing the porphy rin lines change. Now 21 remember, the exposure to mercu ry occurred eight years 22 ago, so I'm surprised, and what 's most surprising, and 23 again, this is in comparison to the table that I 24 showed you from Dr. Woods' publ ication, that Colten 25 Snyder was chelated during this period of time, and Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 249 of 289 780A MCCABE - DIRECT 1 you would expect the chelation will be changing his 2 porphyrin lines, and they are n ot changing. And so it 3 again makes me suspicious that these data are true and 4 a representative indication of the mercury burden in 5 this individual or that this ap proach can be used as a 6 reliable indicator of that merc ury burden, and I 7 emphasize reliable indicator be cause I have to step in 8 Dr. Bradstreet's shoes. That's what he said. 9 Q So in other words, if you were to assume, 10 make an assumption that Dr. Woo ds' work can be applied 11 here, you assume this lab, this is not following the 12 pattern that should be followed based on Dr. Woods' 13 tests? 14 A Correct. And the rea son why I think it's 15 not fitting the pattern is beca use it's not a valid 16 assumption, that it can be appl ied to a low level 17 exposure. 18 Q The other reservation that you have too, you 19 have another reservation with r espect to the actual 20 values from the lab. 21 A Yes. I had some rese rvations about some 22 issues with the lab, that's cor rect. 23 MR.

I don't recall that I reviewed those. I may Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 252 of 289 783 MCCABE - CROSS 1 have. The safe answer is I thi nk not. 2 Q Okay. And in all ser iousness, if you don't 3 know something, I'm comfortable with the answer that 4 you don't know. I certainly do n't want you to be 5 speculating or guessing here. 6 A Sure. I understand. 7 Q Now you've also cited some literature, I 8 think it's five citations in yo ur expert report, and 9 you discussed all the work in y our CV. Aside from the 10 Cedillo materials that you desc ribed, the literature 11 that you specifically cite here and generally the 12 literature that's available to you in your area of 13 expertise, anything else that y ou were examining in 14 order to prepare for your testi mony? 15 A I think nothing espec ially since you gave me 16 the umbrella term of the litera ture that's available. 17 So yes, I can do a PubMed searc h and find many papers. 18 Nothing specialized for that. 19 Q Okay. Great. Now I have a question about 20 this immune dysregulation issue . At what level of 21 mercury exposure would you expe ct to see some form of 22 immune dysregulation? 23 A Ask me the question a gain, please. 24 Q Sure. At what level of mercury exposure 25 might you expect to see some fo rm of immune Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 253 of 289 784 MCCABE - CROSS 1 dysregulation? And this is in humans. We're not 2 talking about in-vitro, animal models. Specifically 3 humans. 4 A It's a difficult ques tion to answer and I'm 5 not hedging in my answer. Ther e is literature looking 6 at exposure, chiefly in occupat ional exposures. I'm 7 thinking of papers with, for ex ample, the urine 8 mercury level. Remember these would be in 9 occupational exposure, so you w ould expect in the 10 target populations quite high l evels, and those are 11 around 50 microgram per liter m ercury present in the 12 urine. 13 And the studies are n ot very sophisticated, 14 which is why I stay away from t hose types of 15 approaches, because you can't a sk as interesting 16 questions. The studies are not very sophisticated in 17 that the approaches to, well, c ount subtypes of 18 lymphocytes, subtypes of T-cell s or B-cells and K- 19 cells. 20 Q And you correlate tho se counts through -- 21 A Correlate those chang ed -- correct, you 22 correlate the changes in counts to the mercury 23 exposure level. 24 Now you asked me how much mercury would you 25 need to be exposed to. I can't speak to that based on Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 254 of 289 785 MCCABE - CROSS 1 the literature. I can speak to in those types of 2 reports what are the reported u rine mercury values, 3 for example. I can tell you th at in over half a dozen 4 papers that come to mind in the unsophisticated 5 approach that's taken that the data are all over the 6 place. Some of them show incre ases in T-cell numbers, 7 decreases in T-cell numbers. I t's not a very 8 sophisticated approach as I've told you because it 9 doesn't say anything about the functionality of those 10 cells. 11 If I use a model that I discussed earlier, 12 it's essentially an A and B app roach, connect A to B, 13 and it's limited in that it's d ifficult to take a view 14 of that. You can speculate wha t it might be. It's 15 difficult to put that speculati on into a cogent 16 argument here because the value s in individual papers 17 vary. 18 Q Do you have a sense t hen of what the range 19 of values are across some of th ose individual papers? 20 I mean, you used an example of 50 micrograms per liter 21 for urine samples, and that's 5 0 micrograms of mercury 22 in the urine, correct? 23 A Correct. Correct. 24 Q That's one number. D o you have a sense in 25 the published literature that y ou're familiar with Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 255 of 289 786 MCCABE - CROSS 1 what range of urine mercury wou ld you expect to see in 2 an immune dysregulation respons e? 3 A I don't know that tha t literature supports 4 that it's an immune dysregulati on, so I am not willing 5 to say that a change in lymphoc yte numbers is 6 equivalent to an immune dysregu lation. The immune 7 system is more complicated than that. You can't 8 simply count the cells, so that 's a caveat to the 9 answer I'm giving. 10 From the literature, these are papers that 11 have been in the literature for quite some time. I 12 haven't reviewed the details of many of those papers, 13 of all of these papers recently . I don't know what 14 the range would be. I would no t be surprised that 15 many of them -- two come to min d, 150 microgram per 16 deciliter, another in the 40s. 17 Q The 40s. You also me ntioned that one of the 18 limitations of these studies is they generally do 19 little more than count cells. 20 A Correct. 21 Q Are you familiar with any studies that 22 examine mercury exposure and im mune regulation or 23 immune response that do more th an count cells? 24 A In humans? 25 Q Yes. And if so, at w hat sort of levels Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 256 of 289 787 MCCABE - CROSS 1 would you expect to see a respo nse based on exposure? 2 A Nothing that's coming to mind right now. 3 Nothing that's coming to mind r ight now. 4 Q I want to shift gears a little bit and talk 5 about immune issues and talk a little bit about some 6 of the mercury issues that rela te to these various 7 tests. I noticed in your exper t report, you mentioned 8 that Dr. Woods' work shows that heightened urine 9 porphyrins may be a marker foll owing exposure to high 10 level, prolonged exposure to hi gh levels of methyl 11 mercury. 12 A That's correct. 13 Q Are you aware of publ ications, including 14 publications perhaps by Dr. Woo ds, of other forms of 15 mercury other than methyl? 16 A Yes, and I would expe ct based on how I know 17 that mercury is handled that ot her forms of mercury 18 showing up in the kidney as the mercury ion would 19 respond, would show altered pro files. In my expert 20 report, I am referring to his a nimal studies with the 21 rats where he had exposed the r ats for a long period 22 of time, as I indicated on dire ct. 23 Q Yes, and that's just what I wanted to 24 clarify because it gave me the impression when I read 25 it that you were excluding othe r forms of mercury, but Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 257 of 289 788 MCCABE - CROSS 1 in fact that is not the case. 2 A You are correct. In the application of Dr. 3 Woods' research to the matters before this Court and 4 this case, the issue of speciat ion of mercury is not 5 an issue that I meant to make, but the issues of a lot 6 of exposure and high exposure I think remain. 7 Q Yes. Yes, and the sp ecie issue you talk 8 about a little bit also. It is something that we 9 should at least touch on. In f act, let's start 10 talking about it now a little b it, the different forms 11 of mercury. 12 Now my understanding is that when Thimerosal 13 is injected into somebody, Thim erosal, one of the 14 breakdown products is ethyl mer cury, correct? 15 A That's correct. 16 Q And ethyl mercury is an organic form of 17 mercury. 18 A That's correct. 19 Q And peer-reviewed pub lished literature over 20 the last couple of years indica tes that ethyl mercury 21 has a greater likelihood of bei ng deposited in the 22 brain than does methyl mercury. That's the Burbacher 23 study, is that correct? 24 A I have seen the Burba cher study. I have not 25 looked at it more recently. My understanding aside Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 258 of 289 789 MCCABE - CROSS 1 from the Burbacher study is tha t you are correct in 2 that Thimerosal is broken down into ethyl mercury. 3 Ethyl mercury, the comparisons are always made between 4 the toxic kinetics, the movemen t of mercury in 5 different tissues of the body, the comparisons are 6 often made between ethyl mercur y and methyl mercury. 7 Ethyl mercury is broken down in to mercury plus 2 more 8 quickly than methyl mercury. 9 So ask me your questi on again just so I make 10 sure I don't go off on a tangen t here that's 11 irrelevant to answer your quest ion. 12 Q The question was, and I appreciate your 13 getting to the speciation of th e Hg+2 because that 14 Hg+2 that ethyl mercury tends t o break down into in 15 the body, as Dr. Burbacher poin ts out, tends to be 16 deposited in the brain, not in the form of ethyl 17 mercury but in the form of an i nner -- 18 A Well, it wouldn't get into the brain as 19 mercury plus 2. 20 Q But once in the brain , it would be -- 21 A Once in the brain, as in all tissues of the 22 body, ethyl mercury would break down more rapidly into 23 mercury plus 2, and mercury plu s 2 being the ultimate 24 toxic species of mercury as mos t metal toxicologists 25 believe. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 259 of 289 790 MCCABE - CROSS 1 More methyl mercury g ets into the brain than 2 ethyl mercury. Since ethyl mer cury breaks down more 3 quickly, if you compare the tot al mercury level 4 between methyl mercury and ethy l mercury, you will 5 find more methyl mercury, more total mercury in the 6 brain in the case of methyl mer cury. You will find 7 equivalent levels of mercury pl us 2 because the ethyl 8 mercury that gets into the brai n is broken down to 9 mercury plus 2 more rapidly. 10 Q And then the mercury plus 2 that's in the 11 brain, that's mercury at that p oint behind the blood- 12 brain barrier. 13 A Correct. 14 Q So that's mercury tha t is not going to be 15 excreted through the hair, for example, correct? 16 A You would not expect that to be readily 17 exchangeable and appear back in the blood and be 18 detected in hair as a measure o f the mercury that was 19 found in blood. 20 Q Okay. 21 A Correct. 22 Q I think I follow that . 23 A You're asking me abou t the excretion of 24 mercury at the hair, and I'm te lling you that the 25 measure of mercury in hair is a proxy for the mercury Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 260 of 289 791 MCCABE - CROSS 1 that's in the blood. 2 Q And that's the exact term you used in -- 3 A It's a proxy for the organic mercury that's 4 present, because remember it's not going to be in the 5 hair unless it's in the organic form. 6 Q And that's what I was trying to get at. And 7 I will try to ask direct questi ons only because we can 8 make this a lot quicker. My on ly question was the 9 Hg+2 that's in the brain, the p resence of that form of 10 mercury in the brain will not b e detected on hair 11 tests, correct? 12 A That's correct. 13 Q It will not be detect ed in urine tests, 14 correct? 15 A That's correct. 16 Q It would not be detec ted in blood tests, 17 correct? 18 A That's correct. 19 Q It wouldn't be in any other excretory 20 pathways where one might expect to find mercury, 21 feces, fingernails, that sort o f thing. You just 22 wouldn't see it being excreted. 23 A That's correct. 24 Q Okay. And we know th at the mercury, Hg+2 25 that's in the brain, deposited in there according to Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 261 of 289 792 MCCABE - CROSS 1 Burbacher has an indeterminant efflux, isn't that 2 right? 3 A Correct. 4 Q So none of the testin g that you've discussed 5 today, the blood tests, the uri ne test, all the work 6 that Jeff Bradstreet was doing, none of these tests 7 would be informative about the presence of Hg+2 in 8 Colten Snyder at any point in h is life because this is 9 all based on excretion. 10 A If I may, and if I am spiraling away from 11 answer your question, you certa inly will stop me. 12 You're making the assumption th at there is a 13 particular affinity for Thimero sal going to the brain 14 and not in any of these other t issues where it would 15 be metabolized, so it would be metabolized and would 16 then be readily measurable, for example, in the kidney 17 or in the urine. 18 Q Oh, yes. That was th e point. 19 A I just want to make s ure that in my 20 answering these questions right that there is no way 21 of assessing because it all wen t to the brain, and 22 there is no measure, and there is no noninvasive 23 measure to detect the mercury t hat's in the brain, 24 that we don't have any way of e valuating the exposure 25 of mercury that occurred.

That's correct. 18 Q And by being porphyri nogenic, it changes the 19 typically excretory profile of the porphyrins that are 20 being thrown off by this synthe tic cycle, correct? 21 A Correct. 22 Q And so Dr. Woods has posited that if you can 23 then analyze the porphyrin leve ls of somebody who has 24 been exposed to mercury and som ebody who is not 25 exposed, you'll see a different expression in the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 264 of 289 795 MCCABE - CROSS 1 ratio of the various porphyrins . You have an 2 expectation for an unexposed po pulation based on what 3 we know about the natural exces s. You would then 4 see -- this is why it's a signa ture -- that the 5 mercury gets into some of those steps and disrupts the 6 ratio of porphyrin that are rel eased, correct? 7 A That's my understandi ng. That's correct. 8 Q And that's measurable . 9 A Keeping in mind that the porphyrin profile 10 that's present in urine can als o be modulated by other 11 metals and by other toxic agent s. 12 Q Oh, absolutely. Abso lutely. I think that's 13 really the body of this work th at's very clear, that 14 in fact his mercury model actua lly follows upon a lead 15 model, and so we're sort of lea rning what we learn 16 about lead, we then learn thing s about mercury, and 17 this is a way to do it because this is urine testing. 18 A Absolutely correct. 19 Q And Dr. Woods has als o published work 20 indicating and associating vari ous levels of 21 porphyrinia with some behaviora l -- this is some of 22 the dental studies. Are you fa miliar with those? 23 MR. MATANOSKI: I'm g oing to object to going 24 into that just because we certa inly haven't been going 25 into that on direct.

POWERS: 10 Q So the question was a re you familiar with 11 the literature of Dr. Woods tha t looks to associate 12 porphyrinia that he claims is s ignificant for mercury 13 exposure to behavioral in denta l workers? Are you 14 familiar with those? 15 A Yes, I'm familiar wit h it. I'll tell you as 16 an immunotoxicologist with expe rtise also in metal 17 toxicology, the aspects of thos e papers that dealt 18 with the neuro outcomes I don't remember. That's not 19 my area that I was interested i n those particular 20 papers. 21 Q So you were intereste d in the toxicology 22 aspect and not the neurological outcome aspects? 23 A I wouldn't say I was completely 24 disinterested. I'm telling you that if you're going 25 to ask me questions about the n eurological outcomes in Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 266 of 289 797 MCCABE - CROSS 1 those papers, I don't remember. 2 Q I was just asking -- 3 A So the answer is yes, I'm aware that he's 4 made and he's attempting to mak e connections between 5 the mercury exposure, the porph yrin profiles and the 6 neuro behavior outcome as is be ing done in this case, 7 the same. 8 Q On your slide No. 4, this is out of the 9 blue, but I'm wondering -- this is a math question. 10 A And it's asking me fo r a password here. Oh, 11 I see. 12 Q I don't think we need the slide. It's slide 13 4. 14 A Yes. 15 Q The hair mercury leve ls are being measured 16 in parts per million. 17 A Yes. 18 Q Is there any way to e xtrapolate from parts 19 per million of mercury in a hai r sample into 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight assuming you 21 knew how much a subject weighed ? 22 A You would extrapolate these data to 23 micrograms per gram of hair. I believe you would 24 measure the hair. 25 Q But you would be able to make an Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 267 of 289 798 MCCABE - CROSS 1 extrapolation to body weight? 2 A You would be able to do that once you knew 3 what the body weight of the sub ject was and the weight 4 of the hair. I think you could make that kind of a 5 thing. 6 Q And it's not just an abstract question I 7 asked because so often in the l iterature relating to 8 Thimerosal and mercury that is the unit of measure. 9 It's micrograms of the target p er kilogram of body 10 weight. 11 A Correct. 12 Q I'm not going to ask you to do any 13 conversions, but if you think t hat it's possible to do 14 that, that's informative for me down the road. 15 A Yes, and I see that i n the literature as 16 well. 17 Q Okay. Now the variou s tests that Dr. 18 Bradstreet performed that you w ere discussing, these 19 tests all were two years later from the date of Colten 20 Snyder's last known Thimerosal exposure, is that 21 correct? 22 A I believe that is cor rect. Yes, that's 23 correct. 24 Q So none of the data t hat's presented in any 25 of these tables is informative as to Colten Snyder's Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 268 of 289 799 MCCABE - CROSS 1 body the day that he received t he MMR vaccine back in 2 1998, is that correct? 3 A That's correct. I th ink I made that point. 4 Q One wouldn't expect t o find it. 5 A That's correct. 6 MR. POWERS: I have n othing further. 7 THE COURT: Okay. Ju st to follow up on 8 that, if I inject a set amount of ethyl mercury in the 9 form of Thimerosal into a 11 ki lo baby, and let's 10 assume none of it's excreted, i t's going to be a 11 different burden than when that child weighs 50 12 pounds, a different percentage of his body weight. 13 THE WITNESS: Correct . 14 THE COURT: So what h e got when he was two 15 months, four months, six months doesn't really 16 translate into what you would e xpect to see in terms 17 of urine level, hair level or b lood level here? 18 THE WITNESS: Sure, s ure. That's correct, 19 it doesn't. Right. I think th e answer is yes. 20 THE COURT: All right . 21 THE WITNESS: So the issue is that I don't 22 see any evidence of high mercur y burden. 23 THE COURT: Now let's talk about mercury 24 levels. You indicated, and I a m aware that you cannot 25 translate urine levels into hai r levels or blood Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 269 of 289 800 MCCABE - CROSS 1 levels, but is there a conversi on measure that is 2 used, that is, blood mercury le vels are generally so 3 many times greater than urine l evels? That's a 4 question. 5 THE WITNESS: That's a question. Certainly 6 there are conversion factors fo r blood levels of 7 mercury and levels you would fi nd in hair. 8 THE COURT: And it's roughly equal. 9 THE WITNESS: It's ro ughly around 1 to 250. 10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 THE WITNESS: Most of the mercury that's in 12 the blood is associated with th e red blood cells. It 13 makes the plasma that's importa nt because the plasma 14 fraction is the fraction that's readily exchangeable 15 in tissues. The plasma convers ion to hair is around 1 16 to 2,500. 17 THE COURT: But you'r e not familiar off the 18 top of your head with any conve rsion of blood level to 19 urine level? 20 THE WITNESS: Off the top of my head, no, I 21 am not. 22 THE COURT: Okay. Th at's fine. 23 THE WITNESS: The con version factor for hair 24 to blood I see in a number of t he literature that I'm 25 reading, so I don't know. I'm not aware of it off the Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 270 of 289 801 MCCABE - CROSS 1 top of my head, and I don't kno w of one available. 2 And why would that be just if I may? Why 3 might that be and why would it make sense is that as 4 the kidney being the ultimate o rgan that mercury plus 5 2 is going to, right, it's goin g to move from the 6 kidney into the urine. 7 THE COURT: Okay. An d ethyl mercury has 8 more of an affinity for the kid ney, is that correct? 9 THE WITNESS: I don't know that. 10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 THE WITNESS: I don't know if that's 12 correct. 13 THE COURT: Okay. Ho w do the methyl and 14 ethyl mercury half-lives or hal f-times in the body 15 compare? 16 THE WITNESS: The hal f-times? 17 THE COURT: That is, if I inject the same 18 amount of ethyl mercury versus methyl mercury, ethyl 19 mercury into one individual, me thyl mercury into 20 another individual or group of individuals, looking at 21 excretion patterns. 22 THE WITNESS: Yes. I 'm thinking of two 23 pieces of information that come to mind, and it's not 24 a side-by-side type study in an swering your question. 25 THE COURT: I underst and, but we usually Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 271 of 289 802A MCCABE - CROSS 1 don't inject either into people deliberately anyway. 2 THE WITNESS: Oh, inj ection of methyl 3 mercury versus exposure. 4 THE COURT: Yes. I'm looking at similar 5 modes, so whether we use ingest ion, whether we use 6 subcutaneous injection, and doe s it differ between 7 those two. 8 THE WITNESS: So that I also have to offer 9 the two studies that I'm thinki ng about. So methyl 10 mercury, I have in my head that the half-life of 11 methyl mercury is about 65 days . That's my 12 recollection. The half-life of methyl mercury is 13 about 65 days. The half-life o f Thimerosal is more on 14 the order of a week or two as I recall. 15 THE COURT: All right . You indicated some 16 degree of familiarity, am I cor rect, with the French 17 laboratory to which the -- 18 THE WITNESS: Familia rity, I don't know. I 19 indicated that I had some reser vations about the data 20 obtained from that lab. 21 THE COURT: Okay. 22 THE WITNESS: I don't have any familiarity 23 with the lab. 24 THE COURT: Okay. Is that reservation about 25 this particular data or data in general from that lab? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 272 of 289 803 MCCABE - CROSS 1 THE WITNESS: Oh, thi s particular data. 2 THE COURT: And it's because this data is 3 somewhat anomalous in what you would expect in terms 4 of a chelated profile show? 5 THE WITNESS: Well, t hat's the start. 6 THE COURT: Okay. Wh ere do you go from 7 there? 8 THE WITNESS: The sta rt is being asked to 9 make an assumption that I can a pply Dr. Woods' work to 10 a lower level of exposure. 11 THE COURT: Okay. 12 THE WITNESS: The ass umption that the data 13 are valid if they don't fit the signature profile, as 14 I indicated. So the reservatio ns that I have, if we 15 turn to page, I think it's page 10, page 10. 16 THE COURT: And that would be of Trial 17 Exhibit 3. 18 (The d ocument referred to was 19 marked for identification as 20 Respon dent's Trial Exhibit 21 3.) 22 THE WITNESS: This wo uld be -- yes, and it's 23 the urinary porphyrin profile a s measured or submitted 24 for measuring on July 26, 2007, and my comments I 25 think can be applied to the oth er two tests as well. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 273 of 289 804 MCCABE - CROSS 1 I'm bothered by the c olumn dealing with 2 interpretation, and you'll see that in each case it 3 says for the urine porphyrin on the right-hand side. 4 THE COURT: Yes. 5 THE WITNESS: The ave rage rate, the next one 6 down, increased rate, slightly increased rate all the 7 way down. In each case, the wo rd \"rate\" is used. So 8 this is a laboratory that's int erpreting their data 9 and they are offering an interp retation involving 10 rate. 11 Now everyone that dri ves a car knows that 12 rate is a measure per unit time , and this is a single 13 point in time measuring these p orphyrin levels, and so 14 I don't know what to make of th eir interpretation and 15 so it's a flag. Am I wrong abo ut that? I don't know. 16 It's a flag that the interpreta tion is using. It's a 17 flag to me -- again, this is an exercise in math -- 18 how do we go from nanomils of p articular porphyrin per 19 gram of creatinine -- sorry, I' m going to do it the 20 other way. How do we go from f irst nanomils -- 21 THE COURT: Per liter . 22 THE WITNESS: -- of a porphyrin per liter to 23 nanomils per gram of creatinine , and that requires the 24 normal answer, urinary creatini ne is found down at the 25 bottom, in this case 548 millig rams per liter. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 274 of 289 805 MCCABE - CROSS 1 If I applied that nor malizer to each of the 2 values in column 1, for at leas t the first two, and I 3 don't have this -- the first tw o, the calculation is 4 different than what's reported here. Is it wildly 5 off? No. But if they can't pe rform a simple math 6 conversion in reporting a value , and I'm suspecting -- 7 if I'm wondering if the data fi t the diagnosis, I'm 8 left with trying to figure out, well, what's the skew 9 here. 10 I think the last thin g to draw out is that 11 the creatinine levels, and so h ere is where you have 12 to go from page 10 back to page 9, the normalizer 13 changes. The urinary creatinin e level changes. So 14 can urinary creatinine values c hange from ibly. The 924 16 milligrams per liter, this is o n page 9. 17 THE COURT: Right. 18 THE WITNESS: The 924 milligram per liter 19 creatinine value, doctor's data , there is a value for 20 creatinine taken 10 days earlie r that differs by 21 hundreds. 22 THE COURT: It's 20.3 . 23 THE WITNESS: It's 20 .3. So if you make the 24 conversion, it becomes 203 gram s per liter. Exactly. 25 It's over a 10-day period the c reatinine value changes Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 275 of 289 806 MCCABE - CROSS 1 from 200 to 900. This is a spe cialized test that's 2 being sent to a lab in France, and my reservation is, 3 again I may be wrong, but it ra ises a flag for me. 4 It's not that they are incapabl e or if they reported 5 suspect creatinine values, whic h is something anybody 6 can measure, what does that do to the values of the 7 rest of the data? 8 The last issue to dra w out, and again it's 9 in comparison between porphyrin profile in one, two 10 and three, so pages 8, 9 and 10 , is that the reference 11 values change between tests. N ow can reference values 12 change within a laboratory? Su re they can, and I 13 expect they could. But what's the explanation for 14 this change in reference values ? It's not provided. 15 The larger issue here is that this is a 16 specialized test. We wouldn't do this test or have 17 access to do this test at the U niversity of Rochester 18 or the medical centers around t he United States 19 presumably. That's why the sam ples are being sent to 20 France. 21 THE COURT: So you're saying this kind of 22 testing is not being done in th e United States? 23 THE WITNESS: Correct . 24 THE COURT: It's not being done by Dr. 25 Woods? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 276 of 289 807 MCCABE - CROSS 1 THE WITNESS: Well, t hat would be a 2 question. If I got turned onto the idea that urinary 3 porphyrin profiles will be the new way to assess 4 mercury in the urine, it seems to me that I would 5 start a conversation with Dr. W oods and find out 6 what's the protocol that I shou ld be following to do 7 this. 8 Remember the protocol itself would involve 9 again the before-and-after appr oach that he reported 10 in the table, and I showed you before-and-after 11 chelation. It would involve an approach where I am 12 measuring the urinary mercury l evels in concert with 13 measuring the urinary porphyrin levels, right, because 14 after all I'm interested in sho wing that there is a 15 connection, and that's not bein g done here. 16 So it's a specialized test perhaps at the 17 front end of this. The reason that it's not done in 18 other labs is because we wouldn 't know what to do with 19 the data. We don't know what t he reference values 20 should be. So here I don't thi nk they know what the 21 reference values should be eith er. They simply 22 change. Am I wrong? I may be, but again, these are 23 the issues that raise flags in the application of this 24 porphyrin approach to the quest ion of is there 25 significant kidney burden of me rcury here. Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 277 of 289 808 MCCABE - CROSS 1 THE COURT: Okay. It appears that these 2 tests, it looks to me, are bein g done for the purpose 3 of demonstrating that there is a body burden of 4 mercury that is not being detec ted on blood or urine 5 tests. Is that how you interpr et it? 6 THE WITNESS: I inter pret that that's what 7 their intent is, to have an alt ernative way of 8 measuring the kidney burden of mercury because the 9 direct measure of mercury in ur ine shows -- 10 THE COURT: Very low. 11 THE WITNESS: -- very low, but again, the 12 problem there again was by the approach. Remember 13 there wasn't a before or after chelation, very 14 limited. If I was allowed to d esign this as a 15 research study, I would rather they go back and do the 16 pre- and postchelation and meas ure mercury in the 17 urine, directly measure mercury in the urine. Show me 18 that it doesn't respond to chel ation. 19 Well, I guess show me that it does respond 20 to chelation, and then you woul d need a new test, a 21 new test of porphyrin values to give me an indication 22 of what the kidney mercury valu e was. I'm speaking to 23 the efflux issue. 24 THE COURT: Okay.

Th ank you. 9 THE WITNESS: I can p rovide an explanation. 10 THE COURT: Sure. 11 THE WITNESS: I think the answer is no, and 12 Heyer's work still goes to a lo t of high exposures. 13 THE COURT: Okay. 14 THE WITNESS: It's th e application of 15 prolonged high exposure to a ge netic polymorphism in 16 CPOX-4. 17 THE COURT: All right . 18 THE WITNESS: So it d oesn't help in 19 explaining Colten Snyder's prof ile. 20 THE COURT: And Colte n Snyder's profile does 21 not look like those with high e xposure and CPOX-4. 22 THE WITNESS: As I te stified, I don't see 23 that Colten Snyder's porphyrin profiles are acting as 24 the bulk of Dr. Woods' research has said that they 25 should.

Any followup? Go ahead. No, Mr. Matanoski, 6 you get to go first. That's ju st the way it works. 7 REDIRECT EXAMI NATION 8 BY MR. MATANOSKI: 9 Q Mr. Powers asked you about some studies with 10 respect to some values you foun d -- at the very 11 beginning of your cross-examina tion, studies were 12 conducted where there may be so me in humans, and there 13 may be some unusual and a diffe rence in you said the 14 cell count. 15 A Yes. 16 Q In those studies, now only if you recall, 17 were the individuals in those s tudies medically 18 immunosuppressed or clinically immunosuppressed? 19 A That's the point. Th ose types of features, 20 those types of issues were not addressed in those 21 studies from my recollection. It was again another A 22 and B connection, BB and lympho cyte numbers and 23 comparing the mercury exposure as indicated in the 24 urine. 25 Q They never got to the result we're Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 285 of 289 816 MCCABE - RE-CROSS 1 interested in about -- 2 A Well, not that I reca ll, but the immunotox 3 literature, the metal tox liter ature, there are 4 studies that have examined freq uency of colds, the 5 number of sick days, things of that nature. My 6 recollection of that work appli es more to the lead 7 literature than the mercury lit erature. But in the 8 specific studies that I'm think ing about where there 9 were attempts to make correlati ons between lymphocyte 10 number and urine mercury, I don 't recall, but I don't 11 think that other evidence of im munosuppression such as 12 frequency of infections was exa mined. 13 MR. MATANOSKI: Thank you. 14 THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Powers. 15 MR. POWERS: Thank yo u. 16 RECROSS-EXAMIN ATION 17 BY MR. POWERS: 18 Q Just a couple of quic k things. On slide No. 19 10, you were talking about the term \"rate\" there. 20 A Yes. 21 Q Is there any possibil ity that what is meant 22 to be stated there is \"ratio\" a nd perhaps it's a 23 language issue? I noticed some other sort of grammar 24 and semantic errors in there. Would ratio be an 25 appropriate term to use where r ate is not? Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 286 of 289 817 MCCABE - RE-CROSS 1 A It would not be. I t hought about our good 2 friends in France and whether t hat would be indicated 3 in the report. Ratio is not th e issue, and it's not 4 in my slides, but you know that each one of these 5 porphyrin profiles contain addi tional pages where the 6 ratios were calculated, and act ually part of it's here 7 below and you can see ratio, th ey are using the word 8 \"ratio\" just fine. So no, I do n't think it's ratio 9 instead of rate. 10 Q Would that be an appr opriate term to use 11 given Dr. Woods' work looking a t to some extent at 12 least the relative ratio of the various porphyrins 13 that are displayed? 14 A I understand that, an d again, I'm going to 15 say no, and I don't think so be cause it's not the 16 interpretation in terms of aver age rate. The issue of 17 rate refers to each one of thes e rows that are not 18 providing the ratio. The ratio is provided elsewhere 19 in the report. 20 Q Okay. A moment ago, actually early on in 21 some questions the Special Mast er was asking, you said 22 there was no evidence of height ened mercury levels in 23 Colten. I did have a question on porphyrins. 24 Now hemosynthesis is happening in cells in 25 the brain. We are talking abou t that. So there would Heritage Reporting Co rporation (202) 628-488 8 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 129 Filed 03/20/08 Page 287 of 289 818 MCCABE - RE-CROSS 1 be porphyrins even as to porphy rinia, even with a 2 typical porphyrin excretion pat tern, the hemo process 3 in brain cells would be generat ing porphyrins, 4 correct? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Do those porphyrins c ross the blood-brain 7 barrier and end up in urine? D o you know? 8 A I believe it depends on whether they are 9 oxidized or reduced, whether we 're talking about 10 porphyrins or porphyrinogens, b ut again -- 11 Q I'm talking about the porphyrins that would 12 be a byproduct of a typical hem o cycle where they are 13 overcreated at certain steps. 14 A Yes. Yes. I don't k now. I don't know. 15 MR. POWERS: Nothing further. 16 (Witness excused.) 17 THE COURT: All right . We are finished for 18 the day and almost on time.
