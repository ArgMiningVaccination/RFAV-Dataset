The truth is, we often don't know. Researchers are studying this question and hopefully we'll have a better understanding of these interactions in the future. For the time being, the best advice is to think twice before mixing any herb with a prescription or nonprescription drug. Certain supplements have been recognized as having a high risk of interactions with certain medications. You don't want to mix medications with these particular herbs without your doctor's approval because of potential risks. Some supplements of concern include: - Black cohosh - Dong quai - Evening primrose oil - Garlic - Ginkgo - Ginseng - Hawthorn - Kava - St. John's wort - Yohimbe Alternative medicine, home remedies and more in Mayo Clinic's [Integrative Guide to Good Health](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/categories/healthy-lifestyle/mayo-clinic-the-integrative-guide-to-good-health.php).
