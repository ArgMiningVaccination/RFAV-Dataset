[Get details](#affiliate). This review is based on the original edition of this book. It has since been revised and updated. Aromatherapy and Subtle Energy Techniques is a practical book that introduces beginners to the concepts of subtle energy techniques and briefly dives into energy therapies including Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, Polarity Therapy, Subtle Energy Medicine, Earth Energy Healing and Hands-on-Healing. The authors use a friendly, clear writing style that is easy to follow. The authors introduce the seven chakras (the energy centers of the body) and detail the ideal states of when each chakra is in balance as well as describe the symptoms that occur when individual chakras are imbalanced and are either constricted or congested. The concepts and benefits of Compassionate Touch are explained, and detailed chapters teach the reader how to emotionally and physically prepare to give an energy session, how to ready the room (cleanse and clear it with essential oils) and how to prepare the recipient of the session. Details for performing subtle energy sessions with illustrations and details on 12 hand positions used in subtle energy sessions are also offered. An appendix describes an array of common imbalances and recommends which of the 12 hand positions to use to address the imbalance. In separate chapters, the authors provide a useful, but brief introduction to the origins of aromatherapy and essential oils, safety information and details on how to incorporate the use of essential oils into the energy session by way of diffusion, room mists, and anointing oils. Charts throughout the book describe the oils that can assist in balancing each particular chakra and the oils that are best used during each phase of an energy session. Aromatherapy and Subtle Energy Techniques is a practical introduction to the chakras and the field of subtle energy techniques by way of compassionate touch. It is also a good introduction into how aromatherapy can enhance this modality. This book is not intended to serve as a complete guide to aromatherapy, but focuses solely on the emotional and spiritual use of essential oils, most especially within the use of subtle energy techniques. At 207 pages, it is a detailed and solid introduction, but further reader is recommended to those that wish to seriously explore these fields further. The authors provide a list of books of \"Recommended Reading\" at the end of each chapter. One precaution that I offer to readers of this book: Do not use any essential oils on the skin without first diluting them. In some places within the book, the authors mention placing a drop or two of particular essential oils on the hands (to prepare for a session) or feet (i.e. to ground the feet). The authors do not make it clear if they are referring to oils that have been already diluted. I precaution all readers to first dilute all essential oils well in a quality carrier oil as sensitization can occur in some individuals with even lavender and other generally \"gentle\" oils, and even by using only a single drop or two.
