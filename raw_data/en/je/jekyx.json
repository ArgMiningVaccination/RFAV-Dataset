Definition of spiritual bathing Spiritual bathing, sometimes called ritual cleansing, is a practice that millions of humans have engaged in over thousands of years. The actual practice depends on the person doing it, their culture, beliefs, and more. However, in almost all cases, it involves the submersion of one's body in water. It may involve many other rituals, including baths in nature or a specific vessel, using certain oils or elements, and more. Another main characteristic of spiritual bathing is the beliefs around it. Everyone who does one believes that it has a deeper meaning or will benefit them somehow. Historical background of spiritual baths While it may seem trivial, knowing who engaged in this practice before you and why they did it can help you connect to it and your [common humanity](https://self-compassion.org/embracing-our-common-humanity-with-self-compassion/). As we stated, humans have practiced spiritual bathing for thousands of years. The oldest known public bathhouse in present-day Pakistan dates to about 2500 BCE. It was located on one of the highest points of a major city and connected to a temple. Pakistan wasn't the only place where we've uncovered evidence of ancient public bathhouses and ritual bathing. It was common throughout Asia and the Middle East. It reached Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, spreading throughout Europe. Spiritual baths had different meanings in different places. For some cultures, submerging in water symbolized cleansing. They took spiritual baths before or as part of ceremonies and rituals to prepare their bodies for religious practices. In other places, the act of bathing was the religious or spiritual ritual itself. Cleansing oneself in some way held special meaning. It may have symbolized the forgiveness of past wrongs or sins or represented a passage in life. It also helped align chakras. Many peoples regarded natural baths as especially sacred. They saw natural springs, particularly natural hot springs, as gifts from the sacred realms. They often believed (as many still do) that these waters hold healing properties. By the time ritual bathing became part of European life (by about 300 BCE), baths had also become recreational and held social importance. Some public bathhouses broke down the separation between classes of people. In other places, being seen at bathhouses was crucial to your political career or economic life. As we moved away from ancient times, spiritual baths became more of a private practice. People bathed individually or in small ceremonies rather than in public bathhouses. It wasn't until after the 14th century that laws (primarily originating in Europe) forbade unisex bathing and separated women and men. Importance of spiritual baths in modern society Spiritual baths continues to be common today, although in many cases, the meaning has evolved. Today, spirituality tends to be a more individual experience. Therefore, spiritual baths also tends to be individualized. Many people today draw from cultures of the past in their practices. People from many faiths incorporate spiritual baths. It has also become a powerful act of self-care connected to mental and emotional well-being. Some people relate it to other behaviors, like [affirmations](https://behaveo.com/self-care-affirmations/) and aromatherapy. Traditional communal bathhouses still exist around the world. Some of them have been in operation for centuries. As in Ancient Greece, many of today's bathhouses are open to people from all walks of life, making them equal spaces. Finally, millions of people make pilgrimages to natural springs annually. They believe in the same healing powers that have helped others for centuries. Understanding spiritual baths Engaging in a spiritual ritual without connecting to a more profound meaning doesn't make sense. If not, it isn't spiritual at all. Let's break it down further.

But what does that mean? Cleansing often entails removing or clearing negative emotions, energies, or forces. It's also meant to restore balance. Some people find balance in [the chakras](https://behaveo.com/root-chakra-affirmations/). But for others, balance has to do with how you feel. There are several methods people use for cleansing other than ritual bathing. These include yoga, deep breathing, and meditation. Essentially, anything that gives you a break from day-to-day anxieties and allows you to return to your life feeling refreshed can serve as a cleansing ritual. That's the point of cleansing your mind, body, or soul: to restore balance and help you feel and perform at your best. Different types of spiritual baths As we've discussed, a spiritual bath is as unique as the bather. Still, there are different types and variations depending on the bathers' intent, beliefs, and so on. First, spiritual baths are part of many religious traditions. In Islam, ritual baths are called [Far'd Ghusl](https://raiyanfoundation.com/act-of-worship/purification-in-islam/perform-ritual-bathing-fard-ghusl/).

Some adherents also participate in an extended celebration called [Magh Mela](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/with-many-firsts-magh-mela-set-to-kick-start-on-january-6-101672761687068.html), where thousands of people engage in collective ritual bathing in rivers. Rather than bathe themselves, Buddhists participate in [Bathing of the Buddha](https://journal.tzuchi.us/article/65/buddha-bathing-and-interfaith-prayers-of-gratitude/#:~:text=The%20Buddha%20Bathing%20Ceremony%20is,'bathe'%20the%20statue%20itself.), a ceremony involving cleansing statues of the Buddha. The other significant distinctions in types of spiritual baths include whether you're bathing alone or with others, in a private or public setting, in nature, or a human-made pool or vessel, and what other objects or practices you incorporate. We'll cover more of that below when we discuss how to take a spiritual bath.
