HOMOEOPATHY: In this Gentle healing science, the concept of causation is considered as the dynamic one (in most of cases except accidental and surgical one). Concept of vital force and its disturbance is one the important aspect in learning homoeopathy. As per Dr. Kent in his philosophy, \"All disturbances/diseases conditions start from mind (A dynamic entity) and then followed by Physical Manifestation.\" Will/emotion, memory and intellect are the major component of human mind. Internal morbid derangement first reflects on any one of them followed by Physical body. Medicines having similar kind of actions in series as seen in morbidity are helpful for case and having power to cure the sick person. Homoeopathic Materia Medica and Repertory are full of these kinds of medicines. So, in this way one can conclude that our emotion and mind can affect the immune system and followed by our power to resist disease. Homoeopathic medicines help us at this level to strengthen our immune system for prevention as well as cure. GNM: German new Medicine is like sibling of Homoeopathy which is also concern with the healing. Here the founder of GNM method Dr. Hamer with his sharp observations and understanding related to Brain scan help him to conclude about the Mind and body connection of Disease condition. If we take some glimpses from the History of GNM method in medical science then Dr. Hamer first observed this mind and body connection in Cancer. Further observations confirm this mind body connection in other diseases. Their concept of different conflicts and its corresponding bodily manifestations are interesting to study and apply in practice. Here again this mind body connection and their interdependent actions contribute a lot in our immune system. Traumatic thoughts or shock produces conflicts that have a major impact on our immune system and its work in protection of our body.
