Auricular Acupuncture Have you been struggling with anxiety, chronic pain, migraines, depression, stress, insomnia, trauma, headaches, smoking cessation, alcohol, and drug addiction? We offer a free auricular acupuncture clinic. Why auricular acupuncture? - The ear is a \"microsystem\" comprised of acupuncture points that coordinate to every part of the body. - An alternative medicine treatment in which specific points on the ear are stimulated in order to promote healing in other areas of the body. - The goal of ear acupuncture is to improve the flow of vital energy (known as qi or chi) throughout the body in order to restore balance - An imbalance in these is believed to be at the root of many health issues. - An average treatment session is only 20-30 minutes in length "}
