Illness behaviors were assessed solely asopen-ended questions. Assessment ofcompliance wasdeferred until theactual study, since astandard measurement method (blood glucose) wasproposed. Results indicated that allsubjects' beliefs were ingeneral consistent with theliterature, with several noteworthy exceptions. Forexample, folkhealer wasobtained only. Nine illness behaviors were tabulated from open-ended responses. Twenty diabetic subjects meeting theabove inclusion criteria (16 females, 4males; mean age, 73.4y; SD,5.6y), participated intheactual study. The instrument revised toinclude closed-ended items onillness behavior, and toexclude allcomponents yielding unanimously negative responses inthepilot study. Compliance with diabetes therapy was additionally measured. Results indicated grossly identical findings with the pilot study. However, most subjects rejected theillness behaviors offered on closed-ended questioning, preferring tooffer their unique explanatory models.

Such factors include: Poor access tomainstream facilities, and alack ofcultural sensitivity onthepart medical systems. Issues ofAccess Onavery concrete level, economic andsocial conditions have historically discouraged (ifnotprohibited) minority useofmainstream medical care. Leftwith noalternative, many such rely indigenous, therapists remain theonly source ofhealing power available to most oftheblack population, thebelief system onwhich these therapists base their cures advantage summarized byMathews (1987), who writes, \"The survival 3 social andeconomic inequities affect adherence tofolkbeliefs ina more indirect fashion. AsMathews andothers (Mathews, 1987; Snow, 1971, 1974) inmost traditional cultures, andtends toprevail under situations ofuncertainty, when people perceive insufficient knowledge, orlack ofcontrol over events intheir world. Certainly, then, forblack Americans stillliving under conditions ofpoverty, racism, andsocial uncertainty, itfollows that the promise ofmagic would hold acertain appeal. Thus, folkbeliefs will continue tobetenaciously available. seealso Baer, forsimilar aptly markedly improved both economic andsocial conditions forblack Americans.

Combined withChapter 1 Introduction 4 restrictive government programs (such asMedicare andMedicaid), access tohealthcare stillcontinues tobemore ofaprivilege (1988) disparities andinadequate supplemental insurance toMedicare, coupled with anincrease ininvestor owned hospitals, means thatmany elderly black Americans willreceive inferior care inover-crowded, under-funded public hospitals. Inaddition, he continues, preventive care totheblack elderly isfurther minimized by Medicare policies thatprohibit reimbursement formost preventive care. Further, Carter notes, although healthcare today ismore accessible to allAmericans than ever before inthehistory ofthenation, provision of psychiatric care toblack patients ofallages inferior. In particular, headds, amajor criticism oftheDiagnostic andStatistical Manuals (DSM) ofMental This oversight essentially means thatsuch patients cannot beadequately treated within mainstream psychiatric facilities, andmust therefore rely onindigenous treatment (such elderly areespecially atriskforsuch social andeconomic inequity as leads tofolk medicine adherence. Forinstance, Manuel (1988) notes (based on that, salary, ofwhites ($6,309). ishigher among older blacks isgreater whites. Thus, asManuel have almost universally agreed that \"ithappens relationship between physician andpatient may befound particularly inthewritings of Parsons (1951, 1953, 1975), Friedson (1970a, 1970b) andMechanic (1968).

TheParsonian derivation ofthepatient's sick role asaform ofdeviant behavior, requiring extraction from an\"expert\" physician, certainly imparts a notion ofasymmetry (and, often, conflict) between clinician andclient. Likewise, Friedson writes oftheconflictual relationship patients' role thoughtful, andwarm, oriented professional who resists 1 Introduction 6 Further justification fortheexistence ofviable folkmedicine today isfound within lack ofcultural onthepart ofthemainstream medical system.

Much oftheir success has todomore with this sensitivity than with their \"pharmacopia\" ortherapeutic techniques. Aswell asrecognizing (and addressing) thathealth problems are inextricably entwined with other matters ofdaily life(Snow, 1978), folk healers possess additional psychosocial characteristics distinguishing them from their mainstream counterparts. AsMathews (1987) writes, \"The traditional medicine ofmany black of 1984b).Chapter Introduction 7 First, folkhealers tend been inthecommunity they serve, beliefs, and toaccept controls theillness disease concepts andcures aredeveloped from within the community, andmust have meaning tothepatient constituency inorder to continue inthecommon repertoire offolk-healer beliefs andpractices. of understanding folkhealers behavioral andsomatic symptoms asnaturally co-occuring elements ofa syndrome; anystigma and/or guilt associated with such behavioral aberrations isminimized. Finally, given theheavy influence ofmagic and religion practitioner &Lauro, 1982). social roleimparts agreater sense ofcultural sensitivity onto thepatient, who then may preferentially choose afolkover mainstream practitioner.Chapter 1 Introduction 8 Potential Benefits ofStudying Folk Medicine Systems \"Whereas cultural sensitivity isessential togood medical care ina pluralistic inner cityarea, cultural greater potential forimproved outcome\" research indicates thatissues ofpoor access tomainstream healthcare facilities, coupled with poor cultural sensitivity in such settings, both serve tomake adherence toafolkmedicine system likely among certain groups ofculturally-diverse individuals. Assuch, the healthcare professionals' task oflearning about patients' explanatory becomes review indicates thatboth (mainstream) physician-patient communication canpotentially be positively affected byincreased improving both factors canserve patients. Furthermore, itisreadily acknowledged thatpatients virtually never volunteer such information spontaneously. Forexample, Snow (1988) notes that inonestudy, notasingleChapter 1 Introduction 9 southern black informant admitted totheuse ofhome remedies, while ethnographic materials collected during home visits proved justtheopposite tobetrue.

Earlier inthischapter, issues ofaccess andcultural compatibility, itmay have appeared asthough attendance ata many individuals willsubscribe tomore than onebelief system atatime, even Rau, practitioners. Infact, onestudy (Mathews, 1987) concluded thatfolkmedicine adherents onaverage consult three different practitioners (from both folkandmainstream systems) perepisode ofserious illness.

This willbediscussed more fully in Chapter 2;fornow, wewillsimply define itas,\"the ways inwhich given symptoms andacted (ornotacted) upon bydifferent kinds ofpersons\" (Mechanic, 1962, p.189).

Findings ontherelationship between useof afolkmedicine system andsubsequent compliance with mainstream recommendations onnumerous casestudies. between folkhealer-patient andphysician-patient relationships may discourage compliance inthelatter system. Secondly, characteristics offolkbeliefs may similarly discourage mainstream compliance. Weconsider each ofthese possibilities inturn. Above wenoted that folk healers, incontrast tomainstream physicians, tend toshare common frames ofreference with their patients. As such, thesentiments ofafolkpractitioner, when consonant with those ofthe patient, butdissonant with those ofthemainstream physician, may serve to inhibit further visits tothephysician, and topromote noncompliance with mainstream medical recommendations (Snow, 1983, 1988; Watson, 1984a). Ofequal, ifnotgreater, importance, various components ofafolkbelief system may serve topromote noncompliance inthemainstream system. For example, traditional medical systems, including that ofblack Americans, frequently contain supernatural, magical, andmoral components intheir explanation andmanagement ofillness (Snow, 1983, explanations ofillness cancause noncompliance inthelatter system. Forexample, old,black female with ahistory ofdiabetes, who refusedChapter 1 betoseek a\"cure\" forthisproblem (Snow, 1974). Conclusions Summary This chapter introduced theconcept offolk orlaymedical systems, with tomainstream facilities, and topoor cultural sensitivity within these facilities. Thus, either through alack of alternatives and/or preference, culturally-diverse patients may find themselves attending folktherapists. Having established thepossibility ofcontemporary folkmedicine systems, several potential benefits ofstudying such systems considered.

With respect tothelatter, during theantebellum period, reasons offered foritsappearance differ. For example, Mathews (1987) writes, \"While white settlers hadoccasional access tothefewphysicians residing inthelarger settlements andonsome plantations, African oftheir position atthebottom ofthecaste system, more outofacultural preference than from racism.

Theviscosity oftheblood (thick vs.thinblood) isthought tobe (Snow, isthebasis forthediscussion which follows). Babies/children, the elderly, andwomen ofallages (especially pregnant andpostpartum) have the thinnest blood, making them particularly atrisk forillness. Thin blood is joint disease, the blood was \"high\" inthehead, asprofuse bleeding would result.

Further, with specific regard tothehealing ofillness, a particular practice ofblack theology isnoteworthy: theWednesday evening healing service. TheWednesday evening healing may becharacterized bythree distinct phases: Theprayer phase, testimony, andthesermon (Griffith & 1981). Theprayer focusing on thanking theLord forspecific tasks.

Finally, thepastor delivers asermon, tying together themes which have emerged during theevening. Researchers (including Griffith, English, &Mayfield, 1980; Griffith & Mathewson, 1981) have noted that theWednesday evening service may be characterized byahealing community model, inthat itisasmall collectivity whose members possess oneanother.

Needless tosay,several arcane practices aremost likely notuniversally andthemodel proposed intheliterature must beconsidered. That is,dorootwork participants consistently perform ofthepractices mentioned exactly asthey aredepicted new ones with personal p.890). Finally, virtually nostudies have attempted toassociate Sociodemographic factors (e.g., age,gender, place ofbirth, years ofeducation,Section 2.1 Folk Medicine Review 36 religion, etc.) with thetendency toadhere toafolkmedicine system. While empirical may allaffect folkremedy use, thisfinding hasnever been demonstrated quantitatively. Further, similar associations have never been investigated interms offolkhealer use, orbelief intheexplanatory models of illness causation. Insummary, three specific research questions emerging from review of (a)completeness sections, amethodological plan forinvestigating each ofthese questions will bedeveloped.Section 2.1 Folk Medicine Review 37 Footnotes 1Snow (1971, 1974) writes that\"high blood\" may beterminologically confused with blood andimproved patient compliance. However, onamore level, the medical interview isthebasis ofthediagnostic process (Ebden, Bhatt, Carey, & Harrison, 1988). Further, \"focused cultural patterns may alter thepatient's willingness orability data may beused toformulate policy, orat least todraw conclusions about thepopulation under study. Thus, itis imperative thatthedata, onwhich such conclusions will bebased, beas complete ofprevious research oneliciting such culturally information. Review consultation, considered interms ofthelarger cross cultural communication paradigm. This latter research area wasinvoked after thesparse, largely inconclusive nature ofthemore Culturally-Sensitive History Elicitation have slight tendency tofavor theopen-ended approach. Hentges, Shields, and Cantu advocate using open-ended questions forelicitation ofpatients' explanatory models andfolkremedies used. Likewise, Mathews (1987) suggests anopen-ended strategy when obtaining explanatory models and/or cultural interpretations (thedistinction between thetwo ismade onp.42). Finally, Tinling (1967) reports using closed-ended questioning when attempting tolearn ifpatients believe they have been hexed. Components Focus onMethodology Since virtually onmethodology wasmentioned in these review articles, they willnotbeconsidered inthissection.Section &Smith, face-to-face interviewing with semistructured instruments, orboth techniques, were utilized. Descriptive studies. Baer (1981) described thenature, structure, andfunction ofblack folk healers inanurban community. Heconducted extensive interviews with eight spiritual advisors, utilizing asemistructured interview schedule.

They interviewed twenty service attenders, likewise using a semistructured interview schedule. Similarly, Griffith andMathewson (1981) described theWednesday evening healing service byobserving oneblack church inNew Haven, Connecticut, foreight consecutive Wednesdays. Theremaining descriptive study (Snow, 1971, 1974) was anexploratory, ethnographic investigation ofthefolkmedicine system ofapoor blackSection 2.2 Assessing Folk Beliefs/Practices 41 neighborhood (of29separate families) were interviewed, and lifehistories, geneologies, andin-depth interviews were performed.

They observed onechurch consecutive weeks.

Indirectly advocating aclosed-ended approach, Putsch urges clinicians to \"become familiar with special terminology used bypatients, [especially] specific beliefs, Research Questions/Methodologies Since none oftheliterature reviewed inthissection rigorously addressed alternative methods ofculturally-sensitive history elicitation, it follows that nodefinite conclusions astotheoptimal method(s) canbe offered. However, several general trends become evident. Forone, both the literature onculturally-sensitive history elicitation (taken from larger studies ofblack folkmedicine) and onuseofinterpreters agree that anopen-ended strategy explanatory models, cultural interpretations, anduseoffolkhealers/remedies. beliefs, practices, andtraditions 2.2 Assessing Folk Beliefs/Practices 44 accomplished with closed-ended theliterature oftherootwork system, when proves ofallstudies arereview must bediscounted because nomethods arediscussed. thedescriptive studies, andSnow's studies reference wasmade methods By contrast, inthecontext ofaspecific cross-cultural problem (i.e., apatient resists relegates obtaining folk-remedy histories toopen-ended questioning. Considering the concern over adverse effects secondary tofolkremedy use(mentioned in Chapter 1),itwould seem thatvery specific information would benecessary. Presumably, such information could beobtained ofinformation gained onopen versus closed-ended questioning. Ideally, further research should address every component ofaSection 2.2 Assessing Folk Beliefs/Practices 45 folkmedicine system asboth anopen andclosed-ended component, comparing which method yields more information. Atthevery least, such a study should beundertaken interms offolkremedy use.Section 2.2 Assessing inthiscontext refers toamethod ofdata and Referral \"Introubled states, infactfrequently outlet 1957, Whether for\"macro\" such ashealth services utilization, or \"micro\" issues, such asprevention, how individuals decide topresent toa healthcare thecontext ofourstudy, thisquestion ismodified slightly, focusing primarily forces cause persons toseek help infolk, as opposed tomainstream, medicine settings. relevant literature, tolearn what determinants of provider (folk vs.mainstream) choice have previously been identified, and how they were measured.

Layreferral, specifically toeither a folk ormainstream system. AsFreidson (1960) writes, when prospective participate willbeused bymost, theprofessional practitioner being called for minor illnesses only... (p.377). That is,somewhat intuitively, individuals who arestrongly vested choose mainstream intofolk ormainstream care systems. Studying Mexican-Americans intheSouthwest, Saunders (1954) found seven reasons why individuals may choose folk over mainstream care: (a)Geographic accessibility, oftheAnglo medical system, (e) resistance tobeing separated from one's family during ahospital admission,Section 2.3 Assessing Illness Behavior 50 (f)inability ofAnglo practitioners with thepresenting complaint (i.e., mal oioorsusto among Mexican-Americans, orhexing among black Americans), and (g)failed patient Model reference group. Itisthus similar toMechanic's concept of\"other-defined\" illness, discussed above.

Furthermore, while thesecond type oflayreferral theory (factors influencing eventual presentation toamainstream setting) isperhaps less applicable, thefirsttype oflayreferral theory Adetailed Illness Behavior intheliterature; these factors are summarized inTable Influencing theDecision toEngage Medical Fear ofthemainstream medical system Resistance toseparation from family (esp. during hospitalization) Inability ofmainstream system tohandle complaint Failed patient expectations within Methods Review oftheliterature indicated that, forcross-sectional studies, two measurement strategies have been employed: the\"retrospective hypothetical\" approach, composed primarily ofhypothetical illness behaviors may notaccurately \"actual\" illness behaviors. Likewise, asking patients (asZola did) toSection 2.3 Assessing Illness Behavior 54 report their reasons behind their current clinic visit may notprovide aclear picture of\"usual\" illness behaviors. Insummary, theliterature offers many reasons why folksystems may bepreferentially chosen over mainstream systems; however, virtually none ofthese determinants have been validated forblack populations. Further research should definitely address thisshortcoming. Additionally, neither of themethods forstudying illness behavior with across-sectional design are optimal. Unfortunately, while only themethod suggested forlongitudinal designs looks promising, such studies arevery difficult tocarry out. Further research should investigate alternative methods forstudying illness behavior/lay referral with cross-sectional designs.Section 2.3 Assessing Illness Behavior 55 Footnotes 1Symbolic-interactionism isexplained inAppendix A. *Abnormal illness behavior generally embodies such conditions as psychosomatic disease, somatization, hypochondriasis, hysteria, and idiopathic Ithas since been revised andmodified toexplain patient compliance with recommendations other than those forpreventive medicine.

Recent disease-specific research These studies aredesigned toidentify factors leading tononcompliance, forspecific (usually chronic) illnesses. Traditionally, such studies have focused oneither diabetes orhypertension, although other disease processes have alsoreceived attention. Forexample, Ary, Toobert, Wilson, andGlasgow inrheumatoid noncompliance achosen diagnosis, the opposite approach isused aswell. That is,researchers may begin bypositing possible factors affecting compliance, subsequently testing their hypotheses onSection 2.4 Studying Patient Compliance 59 patients notclassified byanyonediagnosis. Many psychosocial variables have been A heightened interest inpatient compliance asit pertains toelderly patients. Several reasons account forthisincreased amount of healthcare expenditures, amajor proportion ofthese dollars being spent on drugs (Meagher, O'Brien, &O'Malley, 1985). Third, most ofthisdrug therapy isdirected toward maintenance inchronic illness. Further, numerous other factors provide justification forexamining compliance behavior inolder patients. Forexample, certain age-specific combined with theeffects ofaging onthedistribution, metabolism, andthepatterns ofdrug Other may have onimpairment inthepatient's vision, cognition, muscle person's difficulty inadhering toamedication regimen (p.1161).Section 2.4 Studying (seeboth Table A-2andAppendix A)isconsidered tohave reflects reduced Therefore, does notdecrease overall inelderly asopposed to younger patients (Kunze, 1982). Rather, factors such asthose mentioned above, which may accompany older age,have been shown todecrease compliance. Forexample, estimates indicate thatonly 5%ofolder people suffer from asevere intellectual impairment, and asimilar number may suffer from milder impairments. Further, while such disease may become more prevalent among those above age80,about 80% ofthose who liveintovery oldagenever experience asignificant memory loss symptoms of dementia (Mace &Rabins, 1981). Therefore, while itwould certainly bean overstatement toconclude patients suffering from cognitive decline.Section (Gordis, p.23). Review oftheliterature indicates thatmeasuring compliance isa difficult andoften inaccurate task. Research oncompliance measurement has historically focused onmeasuring compliance with medications! (Gordis, Furthermore, phenomenon, hasbeen divided intotwo categories: Direct andindirect measurement. Medication monitoring isanadditional form ofdirect measurement. This method involves attachment ofamonitoring device tothemedication container, which records indirect methods include: andillness behavior theories.

Bycontrast, thissecond approach would suggest associating specific illness behaviors (i.e.,using peach leaftea fordiabetes) with mainstream compliance. Measurement Independent variables. Inthefirstscenario, theindependent variables though toaffect compliance would therefore bethose same variables affecting theillness behavior/lay referral process. Proposed methods ofmeasuring these variables were discussed inSection 2.3. Thesecond scenario would engender thesame measurement methodology (and problems) discussed inSection 2.2. That is,arigorous method forassessing such beliefs/practices would be required. Dependent variable. Inthissection, twostandard methods ofcompliance measurement were introduced: Direct andindirect measurement. Unfortunately, there is currently noconsensus among researchers astowhich method gives the most accurate measurement ofcompliance. Naturally, theindirect methods areplagued with errors inherent inhuman nature (i.e.,forgetting). However, thedirect methods, while notsubject tothesame problems no means error-free.

For one, repeatedly noted thedireconsequences ofhaving \"someone get something inyour stomach,\" consistent with and insubsequent areas. Insharp contrast, while participants' responses tomethods of unnatural illness paralleled theliterature, their beliefs regarding signs and symptoms differed dramatically. None ofthose interviewed agreed with any ofthecomponents discussed intheliterature (that symptoms included no other explanation death; feeling likereptiles areon/within thebody; orsevere gastrointestinal symptoms). Rather, somewhat more pragmatic explanations were offered for these mysterious symptoms: You really never know... Ifthere's noother explanation foranillness? (Ms. C.). They jus'besick... nobody knows why, except Him... maybe they didget sickthrough fortune tellers, orHoodoo.... But, no,Idon' believe in no-one except TheLord... Oh, Iguess somebody might poison you.

However, since several ofthecomponents taken from thetheoretical model will notbeincluded intheactual instrument, it should bepossible toreduce interviewing time. Parity Between Subjects' Explanatory Models and Theoretical Models Ourparticipants' explanatory models differed from those offered inthe literature onseveral Potential literature. Infact, itseemed almost asthough there were nosuch folk notions among oursubjects; very mainstream explanations were offered. Somewhat bycontrast, participants didexhibit acomponent ofdisbelief in chronicity ofillness. However, their explanatory models differed from the literature intheir specificity. Some diseases were considered contagious, other diseases, inevitable; and, stillothers, assecondary tofever. While further research several plausible hypotheses forthese differences may beoffered. One, such beliefs may be affected bygeographic region. Individuals from Texas andLouisiana (states from which themajority ofparticipants were born than arefolkSection 3.2 Operationalizing medicine from areas. Likewise, themajority ofoursample wasfemale. Being the\"usual\" caregivers infamilies, perhaps females have adapted their explanatory models sothatthey differ somewhat from the \"classical\" rendition offered intheliterature. Finally, ourstudy generation than theonedepicted intheliterature. However, since very fewoftheexisting studies provided such demographic information, these hypotheses must remain mere conjectures. Anadditional consideration deals with theconcurrent validity ofthe instrument. That is,since nosimilar instruments exist, itispractically impossible tojudge whether many ofourparticipants' explanatory models differed from thetheoretical model, simply because weasked different questions than nature oftheSanFrancisco BayArea serve to diminish thepotential difficult toobtain such products inSanFrancisco. While other urban areas have been studied, such investigations have generally been limited totheSouth, where kinresiding inrelatively nearby rural areas could provide supplies. Thefactthat 12newremedies (ever used) were identified bysubjects (and appear atapoint theform ofalargely personal relationship between theLord andthepatient. Two possible explanations come tomind. One, some modicum ofmainstream care may have always been available tosubjects, thus reducing/eliminating theneed forfolkcare. Secondly, religious differences between ourstudy sample and those ofthetheoretical model may account forsuch differences inviewpoint. Differences insubjects' part, arenotavailable, this ismerely speculation. With ofthe ofknowledge/fear medical settings, resistance toseparation from family, andfailed expectations inthe mainstream encounter. Lack ofacknowledgement factors may ofourstudy model of toeither ormainstream participation may be postulated. Thetheoretical models offered todate have simply dealt with factors leading toinitiation offolktreatment; none have discussed discontinuation offolktreatment infavor ofmainstream care (obviously, once both choices become available). Ourstudy participants offered reasons of barriers ofaccess tofolkremedies, superiority ofmainstream medicine, and ineffectiveness/side models. Inthefollowing section, wewillinvestigate (through CEquestioning) whether these explanatory models seem tobedominant among former folk remedy users.Section 3.2 Operationalizing theInstrument 109 Footnotes |Samples oftheintroductory mean inthisinstance, making themean lessdescriptive than themedian.Section 3.3 Analyzing Folk Medicine System Participation Among Elderly, Black Clinic Attenders inSanFrancisco Intheprevious section, itwasdetermined (2hours) needed tocomplete theinterview.

These modifications resulted inalistof51folkremedies. Furthermore, since pilot results indicated thatonly 40% were drawn from theexplanatory models oflayreferral collected during the pilot study. Finally, demographics, current (mainstream) medications used, andcompliance with diabetes therapy were assessed. Participants were asked topresent allmedications (prescription, over-the-counter, and, whenSection 3.3 Folk Medicine System Participation 113 appropriate, folkremedies) during thehome visit. When present, recent medication lists inOPD charts were utilized forcross-validation.

At base, these differences may possibly point tothefactthatthepilot andstudy samples were actually drawn from twodifferent underlying populations. This possibility will beconsidered below. Additionally, several conditions found inthecurrent study differ from theexplanatory models offered inthe literature, inways notnoted onpilot testing. These differences willalsobe considered.Section 3.3 Folk Medicine System Participation 136 Components Differing From Pilot toActual Study Natural and unnatural illnesses.

Forone, such research willrequire amuch Many ofthevariables inSection 2.4could seriously sway theoutcome variable.

Furthermore, taken, could likewise confoundSection 3.3 Folk Medicine System Participation 141 theendresult. Finally, inoursample, both groups were virtually homogeneous with respect todegree offolksystem participation, again hampering anyconjectures regarding itsrelationship tomainstream compliance. Therefore, future research should ensure variation among degree offolksystem participation.Section 3.3 Folk Medicine System Participation 142 Footnotes 1AstheOPD ispart ofarelatively small community hospital, there is minimal computer laboratory results andbilling --sothere was appear in Appendix C. *Allinstruments appear inAppendix C. 4The remaining categories from thepilot (contagion and ailments/conditions) were eliminated due touniversally ofhealers (seeSection 2.1), which discounts healing ability gained through formal education. *Additionally, while notdirectly mentioned inthissection, arereviewed: Themajority ofparticipants infavor ofmainstream medicine; and allpossessed very negative attitudes toward folk healers.

Additionally, recruiting subjects from aclinical facility eliminated any possibility ofstudying individuals who entirely refute mainstream care.

While thesamples were not\"biased\" in terms ofthepopulation from which they were drawn (i.e., intheOPD, there aremany more elderly female clinic attenders than there areelderly male could beundertaken, due tothelimited sample size. Limitations Relevant toOutcomes Mainstream compliance. With respect tothedependent variable (mainstream compliance), this study wasseverely limited byhomogeneity ofboth dependent and independent variables. This limitation emerged most blatantly asaresult of thesmall, nonrandom nature atrueassessment possible tovalidate anyofthetheoretical models forfolksystem initiation, as inclinical settings.

Furthermore, time since andreasons formigration may prove tobeuseful explanatory variables, andaredeserving ofrigorous attention. Inanideal setting, itcould prove informative toperform a matched study, comparing thebehaviors ofthose choosing to inthesouthern state counterparts who migrated toSanFrancisco. However, such astudy would require very tight statistical control, since thepotential forconfounding factors would abound. Forexample, ofour subjects came toSanFrancisco toseek better work opportunities. While these individuals were most likely quite poor when they lefttheSouth, they probably were notaspoor asthose who stayed because, they lacked theSection 4.1 Limitations/Further Research 148 resources tomove. Inturn, thispoorer group may have been unable toafford mainstream care, andtherefore relying onfolkmedicine. Attitudes Toward Folk Healers Reviewing study results, theuniversal scorn toward folkhealers, expressed byallparticipants, deserves further attention. This finding wasone ofmental illness (considered untreatable inmainstream settings), random With specific reference tooursamples, perhaps subjects disliked healers simply because they never had aneed for them, andassociated them with many ofthenegative variables mentioned above. Nonetheless, thefactthatvirtually allsubjects described actual healers inoverwhelmingly negative terms cannot bediscounted. Therefore, another area ofresearch interest would entail documenting thecredibility ofvarious types offolkhealers, invarious communities (Snow (1978) quality they hadencountered.Section 4.1 Limitations/Further Research 149 Issues ofFolk System Participation Study results indicated thatsubjects who related positive experiences with anintense level ofmainstream care (i.e., diabetics who receive extensive patient education) often possessed strong patterns ofprevious folkmedicine system participation, butcurrently described both explanatory models and practices more consistent with their mainstream care. This trend isdeserving offurther study. Specifically, itcould prove worthwhile toestablish whether thisshift generally occurs under conditions ofoptimal mainstream care, or whether afolk toamainstream orientation. Analysis ofthenature ofthese shifts (i.e., which comes first, how long does ittake, etc.)could yield results serving toimprove ourunderstanding ofthedevelopment ofexplanatory oftheinstruments. Asafinal point, more research ondeveloping avalid and reliable interview instrument issorely needed. InChapter 3,itwasnoted that several ofourresults may have differed from those described inthe literature, simply because weasked ourquestions differently than did previous researchers. Unfortunately, since noother instruments have been published todate, thisquestion cannot beanswered retrospectively. Nonetheless, instrument development andrefinement should research nature asaproxy, other alternatives appeared anddescribed their explanatory models (i.e.,participants reported \"still having\" diabetes, arthritis, etc.). Such alternatives aClinician that most clinicians suffer from anoverwhelming lack ofaconsistent way to assess thepresence explanatory models serves toimpart cultural sensitivity onthe encounter. More concretely, knowledge ofthese folkways canprove important when assessing thepossibility ofadverse medication reactions, compliance with mainstream care. InSection 4.1,itwasnoted thatthegeneralizability ofthisstudy isin many ways limited. Nonetheless, several trends emerge from thedata, which may prove useful inguiding theclinicians' general decisionmaking and interviewing processes. Inthissection, study findings willbebriefly summarized, and these trends identified. Summary While both pilot andstudy subjects possessed several beliefs consistent with folkexplanatory models, these models did not seem toconflict with mainstream care. Forexample, although several participants didnot universally believe intheories ofcontagion, they thatthey would notseek mainstream care forsuch problems (assuming thatsuch care were available). Avery strong personal relationship between theLord wasobserved inallcases, butthisbelief again didnotappear toclash Clinical Suggestions 152 with mainstream care (i.e., nosubjects were seeking medical care solely through prayer). Bycontrast, while some previous folkhealer attendance had been observed, very little credibility wasplaced insuch healers. Itis onactual results, subjects' a combination herbs androots Rub. Inboth cases, reported tobe highly personalized. Themost commonly-reported indications foruse included both minor acute conditions (colds) aswell aschronic problems (hypertension, arthritis). Finally, closed-ended (CE) questioning was determined necessary when specific practices (i.e., specific remedies used) were required, while open-ended (OE) strategies proved more useful when eliciting explanatory models. Recommendations Results suggest that, ideally, athorough understanding ofthe prevailing folkbelief system isrequired such beliefs andpractices. Unfortunately, themajority ofclinicians both serve inover fivelanguages), andhave limited time tospend with their patients.Section 4.2 Clinical Suggestions 153 Acknowledging both these limitations, twopossible strategies could potentially beapplied. Inanoptimal scenario, aclinical researcher could develop aprotocol fortheprevailing beliefs andpractices ofeach cultural group served. These protocols could then bemade available intheclinic, much inthewayhistory/physical forms aremade available. However, this scheme would most likely work inpractice only ifoneorfewcultural groups were served, population.

When time does notpermit thorough should beconsulted (the FDA todistribute such lists). CEquestioning should assured indications forremedies. Nonetheless, since results indicated thatsubjects tended toreport additional indications for remedies (that is,they extended rather than refuted indications offered intheliterature), thefollowing scheme may prove useful: When such information isavailable, firstquery thepatient inSection befollowed byOEquestioning, forthesame reasons mentioned in(1).
