Nearly 260 confirmed and 130 suspected monkeypox cases had been reported to the World Health Organization as of last week as the smallpox-like virus continues to spread in countries where the disease is not native, including the U.S. Dr. Rosamund Lewis, WHO's top monkeypox expert, said Sunday that she doesn't anticipate the recent outbreak will turn into a pandemic, although researchers are still learning how exactly the virus spreads and what factors may be increasing its transmission, [The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-pandemics-world-organization-smallpox-260f127f54016fca402e88f8bdb3ace3?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the total U.S. confirmed monkeypox cases to 18 in nine states Tuesday. Texas does not have any confirmed cases. Though the Lone Star State seems to have evaded the current spread of the virus thus far, North Texas is familiar with monkeypox, which is native to Central and West Africa. Nearly one year ago, a Dallas hospital treated a patient who contracted the virus while traveling, setting off public health alarms and preparing local experts for potential future monkeypox cases. \"We've dealt with it before. We've dealt with other things like it before. I think we are certainly well-prepared,\" said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County health department. What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is a virus transmitted from animals to humans that causes symptoms similar to the now-eradicated smallpox virus, although monkeypox is less contagious and less severe. It spreads from animal to person or person to person through close contact with lesions, body fluids and contaminated materials like clothing and bedding. Around one to two weeks after infection, most patients begin to experience fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes, according to the CDC. Between one to three days after developing a fever, patients get a rash that often starts on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. Lesions from the rash go through several stages before scabbing and falling off. The illness lasts around two to four weeks. Recently, around 3% to 6% of cases have been fatal, WHO said. The virus isn't new. Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 in colonies of monkeys kept for research, although several different animals can carry the disease, including rodents. The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, and since then cases have been reported in several Central and West African countries. Monkeypox cases also have been documented in countries outside Africa, including the U.S., the U.K., Israel and Singapore. Historically, cases outside Africa have been related to international travel or imported animals. The current outbreak looks a little different than past virus flare-ups. The \"vast majority of reported cases\" in the current outbreak have no travel links to countries where the disease is native, meaning the virus has likely been spreading undetected for some time, WHO said. Some patients aren't experiencing flulike symptoms, and are instead just reporting rashes in certain parts of the body, such as the genitals. Those subdued symptoms make the virus harder to diagnose, said Dr. Prathit Kulkarni, assistant professor of medicine-infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Recent cases also have been largely reported in men who have sex with men, although Kulkarni emphasized that people of any sexual orientation could potentially contract the disease. Right now, scientists don't think of monkeypox as a \"sexually transmitted infection in the way we would consider HIV or gonorrhea or chlamydia as sexually transmitted,\" he said. \"It's more transmitted by direct close contact, but it doesn't have to necessarily be sexual contact.\" What treatments are there? Most people with healthy immune systems infected with monkeypox will experience mild symptoms that go away on their own. People who are at high risk of severe disease \u2014 including immunocompromised patients, children younger than 8 or people who are pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 may want to contact the CDC about treatment options. There aren't any treatments created specifically for monkeypox infections, but an antiviral drug developed to treat smallpox has been licensed to treat monkeypox, WHO said. The best way to prevent the spread of monkeypox is by taking preventive measures, like avoiding contact with sick people or animals that could harbor the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for someone who has monkeypox. The Food and Drug Administration approved one vaccine, called Jynneos, for the prevention of monkeypox, and it is being evaluated for potential use in people who are at risk of exposure to the virus. Vaccines used to stop smallpox also provide protection against monkeypox, according to WHO. Most countries halted their smallpox vaccination programs in the 1980s after the virus was declared eradicated, and Lewis said it's uncertain whether people previously vaccinated against smallpox still have immunity against monkeypox more than four decades later. What Dallas leaders learned from the 2021 monkeypox case When Dallas County officials learned of the monkeypox case in Dallas last July, they sprang into action by isolating the patient and contacting recent close contacts. The patient, who has not been publicly identified, had recently traveled from Lagos, Nigeria, and had a connecting flight through Atlanta. Huang said a team of public health officials from the county, the state and the CDC helped to monitor close contacts for 21 days after potential exposure. None of the close contacts ever developed symptoms. \"It was a public health success,\" Huang said. \"But, it was some basic public health control that we do in multiple situations.\" In addition to being home of Texas' first monkeypox case, Dallas was also the site of the first U.S. ebola case during the 2014 outbreak. Early diagnosis of the monkeypox case likely kept the virus from spreading further, said Dr. Agam Rao, a medical officer in the CDC Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. \"The clinicians in this case did things so quickly and so impressively that they're sort of a model for other clinicians,\" Rao said. While it's possible that Texas will see a monkeypox case in coming weeks or months, it's not inevitable, especially because the disease spreads primarily through close contact rather than airborne pathogens. \"It's highly unlikely that monkeypox is going to spread in the same way COVID did so rapidly around so many different countries,\" Kulkarni said. If someone suspects they have the virus, they should immediately contact a health care provider to help mitigate the spread of the disease, he said. "}
