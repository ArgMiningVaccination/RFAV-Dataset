I am polydrugged, having been prescribed Ativan (1985), sertraline (2005), and tramadol (2012). The consensus is that I should come off these. I agree, BUT who, pray, will help me with withdrawal? On my medication it says with a view of reduction, that is, on the Ativan and tramadol \u2014 although not once has there been any suggestion as to how. I turned to 'Dr Google' and a helpline in Bristol \u2014 one of only two in the UK. It has taken 2 painstaking years to withdraw safely from benzodiazepines. I am a taxpayer and have been for over 40 years. Why, unlike for illegal substances, is there no help, TLC, or rehab facilities for me and thousands like me? A worker, a mother, a friend. I have no respect for the doctors who are either ignorant about this or wilfully silent. Honesty is needed from the profession in order to restore a semblance of trust. - \u00a9 British Journal of General Practice 2017 REFERENCE - 1. "}
