The updated guidance can be found atInterim Clinical Considerations for Use of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Authorized in the UnitedStates | CDC. Summary of the recent changes include: New booster recommendation for people ages 12 years and older to receive 1 bivalent mRNAbooster after completion of a monovalent primary series; it replaces all prior boosterrecommendations for this age group COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefSeptember 9, 2022 Recommendations for use of a bivalent Moderna booster dose in people ages 18 yearsand older Recommendations for use of a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster dose in people ages 12years and older Updated guidance for observation periods following COVID-19 vaccination Updated guidance on COVID-19 vaccination and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) inchildren (MIS-C) and in adults (MIS-A) Import ant Consider ations Appointments for monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna boosters in people 12 years of ageand older must be rescheduled for when the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines are available. Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized as booster doses forindividuals ages 12 years and older,meaning monovalentbooster doses can no longer be givento people ages 12 years and older, even if the person had not previously received a monovalentbooster dose. Everyone ages 12 years and older is recommended to receive 1 age-appropriate bivalent mRNAbooster dose after completion of any FDA approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primaryseries or last monovalent booster dose. People cannot get a bivalent booster without first completing at least a primary series Age-appropriate homologous and heterologous boosters allowed; there is no preference Any monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster administered to people aged 12 years afterFDA's authorization of bivalent boosters must be reported as a vaccine administration error toVAERS. In this situation, organizations or providers may submit a single, aggregateVAERSreportdescribing the error, how it happened, andhow many people were affected. If anyvaccine recipient developed an adverse event, an individual VAERS report should also besubmitted. At this time, no changes to schedules for children ages 6 months through 11 years. Individuals ages 12 years and older are recommended to receive an age-appropriatebivalent mRNAbooster doseat least two months after receipt ofa primary series or prior monovalent booster dose.Either Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent vaccine (12 years and older) or Moderna COVID-19 bivalentvaccine (18 years and older) can be used based on the patient's age at time of administration. 2COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefSeptember 9, 2022 COCA CALL - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BIVALENT COVID-19 BOOSTER DOSES INPEOPLE AGES 12 YEARS AND OLDERDuring this COCA Call, presenters will discuss CDC's new guidance on bivalent COVID-19 booster dosesfor people ages 12 years and older, including those who are moderately or severelyimmunocompromised.Date: September 13, 2022Time: 1:00 - 2:00pmLink:https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2022/callinfo_091322.asp COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION AND ORDERING CADENCEThe Department will continue to survey Local Public Health Agencies (LPHAs) biweekly to determineeach county's desired COVID-19 vaccine allocation.

Everyone ages 12 years and older is recommended to receive 1 age-appropriate bivalent mRNAbooster dose after completion of any FDA approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primaryseries or last monovalent booster dose. COVID-19 UP TO DATE VACCINATION DEFINITIONWith the arrival of updated boosters, CDC is reframing what it means to beup to date with COVID-19 vaccination.An individualis now considered up to date with COVID-19vaccines if they have completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series and received the most recent boosterdose recommended by CDC. Vaccine recommendations are based on age, the vaccine first received, andtime since last dose. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised havedifferentrecommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. TIMING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH CURRENT OR PRIOR SARS-COV-2INFECTION At a minimum, defer any COVID-19 vaccination, including bivalent booster vaccination, at leastuntil recovery from the acute illness (if symptoms were present) and criteria to discontinueisolation have been met. In addition, people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying any COVID-19vaccination, including bivalent booster vaccination, by 3 months from symptom onset or positivetest (if infection was asymptomatic). 4 COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefSeptember 9, 2022 Individual factors such as risk of COVID-19 severe disease, COVID-19 community level, orcharacteristics of the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain should be taken into account whendetermining whether to delay getting a COVID-19 vaccination after infection. COADMINISTRATION OF COVID-19 VACCINES WITH OTHER VACCINES Routine administration of all age-appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously is recommendedas best practice for people for whom no specific contraindications exist at the time of thehealthcare visit. Extensive experience with non-COVID 19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity andadverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously aswhen they are administered alone. Providers should offer all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit. COADMINISTRATION OF INFLUENZA WITH COVID-19 VACCINES Providers should offer influenza and COVID-19 vaccines at the same visit, if eligible. This includes adjuvanted or high-dose influenza vaccines; administer in separate limbs. With both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 circulating, getting both vaccines is important forprevention of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Getting both vaccines at the same visit increases the chance that a person will be up to date withtheir vaccinations.

This is especially truefor those over 50 years of age or immunocompromised individuals seeking additional boosters.If a vaccination card is full, the CDC recommends completing a second card and stapling the two cardstogether. Individuals are encouraged to photograph both cards in case the two become separated, ifpossible. Both cards should be presented when vaccination history is required for travel, employment, orother purposes. Patients should bring both cards to vaccination appointments for verification ofvaccination history. 11COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefSeptember 9, 2022 V-SAFE AFTER VACCINATION HEALTH CHECKERV-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalizedhealth check-ins after an individual receives a COVID-19 vaccination.
