How to Reduce Your Environmental Allergy Symptoms Without Needles, Shots or Medication! Frequently Asked Questions About Environmental Allergy *1. What is a Environmental Allergy? *Environmental allergies are your body's response to substances you inhale at your home, school or workplace. They can be caused by dust, animal dander, mold spores or mildew, or feathers. *Dust and mold allergies are different from pollen allergies because they cause problems all year round-not just at certain seasons. Patient Testimonial *Happy again! *\"A woman 23 years of age, suffered from a type of dermatitis that did not respond to any type of traditional solutions. In the office she was helped for food products, chemicals and environmental items. Various parts of her body showed cracked areas and clear water blisters that looked like first degree burns. Her history revealed she was allergic to environmental allergens. She had the NAET solution by Dr. Popkin and her problems resolved.\"* - Susan G. 2. How do Environmental Allergies develop? *Doctors and health specialists are not exactly sure why some individuals are susceptible to allergies and others are not. Many times allergies are passed from generation to generation or many times skip a generation. Many authorities feel that allergies can be developed in utero when the mother is exposed to certain foods, substances, chemicals, etc. Patient Testimonial *Depressed No More \"I had been suffering from depression most of my life. I tried various forms of solutions, including psychology, exercise, mega nutrition therapy, massages etc. I was found to be allergic to iron. I had wrought iron ornamental works all over my house. When I was helped for the metal iron, my depression cleared!\"* - John A. *3. How many different types of Environmental Allergies are there? 1. Inhalants 2. Contactants 3. Infectants 4. Molds & Fungi - Changes in the environment can bring changes of air pressure that can affect the immune system. - Environmental toxins such as metals, chemicals, and other pollutants weaken the immune system. - Environmental stressors include the various microorganisms, synthetic fabrics, plant proteins, plasticizers, chemical additives, food preservatives, food colors, drugs, vaccines, artificial sweeteners, synthetic hormones, air pollutants, cleaning agents, deodorants, soaps, and toothpastes that we use on a daily basis can affect your immune system and cause allergic reactions. - Environmental stressors are often considered as the most harmful substances that can affect your immune system in many ways and cause many types of environmental allergies. - Some environmental agents such as plastic containers, latex products, and some flowers can become your worst enemies in some circumstances and leads to environmental allergies. *Patient Testimonial *Painful Lupus *A woman of 28 years old, was under treatment for lupus. She had severe joint pain most of the time. She suffered from severe insomnia , mental cloudiness, poor memory, irritability and as mentioned joint pain. She was on 3 different analgesics , which she took every 3 hours to control her pain. Extremely hot, cold or cloudy weather affected her immensely. On such days, she stayed indoors with pain pills and warm water. When she was evaluated she was found to be allergic to all fabrics she was wearing, however she was not allergic to any food or drugs. she was managed individually for cotton, polyester, acrylic, nylon, plastics and leather. At the end of her help plan, the lupus symptoms diminished greatly and her blood tests showed great improvement. She was told by her M.D. that her Lupus was in remission and she was symptom free.* - Lily H. 4. What different symptoms can people experience from a Environmental Allergy? *Environmental allergies may cause symptoms such as sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy eyes and they may cause coughing and wheezing. 5. What is N.A.E.T. and how does it help with environmental allergies? *N.A.E.T. stands for Nambudripad's Allergy Technique. NAET was developed by Dr. Devi Nambudripad. She is an R.N., PhD in Acupuncture, Chiropractor and has recently received her M.D. degree. She has a clinic in Buena Park, California, where we have personally visited many times. She still sees over a hundred patients per day and continues doing allergy research. *We have found that individuals with environmental issues have many symptoms due to the outside landscape. By addressing the cause and reduce the allergies using the NAET technology their signs & symptoms may resolve. *I know that you're wondering if NAET could help you or your child? It can.

Why haven't I heard about N.A.E.T.? *Even though it has been practiced over the past 20 years, N.A.E.T. is still considered a relatively new technology on the allergy scene. Dr. Devi has personally trained over 4500 practitioners in her allergy addressing technique. Unfortunately, these individual practitioners, including us, do not have the tremendous advertising budgets of the pharmaceutical industry to enhance the awareness of this cutting edge solution. N.A.E.T. has grown primarily by word of mouth from existing patients and is only now finding its way into the research journals and allergy reference materials. 8. What is the N.A.E.T. procedure and testing? *N.A.E.T. is based on the theory and concepts of EME or electromagnetic energy. The human body has a flow of electrical currents that run through it everyday of your life called meridians or energy channels. When the body has an allergic reaction, a blockage occurs in the meridians. Blockages of different meridians, or channels, cause different symptoms. By stimulating what are called alarm points on either side of the spine while the person holds the allergen vial, the electromagnetic energy is altered in the patient's body therefore reducing the allergic response. In the body a chemical, enzymatic, and physiologic change occurs which neutralizes the immune mediators and therefore interrupts the antigen-antibody reaction. By doing this, it clears the energy blockages and notifies the brain that the allergen has been desensitized. 9. What is the help procedure on a typical N.A.E.T patient? *The patient is first asked to wash their hands with soap and water in order to clean off any foreign substances or energies that may be on their hands. The patient is then asked to remove their watch, socks, shoes, and any other electrical or battery operated device from their body. The Doctor will then begin the MRT (muscle response testing procedure) in order to determine what substance the patient has allergy or sensitivity to. The MRT procedure is painless. When a baby or child is being tested, a surrogate will be used. Typically this is the parent. The surrogate is always checked first to make sure they are not allergic to the item being tested. After recording the findings, the Doctor will begin the first session. The patient then holds a small vial with the allergen energetic in it. The Doctor then uses a small painless instrument to stimulate key acupressure points along the spine. Based upon the patients preference, different techniques including acupressure, electro-acupuncture, laser acupuncture or needle acupuncture, are utilized in completing the help plan. After this procedure, the patient with the vial in hand is asked to relax for a period of 20 minutes. This period helps the body go through the desensitization to the allergen. In the case of children, the vial is secured to their body using a hypoallergenic tape. At the end of the help plan period, the doctor will once again check muscle response strength to the allergen. Once again, the patient will be asked to wash their hands; but this time only water is to be used. This will remove remnant bioenergetics of the substance being managed. Final written instructions are then given outlining the products that must be avoided and the length of time of this avoidance period. 10. Does the help planhelp people of all ages? *N.A.E.T. can be effective for individuals of all ages. In our office we have helped pregnant women, newborns, infants, children of all ages, adults, and geriatrics. 11. How long do you have to avoid the allergen? *As previously stated, after the session in the office is completed, you will be give a list of substances to be avoided and the length of time of the avoidance. Your body will be very sensitive at this time to the items / allergen that you have cleared. Most individuals have to stay away from the products for at least 25 hours. However, this could be longer in individual situations and will be assessed on each and every visit. 12. Are there any risks to the patient or potential side effects? *There have been no reported side effects when the guidelines have been followed correctly. If they are not adhered to, the patient may experience an allergic reaction if they come in contact with the allergen during the avoidance period. The high success rate is due in part to the thorough consultation, examination, and proper protocols that are instituted in our office. The patient's commitment, understanding, and follow through with the Doctor's instructions are an integral part to the success of the session. If the guidelines are closely followed, side effects should be few, if none at all. The patient can expect improved health, which relates to an enhanced immune system, reduction of their allergies and symptoms, and a sense of well being. 13. Is there a certain order that must be followed in dealing with allergens? *Yes, according to Dr. Nambudripad's technique food items are checked and cleared first. There is a list of foods called the basics. 15 to 25 foods must be evaluated. The reason we check foods first is that your body cannot survive without food. Your body can avoid certain environmental allergens, chemicals, inhalants, etc. By clearing foods first, we strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and absorption. This allows your body to get the necessary nutrients which are essential when undergoing the subsequent sessions. Typically, the session order is as follows: - Egg Mix - includes egg yolks and whites, chicken - Calcium - Vitamin C - B-complex - Sugar - Vitamin A - Iron - Salt - Chlorides - Mineral Mix - Corn - Yeast - Wheat *The order is very structured and must be followed exactly because one food group is usually linked to the subsequent one. Clearing of one allergen could potentially reduce the need for dealing with another allergen group further down the line. 14. How many sessions will I need? *This is a very difficult question to answer in that everyone has different genetic makeup, body type, histories, and personality. All of these factors will come into play in order to determine which allergens need to be addressed. Most individuals will have to be tested and cleared on the basics that come of positive. For each positive allergen being tested, one session is usually needed for clearing that particular item. Only one allergen is cleared or helped with per visit. This is not only because your body is actively desensitizing toward the one allergen, but also it would be rather difficult for your body to go through this procedure with multiple allergens at the same item. Secondly, it would be rather difficult to avoid multiple food groups at the same time and strict adherence to the avoidance list and avoidance time is a key component to a successful session. Fasting is not recommended, or allowed, during the avoidance period. 15. What is the difference between allergy shots and N.A.E.T.? *The goal of allergy shots or immunotherapy is to desensitize the individual to the allergen or allergens by injecting a small amount of the substance in the skin. Allergy shots typically do not offer long-term results but are primarily used as a symptomatic approach. The injection is usually administered in the arm and given 2x per week. The dosage is gradually decreased depending on symptoms until a maintenance level is established. This process can last for 5 -7 years. Shots can be painful when being administered. Pain at the injection site, with soreness can also be expected from these shots. *N.A.E.T. uses no shots, no needles, and no medications. It is a painless session. With N.A.E.T., in just a few visits most individuals will achieve positive results in a short time. Although the number of sessions varies as a result of the amount of allergens that need to be dealt with, most people can have resolution of a life-long problem in as little as 3 months or a few visits. 16. How do I setup a consultation with the doctor to see if he can help me? *Dr. Popkin will be happy to discuss any questions, or concerns with you prior toyou coming. Please call (954) 370-1900 to schedule a consultation with the doctor. 17. Patient Testimonials *\"WITH JUST 6 NAET SESSIONS WE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. Maureen is 16 years of age.

It has been 4 weeks today since we started NAET sessions on our son Adam,who has been diagnosed as autistic for the past 3 years. We tried many different sessions on him ever since he was diagnosed as autistic. Our 5 year old son has shown tremendous improvement already. He is more awake,calmer and focused now than ever before. His inaudible speech is much cleared too. I would like to inform all parents and caregivers of autistic children to find NAET for your children. NAET has given us hope and expectations and is something everybody needs to look into. We have been searching for the past 3 years for some relief for our son's problem. Now after many sessions NAET has given us hope to move on with our lives. Thanks Dr. Popkin!!\"* - John T. *Results may vary from person to person "}
