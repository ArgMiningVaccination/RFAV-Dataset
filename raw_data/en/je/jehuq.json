Campus Security The Washington University campus is among the most attractive in the nation, and it enjoys a safe and relaxed atmosphere. Personal safety and the security of personal property while on campus is a shared responsibility. Washington University has made safety and security a priority through our commitment to a full-time professional police department, the use of closed- circuit television, card access, good lighting, shuttle services, emergency telephones, and ongoing educational safety awareness programs. The vast majority of crimes that occur on college campuses are crimes of opportunity, which can be prevented. The best protection against crime is an informed and alert campus community. Washington University has developed several programs to help make everyone's experiences here safe and secure. An extensive network of emergency telephones \u2014 including more than 200 \"blue light\" telephones \u2014 is connected directly to the University Police Department and can alert the police to a person's exact location. In addition to the regular shuttle service, an evening walking escort service and a mobile Campus Circulator shuttle are available on the Danforth Campus. The Campus2Home shuttle will provide a safe ride home for those living in four designated areas off campus \u2014 Skinker- DeBaliviere, Loop South, north of the Loop, and just south of the campus \u2014 from 6:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. seven days a week. The shuttle leaves from the Mallinckrodt Center every 15 minutes and takes passengers directly to the front doors of their buildings. Shuttle drivers will then wait and watch to make sure passengers get into their buildings safely. Community members can track the shuttle in real time using the WUSTL Mobile App. The app can be downloaded free of charge from the Apple iTunes Store or the Google Play Store. The University Police Department is a full-service organization staffed by certified police officers who patrol the campus 24 hours a day throughout the entire year. The department offers a variety of crime prevention programs, including a high-security bicycle lock program, free personal-safety whistles, computer security tags, personal safety classes for women and men, and security surveys. Community members are encouragedto download and install the WashU Safe personal safety app on their phones; this app allows users to call for help during emergencies, to use Friend Walk to track their walks on and off campus, and to access many additional safety features. For more information about these programs, visit the Washington University Police Department website (https://police.wustl.edu/). In compliance with the Campus Crime Awareness and Security Act of 1990, Washington University publishes an annual report (http://police.wustl.edu/clery-reports-logs/) entitled Safety & Security: Guide for Students, Faculty, and Staff \u2014 Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Reports and Drug & Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program .

A copy of our complete Tobacco-Free Policy (https://hr.wustl.edu/ items/tobacco-free-policy/ ) is available on the Human Resources website. Medical Examinations Entering students must provide medical information to the Habif Health and Wellness Center. This will include the completion of a health history and a record of all current immunizations. If students fail to comply with these requirements prior to registration, they will be required to obtain vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella at the Habif Health and Wellness Center, if there is no evidence of immunity. In addition, undergraduate students will be required to obtain meningitis vaccinations. Students will be assessed the cost of the vaccinations. Students will be unable to complete registration for classes until all health requirements have been satisfied. Noncompliant students may be barred from classes and from all university facilities, including housing units, if in the judgment of the university their continued presence would pose a health risk to themselves or to the university community. Medical and immunization information is to be given via the Habif Health and Wellness Center (https://students.wustl.edu/ habif-health-wellness-center/) website. All students who have completed the registration process should access the website and create a student profile by using their WUSTL Key.

These community standards and expectations are intended to foster an environment conducive to learning and inquiry. Freedom of thought and expression is essential to the university's academic mission. 11Bulletin 2021-22 About Washington University in St. Louis (10/14/21) Disciplinary proceedings are meant to be informal, fair and expeditious. Charges of non-serious misconduct are generally heard by the student conduct officer. With limited exceptions, serious or repeated allegations are heard by the campuswide Student Conduct Board or the University Sexual Assault Investigation Board where applicable. Complaints against students that include allegations of sexual assault or certain complaints that include allegations of sexual harassment in violation of the Student Conduct Code are governed by the procedures found in the University Sexual Assault Investigation Board Policy (https://wustl.edu/about/ compliance-policies/governance/usaib-procedures-complaints- sexual-assault-filed-students/ ), which is available online or in hard copy from the Title IX coordinator or the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards. Students may be accountable to both governmental authorities and to the university for acts that constitute violations of law and the Student Conduct Code. For a complete copy of the Student Conduct Code (https:// wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/ university-student-judicial-code/), visit the university website. Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy Effective learning, teaching and research all depend upon the ability of members of the academic community to trust one another and to trust the integrity of work that is submitted for academic credit or conducted in the wider arena of scholarly research. Such an atmosphere of mutual trust fosters the free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential. In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged, and work that is presented as original must be, in fact, original. Faculty, students and administrative staff all share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at Washington University. Scope and Purpose This statement on academic integrity applies to all undergraduate students at Washington University. Graduate students are governed by policies in each graduate school or division. All students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behavior. The purpose of the statement is twofold: 1.To clarify the university's expectations with regard to undergraduate students' academic behavior; and 2.To provide specific examples of dishonest conduct. The examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive.Violations of This Policy Include but Are Not Limited to the Following: 1.Plagiarism Plagiarism consists of taking someone else's ideas, words or other types of work product and presenting them as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to be attentive to proper methods of documentation and acknowledgment. To avoid even the suspicion of plagiarism, a student must always do the following: Enclose every quotation in quotation marks and acknowledge its source. Cite the source of every summary, paraphrase, abstraction or adaptation of material originally prepared by another person and any factual data that is not considered common knowledge. Include the name of author, title of work, publication information and page reference. Acknowledge material obtained from lectures, interviews or other oral communication by citing the source (i.e., the name of the speaker, the occasion, the place and the date). Cite material from the internet as if it were from a traditionally published source. Follow the citation style or requirements of the instructor for whom the work is produced. 2.Cheating on an Examination A student must not receive or provide any unauthorized assistance on an examination. During an examination, a student may use only materials authorized by the faculty. 3.Copying or Collaborating on Assignments Without Permission When a student submits work with their name on it, this is a written statement that credit for the work belongs to that student alone. If the work was a product of collaboration, each student is expected to clearly acknowledge in writing all persons who contributed to its completion. Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise, it is dishonest to collaborate with others when completing any assignment or test, performing laboratory experiments, writing and/or documenting computer programs, writing papers or reports, or completing problem sets. If the instructor allows group work in some circumstances but not others, it is the student's responsibility to understand the degree of acceptable collaboration for each assignment and to ask for clarification, if necessary. To avoid cheating or unauthorized collaboration, a student should never do any of the following: 12Bulletin 2021-22 About Washington University in St. Louis (10/14/21) Use, copy or paraphrase the results of another person's work and represent that work as one's own, regardless of the circumstances. Refer to, study from or copy archival files (e.g., old tests, homework, solutions manuals, backfiles) that were not approved by the instructor. Copy another's work or permit another student to copy one's work. Submit work as a collaborative effort if they did not contribute a fair share of the effort. 4.Fabrication or Falsification of Data or Records It is dishonest to fabricate or falsify data in laboratory experiments, research papers or reports or in any other circumstances; to fabricate source material in a bibliography or \"works cited\" list; or to provide false information on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or other document in connection with academic efforts. It is also dishonest to take data developed by someone else and present them as one's own. Examples of falsification include the following: Altering information on any exam, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Altering, omitting or inventing laboratory data to submit as one's own findings. This includes copying laboratory data from another student to present as one's own; modifying data in a write-up; and providing data to another student to submit as one's own. 5.Other Forms of Deceit, Dishonesty or Inappropriate Conduct Under no circumstances is it acceptable for a student to do any of the following: Submit the same work, or essentially the same work, for more than one course without explicitly obtaining permission from all instructors. A student must disclose when a paper or project builds on work completed earlier in their academic career. Request an academic benefit based on false information or deception. This includes requesting an extension of time, a better grade or a recommendation from an instructor. Make any changes (including adding material or erasing material) on any test paper, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Willfully damage the efforts or work of other students. Steal, deface or damage academic facilities or materials. Collaborate with other students planning or engaging in any form of academic misconduct. Submit any academic work under someone else's name other than one's own. This includes but is not limited to sitting for another person's exam; both parties will be held responsible. Engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here.This list is not intended to be exhaustive. To seek clarification, students should ask the professor or the assistant in instruction for guidance. Reporting Misconduct Faculty Responsibility Faculty and instructors are strongly encouraged to report incidents of student academic misconduct to the academic integrity officer in their school or college in a timely manner so that the incident may be handled fairly and consistently across schools and departments. Assistants in instruction are expected to report instances of student misconduct to their supervising instructors. Faculty members are expected to respond to student concerns about academic dishonesty in their courses. Student Responsibility If a student observes others violating this policy, the student is strongly encouraged to report the misconduct to the instructor, to seek advice from the academic integrity officer of the school or college that offers the course in question, or to address the student(s) directly. Exam Proctor Responsibility Exam proctors are expected to report incidents of suspected student misconduct to the course instructor and/or the Disability Resource Center, if applicable. Procedure Jurisdiction This policy covers all undergraduate students, regardless of their college of enrollment. Cases will be heard by school- specific committees according to the school in which the class is listed rather than the school in which the student is enrolled. All violations and sanctions will be reported to the student's college of enrollment. Administrative Procedures Individual undergraduate colleges and schools may design specific procedures to resolve allegations of academic misconduct by students in courses offered by that school, so long as the procedures are consistent with this policy and with the Student Conduct Code. Student Rights and Responsibilities in a Hearing A student accused of an academic integrity violation \u2014 whether by a professor, an assistant in instruction, an academic integrity officer or another student \u2014 is entitled to do the following: 13Bulletin 2021-22 About Washington University in St. Louis (10/14/21) Review the written evidence in support of the charge Ask any questions Offer an explanation as to what occurred Present any material that would cast doubt on the correctness of the charge Receive a determination of the validity of the charge without reference to any past record of misconduct When responding to a charge of academic misconduct, a student may do the following: Deny the charges and request a hearing in front of the appropriate academic integrity officer or committee Admit the charges and request a hearing to determine sanction(s) Admit the charges and accept the imposition of sanctions without a hearing Request a leave of absence from the university (however, the academic integrity matter must be resolved prior to re- enrollment) Request to withdraw permanently from the university with a transcript notation that there is an unresolved academic integrity matter pending A student has the following responsibilities with regard to resolving the charge of academic misconduct: Admit or deny the charge. This will determine the course of action to be pursued. Provide truthful information regarding the charges. It is a Student Conduct Code violation to provide false information to the university or anyone acting on its behalf. Sanctions If Found Not in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If the charges of academic misconduct are not proven, no record of the allegation will appear on the student's transcript. If Found in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If, after a hearing, a student is found to have acted dishonestly or if a student has admitted to the charges prior to a hearing, the school's academic integrity officer or committee may impose sanctions, including but not limited to the following: Issue a formal written reprimand Impose educational sanctions, such as completing a workshop on plagiarism or academic ethics Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the assignment (a given grade is ultimately the prerogative of the instructor) Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the courseRecommend to the instructor that the student receive a course grade penalty less severe than failure of the course Place the student on disciplinary probation for a specified period of time or until defined conditions are met. The probation will be noted on the student's transcript and internal record while it is in force. In cases serious enough to warrant suspension or expulsion from the university, refer the matter to the Student Conduct Board for consideration. Additional educational sanctions may be imposed. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Withdrawing from the course will not prevent the academic integrity officer or hearing panel from adjudicating the case, imposing sanctions or recommending grade penalties, including a failing grade in the course. A copy of the sanction letter will be placed in the student's academic file. Appeals If a student believes the academic integrity officer or the committee did not conduct a fair hearing or if a student believes the sanction imposed for misconduct is excessive, they may appeal to the Student Conduct Board within 14 days of the original decision. Appeals are governed by Section VII C of the Student Conduct Code. Records Administrative Record-Keeping Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the academic integrity officer in each school to keep accurate, confidential records concerning academic integrity violations. When a student has been found to have acted dishonestly, a letter summarizing the allegation, the outcome and the sanction shall be placed in the student's official file in the office of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. In addition, each school's academic integrity officer shall make a report of the outcome of every formal accusation of student academic misconduct to the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards, who shall maintain a record of each incident. Multiple Offenses When a student is formally accused of academic misconduct and a hearing is to be held by an academic integrity officer, a committee, or the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, the person in charge of administering the hearing shall query the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards about the student(s) accused of misconduct. The director shall provide any information in the records concerning that student to the integrity officer. Such information will be 14Bulletin 2021-22 About Washington University in St. Louis (10/14/21) used in determining sanctions only if the student is found to have acted dishonestly in the present case. Evidence of past misconduct may not be used to resolve the issue of whether a student has acted dishonestly in a subsequent case. Reports to Faculty and Student Body School and college academic integrity officers are encouraged to make periodic (at least annual) reports to the students and faculty of their school concerning accusations of academic misconduct and the outcomes, without disclosing specific information that would allow identification of the student(s) involved.

M17 CLNV 541 Methods, Metrics and Measures for Dissemination and Implementation Research Despite the unequivocal successes of biomedical research over the last generation, the use of evidence-based clinical interventions in routine public health and clinical practice remains far from optimal. Today, Americans receive approximately half of indicated medical care (and much unindicated care as well). As a result, even though the past 30 years have yielded unprecedented gains in clinical and medical sciences, the health of Americans lags behind that of other industrialized countries. Globally, the proportion of morbidity and mortality due to available (and affordable) but unused clinical interventions is even larger. Dissemination & Implementation (D&I) researchis an emerging area of scientific inquiry with a growing body of distinctive perspectives and methods that seeks to tackle this gap. This course focuses on approaches of particular or distinctive relevance to implementation research. Given that implementation issues often occur at an organizational, practice, or regional level, knowledge of concepts involving multi-stage sampling, attendant design effects, quantification of within- and between-cluster correlation, and cluster-level randomization is crucial. In addition, many emerging concepts in implementation research \u2014 including context, adaptation, strategies and outcomes \u2014 are now accompanied by advancement in their conceptualization and measurement. This course introduces the foundational methods of measurement development (e.g., latent class analysis, criterion and construct validity) as well as important recent publications in this area (e.g., the Program Sustainability Assessment Tool).

The prevailing view is that the functional organization of even the mature brain is dynamic \u2014 changing in response either to increases or decreases in stimulation. However, this has not always been the accepted perspective. Even now, many fundamental questions remain, and the answers should directly impact the way that we approach learning and the rehabilitation (re-learning) in the future. Just what are the limits on plasticity in the adult brain? How should environments be structured to exploit this capacity effectively? Is all reorganization behaviorally relevant? What factors contribute to adaptive, as opposed to maladaptive, changes? Together, we will consider historical perspectives on, and what is presently known about, these and related questions.

Physical Therapy Physical therapy is the science of human movement applied to rehabilitation, injury, fitness, injury prevention and overall health. Practicing in a variety of settings, physical therapists diagnose and treat movement dysfunction in patients with skill, competence and compassion. The Program in Physical Therapy is committed to providing students with excellent scientific and clinical education in an environment that strives to continually lead the industry in practice, research, innovation and advocacy of movement health. The Program in Physical Therapy at the School of Medicine offers two formal curricula that collectively foster opportunities for lifelong learning and comprehensive career development: the Doctor of Physical Therapy (p. 91) and the PhD in Movement Science (p. 92). 54Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) The Human Movement System Approach The Program in Physical Therapy has pioneered a unique, movement-based approach to physical therapy. The human movement system is at the core of our approach to physical therapy education, research and patient care. This system consists of physiological organ systems that interact to produce and support the movement of the body and its parts. Movement science is the study of the movement system, and we believe physical therapists are the world's movement system experts. Our program (https://outlook.wustl.edu/movement-redefined/ ) has pioneered the development of movement-focused physical therapy education, research and treatment. The human movement system continues to be our foundation for treating patients, conducting research, and training the next generation of leaders in physical therapy. Our vision is aligned with the vision of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) (http:// www.apta.org/ ), which is to \"transform society by optimizing movement to improve the human experience.\" Additional Information Further information, including complete admissions instructions and program descriptions, may be obtained through direct correspondence with the Program in Physical Therapy: Program in Physical Therapy Washington University School of Medicine 4444 Forest Park Avenue, CB 8502 https://pt.wustl.edu Degrees & Offerings Doctor of Physical Therapy (p. 91) PhD in Movement Science (p. 92) Research The mission of the Research Division is to understand how the movement system ( https://pt.wustl.edu/about-us/) is affected by disease, injury, lifestyle, development and aging and to understand how movement can be used to promote health by enhancing physical function, activity and participation across the lifespan. Our interdisciplinary scientific endeavors include mechanistic and translational investigations at all levels of organization, from the cell to society. Our research (https://pt.wustl.edu/ research/our-research-areas/ ) is supported by millions of dollars in federal, private foundation and university funding.

Audiology and Communication Sciences Doctor of Audiology The Doctor of Audiology (AuD) (https://pacs.wustl.edu/programs/ doctor-of-audiology/ ) program is a four-year course of study that prepares students as independent clinical audiologists. The curriculum integrates course work with immersive clinical experiences and research opportunities, culminating in a year-long clinical externship. Course work includes the basic and applied sciences as well as in the prevention, identification, evaluation and treatment of auditory and vestibular disorders. Clinical experiences begin during the first semester of study and become more immersive with each successive semester, culminating in a full-time clinical externship during the fourth year. The program operates within the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, which offers students a wide variety of clinical education opportunities and experiences across the life span and scope of practice. Approximately 50 additional sites are affiliated with the program in the St. Louis metropolitan area. In addition, the world-class medical school and hospitals on campus provide students with unique opportunities, such as attending Grand Rounds, participating in cochlear implant seminars, and optional research training programs. Interested students have the opportunity to complete a summer practicum and the externship outside of the St. Louis area. The program is currently affiliated with 150 additional sites around the country, and that number grows each year. Master of Science in Deaf Education The Master of Science in Deaf Education (MSDE) (https:// pacs.wustl.edu/programs/master-of-science-in-deaf-education/) program is a two-year course of study that prepares students as teachers of children (birth to grade 12) who are deaf or hard of hearing. The early identification of hearing loss and advanced hearing technologies have increased the national need for 70Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) teachers with experience in listening and spoken language, thus creating opportunities for our graduates across the country. The program's curriculum is rooted in the development of speech, language, and social skills, with students studying the factors necessary for high-quality education. Students build their knowledge and skills through classroom instruction and immersive, hands-on student teaching experiences. They learn about and engage in the teaching process, from the first diagnosis and early intervention through family-centered counseling and educational options for the child. During the first year of study, students complete foundational course work and begin observation and practice teaching; advanced course work and formal practice teaching experiences are completed during the second year. PhD in Speech and Hearing Sciences The PhD program in Speech and Hearing Sciences (http:// bulletin.wustl.edu/grad/gsas/sahs/ ) prepares students for academic and research careers in speech and hearing sciences. The program was established in 1947, and it is dedicated to fostering scientific inquiry in speech and hearing sciences and related disciplines. The program is administered through the Graduate School at Washington University in St. Louis. Minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences The Minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences ( http:// bulletin.wustl.edu/undergrad/artsci/speechhearing/#minors) is designed for current undergraduate students interested in exploring topics related to human communication. Course work provides an overview of the fields of hearing, deafness, language and speech, with opportunities to explore related topics in more depth. This minor is especially valuable for students in fields such as psychology, education, philosophy-neuroscience- psychology (PNP) and linguistics, but it has broad applicability for many fields of study. Course work completed as part of this minor can also be used to fulfill prerequisites for graduate studies in audiology, deaf education and speech-language pathology. Biology and Biomedical SciencesPhD Degrees in Biology & Biomedical Sciences PhD Degrees Each program has its own steering committee, which provides students with guidance, addresses their needs, and monitors their progress. The committee also helps each student customize the course of study to match their individual needs. Each of the 13 programs establishes its own degree requirements. Across all of the programs, the course of study consists of five distinct parts: Courses This generally requires two to five semesters and usually consists of four to nine courses in areas fundamental to the student's program. Students are expected to maintain a B average in graduate courses. Laboratory Rotations Selecting a thesis adviser is the most important decision a student makes in graduate school. To help each student make an informed, thoughtful choice, the Division builds in flexibility to explore options. Students usually participate in three lab rotations during their first year. Additional rotations can be arranged, and rotation lengths are flexible. Students usually begin their thesis research by the end of their first year. Qualifying Examination After required courses are completed, each student takes a preliminary or qualifying examination to assess their mastery of the field and their ability to integrate information across fields. Upon successful completion of the qualifying exam, the student concentrates on thesis research. Thesis Research Thesis research begins once the student has chosen a laboratory in which to work. With their mentor \u2014 the laboratory's principal investigator \u2014 the student devises a thesis project and chooses an advisory committee. Typically between the end of their second year and the middle of their third year, students present their thesis proposals to the thesis committee. Upon successful approval of the thesis proposal, the student officially becomes a doctoral candidate. For the rest of the student's program of study, the thesis committee monitors progress and meets at least once a year to provide analysis and advice. It also serves as the thesis defense committee when the thesis is ready for presentation. Most students complete and defend their dissertations by the end of their sixth year. 71Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Scientific Scholarship Keeping abreast of scientific developments is critical for faculty and students alike. The Division offers many ways to stay current. More than 15 weekly biology seminars provide excellent opportunities to meet outstanding scientists from outside Washington University. Several annual symposia bring internationally recognized speakers to campus. Journal clubs meet weekly for students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty to present and discuss current scientific literature. A number of Interdisciplinary Research Pathways (http:// dbbs.wustl.edu/curstudents/SpecialEmphasisPathways/Pages/ SpecialEmphasisPathways.aspx ) allow students to enhance their PhD program. Program retreats allow for informal interaction among students and faculty. The Division also provides funds for each student to defray the costs of attending a national scientific meeting.

Medical Education Doctor of Medicine Admissions Admission Requirements for the Study of Medicine Entrance requirements for the School of Medicine include the following: 1.Evidence of superior intellectual ability and scholastic achievement; 2.Completion of at least 90 semester units of college courses in an approved college or university; 3.Completion of the Medical College Admission Test of the Association of American Medical Colleges; and 4.Evidence of character and integrity, a caring and compassionate attitude, scientific and humanitarian interests, effective communication skills, and motivation suitable for a career in medicine. Chemistry, physics and mathematics provide the tools for modern biology, for medicine and for the biological basis of patient care. Thus, a firm grounding in these subjects is essential for the study of medical sciences. Entering students are expected to have accomplished at least the equivalent of one-year courses at the undergraduate level in physics and biology; mathematics through calculus; and chemistry, including one year of general or inorganic chemistry and one year of organic chemistry. Course work in biochemistry is encouraged although not required. In addition, one semester of biochemistry can be substituted for one semester of organic chemistry. Similarly, one semester of statistics can be substituted for one 78Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) semester of calculus. In selected instances, one or more of these prerequisites may be waived by the Committee on Admissions, but applicants are strongly advised to pursue their interests in these and other areas of science. A major goal of undergraduate college work should be the development of the intellectual talents of the individual. This often involves the in-depth pursuit of some area of knowledge, whether in the humanities, the social sciences or the natural sciences. At the same time, a diversity of background is encouraged in to provide a necessary foundation for the development of cultural awareness, sensitivity and competence. Specific courses (other than the few in the natural sciences) are not prerequisites, because a great variety of courses and life experiences may prepare students for the many roles they may play in their medical careers.

Most state boards of licensure require that applicants graduate from a U.S. medical school accredited by the LCME as a condition for licensure. In addition, most state boards of licensure require that U.S. applicants take and pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination ( USMLE (https:// www.usmle.org/ )). For U.S. medical students to be eligible to sit for the USMLE, their school must be accredited by 80Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) the LCME. Graduates of LCME-accredited schools are also eligible for residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME (https:// www.acgme.org/ )). The School of Medicine has determined that, as a result of its LCME accreditation, its MD program curriculum meets the educational requirements to sit for the USMLE and to pursue licensure and certification in all states and territories of the United States and Washington, DC. For Students Entering the MD Program in July 2020 or After: The Gateway Curriculum ensures that students are not only exceptional physicians but that they are also prepared to lead the transformational changes needed to improve the future of health care delivery and the understanding of health and social determinants of health. The curriculum will include three phases. Phase 1 Phase 1 will consist of 61 total weeks of curricular time: 48 of these will involve Integrated Foundational Modules, nine will be spent in Clinical Immersions, and four will be made up of the EXPLORE Immersion. The Integrated Foundational Modules will present key science content in several fundamental areas. The Clinical Immersion time will contain clinical experiences that are authentic, varied in content, and appropriate for the student's level of ability. Every student will have an immersion in each of the following areas: Inpatient, Ambulatory, and Procedural. There will be substantial emphasis on professional identity formation and the social, behavioral, and health systems sciences. The EXPLORE Immersion element of the curriculum will focus on four key areas: research, education, advocacy/global health, and innovation. Phase 2 Phase 2 will include 12 months of clinical clerkship experiences in the content areas of Internal Medicine, Neurology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Surgery. Each clerkship will begin with one week of specialty-specific foundational science that consists of the purposeful reiteration and expansion of prior material and new material. This material will be taught in a \"signs and symptoms\" framework in order to facilitate core knowledge transfer to clinical reasoning. Each clerkship will end with one week dedicated to assessment, reflection, coaching, and communities (ARCC). Phase 3 Phase 3 will consist of 64 weeks total. Students will engage in 36 weeks of required elements that will include four weeks of Internal Medicine Subinternship, 16 weeks of Advanced Clinical Rotations (ACRs), 12 weeks of required Keystone IntegratedScience Courses (KISCs), and four weeks of Capstone. In addition, students will have the opportunity to take 36 weeks of electives (clinical, research, other non-clinical) inclusive of the following: Up to eight credit-bearing weeks of USMLE study time Six weeks of School of Medicine holiday time Up to four weeks of unscheduled (no credit) time, not inclusive of holiday time There is no limit on the amount of elective time that can be dedicated to research activities (excepting MSTP students who have completed their PhD training). For Students Entering the MD Program Prior to July 2020: The curriculum includes a core experience based upon a sequence of courses that introduces students to the many domains and disciplines of medicine. The principles, methods of investigation, problems and opportunities in each of the major disciplines of medical science and medical practice are presented in such a way as to help students select the career best suited to their abilities and goals. Through all four years of the curriculum, key topics known as Threads are woven throughout the learning experience, linking clinical and course work and enhancing the learning experience. The preclinical curriculum provides a science and investigative foundation for future clinical practice. First-year and second- year course work combines basic science taught via a variety of didactic means, including lectures, small groups, simulations and case-based learning. It also includes a Practice of Medicine course that uses regular patient interactions and integrative cases to teach students to skillfully interview and examine patients while integrating current health disparities and issues in the present global spectrum. In addition, students have the opportunity during their first year to complete four 10-hour selective courses in the humanities, the basic sciences and various clinical areas, which provides enrichment and in-depth focus on areas beyond the core curriculum. The preclinical curriculum is pass/fail. The overall goal of the third year is the implementation of the fundamental interactive clinical skills necessary for the practice of medicine at the highest possible level of excellence. Students achieve this goal by participating in intensive, closely supervised training experiences in the core clinical clerkships, which involve inpatient and ambulatory settings and interactions with patients who present a spectrum of emergent, urgent, routine and chronic clinical problems. Through these experiences, students exhibit growth and maturation in their abilities to take medical histories, perform complete physical examinations, synthesize findings into a diagnosis, formulate treatment plans, and document and present information in a concise, logical and organized fashion. 81Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) During the final year of the medical school curriculum, the required elective program helps students to decide where their major interests lie. It also enables them to benefit from the wide range of specialized knowledge and skills found in the faculty, and it lays the foundation for lifelong learning and the application of principles. The elective program permits students to select, according to their desires, the areas that they wish to explore or to study in depth. The fourth year is also offers students the opportunity to synthesize the learning from the third year in preparation for clinical residency. Toward this end, students are required to complete a Capstone course prior to graduation.

Interdisciplinary Courses Return to Doctor of Medicine Core Courses (p. 83) M80 InterDis 799 Selective Clerkship M80 InterDis 807 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation The elective is designed to provide the student with a broad introduction to the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Major objective of this clinical elective is to achieve greater knowledge of the neurological and musculoskeletal diseases and their treatment, and gain understanding of basic principles of rehabilitation. The student will learn the clinical and rehabilitative care of patients with strokes, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma and diseases, and limb amputations. Student will gain clinical skills in evaluating in management of functional impairments. Students will be expected to participate in daily rounds on inpatient rehabilitation units with the clinical care team, follow 3-5 patients, attend multidisciplinary team conferences and family meetings, attend outpatient rehabilitation clinics in spinal cord, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and amputee.Teaching and supervision is provided by the physiatry and neurology faculty of the Division of Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation and neurology residents are involved in student teaching as well. Students are required to participate in didactic teaching conferences within the PM&R residency. This rotation is particularly useful for students considering careers in rehabilitation, neurology, geriatrics, primary care, neurosurgery, or any other field that will require experience in the evaluation and management of patients with physical impairment and disabilities. M80 InterDis 808 Step Preparation Step Preparation. M80 InterDis 809 Ambulatory Care - Jacqueline Maritz Lung Center The Jacqueline Maritz Lung Center houses the ambulatory care activities of the Divisions of Pulmonary Medicine, Thoracic Surgery, and Allergy/Immunology, as well as the pulmonary function laboratory. The student will rotate through: 1. both general pulmonary and subspecialty clinics in Pulmonary Medicine (cystic fibrosis, transplantation, emphysema, etc.), 2. the Thoracic Surgery clinic, and 3. the Allergy/Immunology clinic. Students will also interpret pulmonary function tests. Chest imaging is also emphasized in the evaluation process. The rotation can be streamlined to meet areas of emphasis desired by individual students. M80 InterDis 827 Introduction to Global Health This is a cross-disciplinary \"crash course\" in global health for students considering a career in global health and should be particularly useful for those students planning to complete international electives before graduation or during residency. The course consists of a mix of lectures, workshops, discussions, debates, laboratory sessions, clinics, and simulation labs for two weeks. Topics will include significant coverage of high- burden infectious and tropical diseases (primarily case-based) in addition to discussion of emerging and neglected global health topics including mental health, non-communicable diseases, radiology, and maternal health. Active participation in all activities and discussions is expected in order to obtain credit for this course. The course is team taught by faculty from around the medical school with extensive experience in global health and will include opportunities to network with faculty and residents actively engaged in clinical, research, policy, and implementation work around the world. This course has been run for two years previously for residents only and now is being opened up to senior medical students as well. No specific clinical requirements or call is required. Attendance and active participation for each session throughout the two weeks is required and students should not schedule residency interviews or other time off during this block. M80 InterDis 829 Biomedical Innovation and Entrepreneurship This four-week course will be offered once during the year, from Weeks 25 through 28. The course will serve as both a primer for students interested in medical technology and biotechnology development as well as a hands-on opportunity for them to work directly with teams engaged in clinical problem solving and product development. Students will learn the basics of developing a business plan, market analysis, clinical needs assessment, and project design. Students will split their time between working with an IDEA Labs team, performing 84Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) independent research, and completing educational modules. During the portion of the year that this course is offered, IDEA Labs teams are beginning to develop solutions to clinical problems. During this process, the teams need to reach out to the clinical community for input on clinical needs and marketability. Fourth-year medical students will work with one IDEA Labs team to help complete the clinical needs assessment and market analysis portions of their business model. They will do this by both reaching out to clinicians and performing the research necessary to complete these portions of the business model. Fourth-year medical students are uniquely qualified to help with the clinical needs assessment given their experiences, clinical knowledge, and connections from their third year of medical school. In addition, during this time, students will also be expected to complete a \"passport\" of online and hands-on learning modules from an assortment provided by IDEA Labs from which the student may choose. The lectures will consist of online/in-person lectures outlining business development, clinical needs assessment, market analysis, and product development. The hands-on experiences will consist of 3D printing/prototyping and an open-source, single-board microprocessor workshop. Students are not expected to master any one facet of this experience; instead, this course is intended to introduce students to some of the thought processes and techniques behind moving from a clinical problem to a market ready product. Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, students should be able to do the following: (1) Perform a clinical needs assessment of a proposed solution to a clinical problem, including clearly defining the problem at hand, researching current solutions, designing and implementing a needs-based survey, and obtaining expert opinion and consultation. (2) Perform a preliminary market analysis of a proposed solution to a clinical problem, including estimates of market size, market trends, market growth rate, market profitability, industry cost structure, distribution channels, key success factors, key success details, and a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) of the proposed solution and IDEA Labs team/business as a whole. (3) Participate and engage in clinical problem identification and solution validation. (4) Print a small 3D object using modern, commercially available 3D printing techniques. This course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. There will be no exam, and the following criteria will be used to determine the final grade: submission of a clinical needs assessment and a market analysis; demonstration of completed passport of experiences, and self-assessment involving the completion of a survey at the beginning and the end of the course reflecting on the knowledge gained during the course. M80 InterDis 831 One Health; Comparative and Ecological Medicine In this elective, medical students will analyze and evaluate their roles as practitioners of One Health: the collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach to health that optimizes health outcomes by recognizing the interdependence among people, animals, plants and their shared environment. Students will explore human and animal health overlaps from the perspective of ecological health, and comparative anatomy and pathology. They will also have the chance to learn first- hand from veterinarians and animal health experts the extent to which human health is dependent on the close connections we have to the health of animals and our ecosystems. These learning opportunities will occur in the anatomy lab, in lectures, and alongside animal health care providers and scientists whoare working within the fields of pathology, conservation, and zoological medicine. At the completion of this elective, students will turn in a One Health project applying the core concepts of ecological and comparative medicine. M80 InterDis 835 Interprofessional Hotspotting We are looking for ONE Washington University Medical Student interested in joining an interprofessional team of students that will learn how to take care of patients with complex medical and social needs. This student will join the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Learning Collaborative (ISHLC), which is an annual program run by the Camden Coalition that trains interdisciplinary teams of professional students from schools across the country to learn to help patients with complex medical and social needs. The Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education (CIPE) at the Washington University Medical Campus will send ONE team this year to the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Learning Collaborative. The team will consist of one nursing student from Barnes-Jewish Goldfarb School of Nursing, one occupational therapy student from the WashU OT school, one medical student from WashU School of Medicine, and one pharmacy student from St Louis College of Pharmacy. This team will learn from and take care of high-risk patients from September 2020 through April 2021, with an estimated time commitment of two hours per week. M80 InterDis 849 Fourth-Year Capstone The fourth-year Capstone course is highly structured. In order to provide students with the absolute best experience possible, students are REQUIRED to attend all sessions. In general, the morning sessions will start at 8:00 am and run until approximately 12 noon. Afternoon sessions will generally run from 1:00 pm until about 5:00 pm. The afternoon sessions are typically hands-on activities which are faculty/ staff intensive. By the end of this four-week course, students should be able to demonstrate improved cognitive and clinical skills needed to enter the internship year of graduate medical training. Topics to be covered include acute clinical problems commonly faced on the inpatient service or emergency room, review of key diagnostic testing, basic procedural skills and patient and family communications regarding informed consent and end-of-life issues. Coursework will be divided between self-study, didactic, small group discussions, hands-on skills practice, and simulation. Parts of the course will be tailored to specialty interests. Students will be assessed by performance on simulation exercises and a written exam. M80 InterDis 851 The Business of Medicine This two-week interactive course enhances medical students' Healthcare System Literacy, i.e. their understanding of how the healthcare system is structured, financed, operated, and regulated. They will learn how clinical decisions and options are tied to market forces, business structures, and health policy. From clinical practice management issues up to 'big picture' views of healthcare, the course modules help prepare students for the challenges they will face in their own practices as well as for leadership roles in improving patient care on a large scale. The course will be a blend of case-method sessions, targeted mini-lectures, expert panels, and field trips, all designed to invite student participation and engagement with representatives from a broad spectrum of the healthcare industry. 85Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) M80 InterDis 863 Mind-Body Stress Reduction Mind-Body Stress Reduction is a program that uses intensive training in mindfulness meditation to teach people how to: - Reduce stress and anxiety - Increase focus & concentration - Manage health problems - Live more fully productive lives Mind-Body Stress Reduction utilizes both formal and informal mindfulness meditation practices. Mindfulness can be described as non-judgmental, non-striving, moment-by-moment attention. It is often called present-centered awareness, a state of consciousness that has been shown to have health benefits for the autonomic nervous system, to increase immune function, and to increase alpha and theta brain waves, which are present in deep states of relaxation. M80 InterDis 864 Care of the Homeless The purpose of this elective is to educate students on the following areas: the causes of homelessness; the health care consequences of homelessness, including medical problems, barriers to care, and distrust of health care providers; the safety net system in St. Louis; and how to provide primary care tailored to the needs of the homeless. The format of the elective will include individual readings (printed/online/Canvas) and viewing of \"The Pruitt-Igoe Myth\" and other video resources available for free. Zoom conferences with other instructors or community resources may be arranged. Students may be asked to explore online resources for case studies or to make the course more interactive. At the conclusion, students will complete a reflection paper. At the end of the course, the student will be able to assist homeless persons to access services in St. Louis; list and describe barriers to care for homeless persons; list and discuss some of the ways that providers can be more accommodating to homeless patients; formulate treatment plans that address food insecurity, lack of shelter, and other homeless patients' needs; and understand the special difficulties faced when managing COVID in the homeless population. M80 InterDis 875 Medical Education Scholarship This two-week virtual elective will introduce types of education scholarship; provide guidance for selecting a topic, writing a question, and developing project objectives; illustrate meaningful outcomes for the evaluation of education scholarship projects; and introduce qualitative and quantitative methods appropriate for education scholarship. We will meet intermittently throughout the two weeks on a mutually agreed-upon schedule. Much of the work will be done independently, with the instructor available to provide feedback and answer questions. By the end of the elective, the student will be able to define scholarship of teaching, discovery, integration, application, and engagement and provide examples of education scholarship in each type; gescribe the criteria for evaluating scholarship in medical education; provide examples of education outcomes at each level of Miller's Triangle and Kirkpatrick's Levels of Program Evaluation; and draft a plan for an education scholarship project with clear goals and appropriate plans for adequate preparation, appropriate methods, evaluation of results, dissemination, and reflective critique.

GME-Sponsored Programs In 1997, Washington University (https:// medicine.wustl.edu/ ), Barnes-Jewish Hospital (http://www.stlouischildrens.org/ ) joined together to oversee the quality of graduate medical education training programs at these institutions. All three of these institutions have long histories of successfully training outstanding residents and clinical fellows; this collaborative educational effort demonstrates their dedication to quality healthcare and supports thoughtful patient care in the St. Louis area. The GME Consortium sponsors more than 99 training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the organization that accredits sponsoring institutions and training programs across the United States. There are approximately 40 additional subspecialty fellowship programs that are either accredited by other national accrediting bodies or that are in emerging new areas of medicine not yet recognized by the specialty boards. The GME Consortium and all of its sponsored training programs are fully committed to providing a quality educational experience for residents, clinical fellows and other trainees Residencies and Fellowships Advanced medical training is integral to the quality of patient care in the United States. Residents are doctors who have completed their medical education and who are pursuing three to seven years of advanced medical training in a chosen specialty. Clinical fellows have completed their residencies and are boards- eligible in their primary specialty training; they are pursuing 87Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) additional years of training in an advanced subspecialty area of medicine. Both roles allow trainees to progressively assume greater responsibility working with patients while learning from faculty who are highly qualified in their specialties.

or research experiences. Special electives in basic science research as it applies to anesthesiology can be arranged with the principal investigators in the Department of Anesthesiology (http://anest.wustl.edu); in the Division of Basic Research under the direction of Jose Moron-Concepcion, PhD; in the Washington University Pain Center under the direction of Rob Gereau, PhD; and in the Division of Clinical and Translational Research under the direction of Simon Haroutounian, PhD. The basic science laboratories focus on various topics related to ion channel structure and function, molecular mechanisms of anesthetic action, sepsis, cellular and molecular mechanisms of reward and addiction, and the cellular and genetic basis ofacute and chronic pain and itch. Arrangements for these special electives are made through the specific investigators: Zhou- Feng Chen, Jose Moron-Concepcion, PhD; or Arvind Palanisamy, MD. In addition, opportunities exist for clinical research under the direction of Joanna Abraham, PhD; Michael Avidan, MBBCh; Anne Ben Palanca, MD, PhD; or Troy Wildes, MD. Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M10 Anesth (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M10). M10 Anesth 805 Anesthesiology This clinical elective is designed to familiarize the student with basic aspects of anesthesiology practice. The primary teaching method is patient care in a clinical setting (one-on-one). The student will learn the basics of preoperative evaluation of surgical patients, the use of intraoperative monitoring in patient management and postoperative care. In addition to perioperative care, the student will be exposed to other clinical areas which include our pain management clinic, regional anesthesia/acute pain management, cardiothoracic intensive care unit, labor and delivery, pediatric anesthesia, and the Center for Preoperative Assessment and Planning. During the four-week rotation, the student will learn airway management skills, practical perioperative fluid and electrolyte therapy, along with general and regional anesthetic techniques. As an integral part of the anesthesia care team, the student will participate actively in the anesthetic management of surgical patients. The student's specific requests to be assigned to certain types of cases will be honored as time and availability dictate. The rotation will include three clinical simulator sessions using a simulator mannequin for practical management of airway problems, resuscitation, and trauma emergencies. By the end of the rotation, the student should be able to independently (under supervision) provide anesthesia for uncomplicated surgical procedures. M10 Anesth 811 Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Subinternship This clinical elective offers practical experience in the perioperative assessment and management of surgical patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. The student, as an integral part of the cardiothoracic anesthesia team that is composed of faculty members, fellows and residents, will learn basic principles of airway management and lung ventilation, essential aspects of pharmacologic treatment of hemodynamic abnormalities and cardiac dysrhythmias, and management of intraoperative coagulation disturbances. Emphasis will be placed on the interpretation of intraoperative hemodynamic data, echocardiographic finding (TEE), and laboratory results. During this rotation, the student will also gain practical experience in endotracheal intubation as well as the placement of intravenous lines and invasive monitoring lines, including radial artery and pulmonary artery catheters. Students will learn how to use these parameters in clinical decision making during anesthesia. At the conclusion of the rotation, the student will have a better understanding of invasive monitoring and data interpretation, as 104Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) well as a more systematic approach to the management of intra- and post-operative hemodynamic, pulmonary and coagulation abnormalities. The students are expected to attend the didactic sessions of CTA and the Department of Anesthesiology. A presentation will be assigned. M10 Anesth 812 Pediatric Anesthesiology This clinical elective is designed to teach the theory and practice of pediatric anesthesiology and pain management. It features individualized instruction with faculty who specialize in the perioperative care of pediatric patients. The elective consists of active participation with pediatric anesthesiologists at St. Louis Children's Hospital and St. Louis Shriners Hospital learning pre-anesthetic assessment, the performance of routine anesthetics (which includes instruction and practice in pediatric airway skills), learning other technical skills such as intravenous line placement and the management of post-anesthesia care and pain therapies. The final week may be tailored to meet the student's individual interests, needs and career goals. Possibilities include exposure to sedation and anesthesia for procedures outside of the operating rooms, and to subspecialties including cardiovascular anesthesia, neurosurgical anesthesia, and acute and chronic pediatric pain management. Students also will have an opportunity to learn the management of some common medical emergencies in the Clinical Simulation Center. M10 Anesth 819 Cardiothoracic Critical Care Subinternship This clinical elective offers practical experience in the postoperative management of cardiothoracic patients. The student will be fully integrated into one of the intensive care teams and have the opportunity to contribute to the management of critically ill patients. Students will have the opportunity to follow specific patients over the course of their stay in the ICU, during which time they will gain insight into holistic management of patients with multi-organ dysfunction. The CTICU environment is both challenging and exciting. Students will gain unique insight into cardiorespiratory physiology and pharmacology which will be demonstrated at the patients' bedside, an invaluable and unforgettable learning experience. Students will have opportunities to learn and sometimes assist with procedures, such as central lines, chest tubes, bronchoscopy and pulmonary artery catheter insertion as well as bedside ultrasound including TTE and TEE. Principles of management and resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients following surgery will be emphasized as well as ventilator management. Students will also see and help manage patients with unique physiology such as those patients on ventricular assist devices, and on ECMO. We also have a very busy and heart and lung transplantation program at the hospital - all of these patients are cared for in the CTICU. At the conclusion of the rotation, the student will have a better understanding of shock, sepsis, multi-organ failure, organ system support and compassionate withdrawal of life support. In addition to bedside teaching, there will be informal teaching sessions on a wide variety of topics as well as teaching on interpreting hemodynamic data and waveforms, and cardiac echo exams. Students will be encouraged to present on their patient at morning rounds, during which constructive feedback and interactive teaching will occur. Medical students will be asked to present a short discussion on a topic of their choice. This should be a short 20 - 30 minute presentation followed by a discussion on the topic which will be moderated by the attending. Discuss the time and topic of choice with the attending of service.M10 Anesth 820 Critical Care Subinternship Students on this rotation are integral members of the multidisciplinary intensivist-led critical care team in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). Students learn an organ systems- based approach for evaluation and management of critically ill and injured patients, and application of evidence-based principles in delivery of state-of-the-art critical care. Emphasis is placed on critical care knowledge and techniques used at the bedside in the clinical management of serious traumatic and surgical conditions. Students become familiar with resuscitation and cardiopulmonary support, including methods for non- invasive and invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and techniques for airway management and pulmonary support in respiratory failure. Basic knowledge and skills in the management of blunt and penetrating trauma, neurologic injuries, multi-system organ failure, and life-threatening infections in the surgical patient are also taught, as is the importance of treatments to alleviate anxiety and pain, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, and providing adequate nutrition. Practical experience is gained in placement of vascular access devices, airway equipment, ultrasonography and its applications, interpretation of imaging and laboratory data, and use of guidelines, protocols and quality assurance tools in the management of critically ill patients. M10 Anesth 821 Pain Management Acute pain is the most common symptom of medical illness and is ubiquitous after major surgery. Chronic pain is the leading cause of worker disability. Severe pain afflicts most people with advanced cancer. Learning the fundamentals of pharmacologic, interventional, and multidisciplinary pain management is important for all areas of clinical medicine. M10 Anesth 822 Anesthesiology for Neurosurgery Subinternship Students will help care for patients having challenging neurosurgical procedures. Students will become familiar with complex procedures, brain monitoring, cardiovascular support and airway management and will be exposed to all kinds of neurosurgical pathology. Student must be prepared to participate in the intricate anesthetic management of patients undergoing surgery in our novel intraoperative MRI rooms. For those interested, clinical research projects are ongoing and student participation is encouraged. M10 Anesth 823 Obstetrical Anesthesiology The medical students will learn the different analgesia/anesthetic options for the labor patient. They will also learn how the physiological adaptations of pregnancy influence anesthetic management. They will be actively involved in the parturient's management, i.e., starting an IV, placement of spinal, epidural or CSE (combined spinal epidural) anesthetics. They will also attend the OB anesthesia conferences and interview patients in labor (with an OB anesthesia attending). M10 Anesth 900 Research Elective - Anesthesiology Research opportunities may be available.

Piston, PhD 4912 South Building Phone: 314-362-9121 The intracellular and intercellular dynamics of cells within the islets of Langerhans play a key role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. The islets are made up of different cell types, but very little is known about the interplay between the different cell types and how this affects their secretion of various hormones. The islets' a-cells secrete insulin in response to increased blood sugar and also in response to neurotransmitters and hormones. Glucagon also plays a key role in blood glucose homeostasis, and it is secreted by the islets' a-cells. High glucose levels inhibit glucagon secretion from a-cells within the islets but not from dispersed a-cells, and the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been defined. We use quantitative live cell microscopy to measure single-cell parameters within intact islets held within microfluidic devices in order to expose them to spatially heterogeneous levels of various stimuli. The resulting data are fit using mathematical models of islet functional dynamics, which we are continually modifying to better fit the observed islet physiology. 113Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Sheila A.

Peng Yuan, PhD 9608 BJC Institute of Health Phone: 314-747-3793 The focus of this lab is on the structure and function of ion channels and transporters, which play essential roles in human physiology and disease. How do channels and transporters recognize their specific substrate ions? How do they respond to various stimuli, including chemical ligand, temperature, membrane voltage and mechanical force? How do they interact with the lipid membrane where they reside? To answer these fundamental questions, we use multidisciplinary approaches, including X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, biophysics and electrophysiology. Dysfunction of these membrane proteins could lead to a variety of diseases, such as asthma, hypertension, cancer, heart failure, diabetes, chronic pain and many more. The long-term goal is to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of ion channels and transporters, which will offer novel strategies for drug development and better treatment of diseases.Courses The Department of Cell Biology and Physiology also offers courses through the Graduate School.

Department of Developmental Biology The principal research activities of the Department of Developmental Biology are focused on attaining a mechanistic understanding of animal development, encompassing the earliest cell fate specification and movement processes that shape the early embryo, organogenesis, stem cell biology and engineering, tissue homeostasis and repair, and aging. Students and postdoctoral fellows work closely with faculty and staff on research projects and participate in weekly journal clubs and seminars at which recent literature and ongoing research are discussed. The developmental biology faculty employ a variety of model organisms and cell-based systems to answer key outstanding questions about the fundamental mechanisms of development and to apply this knowledge to pathogenic mechanisms that lead to human birth defects and disease; they also use this knowledge to create improved future therapies. The department takes a broad view of developmental biology, with research groups studying diverse developmental processes (e.g., early embryogenesis, organogenesis, aging) and applying multidisciplinary approaches that include forward and reverse 114Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) genetics, epigenetics, molecular and chemical methods, and computational methods. Embryogenesis is a fascinating process during which a fertilized egg undergoes divisions to form a mass of pluripotent cells that signal to one another to establish embryonic polarity, diverse cell types, and organs and that also undergo massive cell migrations and rearrangements to sculpt the embryonic body. Research is also carried out on the processes involved in tissue degeneration, repair and regeneration, the biology of embryonic and adult stem cells, and cellular reprogramming. It is a particularly opportune time for developmental biology research, as recent technological breakthroughs in both animal model systems and genomics afford insights into developmental processes at the epigenetic, genetic and molecular levels and also enable the monitoring of cell behaviors in vivo. We are discovering the genes that are responsible for birth defects and defining connections between many adult human diseases and their origins during embryogenesis. The studies of stem cells, cellular reprogramming and regeneration are bringing us closer to curing human diseases, repairing damaged organs, and extending the boundaries of aging.

M20 Genetics 511 Medical Genetics Medical genetics is both a science and a clinical area or specialty of medicine, and the boundary between research and clinical application is increasingly blurred. The pace at which genomic and epigenomic tools are being developed is unprecedented. These tools result in continual conceptual advancements, which inevitably affect how we approach the study of disease risk, diagnosis and management in all areas of medicine, not just medical genetics. We are moving into a time when the interpretable data from the examination of individual genomes will be incorporated to all other clinical data to assess individual risks and guide clinical management and decision making. This course is intended as the first step toward life- long training in medical genetics and genomics. The course begins with a number of sessions devoted to basic principlesof genetics. Drawing on this foundation, we move on to discuss genomic and epigenomic tools and to learn from leaders in their fields about the big questions in genetics and genomics (i.e., microbiome research, cancer genomics, current clinical uses of exome sequencing, and so) and how the tools are being used to answer these questions. Students are exposed to the use of genetic and genomic databases and information resources, which will allow them to keep up with new information and critically appraise validity and clinical utility. We begin to discuss the implication of this shift to the \"genomic era,\" particularly regarding ethical aspects, regulatory aspects, equal access, healthcare costs and patient education. Clinical geneticists actively participate in the course and use a series of genetic disorders to help students apply their knowledge, focusing mainly on genetic etiology, pattern of inheritance, inheritance risk and molecular diagnostic testing. Frequent patient interviews further enhance the exposure to clinical genetics. Overall, the course aims to enhance genetic and genomic literacy, which is an essential first step in preparing students to participate in the multidisciplinary teams that effectively make cutting-edge genetic and genomic research results accessible to patients. This course is cross listed with L41 Biol 550. Credit 34 units. M20 Genetics 899 Special Study Genetics Special study opportunities are available in the Department of Genetics. If interested, please contact the department for further information. John T. Milliken Department of Medicine Instruction in medicine is provided during all four years of the medical curriculum, beginning with Practice of Medicine I (Medicine 507) during the first year. Teaching during the second year has two main objectives: (1) the correlation of the basic sciences with clinical aspects of disease; and (2) training in the technical methods of physical examination and laboratory diagnosis. By the beginning of the third year, the student is ready for the supervised clinical study of individual patients. A clinical clerkship of 12 weeks, divided into three four-week periods, is served by third-year students on the medical services of the department. During the final year, students may select a sub- internship in general medicine and a series of elective courses in the medical specialties.

John P. Atkinson, MD Clinical Sciences Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: 314-362-8391 A clinical research elective is offered in the evaluation of patients with complement deficiency or overactivity states and with undiagnosed rheumatic disease syndromes.

Nicholas O. Davidson, MD 910 Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower Phone: 314-362-2027 Our focus is on the genetic pathways of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and colorectal cancer development. We have two major areas of research interest. Our laboratory is interested, first, in the molecular mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This is the most prevalent liver disease in the United States, likely affecting a quarter of the population. We have generated genetically manipulated mouse strains that offer insights into the mechanisms of hepatic steatosis. The student would work as part of a team, designing and conducting experiments that will test hypotheses concerning the mechanisms and consequences of hepatic steatosis. These studies will primarily involve mouse genetics, examining the expression of candidate genes under a variety of nutritional and pharmacologic settings that modulate hepatic lipid metabolism. In addition, we are using microarrays to study the spectrum of genetic changes that may predict the extent of hepatic lipid accumulation in patients with steatohepatitis. Our goal is to test hypotheses using mouse genetics and to extend these studies to examine the same pathways in humans with NAFLD. Our second area of interest concerns the genetic pathways involved in colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. We have developed a novel strain of mice in which the dominant effects of mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene have been abrogated through deletion of an RNA binding protein, apobec-1. This deletion has a major effect on the expression of cox-2, abrogating the increase in expression seen in human colonic 176Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) adenomas and wild-type mouse intestinal adenomas. These findings suggest that apobec-1 is a genetic modifier of colon cancer development. We will study the importance of apobec-1 expression in human colon cancer specimens and continue our murine genetic studies of this novel pathway for modulating colon cancer development and progression. Bradley Evanoff, MD, MPH Phone: 314-454-8638 Our primary interest is on occupational medicine epidemiology and intervention research. Our research involves the use of epidemiology methods to characterize associations between diseases and work-related exposures. We are also doing workplace intervention studies to prevent injuries and illnesses and to improve healthy diet and physical activity among working populations. During an elective in occupational medicine epidemiology research, students will learn how to use epidemiologic methods to investigate disease processes by working on a mutually agreed-on topic of interest related to occupational diseases. Other activities can include worksite visits and intervention projects as well as involvement with worksite health promotion and policy making. Elective length is variable, depending on individual circumstances. Please contact Dr. Evanoff to discuss this research. Gregory I.

Stacey House, PhD Phone: 314-362-8070 houses@wustl.edu Lisa Hayes Phone: 314-362-4362 hayesl@wustl.edu Emergency medicine clinical research is the primary focus of this lab. This type of research involves the gamut of research designs, from retrospective cohort studies (\"The Use of B Hydroxy Butyrate Point-of-Care Testing in DiabeticKetoacidosis\") to prospective clinical trials (\"Biomarkers in Traumatic Brain Injury\") to the evaluation of health care systems and emergency department processes (\"Effects of a Triage Process Conversion on the Triage of High Risk Presentations\") to the analysis of health policy issues (\"Rate of Follow-up to a Primary Care Clinic and Subsequent Emergency Department Utilization among an Urban ED Population\"). Students will learn the basic clinical research designs and will be able to articulate the benefits and drawbacks of each. They will be involved in hypothesis generation and study design for projects that are at that stage. For ongoing projects, they will learn about the informed consent process and be involved in screening for study subjects and subject selection and enrollment. They will be allowed to consent for studies judged to be of minimal risk. Students will be taught important rules regarding data acquisition and entry, particularly as these relate to standards that have been set forth in the medical literature. They will learn about bias and inter-rater reliability. Students will participate in data entry, data analysis, and subsequent abstract/manuscript preparation based on their level of interest and time commitment. Students will meet weekly with one of the course directors to discuss study progress and to identify any roadblocks to study completion. These meetings will also serve as a forum for one-on-one education of the student regarding study methodology, ethical issues in research, and various resources available to the clinical researcher at Washington University. Sandor J. Kovacs, MD, PhD 9965 Clinical Sciences Research Building Phone: 314-362-8901 This experience is geared toward students with math, physics and engineering backgrounds. The cardiovascular biophysics research elective concentrates on physiologic modeling and the comparison of model predictions to in vivo human data. The minimum elective time is eight weeks. Marc S. Levin, MD, and Deborah C. Rubin, MD 922/924 Clinical Sciences Research Building Phone: 314-362-8933 or 314-362-8935 Students will be members of a collaborative research team headed by Drs. Levin and Rubin (Department of Medicine) investigating the mechanisms underlying the intestinal adaptive response that occurs to compensate for the loss of functional small intestine. A second project focuses on epithelial- mesenchymal interactions and their role in regulating gut epithelial proliferation carcinogenesis and the normal and cancer stem cell niche. Specific mechanisms under investigation include the function of an immediate early gene Tis7 on gut adaptation after resection or injury. The role of myofibroblast protein epimorphin in regulating cell proliferation and colon carcinogenesis is being explored. The student will have the opportunity to learn basic molecular biology and physiology as they relate to small intestinal growth and function. Examples of 177Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) techniques that are used in these studies include small animal surgery and colitis and cancer models (mice and rats), molecular biological techniques including PCR, Northern blotting, vector construction for the production of transgenic and knockout mouse models, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Jason C. Mills, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower, Room 1030 Phone: 314-362-4213 We investigate the differentiation of epithelial stem cells in the upper gastrointestinal tract. We study how genes regulate differentiation in mouse models and in vitro in tissue culture, and we correlate our findings with human tissue specimens. Specific projects include the following: (1) understanding how inflammation leads to aberrant differentiation (metaplasia), which is a precursor for cancer; (2) elucidating how master regulatory transcription factors like Xbp1 and Mist1 coordinate the massive cytoskeletal and organellar expansion of specialized secretory cells as they differentiate from stem cells; and (3) understanding the mechanisms that regulate how differentiated cells can be reprogrammed into stem cells in gastrointestinal organs like the stomach and the pancreas. Richard E. Ostlund, MD 8804 Wohl Hospital Phone: 314-362-8286 Our laboratory focuses on the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease by studying cholesterol absorption, detoxification and elimination from the body. Direct patient studies that use new stable isotopic cholesterol tracers and mass spectrometry techniques complement in vitro work on the biochemistry of cholesterol transport in cultured cells. Russell Pachynski, MD BJC Institute of Health, 7th Floor Phone: 314-286-2341 Our lab focuses on several aspects of tumor immunology and translational immunotherapy. We utilize mouse tumor models, human tissues and samples, and advanced molecular and immunologic techniques to study leukocyte trafficking in the setting of tumor development and progression. We also have projects focusing on developing novel immunotherapeutics aimed at augmenting the recruitment of beneficial leukocyte subsets into the tumor microenvironment in order to suppress tumor growth. We are utilizing several approaches, such as nanoparticles, fusion proteins and viruses. Katherine Ponder, MD 8818 Cancer Science Research Building Phone: 314-362-5188 kponder@wustl.eduThe focus of this lab is on gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). We have developed a retroviral vector that can be efficiently delivered to the liver of mice and dogs and that results in expression sufficient to reduce many of the clinical manifestations of these genetic diseases. Current studies focus on assessing the therapeutic effect of gene therapy on sites that are affected in MPS (e.g., heart, aorta, bones, joints) and on developing vectors that might be translated into human patients. In addition, we are evaluating the pathogenesis of disease in MPS, which appears to involve the upregulation of destructive proteases in the aorta and possibly other sites. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of disease might result in additional therapies for MPS. Clay F. Semenkovich, MD Southwest Tower, 8th Floor Phone: 314-362-4454 Fatty acid metabolism and its role in atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension and obesity; modulation of respiratory uncoupling for the treatment of aging, obesity and vascular disease. Phyllis K. Stein, PhD Northwest Tower, Room 13116 Phone: 314-286-1350 pstein@wustl.edu This lab's main focus is on the clinical significance of heart rate variability and ECG-derived waveform parameters obtained from continuous ambulatory monitoring. This elective affords the student the opportunity to perform research in heart rate variability or in other measurements, like QT variability or T-wave alternans that can be derived from continuous ECG monitoring from Holter recordings or polysomnography recordings in the sleep lab. One area of active research is the identification of heart rate patterns associated with obstructive and central sleep apneas and hypopneas and the relationship of previously unappreciated cycling heart rate patterns and outcomes. Data are also available from mice. Many possible projects are available using our many large existing datasets, using the thousands of stored studies in the sleep lab, or using de novo data collection in a clinical or animal population and in infants. Also, many possible directions for this research are available, from applying traditional and nonlinear HRV to different populations to developing methods to quantify ultradian heart rate variability patterns to developing novel ECG analysis techniques, among others. Also, we are involved with the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a large population-based longitudinal study of risk factors for heart disease and stroke among community-dwelling people more than 65 years old. There is a subset of this population who had Holter recordings (~1400 at baseline, ~800 of the same people five years later, and ~370 minority subjects recorded at the same time as the second CHS recording). These recordings have already 178Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) been analyzed by us, so there is a large amount of heart rate variability and heart rate pattern data available. There are also subsets of patients from the CHS and from another study (EPHESUS) who are known to have died suddenly, and we have developed a matched control group in order to examine ECG-based differences in those who died suddenly. We also have electronic sleep studies at two time points for about 300 of the CHS Holter participants who also participated in the Sleep Heart Health Study. We have analyzed an additional ~1500 sleep studies from CHS participants who did not have Holter recordings. Thus, there is also an opportunity in the CHS dataset for studies of the relationship of heart rate variability with changes in heart rate variability over time and with a huge number of clinical and demographic factors among the elderly. We also have data on the relationship of Holter-based HRV and sleep apnea patterns to the development of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery as well as data from a study of the treatment of depression in treatment-resistant depressed post-MI patients, a study of sickle cell patients, and a study of heart rate variability and echo parameters in elderly African Americans. Currently, we are also analyzing HRV in premature infants as they mature and HRV as a predictor of response to treatment in babies in the NICU and PICU, using stored 24-hour bedside ECGs. Heart rate variability and clinical outcomes: The student will be learning about HRV methods and will investigate the relationship of HRV and outcomes in one of our datasets. Because we have clinical and demographic data for about 20,000 subjects for whom continuous ECGs from Holter recordings, sleep studies, and ICU studies are available, as well as some mouse data, the student will be able to choose a project that may lead to a publishable result in an area of interest. The HRV Lab has enough computers and software to accommodate the needs of any interested students.

During the course of the elective, medical students will be able to interact with attending physicians and patients for bed side teaching and attend tumor boards and lectures focused on the care of patients with solid tumors. At the end of the rotation, the students will appreciate the principles of our approach to cancer patients and should have gained insights into the evaluation and management of patients with newly diagnosed malignancies. The role of surgery, radiation, and systemic treatment will also be an important theme, as well as the conduct of clinical research in this patient population. Students will also learn to care for hospitalized patients suffering from complications fromtheir cancer or from toxicities due to treatments. Oncologic emergencies will be covered. Issues such as palliative care treatment options and end-of-life decision making will be explored as well. M25 Medicine 867 Medical Intensive Care The Medical Intensive Care Unit Elective is designed to introduce senior medical students to cognitive and procedural aspects of critical care medicine. Students will be expected to learn the basic pathophysiology and treatment approaches to respiratory failure, shock states and metabolic derangements. Participation in procedures will be encouraged as available. Dynamics of difficult conversations with patients and family members will also be modeled and discussed. Clinical responsibilities will occur as a part of a team and students will be expected to participate in admissions and daily follow-up on assigned patients. Teaching will occur via didactic lectures on weekdays and formal patient discussions on rounds. M25 Medicine 869 Palliative Medicine The Palliative Medicine elective will focus on the care of patients with life-threatening or debilitating illness throughout the course of their care. Skills in symptom management, communication, and interdisciplinary team-based care will be the focus. Students will spend the majority of their time on the BJH Palliative Care Service. Based on the individual student's interest, there may also be opportunities to work with the BJC Hospice Team and the St. Louis Children's Hospital Pediatric Advance Care Team. Students wishing to work with either team should contact the Course Director and Administrative Contact, as well as the Instructors of the appropriate team, with as much advance notice as possible as trainee spots are very limited for both. While in the hospital, students will be responsible for seeing patients upon initial assessment as well as delivering follow-up care with the team. Patients will be seen for both end-of-life care as well as symptom management. Students will learn to assess and treat refractory symptoms and participate in complicated advanced care planning. Students will attend interdisciplinary team meetings, and may participate in conversations about goals of care and coping with bad news. They may also make home visits with hospice care providers, if desired. Emphasis will be placed on observing and understanding the psychosocial and spiritual needs of the patients, as well as the impact of the burden on caregivers. In addition, students will be expected to participate in bi-weekly presentations/group discussions on selected aspects of Palliative Medicine with the BJH Palliative Care team. Students will also be required to give a 20-minute presentation to the BJH Palliative Care team at the end of their rotation. M25 Medicine 870 Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism In general, the four-week rotation will be divided into two weeks of general endocrinology and two weeks of diabetes. Students taking this elective will perform consultations with fellows and faculty on the inpatient services at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and will also see patients with endocrine and metabolic diseases in the Outpatient Consultation. They will present these cases daily on teaching rounds. They will also participate in case conferences and seminars on a weekly basis. Extensive interaction with patients with diabetes and a diabetes education program are included, as is involvement with patients with thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, gonad, metabolic bone disease, and lipid disorders. Ample opportunities will be provided for discussions of patient problems with the members of the division. A variety of outpatient clinics are offered in the division and 185Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) interested students should speak with the fellows and faculty members to customize the learning experience to match his or her career goals. At the end of the rotation, it is expected that students will have the ability to initiate inpatient and outpatient management of diabetes including insulin dosing and glucose monitoring, as well as evaluate and treat a variety of endocrine disorders including but not limited to thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal disease. Students will learn to perform effective inpatient and outpatient consultations. M25 Medicine 871 Oncology - Outpatient Students will gain experience in the initial treatment of newly- diagnosed malignancies and the outpatient management of oncology patients. Participation in multidisciplinary tumor conferences will stress a combined-modality approach to management, incorporating chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Students will see patients with a variety of malignancies, including lymphoma, myeloma, and tumors of the lung, breast, and colon. Management of hypercalcemia and other paraneoplastic syndromes, as well as cancer pain management, will be covered. Students will have the opportunity to see how most oncologists spend 90% of their workday. They will observe different styles that oncologists use when presenting news about prognosis, treatment options, and other information to patients while they also learn about the molecular basis for cancer, the mechanisms of action for our therapies (particularly the newer agents which target specific molecular abnormalities), and the key studies that justify the use of therapies (e.g. randomized studies showing that after surgery, chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrence from a particular cancer with a particular regimen). By spending time with clinicians, students will learn how to identify hereditary syndromes, use drugs for symptom relief, and also learn how radiographic and laboratory tests allow oncologists to care for patients. M25 Medicine 877 Intensive ECG Interpretation During this two-week elective, students will read 20-25 ECGs obtained from the Barnes-Jewish Cardiac Diagnostic Laboratory, with an overread by an experienced electrocardiographer. There will also be didactic sessions covering conduction. 879 Pulmonary Clinic for the Underserved Clinical setting: Outpatient Clinic dedicated to providing pulmonary specialty care to patients who are predominantly uninsured or who rely upon public assistance such as Medicaid. Student role: Students independently interview and examine patients and present findings to the attending, tests and imaging are reviewed, and provider and attending develop plan. Common problems/diseases: Asthma, COPD, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, and obstructive sleep apnea are commonly seen. Also, patients are referred for evaluation of abnormal x-rays and for symptoms such as dyspnea. Primary learning objectives: - to understand and practice important history and exam skills in pulmonary medicine: symptoms, smoking history, work and environmental exposures, and important pulmonary physical exam findings. - to understand the basics of pulmonary function tests, chest imaging, and methods for tissue sampling. - to understand the basis of treatment of common pulmonary disorders. Conferences: There is no conference associated with this clinic, but students may attend the usual Thursday morning Medicine Grand Rounds at 8:00 am and the Pulmonary Grand Rounds at 11:00 am if the subject matter is appropriate.M25 Medicine 880 Pulmonary Medicine - Barnes-Jewish Hospital Students will acquire skills in the evaluation and management of patients with pulmonary diseases and in the interpretation of pulmonary function tests.

M25 Medicine 884 Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies This elective is designed to introduce students to the general inpatient, intensive care, and outpatient management of patients with multiple hematologic malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, marrow failure states and myeloma. These patients will be treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapies and cellular immunotherapies including chimeric receptor T cells (CART), natural killer cells, bispecific antibody treatments and stem cell transplant (both autologous and allogeneic). As the primary team, the BMT service is responsible for diagnosing and treating all medical problems including many critical care issues that may occur in these patients. These complex patients are often severely immunocompromised, coagulopathic, and at high-risk of multi-organ complications from both their disease and their therapy. Students work closely with residents, fellows, and faculty to develop treatment plans for patients. Students participate in daily rounds discussing general inpatient and intensive care BMT patients and attend outpatient clinic 1 day/wk to see how BMT physicians approach patients faced with difficult decisions to make regarding their care. In addition to multiple weekly conferences, students also attend daily teaching rounds led by faculty to learn the basic science of hematopoiesis, the genomics of leukema, stem cell biology, gene therapy and cell therapy, transplantation immunology, graft vs host disease and infectious diseases seen in these immunocompromised patients. The average medical student will contribute to the care of inpatients (30-40 patients/day) and will be directly involved in the assessment and care of selected outpatients as well. M25 Medicine 887 Clinical Cardiovascular Medicine This course involves clinical cardiology with some internal medicine in a rural setting. Topics include inpatient and outpatient care, diagnostic testing, device implants and follow- up care, cardiac catheterization, and peripheral vascular angiography and intervention. M25 Medicine 890 Clinical Nephrology Students rotate through inpatient and outpatient experiences to gain exposure to all facets of nephrology. They will spend time the majority of their time on an inpatient consult service, gaining exposure to acute and chronic renal failure, glomerulonephritis, and electrolyte disorders. During this time, they will serve as a fully integrated member of the consult team, evaluating underlying causes of kidney disease, performing diagnostic procedures, formulating management plans, and engaging in decision-making discussions with primary services and families. In addition, students will have the opportunity to experience ICU nephrology, transplant nephrology, the various CKD clinics, and all modalities of dialysis, including in-center, home, and peritoneal dialysis. 186Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) M25 Medicine 890A Kidney Transplant Students participating in this elective will gain exposure to end-stage renal disease and the treatment options, examine kidney transplantation as the most valuable option, learn about immunosuppression, and gain exposure to infectious diseases like CMV, BK, and adenovirus that are commonly seen in patients who have had a kidney transplant (and not often seen otherwise). M25 Medicine 893 Adult Allergy and Clinical Immunology Students will participate in the outpatient Allergy Clinics located in Barnes Jewish Hospital Center for Advanced Medicine, Barnes Jewish West County, and Center for Advanced Medicine South County.

They will have the opportunity to see patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, hives, food allergy, immunodeficiency, eosinophilic esophagitis, hereditary angioedema, mastocytosis, contact allergic dermatitis, eczema, and more. They can attend allergy conferences on Thursday morning. Students have the option to follow a fellow and see inpatient consults at Barnes Jewish Hospital. M25 Medicine 897 Complex Primary Care (ComPACT) ComPACT is an intensive primary care clinic. We work with veterans with multiple medical comorbidities and multiple hospitalizations. Frequently, they also have many social barriers to health care. Our goals are to reduce admissions and improve overall health and wellness. Students will be responsible for performing histories and physicals in the outpatient setting. In addition, when appropriate, students will round on hospitalized ComPACT patients with Drs. Rumora and McCarthy. Patient interactions will be face-to-face and electronic (phone, video). Students will gain experience with balancing the demands of competing medical issues. Many of our vets have heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, COPD, and other conditions. Students will also gain experience in identifying and working to mitigate social barriers to health. We have weekly staff \"huddles\" that we encourage students to attend. We also have a journal club approximately monthly. If this occurs during the student's time with us, we may ask them to present an appropriate paper. M25 Medicine 900 Research Elective - Internal Medicine Research opportunities may be available.

M27 Emergency Medicine Visit online course listings to view offerings for M27 Emergency Medicine (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx? sch=M&dept=M27 ). M27 EMED Emergency Medicine The Urgent Care area (UCA) serves as our site for the WUSM III Ambulatory Care Rotation. Three students at a time are assigned to this two-week rotation. Students will spend their first day in an orientation session learning suturing, ECG interpretation, and airway management (including intubation skills) in hands-on laboratories. They will also review pelvic examinations and view an education video about domestic violence. On day two, they begin primarily evaluating non- emergent patients in Urgent Care and report directly to an Emergency Medicine attending. There are four hours of conferences per week (8-10 a.m. on Tuesday and Wednesdaymornings), and attendance is mandatory. Discussions are currently underway to allow students to participate in helicopter ride-alongs with ARCH Airmedical Services. Students can expect to gain a wide range of skills in evaluating uncomplicated upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, lacerations, eye problems, rashes, simple extremity trauma -- in general, the \"bread and butter\" medical/ surgical problems. Students do a 15-minute case presentation at the close of the block. Credit 77 units. M27 EMED 800 Reading Elective - Emergency Medicine M27 EMED 801 Emergency Medicine Subinternship This rotation offers practical experience in the evaluation and management of acutely sick and injured patients. Students will function as subinterns, initially evaluating their assigned patients, and developing a plan for further diagnostic studies and therapy. They will report to a senior level resident or an attending physician. The student can expect the opportunity to perform or assist with a wide variety of procedural skills such as suturing, splinting, peripheral and central venous access, ultrasound, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Shifts will be eight hours and students will rotate between day, evening, and night shifts (including weekend shifts) to gain maximum exposure to all types of emergencies. The majority of shifts will occur at Barnes-Jewish Hospital; however, additional shifts may be scheduled at Barnes-Jewish West County Hospital, a community hospital approximately 14 miles away. If the student does not have transportation, other arrangements can be made. Students will also be expected to attend weekly grand rounds and student lectures covering aspects of the core content of Emergency Medicine as well as attend a departmental journal club and student simulation session. Students will gain an understanding of other disciplines closely associated with Emergency Medicine by doing rotations with either social work, nursing, physical therapy, or respiratory therapy. Students will also gain knowledge of the triage system during their time in the department. If schedules allow, students interested in EM will be doing 1:1 shifts with a single attending during their last two weeks of the rotation as well as having a teaching shift with the education resident and fellow. Students desiring a Standard Letter of Evaluation (SLOE) should take this WUMS-IV Emergency Medicine Subinternship. Students will be scheduled for required weekend and overnight shifts and changes will not be allowed to the schedule unless approved prior to the start of the rotation by the course coordinator. Please be advised that there is a limit of days off while on this rotation during interview season; otherwise, students should arrange to take the elective at a different time during the year. Days off during the rest of the year will conform to university policy. Days off should be requested from the Course Coordinator at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the rotation for scheduling purposes. M27 EMED 810 Medical Toxicology This rotation offers practical experience in the evaluation and management of the acutely ill, poisoned, or intoxicated patient. Students will function as subinterns and either report to the senior resident, fellow, or directly to the toxicology attending. Students will gain familiarity and experience evaluating and treating patients who have intentionally and unintentionally overdosed on medications or illicit drugs or have substance use disorders, been envenomated (such as by spiders, snakes, or other reptiles), or been exposed to toxic substances or chemicals. Students will also gain experience in administering 187Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) antidotes and learning to properly decontaminate someone after an ingestion or exposure. There are no overnight or weekend shifts. While not required, students are welcome to come in off hours to see new consults and enhance their experience and learning. Daily activities start in the morning and are generally concluded by the early afternoon. A core content of lectures will be provided. The students will also be assigned small projects during their rotation that will enhance their experience particularly in environmental and occupational toxicology. Students will also be asked to complete SAMHSA approved training which will allow them to apply for DEA buprenorphine waivers upon obtaining their permanent medical license. Opportunities to increase their experience with occupational toxicology and addiction medicine also exist during this rotation; students will be able to rotate in the outpatient toxicology and addiction medicine clinic. Students will also have the opportunity to go to the Missouri Poison Center. Students desiring a letter of recommendation from one of the toxicology attendings (who are also Emergency Medicine attendings) or interested in Emergency Medicine or Medical Toxicology should take this elective. Also, students considering other specialties such as Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Neurology, or Internal Medicine should consider this rotation as they will be responsible for evaluating these patients as part of their inpatient or outpatient practice. Please be advised that there is a limit of days off while on this rotation during interview season; otherwise, students should arrange to take the elective at a different time during the year. Days off should be requested from the Course Coordinator at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the rotation for scheduling purposes. M27 EMED 820 Emergency Ultrasound Point-of-care ultrasound has became an integral diagnostic and procedural tool for nearly every clinical specialty. Ultrasound examination at the bedside is noninvasive, painless, and repeatable, unlike many other common diagnostic tests. However, like all procedures, developing ultrasound skills takes a significant amount of practice and experience. This rotation will focus on clinical ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation at the bedside. Students will participate in the performance of bedside ultrasound of patients in the Emergency Department. Common applications of emergency ultrasound include the FAST exam, pelvic ultrasound, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), vascular access, renal, ocular, cardiac ultrasound, and DVT. Students will be involved in direct patient care during this rotation as part of the ultrasound team in the Emergency Department. In general, the student will be in the Emergency Department during weekdays to perform these exams. In addition, the student will meet with the elective instructor approximately once per week to review images or for direct hands-on instruction. At the end of the rotation, the student should be able to obtain images for basic point-of- care ultrasound examinations and to interpret those images for diagnostic purposes. Students may also have opportunity to practice ultrasound-guided procedures during the rotation. M27 EMED 900 Emergency Medicine Research ElectiveDepartment of Molecular Microbiology The Department of Molecular Microbiology teaches introductory courses in microbiology and pathogenic microorganisms for first- year medical students and graduate students. In conjunction with the Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences (DBBS) (http:// www.dbbs.wustl.edu/Pages/ ) divprograms/micro/Pages/default.aspx ), the department also offers a number of advanced courses that are primarily designed for graduate students but also open to medical students.

Projects include studies of the synthesis and regulation of the main cryptococcal virulence factor, its polysaccharide capsule, and host-fungal interactions. Current approaches include those of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, and genetics; studies also include high-throughput analysis of host-pathogen interactions and computational approaches to reconstructing the capsule regulatory network.

Scott J. Hultgren, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: 314-362-6772 Our focus is on the pathogenic mechanisms and disease outcomes in the urinary tract. Work in the Hultgren lab blends multiple scientific disciplines to elucidate bacterial and host mechanisms that determine the onset, course and outcome of interactions between a host mucosal surface and bacterial pathogens. Using genetics, genomics, biochemistry, structural biology, high-resolution imaging, animal models, clinical studies and combinatorial chemistry, we have illuminated new ways in which intracellular lifestyles and community behavior play critical roles in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection. We have uncovered new principles of adhesive pili biogenesis in gram- negative bacteria by the chaperone/usher pathway, delineating 190Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) the fine molecular details of a donor strand complementation and exchange mechanism by which the energy of final subunit folding is used to complete the assembly and extrusion of pili across the outer membrane. We revealed how uropathogenic Escherichia coli use type 1 pili to invade and establish biofilm- like intracellular bacterial communities within bladder cells as part of a mechanism that subverts host defenses and how quiescent intracellular reservoirs can seed recurrent infections. We have uncovered complex networks that govern mucosal epithelial response to infection, which we have shown determines disease outcome. Further, we have made seminal contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis and response to other uropathogens, polymicrobial infections and catheter-associated UTIs and to the mechanisms by which bacteria form a directed amyloid fiber, curli, which is important in biofilm formation. Together, this work is changing the way UTIs are evaluated, reshaping models of bacterial infections in general and spawning new technologies to design novel vaccines and antimicrobial therapeutics to diagnose, treat and/or prevent UTIs and their sequelae. Jennifer Lodge, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 10210A Phone: 314-286-2125 The Lodge lab's main focus is on the fungal cell wall and using it to develop vaccine candidates, understand host response, and develop antifungal therapies. Our main model system is Cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogenic fungus that kills almost 200,000 people every year, predominantly patients with AIDS or other immunodeficiencies. We examine the basic biochemistry and molecular genetics of cell wall structure and biosynthesis, and we have used this information to develop antifungal targets and to examine cell wall contributions to protective immunity. David Sibley, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 9th Floor Phone: 314-362-8873 We study the intracellular survival mechanisms of protozoanparasites, focusing primarily on the model opportunistic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We also study Cryptosporidium, an enteric parasite of global importance among young children in developing countries. Current approaches include high-resolution microscopy, genetic mapping of virulence traits, comparative genomic analyses, and the development of animal models for studying pathogenesis and host resistance. Christina L. Stallings, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 8th Floor Phone: 314-286-0276Our main focus is the molecular pathogenesis of mycobacteria. Our laboratory integrates in vivo disease modeling, molecular biology and biochemistry to provide answers to the fundamental biological questions regarding molecular pathogenesis and to yield therapeutic strategies for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. Joseph P. Vogel, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 10th Floor Phone: macrophages by preventing phagosome-lysosome fusion. David Wang, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 8th Floor Phone: 314-286-1123 Our work focuses on the discovery and characterization of novel viruses. We use functional genomic technologies to identify novel viruses from a variety of clinical samples from diseases of unexplained etiology. We then use epidemiologic, molecular and cellular strategies to define the relevance of newly identified viruses to human disease. A range of new viruses \u2014 including polyomaviruses, astroviruses and picronaviruses \u2014 are currently under investigation. Sean P.J. Whelan, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 9th Floor Phone: 314-286-1585 The Whelan Lab research focus is on the molecular mechanisms that underpin gene expression in nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses \u2014 a group of viruses that includes some of the most significant human pathogens in existence (e.g., rabies, ebola, respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, Nipah viruses). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has served as an important prototype of the NNS RNA viruses for more than 50 years, and Dr. Whelan has played a leading role in this field that can be traced back to the recovery of infectious virus from cDNA. As independent investigators, Dr. Whelan and his colleagues have led the way to understanding the structure and function of the viral replication machinery. The goals of such studies have been to ultimately inform the development of inhibitors against this group of important pathogens and to advance the use of VSV as a vaccine vector, an oncolytic agent, and a neuronal tracer.

Beau Ances, MD Taylor Avenue Building Extension, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-747-8423 Neuroimaging of neurodegenerative disorders. Students can work in a neuroimaging laboratory that is focused on the translational discovery of neuroimaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. The laboratory focuses on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We are investigating the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on the brain network level using functional (blood oxygen level dependent imaging, arterial spinlabeling), structural (volumetrics, diffusion tensor imaging), and metabolic (PET amyloid and tau) methods. Multiple projects that involve bioengineering, neuroimaging and infectious disease are available, depending on the interest of the student. Randall Bateman, MD Biotechnology Center, Room 304 Phone: 314-747-7066 Central nervous system protein metabolism in aging and dementia. This research elective will expose the student to translational research in the study of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The student will participate in multiple areas of the research, including participant recruitment, consent, enrollment and admission to a research hospital unit. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid sample collection, blood collection and intravenous labeling methods will be demonstrated and taught. The student will participate in sample analysis, including processing for mass spectrometry quantitation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western gel methods. Quantitation, analysis and modeling of the data will be taught in the context of data interpretation and study design. Anne H. Cross, MD, and Laura Piccio, MD, PhD McMillan, 3rd Floor Phone: 314-747-4591 or 314-747-0405 Understanding interactions of the immune system with the central nervous system as it relates to multiple sclerosis and other neuroimmunological disorders. Our goal is to understand how immune cells cross the blood-brain barrier and initiate the cascade of events that leads to the lesions of multiple sclerosis. We are also funded to study the effects of diet and adipokines on neuroinflammation. Depending on the time commitment of the student and their individual interests and goals, they will either assist with ongoing projects or be given a laboratory project on which to work. Projects may involve animal models of multiple sclerosis, cell culture or studies of human samples (cerebrospinal fluid, blood or autopsied specimens). Interested students should contact Dr. Cross (crossa@neuro.wustl.edu) or Dr. Piccio (picciol@neuro.wustl.edu ) several weeks in advance before signing up for this research to allow for sufficient planning. Robert T. Naismith, MD McMillan, Room 310B Phone: 314-747-0432 Clinical imaging research in multiple sclerosis. The student will learn about neuroimaging, imaging analyses, data collection, data management and clinical study endpoints in multiple sclerosis. They will observe patient participants undergoing a detailed evaluation of disability measures, such as ambulation, symptom scales, cognition, vision, upper extremity function, and so on. They will witness the entire process of image acquisition, processing, analysis and data extraction. They will have the 203Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) opportunity to interact with many people who are vital to the research, including research coordinators, imaging technologists, imaging physicists/chemists and specialized research clinicians (i.e., neurocognitive and physical therapy research specialists). The student will assist with hands-on clinical investigative research. They will gain an excellent appreciation of multiple sclerosis, from its pathophysiology within the central nervous system to how it affects the neurological function of individuals. Through detailed and quantitative imaging analysis, the student will become very adept at analyzing brain MRI scans. They will mark and track lesions to determine their effects on clinical function and learn to identify normal-appearing white matter, cortex and gray-matter structures. They will become familiar with Amira Imaging Analysis Software, SPSS Statistical Analysis Software, SIENA Volume Analysis Software and Matlab Imaging Analysis Software. Steven E. Petersen, PhD East Building, Room 2108 Phone: 314-362-3319 This lab is interested in brain organization and function, particularly for language, attention and memory. Our main approach to these issues is through functional MRI and large- scale network analysis. Joel S. Perlmutter, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6026 Pathophysiology of movement disorders. The lab is primarily interested in the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of basal ganglia disorders. We have several studies of Parkinson disease (PD). We investigate mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation, which is a dramatic new treatment. These studies combine PET, cognitive testing and quantified measures of movement. We also test new drugs that might rescue injured nigrostriatal neurons (a model of PD). For these, we use PET to measure dopamine pathways and also to quantify motor behavior. We also have an active program developing and validating neuroimaging biomarkers for PD and for determining the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway that includes studies in human and animal models of PD. We have an active program that combines a variety of approaches to developing biomarkers and investigating the pathophysiology of dementia associated with PD. We use PET to measure radioligand binding and sensorimotor processing in dystonia. We developed a new animal model of dystonia to investigate pharmacologic and physiologic changes. We use PET to investigate drug-mediated pathways in the brain and to parse out the effects of selective dopaminergic agonists. We are also working to develop MR- based methods including diffusion tensor imaging and resting- state functional connectivity to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying PD and dystonia.Brad A. Racette, MD McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-362-5291 Our lab is primarily interested in environmental risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease. We use a variety of techniques to study these risk factors, including traditional field epidemiology, in which we evaluate workers exposed to metals in the United States and residents living near a smelter in South Africa; neuroimaging, in which we study the pathophysiology of toxin-mediated parkinsonism; geographic information systems research, in which we associate environmental toxin exposures with the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the United States and Finland; and neuropathologic studies, in which we evaluate manganese-exposed workers from South Africa. There are numerous opportunities available for students to be involved with any of these projects. Students will receive some clinical exposure as well to familiarize them with pertinent clinical syndromes. Marcus E. Raichle, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6907 This lab investigates in vivo brain hemodynamic, metabolic and functional studies of human cognition and emotion using cyclotron-produced isotopes and PET as well as fMRI in humans.

M05 Neurosci 554 Neural Science This is an intensive seven-week course that covers the structure, development, and function of the nervous system as seen from molecular, cellular, and systems-oriented perspectives. The emphasis is on the organization and function of the nervous system in health, but there is frequent reference to the clinical relevance of the material presented. The course includes regular lectures, conference sessions, and laboratories (including a team based learning session), plus a number of clinically oriented presentations and special topics sessions that address selected issues in greater depth. Computer-aided instructional programs, which are accessible from a variety of locations, provide auxiliary modes of self-paced learning and review. Exams emphasize the core body of important facts and principles presented in the lectures and laboratories. Limited space is available for non- medical students with the instructor's permission. Non-medical students should register under the cross-listed number L41 554. Spring only. Credit 109 units. M05 Neurosci 810 Advanced Dissection Students will perform detailed dissections on a discrete region of the body of their choosing-i.e. head/neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvic cavity, or limbs. Students will compile a list of personal learning objectives with approval of the course director(s). A minimum of 30hrs of self-paced individual dissection is required and may include practice of surgical approaches, and/or study of cross-sectional anatomy and medical imaging. L41 Biol 5622 Cognitive, Computational, and Systems Neuroscience Project Building The goal of this course is to help students in the CCSN Pathway develop the critical thinking skills necessary to develop and implement high quality, interdisciplinary research projects. Throughout the course of the semester, each student willdevelop a research plan in their chosen area of interest. The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course. The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing. For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work. The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals). Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims. The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions. Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments. The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods. The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods. Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses. The course will meet once a week, with faculty members from different tracks within the Pathway present at each meeting. This will allow students to receive feedback from several perspectives. Prerequisite: Member of CCSN Pathway, permission of instructor. Credit 3 units. Department of Neurosurgery Instruction in neurological surgery begins with an introduction to the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system presented in the first-year course in neural sciences directed by the Department of Neuroscience (http://neurosci.wustl.edu/ ), with the participation of the neurosurgery faculty. During the second year, the Department of Neurosurgery (http:// www.neurosurgery.wustl.edu ) presents the course in diseases of the nervous system in conjunction with the departments of Neurology, Pathology & Immunology, Molecular Microbiology, Medicine and Pediatrics. The course emphasizes how knowledge derived from basic or clinical investigations leads to improvements in clinical care. During the third year, students may elect to participate in a two- or four-week neurosurgery clerkship that introduces them to the clinical care of patients with diseases of the nervous system. Neurosurgical faculty members work with the neurologists to provide lectures, demonstrations and teaching exercises involving patients with neurological 211Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) diagnoses as part of the clinical medicine course. Students may elect to fulfill their neurology requirement by rotating on the neurosurgery service. Students may also choose neurosurgery as part of the surgical specialty rotations. Neurosurgical diagnosis, critical care, operative treatment and ethical issues in patient management are emphasized. During the fourth year, students may choose from several advanced electives, including clinical externships in neurosurgery and experiences in basic or clinical/translational research. Neurosurgical Specialties As members of one of the most comprehensive neurosurgical programs in both the region and the nation, Washington University neurosurgeons offer exceptional care in a variety of specialties. Tumors The Department of Neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine offers a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of all types of neurological tumors, including brain tumors, inoperable tumors, pituitary tumors, skull-base tumors and spine tumors. Depending on the type of tumor, our multidisciplinary team comprises ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, radiation oncologists, neuroradiologists, neuroanesthesiologists, medical oncologists and other specialists. Aneurysms and Cerebrovascular Disorders and Diseases The multidisciplinary medical team focuses on the treatment It includes cerebrovascular surgeons, who perform microsurgical procedures, and interventional radiologists, who offer minimally invasive endovascular treatment options. We also have a team of critical care neurologists, who coordinate postprocedure care in a dedicated neurointensive care unit, as well as neurologists, who coordinate neurorehabilitation care at The Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis. Spine Injuries and Disorders Washington University spinal neurosurgeons are recognized as national leaders in the treatment of disorders of the spine, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. We use a multidisciplinary approach to treating spinal diseases and disorders. The personalized care of each patient is emphasized. Where appropriate, spine patients receive comprehensive, collaborative care from both neurosurgeons and specialists in thoracic surgery; vascular surgery; anesthesia; pain management; and physiatry.Peripheral Nerves Washington University neurosurgeons work with a multidisciplinary group of surgeons, neurologists and therapists to customize patient treatments to maximize functional outcomes. Washington University neurosurgeons have extensive expertise in advanced microsurgical reconstructive techniques and are on the forefront of new and innovative ways to improve patient outcomes. Pediatric Neurosurgery The entire spectrum of neurosurgical disorders in children is treated by pediatric neurosurgeons and physicians in related disciplines. Our pediatric neurosurgeons are also part of multidisciplinary teams that provide care in several specialized pediatric centers, including the brachial plexus center, the center for cerebral palsy spasticity, the neurofibromatosis clinic, the pediatric epilepsy center, the pediatric gamma knife program, the pediatric neuro-oncology program, and the spina bifida clinic. Epilepsy Our neurosurgeons are nationally recognized for their care of patients with epilepsy as well as research in this field. They are part of a multidisciplinary team that works together to develop the optimal plan to help patients control or minimize their seizures. The Department of Neurosurgery offers care for both adults and children with medically intractable seizures; it provides a full range of surgical options for intractable epilepsy, including implantable seizure-control devices, resection of seizure foci, and vagal nerve stimulation. Movement Disorders The multidisciplinary team specializes in the treatment of movement disorders such as ataxia, catatonia, dystonia, essential tremor, Huntington's disease, myoclonus, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette's syndrome. For some patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor, medications are often inadequate to control disabling symptoms. These patients may benefit from stereotactic neurosurgical procedures to improve their function. Website: G.

Sarah England, PhD Indira Mysorekar, PhD Celia Santi, PhD Ramakrishma Kommagani, PhD Katherine Fuh, MD, PhD BJC Institute of Health, 10th Floor Phone: 314-286-1775 During this six-week elective, students will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in bench research in reproductive science. Dr. England's laboratory focuses on uterine contractility and ion channels in the uterine myometrium. The Mysorekar lab studies the dynamics of tissue regeneration in the adult mammalian urinary bladder, the pathogenesis of a common infectious disease in women (namely, recurrent urinary tract infections), and the potential infectious etiology of preterm birth in pregnant women. Dr. Santi's work focuses on ion channels in mouse and human sperm. Dr. Fuh investigates cell signaling in ovarian cancer and the biology of ovarian cancer metastasis. The main criteria for this rotation is that the student must have prior experience as an undergraduate or postgraduate in a laboratory, not including class work. This rotation is designed for the student who is planning a career in academic medicine as a physician-scientist and who is interested in considering reproductive science as a field. Prior to signing up for this course, the student must contact Dr. England to discuss the schedule and expectations of the rotation. 224Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for ObGyn (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M45). M45 ObGyn 730 participate in a five-week clinical clerkship in Obstetrics and Gynecology. This is divided into components of outpatient OB/GYN, inpatient obstetrics and inpatient gynecology. Comprehensive study of the reproductive health needs of women in both the office setting and the surgical setting is the focus of the curriculum. Students are actively involved in all settings of health care delivery: outpatient faculty clinics within all specialties, resident ambulatory clinics, operating rooms for all obstetric or gynecologic cases, inpatient floors of L&D and Gynecology, and the emergency department/ hospital inpatient consults. Faculty, fellows, residents, and nurse practitioners provide teaching for this rotation. Student-directed didactics include the faculty and chief resident lecture series, procedural skill station session and faculty-assigned preceptor groups that meet throughout their five-week rotation. Credit 192 units. M45 ObGyn 804 OB/GYN Generalist Outpatient Care Subinternship This experience is designed to primarily acquaint the student with the diagnosis and care of outpatients. Students will work one-on-one with attending staff, to focus on an overview of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of common obstetric and gynecologic concerns. The subintern will spend the majority of time attending half day clinics and private offices. Overnight OB call is required (approximately 2 evening shifts) to acquaint the student with the house staff and hospital, providing opportunity to participate in deliveries. If desired, additional time can be arranged to participate in/observe outpatient surgical procedures. A 30-45 minute presentation to attendings and house staff will culminate the rotation on a selected OB/GYN topic. M45 ObGyn 810 OB/GYN Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility Subinternship The subintern will participate (in the office and hospital) in the study and treatment of women with reproductive endocrine disorders and infertility. The student will attend and present in conferences, attend surgery, observe assisted reproductive technology procedures, have assigned reading and be an integral part of the reproductive endocrine service. Opportunities for clinical research projects in reproductive endocrinology are also available. M45 ObGyn 830 Gynecologic Oncology Subinternship The subintern will take part in the work-up of tumor patients prior to surgery and/or radiotherapy, assist in pelvic operations, help render perioperative care, and review pathology specimens and slides. The student will participate in GYN Tumor Clinic sessions, make hospital rounds with house staff, accompany chief residents on consultations, and attend OB/GYN conferences. Opportunities for clinical or basic research projects in gynecologic malignancy are also available.M45 ObGyn 833 Special Topics in Reproductive Health Students will attend a variety of outpatient clinics to interact with patients seeking different reproductive health services. These topics include family planning and abortion services at the Hope Clinic and BJH; general gynecology services at our faculty practice GYN clinic (WHC) and OB/GYN resident clinic (COH 3); specialized reproductive health services including STI testing and contraception at the St. Louis STD clinic, the SPOT, and C3 Clinic; and OB and pregnancy centering clinics at the Center for Outpatient Health and Affinia. There may also be an opportunity to attend an adolescent and pediatric gynecology clinic, a women's cardiology clinic, and an adult transgender care clinic. Clinical experiences will be mainly ambulatory, but there is potential to work with the Family Planning faculty physicians in the operating room at Barnes Jewish Hospital. The student will prepare a 15-20 minute presentation on a reproductive health topic of their choice to present at the end of the rotation. M45 ObGyn 843 Maternal-Fetal Medicine Outpatient Care Subinternship Students will see a variety of high-risk obstetrical patients in the outpatient setting in the Center for Outpatient Health. The student will evaluate various types of reproductive-age patients with medical or obstetrical complications, including preconception consultations, prenatal care consultations, and initial prenatal visits. The student will also see return patients to experience the continuity of prenatal care. Students will participate in antenatal testing and learn basic ultrasonography skills. The student will be responsible for one presentation to be given to the OB teams at the end of the rotation. Students are provided independent study time to put together the presentation, which should be created in PowerPoint and on a topic of their choice, inspired by a patient-related clinical condition that piqued their interest during the block. In addition, the student will have the option to take overnight call or call in the Pregnancy Assessment Center in order to gain more hands- on experience with inpatient obstetrics; this is voluntary and not a requirement. M45 ObGyn 844 Maternal-Fetal Medicine Inpatient (Antepartum) Subinternship Areas of patient care will include the Women's Assessment Center (WAC), the Antepartum Unit, and Labor & Delivery. The primary team will be the Antepartum Team, which includes a second-year and third-year OB/GYN resident, an MFM fellow, and the MFM attending. Students are expected to become functioning members of the antepartum team, with their own patients whom they will be responsible for rounding on and completing day-to-day tasks. Our patients include those who are admitted to the Antepartum Unit, various intensive care units, and other services with complications in pregnancy. The student will prepare a brief talk on a topic of their interest during the course of the rotation. M45 ObGyn 856 OB/GYN Ultrasound: Genetics Working with the attending physicians in the Ultrasound Units at the Center for Outpatient Health and the Center for Women's Wellness at Missouri Baptist Medical Center, the student will learn the principles and techniques of non-invasive screening for fetal disorders and observe the performance of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. The student will also learn the standards and guidelines for performance of the antepartum obstetrical ultrasound examination and female pelvic examination. Normal and abnormal fetal and gynecologic anatomy will be reviewed. Experience will be gained in pedigree analysis and familial 225Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) risk factor assessment by working with genetic counselors. One day is spent in the Cytogenetics Laboratory observing the preparation of prenatal specimens for karyotype analysis. Opportunities for participation in clinical research are also available. M45 ObGyn 870 Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology Subinternship Students will be working with two attendings, a fellow, and residents in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. They will largely be following this team from the outpatient offices located at COH 7, South County, Missouri Baptist & St. Louis Children's Hospital. In addition, OR experiences are located at both Parkview Tower 3 and Children's. The range of topics likely encountered will include gynecologic care in children and young adults, including menstrual and pubertal concerns; sexual health and contraception; vulvar vaginal irritation and labial adhesions; adolescent breast disorders; ovarian pathology and torsion; genital trauma; adolescent PCOS; pelvic pain and endometriosis; and the diagnosis and management of congenital gynecologic abnormalities and fertility preservation. Students will be involved in general pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinics as well specialty clinics (Disorders of Sexual Difference and Fertility Preservation/Gynecologic Late-Effects), and they will assist with inpatient and emergency room consultations and scheduled and emergent surgical cases as available. Subinterns will be required to give a presentation on a PAG topic of their choice by the end of the rotation, and they will have the option to participate in PAG research. M45 ObGyn 875 Affinia Ambulatory OB/GYN with a small subset of Affinia OB/GYN physicians at their office locations spread throughout St. Louis city. These federally-qualified health center sites will allow for a broad array of outpatient obstetrical and gynecologic exposures. Beyond general OB/GYN practice, this rotation will lend more perspective on access to care challenges and various aspects of health inequities. M45 ObGyn 880 Family Planning Ambulatory Subinternship Subinterns will work in small groups typically comprised of the attending, fellow, and resident within the office setting. The array of encounters will vary between ambulatory gynecology and family planning consultations. Topics specific to family planning include more complicated contraceptive counseling and treatment options in addition to providing treatment options for first- and second-trimester abortions, whether elective, due to lethal anomalies, or for maternal health concerns. Exposures to office-based procedures will include manual vacuum aspiration usage, laminaria placement, familiarity with medication usage (e.g., mifepristone), and other general gynecologic procedures (e.g., colposcopies, biopsy samplings, contraceptive placements). M45 ObGyn 900 Research Elective - Obstetrics and Gynecology Research opportunities may be available. If interested, please contact the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.John F. Hardesty, MD, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences The John F. Hardesty, MD, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences has a strong legacy and is a national leader in clinical ophthalmology and research. It is ranked among the top ten best overall programs in the United States, and it is also considered one of the top ten best research programs by U.S. News & World Report. Our ophthalmology department is fourth in National Institutes of Health funding for research and has one of the nation's largest ophthalmology research faculty. The department's mission is as follows: \"As world leaders in patient care, teaching and research, we strive to touch lives and preserve and restore vision through innovation and compassionate service.\" We hope that students will join us to enrich their medical education and to experience the collaborative culture of ophthalmology. Although only a small percentage of physicians in the United States specialize in ophthalmology, there is no doubt that all physicians need a basic understanding of the eye and what it can reveal about a patient's condition. In a recent article published in the journal Ophthalmology, it was stated that \"ophthalmology-related issues arise in the diagnosis and treatment of inpatients and outpatients on internal medicine, pediatrics, trauma neurosurgery, otolaryngology, dermatology, oncology, and went on to state that \"[m]ost primary care program directors believe fewer than 50% of incoming residents have sufficient ophthalmology skills when entering the internship period of medical education. Ophthalmoscopy is one of many ophthalmic skills in which there seems to be a gap in the training of medical students. [A study] demonstrated that emergency medicine physicians often do not perform an ophthalmoscopic examination when it is indicated, and when they do, they are unlikely to detect abnormal findings. This presents a serious issue, because patients with visual impairments are more likely to be hospitalized, and from 2006 through 2011, there were 12 million eye-related emergency department visits nationwide. If they are unable to view or interpret fundus findings with either an ophthalmoscope or fundus photography, the students must know when it is necessary to refer their patients to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.\" In other words, even if a physician does not plan to make ophthalmology their career, deepening their knowledge of this field will enhance their skills as a physician in any field. At Washington University School of Medicine, medical students under the Legacy Curriculum begin ophthalmology-based instruction during the first year with examination of the eye and a lecture on various aspects of ocular disease. During the second year, students receive a refresher lecture and lab 226Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) on direct ophthalmoscopy as well as a lecture on ophthalmic manifestations of systemic disease and primary ocular disease. During the third year, students are given the opportunity during the surgery clerkship to spend four weeks on the ophthalmology services; in addition, there are lectures given to students during the Internal Medicine rotations. During the fourth year, a four- week intensive clinical rotation is tailored to students interested in pursuing ophthalmology as a career. Research electives are available under the guidance of numerous ophthalmology faculty members for fourth-year students. Newer medical students under the Gateway Curriculum have the option of choosing ophthalmology for a three-week-long clinical experience during their first-year Procedural Immersion. More intensive clinical rotations will be available in later phases of the new curriculum. 1Graubart EB, Waxman EL, Forster SH, Giaconi JA, Rosenberg JB, Sankar PS, Goyal A, Mirza RG.

Courses Curriculum courses (p. 238) for Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences are listed below. Visit online course listings to view offerings for M50 Ophth (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M50). Gateway Curriculum: First Year Under the new Gateway Curriculum, medical students spend their four years split between three phases. Phase 1 involves the first 16 months of medical school. During Phase 1, students participate in three Procedural Immersions, which are three- week-long clinical and surgical experiences. The primary goals of the Procedural Immersions are to socialize the student to different clinical settings, to hone their clinical skills, and to allow them to explore the impact of society and health systems on an individual patient's health. This 360-degree approach to early clinical exposure allows students to view practicing medicine through physician, patient, and systems lenses. In these rotations, medical students will often focus on longitudinal patient care by following a specific patient from the time they arrive until they leave and seeing how all health care team membersare involved in that patient's visit. During the Ophthalmology Procedural Immersion, students spend time in the University Eye Clinic and in the pediatric and adult subspecialty clinics and operating rooms, and they attend rounds with an inpatient consult team. This early exposure to clinical experience helps students to contextualize the classroom and clinical learning that they continue with over the next two phases. Legacy Curriculum: Second Year During the second year of the Legacy Curriculum, students will receive a refresher lecture and lab on direct ophthalmoscopy as well as a lecture on ophthalmic manifestations of systemic disease and primary ocular diseases. Legacy Curriculum: Third Year During the third year, students are given the opportunity to spend four weeks of their surgery clerkship on the ophthalmology service. The students work closely with the ophthalmology residents and review the differential diagnosis of the \"red eye,\" how to interpret an ophthalmologic consult note, and how to handle ocular emergencies. During this rotation, there is again emphasis on the use of the ophthalmoscope. Additional clinical skills introduced to rotating students include the use of the slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy. All third-year students on the ophthalmology rotation meet weekly for case presentations with faculty and other medical students on the rotation. They also attend lectures periodically throughout their month in ophthalmology. Legacy Curriculum: Fourth Year The Ophthalmology Sub-Internship Rotation occurs during this time. During the month of June prior to their fourth year, students interested in pursuing a career in ophthalmology are encouraged to complete this intensive four-week rotation. Students will have personal indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses available for use on the rotation. Formal didactic sessions and workshops will be used to teach students how to perform a detailed ophthalmic history and exam, including the mastery of advanced slit lamp techniques and indirect fundoscopy. There will be an intense schedule of both live and recorded lectures delivered by ophthalmology faculty members, with post-lecture quizzes. Students will be expected to perform daily required reading. Retention and understanding of reading materials will be assessed by frequent quizzes. Students are strongly encouraged to present a case at the department's grand rounds. By the end of the rotation, students will be expected to function at the level of a first-year ophthalmology resident. Curriculum Courses M50 Ophth 801 Ophthalmology This elective is for senior students who plan to apply for a residency in Ophthalmology. In accordance with any subinternship, medical students will be expected to function at the level of a beginning first-year ophthalmology resident on this rotation. The students will rotate through the resident eye clinic and the subspecialty clinics of the full time faculty of the Washington University Medical School Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (e.g., neuro-ophthalmology service, cornea/external disease service, etc.). Students may opt to check out indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses that may be used for the month to facilitate the acquisition of fundoscopy skills. During the rotation, the student's responsibilities range from observation to working at a resident level and completing full eye examinations. There will be a rigorous academic curriculum for the rotation, including a weekly case presentation, weekly attendance at grand rounds, and a mix of medical student- oriented and resident-oriented conferences. On day one, students will receive a rotating call schedule for the entire month. A medical student is expected to be present at all times to assist the primary call ophthalmology resident during the rotation. By the end of the four-week rotation, the student is expected to be proficient in taking an ocular history and performing a complete eye exam including slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. All students interested in this senior elective must contact Course Director in March of year WUMS- III. The final grade of the student is determined by input from the director of the particular service(s) through which the student rotated, plus the case presentations. M50 Ophth 816 Away Rotation in Ophthalmology This four-week elective is for senior students from medical schools across the United States who are in good standing at their home institution and who are planning to apply for a residency in ophthalmology. To enroll in this elective, students must first apply online for the elective via the visiting student application service (VSAS). These applications will be reviewed and invitations will then be sent to individuals to enroll in the elective. Due to large demand, not all eligible away students will be accepted for the rotation. The dates for this elective are not flexible. The students will rotate through the resident eye clinic and the subspecialty clinics of the full time faculty of the Washington University Medical School Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (e.g., neuro-ophthalmology service, cornea/external disease service, etc.). In exchange for a refundable deposit, students may opt to check-out indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses that may be used for the month to facilitate the acquisition of fundoscopy skills. During the rotation, the student's responsibilities range from observation (including observing surgery) to working at a resident level and completing full eye examinations. Didactics will include weekly case presentation sessions, weekly attendance at grand rounds, and a mix of medical student-oriented and resident-oriented conferences.

Department of Otolaryngology The Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (http:// oto.wustl.edu/ ) at Washington University in St. Louis has a rich, 130-year history of leadership in our field that is built on the foundations of academic medicine: patient care, research, training and service. Our past leaders include luminaries in the field of otolaryngology, such as John Blasdel Shapleigh, MD; Greenfield Sluder, John Fredrickson, MD; A. PhD; and, presently, Craig A. Buchman, MD, FACS. Even from our earliest days, prior to the inception of the McMillan Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital (circa 1943), excellence has been an integral part of the department's fabric. A look at former faculty and program graduates reveals many of the true innovators in our field. While we remain humbled by our beginnings and past achievements, we choose not to rest on our laurels. Rather, we aspire to further our commitment to improving patients' lives by leading our field and its clinical application. Today, more than ever, we are driven to provide highest-quality, cutting-edge patient care that is both safe and effective. Our Washington University physicians and team, together with our Honor Roll Award-winning hospital, Barnes-Jewish Hospital (U.S. News , 2020-21), are second to none when it comes to tackling the full spectrum of conditions involving the ear, nose, throat, head and neck. Our basic, translational and clinical research programs are remarkable, providing answers to a variety of relevant questions that build on our foundations of knowledge, lay the groundwork for future clinical trials, and provide state-of-the-art patient solutions. Our educational programs for medical and graduate students, physicians in training, and established practitioners are committed to creating a culture of lifelong learning that firmly establishes our next generation of leaders in the field. Our residency program is highly rated by all metrics, providing balanced training across the clinical subspecialties and unique opportunities for growth and development as clinician-scientists (T32 training grant) and educators. We are most proud that these activities are ongoing in a work culture that values collegiality, inclusiveness, diversity and mutual respect. The Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at Washington University in St. Louis is a really outstanding place!CID at Washington University School of Medicine The consortium of graduate education, research and clinical programs known today as CID at Washington University School of Medicine was born out of the pioneering efforts of St. Louis physician Max Goldstein, MD. In 1914, he founded the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID), where doctors and teachers worked together to help deaf people. When CID's school building opened two years later, its auditory/oral methods for instructing deaf children were groundbreaking. Washington University and CID first joined forces in 1931, when CID's established teacher training program became the first deaf education undergraduate program to affiliate with a university. Graduate programs in deaf education, audiology, and speech and hearing sciences soon followed. CID's research efforts began in the 1930s to study the anatomy and science of hearing. During World War II, CID's research on hearing loss in military personnel laid the foundation for the field of audiology. CID also pioneered hearing testing and hearing aids, and it opened the country's first hearing aid clinic in 1941. In September 2003, a new affiliation transferred CID's graduate degree programs, research programs and adult audiology clinic \u2014 along with its building \u2014 to Washington University School of Medicine. The CID school continues to operate on the School of Medicine campus as CID \u2014 Central Institute for the Deaf. Today, these programs continue to work together to fulfill a shared mission to serve people with hearing loss. Website: http://oto.wustl.edu Faculty Craig A.

The type of research will depend upon the current phase of the research program in each laboratory. Students should contact the director of each laboratory to negotiate. 251Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Pablo M. Blazquez, PhD East McDonnell Science Building 4566 Scott Avenue Phone: 314-362-1013 This lab studies the role of the vestibulocerebellum and its target nuclei for eye movement control and spatial orientation. We use a range of methodologies, including single and multiunit recordings, electrical brain stimulation, computational methods, pharmacology and behavioral studies. Our main lines of research are as follows: (1) signal transformations carried out by the the vestibulocerebellum during visual and vestibular stimulation; (2) neuronal computations performed by the anterior and posterior cerebellar vermis for spatial navigation in mice; and (3) the role of the cerebellum-brainstem loop in motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Students will be instructed in one or several techniques and are expected to contribute significantly to the development of specific lab projects. Judith E.C. Lieu, MD, MSPH 3S35 Children's Hospital and McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-747-8205 The focus of the Lieu Lab is clinical outcomes research in pediatric otolaryngology. The techniques and methodologies of clinical epidemiology and health services research are applied to investigate clinical problems in children. Projects currently underway include the evaluation of the quality of life of young children with hearing loss, the evaluation of hearing loss on the perception of fatigue in children, and the use of MRI to investigate the effects of hearing loss in children. Potential studies include evaluating changes in the quality of life of children who begin using hearing amplification devices. Other projects of the student's choosing that would utilize these research techniques may also be pursued. Kevin K. Ohlemiller, PhD 2205 Central Institute for the Deaf Phone: 314-747-7179 The focus of this lab is on gene-environment interactions in cochlear injury. We study the interaction of genes and environment that increase cochlear injury due to noise and ototoxic exposure, with an emphasis on how these may yield apparent presbycusis. Because cochlear function and injury is the same in mice and humans and governed by the same genes, we use mostly mouse models. Methods employed include standard auditory brainstem response assessment and intracochlear recording, quantitative light microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and Western blots. We and our collaborators have identified specific genes and inbred strains of mice that mimic the three major forms of human presbycusis (sensory, neural and strial). Sensory presbycusis appears to bepromoted by alleles and mutations that impair protective factors (e.g., antioxidant enzymes) or that impair ion homeostasis. These may enhance cochlear injury from noise and ototoxins. Neural presbycusis can be modeled in part by mutations that impair inner hair cell/afferent synaptic function. Although it is not yet clear what types of genes and mutations can lead to strial presbycusis, we have discovered multiple mouse strains that show age-related endocochlear potential reduction along with distinctive strial pathology that includes fewer marginal cells as well as fewer and larger strial capillaries. We have also published quantitative trait loci that impact the qualitative character of cochlear noise injury. Important implications of our findings are (1) that there exists no single \"mammalian\" archetype of cochlear noise injury and (2) that noise injury to the organ of Corti in young adult animals depends in part on the status of the cochlear lateral wall. The latter relation appears to be genetically linked and appears not to apply to older adults. We collaborate widely, both within the School of Medicine and nationally. Our research is eminently adaptable in difficulty and scale to students' schedules and other requirements. Students may expect to learn the full range of methods we employ, including physiology, immunocytochemistry, histopathology and cellular/molecular techniques. Jay F. Piccirillo, MD McMillan, 9th Floor Phone: 314-362-8641 The Clinical Outcomes Research Office performs clinical epidemiology and health services research. Clinical epidemiology is the study of diagnosis, prognosis and the evaluation of treatment. Health service research is the study of the delivery of health care. The scientific methodology of clinical epidemiology is based on the architecture of clinical research, biostatistics and data processing. Current projects include studying the impact of comorbidities on the treatment and outcomes of patients with cancer. We also conduct research into the neurobiology, treatment and outcomes of patients with tinnitus. One method that we employ is the use of smartphone technology to capture ecological momentary assessments of tinnitus. Additional projects include exploiting neuroplasticity as part of olfactory training for patients with anosmia. With the use of clinical epidemiology methodology, we can also study a variety of other diseases. Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M55 Oto (https:// courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M55 660B Clinical Topics In Otolaryngology This course consists of nine introductory lectures on common diseases of the head and neck, including voice disorders, head and neck cancer, hearing loss, management of vertigo, pediatric otolaryngology, salivary gland disorders, sinusitis, otolaryngologic emergencies and facial trauma. Additionally, there is a case-based roundtable focusing on otolaryngology disorders affecting the geriatric population and the involvement of allied health care disciplines in the evaluation and management of these patients. Each lecture is highlighted by case presentations and treatment options in addition to pathophysiology. This course follows the physical examination practicum given earlier in the academic year. Credit 9 units. M55 Oto 801 Otolaryngology Subinternship Four-week rotation includes evaluation of ENT problems presented to specialist for diagnosis and treatment. The student participates in the clinic, hospital, and operating room. This may also include time on the Pediatric ENT Service, Audiology, Voice Laboratory, and Vestibular Evaluation Laboratory. Option of rotation on the ENT Service at VAMC is possible. M55 Oto 803 Pediatric Otolaryngology The student will actively participate in the clinical office, inpatient consultations, and surgery with the attending staff at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Care would be taken to provide experience in the common problems one would see in primary care pediatrics or family practice. Participation in sub-specialty/ multidisciplinary clinics such as the Cleft and Craniofacial clinic is encouraged. Opportunity will be provided to learn the fundamentals of audiological evaluation. Students participating in this elective will attend academic conferences in both the pediatric and adult divisions. M55 Oto 831 Neurotology Students will actively participate in the physical examination, advanced testing, and management of patients with balance dysfunction. Students will attend the patient clinic on Wednesday afternoon and all day Thursday, and they will test patients on VNG, rotary chair, VEMP, vHIT, and computerized platform three days a week. Research participation is possible with prior arrangements. M55 Oto 833 Ambulatory Otolaryngology for the Primary Care Physician This course offers a four-week exposure to ambulatory care of patients with diseases of the head and neck. Eight half- day sessions per week will be offered in attending clinics for general otolaryngology, head and neck cancer, otology, and pediatric otolaryngology. Two half-day sessions are reserved for audiology, vestibular lab, and voice lab experience.

Paul M. Allen, PhD BJC Institute of Health, 8th Floor Phone: 314-362-8758 260Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) This lab's focus is on research in immunology and the recognition of antigen by T cells. We are investigating how the T cell receptor functions developmentally, biochemically and structurally. We utilize in vivo models to study the role of T cells in alloreactivity/graft rejection and inflammatory bowel disease. Jacques U. Baenziger, MD, PhD Kingshighway Building, 2nd Floor, Room 2423 Phone: 314-362-8730 Glycobiology; informational role of carbohydrates in protein targeting and reproductive endocrinology. Jeffrey I. Gordon, MD 4444 Forest Park, 5th Floor Phone: 314-362-7243 Genomic and metabolic foundations of symbiotic host- microbial interactions in the human gut; impact on obesity and malnutrition. Michael McDaniel, PhD 3709 West Building Phone: 314-362-7435 The focus of this laboratory is to study the function and growth of pancreatic islets in Types 1 and 2 diabetes. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients to regulate DNA and protein synthesis. G-protein-coupled receptor agonists such as GLP-1 have been shown to enhance proinsulin biosynthesis and secretion and to stimulate cellular growth and proliferation. Our objective is to further explore the mechanisms of action of GLP-1 to enhance DNA and protein synthesis via mTOR in rodent and human islets. These studies are of fundamental interest for optimizing mTOR to induce cellular growth and proliferation, to enhance pre- and post-islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetes, and to prolong b-cell compensation in response to insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes. The failure of b-cells in obesity-associated Type 2 diabetes is believed to correlate with the intracellular accumulation of lipids that contribute to defects in insulin secretion and the maintenance of b-cell mass. Our studies have identified lipoprotein lipase in b-cells; this is a key enzyme for catalyzing the hydrolysis of lipoprotein-associated TAG to produce free fatty acids (FFAs) for local cellular uptake. We are also characterizing the effects of enhanced FFA uptake through fatty acid transporters and determining the regulation of lipid droplet synthesis and breakdown by lipid droplet-associated proteins. Recent studies suggest that FFAs upregulate mitochondrial uncoupling proteins proposed to dissipate the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The objective of this study is to delineate the link between FFAs and b-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes.Kenneth M.

We focus on integrin and cytokine biology utilizing a variety of genetically manipulated mice. John Turk, MD, PhD 6609 Wohl Phone: 314-362-8190 This lab looks at phospholipase A2 in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islet cells (e.g., a novel iPLA2 that does not require Ca2+ cloned from rat and human islets that is involved in cell secretion and proliferation). We also perform studies of iPLA2, its post-translational modifications, and its interactions with other proteins involving mice that are iPLA2-deficient globally or in selected tissues, 261Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) transgenic mice that overexpress iPL2 in -cells, and insulinoma cells with genetically manipulated iPLA2 expression. The mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and complex lipids is an important tool in these studies. Emil R. Unanue, MD BJC Institute of Health, 8414 Phone: 314-362-8748 Our focus is research that involves immunobiology and immunopathology. We examine cellular interactions that result in immune induction and cellular immunity. These cellular interactions are examined in normal immune responses and in autoimmune diseases. The focus is to identify the proteins responsible for the activation of lymphocytes in Type 1 diabetes. Herbert Virgin, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, Room 8849 Phone: 314-362-9223 We work on issues at the interface of virology and immunology by analyzing aspects of viral immunity, viral pathogenesis and viral genetics that contribute to virulence and disease. Mark A. Watson, MD, PhD Clinical Sciences Research Building, North Tower, Room 1029 Phone: 314-454-7919 Our laboratory is interested in defining patterns of somatic gene mutation, gene expression and quantitative tumor clonality that can be used to predict distant site metastases and therapeutic vulnerability in patients with lung and breast cancer. Experimental approaches use histopathological review as well as the next-generation DNA exome and RNA sequencing (NGS) of primary cancer patient tissues, coupled with bioinformatics and statistical modeling, to identify candidate biomarker patterns that may be useful for the clinical management of cancer patients.

Vikas Dharnidharka, MD, MPH Northwest Tower, 10th Floor Phone: 314-286-1574 The focus of this lab is on clinical and translational research in childhood kidney disease. Our group is involved in several different types of clinical and translational research, including multicenter clinical intervention trials to improve teen adherence with transplant medications and to test new medications in children on dialysis; translational biomarker studies in transplant acute and chronic rejection and genomic studies or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease; and large transplant database epidemiological analyses for associations of immunosuppressive regimens with efficacy and morbidity balance. 289Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Stephanie A. Fritz, MD, MSCI Northwest Tower, Room 10125 Phone: 314-454-4115 Our research team studies the epidemiology, microbial virulence mechanisms, and host defenses against community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) colonization, transmission and disease. We are investigating the transmission dynamics of CA-MRSA in households as well as interventions to interrupt the transmission of CA-MRSA and to prevent subsequent infections. Our lab also explores the microbial and host genomic determinants as well as the host immune response to staphylococcal toxins implicated in the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA in patients across the spectrum of disease states. Our goal is to develop novel approaches for the prevention of CA-MRSA infections. Carmen Halabi, MD, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 4th Floor, Room 4107 Phone: 314-286-1376 Our focus is on the extracellular matrix in vascular development and disease. Specifically, we study the extracellular matrix proteins that make up the elastic fibers of blood vessels. Elastic fibers convey elasticity to blood vessels, allowing large arteries to store energy during systole and release it during diastole. Abnormalities in elastic fiber components lead to various complications, including hypertension, stiff vessels, and aneurysms. In the laboratory, we utilize mouse models to understand how abnormalities in these proteins lead to disease, which helps us not only to learn about the normal function of these proteins but also to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Robert J. Hayashi, MD St. Louis Children's Hospital, Suite 9S Phone: 314-454-4118 Our clinical research interests include stem cell transplantation and its complications, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and the long-term side effects of therapy. Keith A. Hruska, MD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 5th Floor Phone: 314-286-2772 The research in the laboratory focuses on chronic kidney disease and its complications of the chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder syndrome, which involves skeletal frailty, cardiovascular disease, and vascular calcification. The lab has discovered important new pathologic mechanisms of disease leading to vascular calcification through systemic effects of factors involved in renal repair and hyperphosphatemia.Translational studies that continue to develop new therapeutic approaches are being aggressively pursued. New therapies for chronic kidney disease and its complications are being studied in clinical trials. Paul Hruz, MD, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, 3rd Floor Phone: 314-286-2797 Our research interests include structure/function relationships in facilitative glucose transporters, congenital and acquired lipodystrophy syndromes, and insulin resistance associated with HIV protease inhibitor therapy. David A. Hunstad, MD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, Room 6106 Phone: 314-286-2710 Work in our lab focuses on the interactions of pathogenic bacteria with their hosts. We aim to elucidate the modulation of host immune responses by pathogens and to determine the mechanisms by which these bacteria present specific virulence factors on their surfaces. Currently, we use cultured bladder epithelial cell models and murine models of cystitis to investigate the ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to modulate host innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, we are studying the molecular mechanisms by which selected outer membrane proteins contribute to the virulence of uropathogenic E. coli. Our primary goal is to discover novel targets for interventions that will prevent and better treat bacterial infections of the urinary tract. Along these lines, we are leveraging recent discoveries in UTI pathogenesis to design nanoparticle-based therapies for the prevention of acute and recurrent UTI. We have also launched a new translational study of immune responses to UTI in male and female infants, paired with an innovative new mouse model of male UTI that permits first-ever studies of sex differences in these infections. S. Celeste Morley, MD, PhD McDonnell Pediatric Research Building, Room 6105 Phone: 314-286-2136 Our laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying immune cell signaling and trafficking using mouse models. We hope to identify the molecules that are critical for host defense against infectious organisms such as pneumococcus. Our focus is currently on an actin-binding protein called L-plastin, which is required for normal T and B cell motility. Alan L. Schwartz, PhD, MD 425 McDonnell Sciences Building Phone: 314-286-1709 290Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Our investigative efforts are aimed at understanding the biology of cell surface receptors, including the biochemical and molecular dissection of the mechanisms responsible for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of blood coagulation proteins and the regulation of intracellular protein turnover.

Note to Students: There are always a number of research projects in the Department of Psychiatry. For additional information, contact Dr. Rubin at 314-362-2462. Andrey Anokhin, PhD Genetics of the Brain, Behavior and Psychopathology Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) Building 660 S. Euclid Ave., Suite 1 Phone: 314-286-2201 andrey@wustl.edu This research elective is intended for students interested in cognitive neuroscience, biological psychiatry, and behavior genetics. Dr. Anokhin's laboratory investigates the links between genes, brain and behavior in order to better understand the complex etiology of mental disorders. Our major focus is on the externalizing spectrum of psychopathology characterized by deficits in inhibitory self-regulation and related psychopathologies, including ADHD, conduct disorder and addictive behaviors. We are particularly interested in the intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) mediating genetic risk for addiction, such as impulsivity, risk taking, and abnormal reward processing. In our laboratory-based studies with human volunteers, including twins, we investigate individual differences in brain activity using the recording of brain oscillations (event- related brain potentials) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For example, an ongoing longitudinal study of adolescent twins explores the developmental and genetic determinants of brain activity related to reward and punishment processing, inhibitory control of behavior, and risk taking to identify prospective predictors of substance abuse and associated behavioral problems. In another ongoing study, we examine twins who are discordant for adolescent marijuana use in order to identify the consequences of substance abuse for the brain, cognition and emotion and to distinguish them frompreexisting risk factors. Interested students will be able to learn a variety of methods used in these studies, such as the recording and analysis of neural activity, including electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs), MRI scanning, startle response, autonomic measures, the administration of neuropsychological and behavioral tests, and the statistical analysis of data. The format of this research elective may include the following: (1) directed reading; (2) participation in laboratory experiments involving human subjects; (3) analysis of existing data from various research projects; and (4) designing and piloting new behavioral experiments. Qualifications include reliability and responsibility, the ability to commit a specified amount of time per week and to work a schedule that can be negotiated on an individual basis, and good computer skills. Deanna M. Barch, PhD Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience of Schizophrenia and Depression 4525 Scott Avenue, Suite 1153K Phone: 314-747-2160 Students may participate in the conduct of clinical studies of schizophrenia and depression. Involvement in clinical studies can include training and experience in interviewing psychiatric patients, or it may involve gaining experience in the techniques of assessing cognitive and emotional function using behavioral and brain imaging methods. Laura Jean Bierut, MD Maternity Building Phone: 314-362-2544 This research elective will focus on analyzing data from high-risk studies of smoking and other addictions. Students will have the opportunity to examine genetic and environmental factors that place some individuals at risk for developing nicotine, alcohol and other substance dependence and that protect others from the development of these disorders. Kevin J. Black, MD 4525 Scott Ave., Room 2205 Phone: 314-362-5041 kevin@wustl.edu Students will participate in ongoing studies of brain imaging, movement disorders or neuropsychiatric illnesses. Degree of participation will relate to the student's available research time, skills and interest. Visit the laboratory's webpage (https:// sites.wustl.edu/blacklab/ ) for examples of past research. Ginger E. Nicol, MD Taylor Avenue Building, Suite 121 Phone: 314-362-5154 305Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) We are part of the Healthy Mind Lab in the department of psychiatry, and our clinical research broadly focuses on increasing longevity and quality of life in children, adolescents, adults and older adults. Our specific projects focus primarily on obesity treatment and prevention, and they include clinical and genetic studies of psychotropic medications known to cause weight gain, like antipsychotic agents. We are interested in developing and testing medication-assisted psychotherapies with agents like ketamine and psilocybin for weight management and disordered eating. We also employ mobile health (mHealth) tools for collecting data and for delivering healthy lifestyle and behavioral weight loss treatments, and we use precision functional brain mapping to study individual, brain-based mechanisms of illness and treatment response. This elective offers the student a broad exposure to clinical research protocols, including protocols in adults and children. Students will have an opportunity to focus on a particular project of interest. Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M85 Psych (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M85).

Biological and psychological influences on these diseases will be presented. Interviewing techniques and performance of the mental status exam will be demonstrated by patient interviews. Credit 44 units. M85 Psych 770 Psychiatry Clerkship Students spend three weeks on the inpatient psychiatry service of Barnes-Jewish Hospital at the main campus unit. Students evaluate and treat patients with psychiatric illness under the supervision of house staff and an attending physician. Students are also assigned for one week at either an ambulatory treatment site or an inpatient consult-liaison service. There is also an opportunity for students to gain exposure to emergency psychiatric services in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital emergency department. The clerkships includes required attendance at teaching conferences, including small-group sessions with WUSM clinical faculty and upper-level psychiatry residents. Students are responsible for completing learning exercises and other assignments. Credit 154 units. M85 Psych 771 Ambulatory Clerkship: Psychiatry for Generalists Up to 2 students may elect to pursue their ambulatory medicine selective through the psychiatry department. Students participate in clinical duties depending on assigned locations, which can include the BJH adult psychiatry clinic, a community mental health center, the Wash U child and adolescent psychiatry clinic,and both the adult and child psychiatry consultation services. Students will also submit a written review of a relevant clinical topic of their choice. There are no call obligations at any clinical site. Credit 77 units. M85 Psych 805 Psychiatry Consult Subinternship Students spend four weeks on the psychiatry consult service at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Under the supervision of house staff and attending physicians, students participate in the evaluation and collaborative management of inpatients on medical and surgical units for a broad range of psychiatric and behavioral concerns. They learn about the intersection between psychiatry and other medical specialties and important skills for collaborative patient care. Students attend departmental conferences and other educational sessions, and they also prepare and present a clinical topical review of their choice M85 Psych 810 Outpatient Community Psychiatry This elective will provide the student with a significant outpatient experience in Psychiatry. Students will be paired with a Resident physician and have exposure to two adult clinics and one child clinic over the course of the rotation. Students will observe and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the clinic setting. Students will also attend scheduled lectures and conferences over the course of the rotation relevant to outpatient Psychiatry. During the elective, the student will learn about the outpatient presentations of psychiatric disorders, a variety of treatment techniques (psychotherapy and psychopharmacology), and general principles of outpatient clinical management. M85 Psych 836 Inpatient Psychiatry Subinternship This is a senior rotation that provides the students with an opportunity to expand their knowledge of inpatient clinical psychiatry by functioning as interns. Students attend all staffing and teaching conferences given to first-year psychiatry residents, take patients in rotation, and share night call with first-year residents approximately every fifth night. Immediate supervision is provided by the inpatient attending, and additional supervision can be arranged as desired. Teaching emphasis is directed toward psychiatric diagnosis, appropriate use of psychopharmacologic agents, psychotherapeutic intervention, use of community resources and pursuit of the psychiatric scientific literature. The student will write a self-selected clinical topic relevant to treatment and management of psychiatric inpatients. M85 Psych 840 Child Psychiatry This elective in child psychiatry utilizes the Child Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic and the consult-liaison service at St. Louis Children's Hospital. It provides experience in age-appropriate diagnostic and treatment methods in children and adolescents. A portion of your time may be spent on the inpatient behavioral unit at Saint Louis Children's if interested and if circumstances permit. A paper on a topic of the student's choosing is required. M85 Psych 844 Forensic Psychiatry The medical student will be actively involved in many aspects of forensic psychiatry including civil litigation, workman's compensation, malpractice, civil commitment, and guardianship. There may be opportunities to be involved in criminal forensic issues. The rotation is primarily self-directed but the student will work with several faculty within the Department of Psychiatry but will primarily meet with the Course Director a minimum of 306Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) two hours per week. They will also work with The City of St Louis Probate Court. The student will also be assigned readings of landmark cases, textbooks, psychiatric expert opinions, legal filing with the probate court and attend civil hearings. The student will learn relevant criminal statutes regarding competency and civil commitment, causation in civil litigation, the concept of medical malpractice and risk assessment of violence and suicide. There may be the opportunity to witness sexually violent predator evaluations and/or treatment. The student will be required to research and write an opinion on a specific approved topic in forensic psychiatry. The objectives will be measured by attendance and by formal evaluation of the student's participation and knowledge during the supervision discussion. It will also be determined by the originality, thoroughness, and quality of the research paper. M85 Psych 880 Schizophrenia Precursors & Prodomal States This is an opportunity for trainees to gain experience in the evaluation of children and adolescents who may be at high risk for schizophrenia. The rotation would center around the \"First Contact Assessment Service\", which evaluates patients who show characteristics suggestive of prodromal schizophrenia (such as new-onset attenuated psychotic symptoms along with recent deterioration in functioning) and/or early life characteristics that may indicate risk for developing schizophrenia later in life (for example, nonspecific social/emotional/behavioral symptoms in a child/adolescent with a strong family history of schizophrenia). Since the full symptoms of schizophrenia are often preceded by a wide range of childhood behavioral and developmental abnormalities, this rotation would also help trainees integrate information regarding the continuity between childhood development and adult psychopathology. Trainee would observe all aspects of First Contact evaluations (including semi-structured diagnostic interviews and examination of subtle neurological signs), participate in case discussions, and observe follow-up consultations involving patients with psychotic and/or complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Trainee would also be required to write a literature review on a topic relevant to the rotation. M85 Psych 900 Research Elective: Psychiatry Research opportunities may be available. If interested, please contact the Department of Psychiatry. Department of Radiation Oncology The Department of Radiation Oncology (http:// radonc.wustl.edu/ ) was created in 2001, after having been part of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology for many decades. The department has a broad academic program that focuses on excellence in patient care and the development of new treatment paradigms; innovative research in each of our three divisions: Clinical, Medical Physics and Cancer Biology; and teaching graduate students, medical students, residents in both radiation oncology and medical physics, and allied health personnel.The department is one of the largest, most academically balanced, and best equipped in the country, and it is responsible for all radiation therapy procedures at Washington University Medical Center and at Siteman Cancer Center facilities throughout the St. Louis regional area. Our faculty have gained international recognition for innovative technological advances in physics and treatment planning, biological research, computer applications and clinical investigation. We have advanced treatment planning computer systems for 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy as well as the latest Gamma Knife, the ICON unit. We have six linear accelerators with on-board CT imaging capability. The brachytherapy suite includes capabilities for high dose rate remote after-loading and for image-guided permanent prostate seed implants.

Please visit the Department of Radiation Oncology website (https://radonc.wustl.edu/education/ ) for more information about current research in the department.Courses Post-PhD Graduate Certificate/ Masters of Science in Medical Physics For course information, please visit the Medical Physics (p. 46) page of this Bulletin. MD/MSTP Programs The Department of Radiation Oncology offers two courses that are open to students in the MD and MSTP (MD/PhD) programs. For course information, please visit the online course listings (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/CourseListings/Semester/ Listing.aspx in Radiation Oncology will provide students with the opportunity to participate in the evaluation and management of a broad range of patients referred for consideration of radiation therapy. Clerkship activities will take place at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Siteman Cancer Center complex and at our satellite facilities. Students will conduct patient evaluations under the supervision of radiation oncology department residents and faculty. Students will attend many conferences throughout the weeks of this clerkship, with the workday starting between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Students will also have the opportunity to attend the appropriate multidisciplinary clinics, follow-up clinics, and multidisciplinary conferences (such as pediatric neuro-oncology, cardiothoracic oncology, lymphoma, GYN tumor conferences, and so on) pertaining to their rotation schedule. Instructional materials are available for students on the rotation. (Students are not expected to purchase any curricular materials for the clerkship.) Student performance will be evaluated by both resident and faculty members who supervise the student over the course of the two-week clerkship. Credit 77 units. M92 RadOnc 801 Clinical Radiation Oncology Subinternship The Radiation Oncology clinical division offers an elective with emphasis on the evaluation, planning, and administration of radiation therapy in patients with malignant tumors. Students will have the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the natural history of cancer as well as its pathological and biological features. Students will sharpen their clinical skills by participating in the management of cancer patients. Students will be mentored to prepare and lead a department noon conference on the management of a specific patient's care, including literature review and discussion. Students will be expected to prepare for clinical consultations by reviewing patient records and relevant literature, obtaining the patient's history, and performing a physical examination. This will be followed by presenting findings and a proposed care plan to the attending and resident physicians. This course is designed for MS4 students who are entering the Radiation Oncology Match. If a student is an MS4 applying in another specialty but interested in a radiation oncology elective, we encourage them to pursue a two-week special study elective in Radiation Oncology.

Interested students should contact the appropriate individual in each division regarding the types of research projects available.Tom Conturo, MD, PhD East Building, 2nd Floor, Rm 2120 Phone: 314-362-8421 Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive means of providing images of the human body at high spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity. The contrast can be manipulated to depend on different properties of tissue water, enabling the study of a variety of biological processes. In some cases, endogenous or exogenous paramagnetic MR contrast agents are used to alter the MRI contrast by perturbing the tissue water environment. Recently, new MRI hardware has also enabled techniques having high temporal resolution. Using the unique contrast properties of MRI and the higher spatial/temporal resolution, noninvasive techniques can be devised to study neuronal activity, tissue perfusion, water mobility (diffusion), and neuronal fiber pathways in the human brain. The goals of Dr. Conturo's research lab are to develop and apply MR imaging techniques for quantitative imaging of cerebral perfusion, brain function, water diffusion, and neuronal fiber pathways. These techniques utilize the MR signal effects of exogenous bolus-injected contrast agents, endogenous hemoglobin, and microscopic water diffusion. Long-term goals are to apply these methodologies toward imaging and understanding tissue structure, function, and physiology in the brain and other organs in normal and abnormal conditions. The approaches that are used in this laboratory cover a broad range of areas, including MRI physics, MRI pulse sequence development, theoretical derivations, computer simulations, image-processing, computer graphics, custom contrast agent design and syntheois, phantom studies, animal models, human studies, clinical patient studies, and comparison with other imaging modalities. Farrokh Dehdashti, MD Nuclear Medicine PET Facility, 10th Floor, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Phone: 314-362-1474 Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique that produces images reflective of biochemical processes of normal and abnormal tissues. PET is complementary to anatomic imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ability of PET to quantify fundamental processes, such as blood flow, oxygen metabolism, glucose metabolism, and receptor density, makes this technique very desirable to both investigators and clinicians. Dr. Dehdashti's research utilizes the conventional PET radiopharmaceutical, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as well as a variety of unique PET radiopharmaceuticals such as Cu-64-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-64 ATSM), 18F-labeled 3'-deoxy-3'fluorothymidine (FLT), a proliferative imaging tracer. Below is a partial list of the research projects relating to PET: (1) PET assessment of progesterone receptors in 324Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer with a new progesterone-receptor imaging tracer, 21-[18F]Fluoro-16,17- [(R)-1'-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20 dione (FFNP); (2) assessment of cell proliferation with a new tracer, N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2 (2-[18F]-fluoroethoxy)-5-methylbenzamide ([18F]3c), also called [18F]ISO-1 by imaging sigma receptors in patients with various solid cancers; (3) PET assessment of tumor hypoxia using 64Cu-ATSM in patients with cervical cancer (the major goal of this project is to predict prognosis); (4) FDG-PET/CT study in cervical cancer to evaluate the change in tumor FDG heterogeneity and SUVmax during chemoradiation and whether these changes are predictive of response to therapy; (5) PET using [18F]FHBG (9-[4-fluoro-3-hydroxymethyl-butyl]guanine), analog of Penciclovir, an acycloguanosine derivative and antiviral drug, for possible tracking of GvHD in patients who were prior recipients of unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplant for any hematologic malignancy; and (6) FLT-PET/CT to assess tumor cell proliferation in patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed ER+ stage IV or metastatic invasive breast cancer. Rob J. Gropler, MD East Building, Room 1307 Phone: 314-747-3878 The focus of our lab is on cardiovascular imaging research. The research in the Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory is designed to better understand the relationship between myocardial perfusion, intermediary metabolism and mechanical function in both normal and abnormal cardiac states. The research involves the integration of several imaging techniques with diverse strengths such as PET, MRI, CT and echocardiography. The success of the research requires several paths of investigation to be pursued in parallel. For example, in order to image the biologic processes of interest requires continued technical developments for each of the imaging methods listed above. There are ongoing efforts to permit more accurate PET measurements of myocardial substrate metabolism. They include the development of novel tracers of extracted substrates, the development of acquisition schemes to assess endogenous substrate metabolism, and the validation of mathematical approaches to correlate the tracer kinetics with the underlying metabolic processes. These studies are being pursued in small and large animal models and then in humans. Another example includes the current efforts to develop approaches to image the coronary arteries noninvasively by MRI using novel contrast agents and acquisition schemes. In addition, techniques are being developed to permit MR guided interventions on the coronary arteries. This undertaking includes the development of novel guide-wire tracking and catheter tracking schemes using both passive and active approaches. Finally, to permit assessments of myocardial oxygenation and thus, perfusion, techniques are being developed to permit BOLD imaging the myocardium. Another path of the research is to determine howthis perfusional-metabolic-functional relation is altered by normal life changes and then determine how disease states alter the relationship. For example, both PET and echocardiography are being used to characterize the age- and gender-related changes on myocardial perfusion, substrate metabolism and function. To study the relationship in disease states, similar studies are being performed in patients with diabetes and obesity. A third path is to determine the mechanisms responsible for these changes in this metabolic-functional relation and identify potential interventions that may reverse or ameliorate them. In this regard, similar imaging studies are being performed to determine the importance of nitric oxide and the PPARa system in defining this metabolic-functional relation. Stephen M. Moerlein, PharmD, PhD East Building, 1st Floor Phone: 314-362-8466 Our research interests lie in the general area of labeled tracer development for nuclear medicine imaging, especially positron- emission tomography (PET). Developmental effort begins with synthesis of target structures, preclinical screening that involves in vitro biochemistry and pharmacological testing, and ex vivo biodistribution studies in small animals. Promising tracers are then examined by in vivo imaging of animal subjects and tracer kinetic modeling. The final step in the transition of a radiochemical into a labeled drug takes into account radiation dosimetry, pharmaceutical quality, and the development of automated production and GMP production processes to streamline delivery to human subjects. Each of these aspects of radiopharmaceutical development are investigated, with a primary emphasis in novel agents for evaluation of pathological processes in neurology and oncology. Marc Raichle, MD East Building, 2nd Floor Phone: 314-362-6907 We use functional imaging techniques \u2014 both positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 to study the normal organization of the human brain and the effect of selected diseases. The research focuses on both the methodology (imaging and experimental) and specific questions in cognitive neuroscience.

For the most up-to-date medical student research opportunities, please visit the Research page of the Department of Surgery website (https://surgery.wustl.edu/research/ ). Section of Minimally Invasive Surgery 660 S. Euclid, Box 8109 Phone: 314-454-8877 Under the direction of L. Michael Brunt, MD, students may investigate minimally invasive gastrointestinal and hernia surgery. The minimum rotation length is four weeks. Under the auspices of the Section of Minimally Invasive Surgery and the Washington University Institute for Minimally Invasive Surgery, a number of surgeons are investigating outcomes of various minimally invasive surgical approaches to abdominal wall hernias, benign foregut disorders, bariatric surgery and cholecystectomy. Dr. Brunt is currently investigating the clinical outcomes and standardization of various laparoscopic surgical procedures, opioid prescribing patterns and opioid use in surgical patients, and education-related research and skills training for medical students planning to enter a surgical internship. Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 660 S. Euclid, Box 8238 Phone: 314-747-0541The Division of Plastic Surgery offers many opportunities for research projects on various topics related to plastic surgery. A project will be designed with students prior to their rotation on plastic surgery so that all of the materials and methods will be available at the beginning of the rotation. The basic science laboratories primarily investigate nerve injury and regeneration, including nerve transplantation. Students will be encouraged to design and complete their own research study during the elective. The minimum rotation length is six weeks. The research rotation can be conducted in the plastic surgery laboratories under the direction of Drs. Moore, Snyder- Warwick, Wood or Mackinnon . Ongoing projects include the following: The influence of the immune system on nerve regeneration; Neural tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics, such as electrical stimulation to promote tissue regeneration The investigation of glial cells at the neuromuscular junction during development, maintenance, aging, and after nerve injury Additional clinical and educational research opportunities in various fields of plastic surgery are available with Drs. Fox, Myckatyn, Patel, Tung, and Woo. These various projects include the following: In vivo tissue generation and tissue differentiation The mechanical, structural and biochemical effects of stress on scar tissue maturation In vivo anatomy of craniofacial deformities Outcome analysis of methods of cleft lip and palate management Breast reconstruction (3D imaging of breasts after cosmetic or reconstructive surgery, interpretation of angiograms of the breast to measure nipple perfusion) The use of nerve transfer to improve hand function in patients with cervical spinal cord injury/quadriplegia Surgical education (specifically web-based multimedia strategies for peripheral nerve surgery education) The Department of Surgery can host Washington University medical students in any of its labs either to receive credit for a class they are currently enrolled in or to add them into the system as Washington University student employees to be paid for their time worked. Student work may be obtained through the Federal Work-Study program, the Office of Medical Student Research, or direct communication initiated by the student with faculty they wish to work alongside on specific subjects of interest with the goal of furthering their education. This can occur during any year of a medical student's education. 340Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Courses Visit online course listings to view offerings for M95 Surgery (https://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sch=M&dept=M95). M95 Surgery 790 Integrated Surgical Disciplines Clerkship During the 8-week surgery clerkship, each student is assigned to seperate rotations. Each student is assigned to a required general surgery rotation at Barnes-Jewish Hospital or the John Cochran Veterans Administration Medical Center. In addition, each student selects elective rotations in other general surgical fields, surgical subspecialties and related disciplines of critical care. The student is an active participant in the daily care of patients on each service and attends the service teaching conferences and rounds. For the duration of the 8-week rotation, there are weekly small-group tutorial sessions with faculty members and a biweekly lecture series. Credit 308 units. M95 Surgery 814 Trauma Service Subinternship The student on this elective will function as a subintern on the Trauma and Acute Care Surgical Service within the Section of Acute and Critical Care Surgery. Through completion of this subinternship, the student will gain an ability to evaluate, resuscitate and manage trauma and emergency general surgery patients. Subinterns will actively interact with patients in the outpatient office, hospital ward and operating room. Practical experience will involve preoperative patient evaluation, resuscitation of acutely ill patients, operative patient management, in-hospital patient care and postoperative outpatient follow-up. The student will also participate in affiliated conferences and in-house call. M95 Surgery 818 Surgical Night Float & ED Subinternship This subinternship is specifically designed to give senior medical students an intern-level experience in managing acute on- call problems in surgical patients and in evaluating urgent and emergent problems in the ED. The rotation will be divided into two, two-week segments: one segment in the ED and the second on night float call on the surgical floors. Students will gain experience evaluating and managing the types of acute problems they will encounter as surgical interns as first responders to patients with acute abdominal pain, chest pain, hypotension, mental status changes, and other ER/on-call type problems. They will be assigned to the on-call surgical resident and will have a structured experience in order to maximize development of their diagnostic, management, and case presentation skills in the acute care setting so that they may more smoothly make the transition to a surgical internship.

This policy was updated in 2001 to include hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The purpose of the policy is to provide guidelines to prevent or reduce the transmission of these infectious agents between patients and health care workers. It is an ethical and moral obligation for students/employees to report bloodborne pathogen infections. The policy deals with the following: (1) the university's responsibilities to infected patients, including obligation to treat, confidentiality, and appropriate serologic testing; (2) appropriate health and safety precautions and procedures for faculty, students and staff, including compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, blood and body fluid precautions, and handling of needles or sharp instruments; and (3) the university's responsibilities to faculty, staff or students who are infected with HIV, HBV or HCV, including admission to medical school, participation in clinical rotations, serologic testing confidentiality, and medical treatment. The policy makes a distinction between Category I activities (those involving no risk of transmission from infected health care workers to patients, such as routine history/physical examinations, minor surface suturing, and elective phlebotomy), Category II activities (those for which bloodborne virus transmission is theoretically possible but unlikely, such as minor local procedures, central venous lines, and other specialty procedures), and Category III activities (those for which there is a definite risk of bloodborne virus transmission, such as general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, and other surgeries as well as nonelective procedures performed in the emergency department).In 2012, a committee was formed that included representation from Administration, Legal - Risk Management, Infectious Disease, Occupational Health, and Student Health Services. The Student Health Services director meets with infected students and discusses the need for restricted activities and proper follow- up. Needle Stick/Human Blood and Body Fluid Exposure Policy All exposures to human blood and body fluids must be reported immediately to the Health Service, which maintains a 24-hour reporting system. During working hours (8 a.m.-4 p.m.), the office can be reached at 314-362-3523 or 314-362-3528. After hours, the Health Service can be contacted through a digital beeper at 314-871-2966. Needle Stick Procedure Cleanse the wound immediately with soap and water. If a mucous membrane has been exposed, rinse with copious amounts of water. 1.Identify the source of exposure. 2.Call the Health Service for further instructions. The source patient will be evaluated for HIV, HBV and HCV. The physician in charge of the case is responsible for acquiring patient consent for testing. The employee will notify the physician. All source patient charges will be the responsibility of the Health Service. 3.Complete the Injury/Exposure Report form. 4.Employees and students will report to the Health Service for follow-up. Individuals will be evaluated for the following: a.HIV or serum sample save b.HBV vaccination c.Hepatitis B surface antibody testing (a positive test in the past eliminates the need for further testing) d.HCV vaccination e.Tetanus and diphtheria vaccination f.Post-exposure prophylaxis Human Blood and Body Fluid Exposures Procedure 1.Clean the area with soap and water. 2.Call Employee Health (314-362-3528) or Student Health (314-362-3523). After hours, call the digital beeper (314-871-2966). 3.Keep the source or patient available for HIV, HBV and HCV testing. 4.Follow the instructions given by the Health Service. Complete an incident report. Always wear Personal Protective Equipment! 349Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Liability Insurance Washington University provides general liability insurance for all students or practicums while participating in required clinical experiences. In addition, Washington University voluntarily provides a defense and indemnification benefit for matriculated students who are candidates for the MD degree at Washington University School of Medicine. The benefit is provided to School of Medicine students for the defense and indemnification of claims arising out of activities that are part of academic programs and only while a student is acting in their capacity as a medical student enrolled in the undergraduate medical program at the School of Medicine. This policy is subject to terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions, and each request for defense/indemnification will be decided on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of the university. Defense/indemnification will not be provided for any criminal acts, acts committed while under the influence, acts in violation of law, acts in which the injury or damage results from intentional malicious conduct or wrongdoing, or acts for which the action or proceeding is brought by or on behalf of Washington University. This indemnification does not cover any liability that is insured elsewhere, but it may be in excess of any amount payable under any other such insurance. Reporting An Incident Any incident \u2014 either actual or alleged \u2014 involving patient injury that could lead to a claim, of which a student has knowledge, must be reported immediately to the Risk Management Office of the School of Medicine. Professionalism & Conduct Policies Policy Against Abusive Conduct Please visit the Human Resources website for the Policy Against Abusive Conduct (http://hr.med.wustl.edu/Policies/Pages/ AbusiveConduct.aspx ). Research Integrity Policy Allegations of breach of the Research Integrity Policy are the primary responsibility of the Research Integrity Committee of the School of Medicine. Complaints regarding students enrolled for the MD degree will be directed promptly to that committee. The Research Integrity Committee will promptly investigate the charges and report its conclusions and recommendations to the dean, who will refer the issue to the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) as a breach of professional integrity if further action is warranted.For further information, visit the Research Integrity Policy (https:// research.wustl.edu/washington-university-research-integrity- policy/) posted on the Washington University website. Social Media Policy Students accepted to Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and current WUSM should be vigilant in their use of social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogging). The profession of medicine requires the highest standards of conduct because of the level of trust patients place in medical professionals. When students are admitted to WUSM, enrollment remains contingent on their demonstration of this high standard of conduct through sound judgment, accountability and integrity. Written, voice, email and other electronic communications \u2014 including those used in blogs, social media sites and smart phone apps, as well as in published writing \u2014 should be thoughtful, and all individuals in the learning environment should be treated with mutual respect and understanding. Posting items that represent unprofessional behavior, releasing patient health information or other HIPAA violations, or violating Washington University in St. Louis policies on social networking sites will result in disciplinary action by the medical school. The following two Washington University policies are incorporated into this policy and apply to accepted and current students: Washington University Social Media Policy (https://wustl.edu/ about/compliance-policies/media-policies/social-media- policy/) WUSM Social Media Guidelines (https://medicine.wustl.edu/ brand/social-media/ ) Guidelines Governing Alcohol Service at Events Sponsored by Student Organizations at the Washington University School of Medicine I. General Principle on Alcohol Service at Events Sponsored by Graduate and Professional Students and Organizations at Washington University in St. Louis Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) has adopted a Drug and Alcohol Policy (http://hr.wustl.edu/policies/Pages/ DrugandAlcoholPolicy.aspx ) reinforcing our commitment to an education, work, living and patient care environment that is free of alcohol and drug abuse. Given our mission to support personal and public health, students of the School of Medicine (WUSM) have a particular responsibility to recognize alcohol 350Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) impairment and the potentially dire social, physiological and psychological consequences of substance use and abuse. For information regarding the effects of alcohol and drug use and abuse and to learn about available counseling services, please consult the School of Medicine's Student and Occupational Health Services (https://wusmhealth.wustl.edu/students/ ). As adults, students are expected to know and abide by all applicable state and federal laws and university policies and procedures. State law makes it illegal for a person under the age of 21 years old to purchase, attempt to purchase, or possess any intoxicating liquor. Violation can subject an individual to a fine between $50 and $1,000 and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of one year. County and municipality ordinances contain similar prohibitions and sanctions. WashU expects its students and community members to exercise responsible decision making if they choose to include alcohol as part of their activities, including making sound judgments about whether, when, and how much to drink. Individual students are responsible for their own behavior and will be held to university and school policies should their behavior not conform to standards of conduct. Individuals may also be referred for criminal prosecution. If a student organization provides alcohol as part of an event, student organizers share in the responsibility of providing a safe environment for all attendees and must prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of participants when planning and hosting an event. Student organizations may also be held accountable for the actions of their members through university and school policies. Student organizations are expected to follow the guidelines below when hosting events with alcohol. Individual schools and certain venues retain the discretion to impose additional guidelines on student organizations and events. For more information, contact the Office of Medical Student Affairs (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/office-of-medical- student-affairs/ ) or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. II. Event Protocols A. Registration 1.Any on- or off-campus event sponsored by a recognized student organization of the school or the university as a whole must comply with the Drug and Alcohol Policy of Washington University in St. Louis, the procedures set forth in these guidelines, and all other applicable university policies. 2.Any on-campus event involving alcohol funded in part by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or by the applicable WUSM student services office and not sponsored by the school itself must be sponsored by a recognized student organization.3.All events with alcohol need to be registered with and approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. Depending on the nature and location of the event, approval from multiple departments within the university or school may be required. Approval for the event should be obtained no less than one week before the event is scheduled to take place. Failure to obtain approval for an event with alcohol during this time frame will likely lead to the event being rescheduled or cancelled. An event may not be publicized until it is approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program and any other applicable department (e.g., Protective Services). 4.To register an event, an event registration form (https:// meet.wustl.edu/services/catering/catering-alcohol- guidelines/) must be submitted to the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program no less than two weeks before the proposed event. B. Marketing 1.Organizations may not plan events that promote or encourage the consumption of alcohol as the main focus of the event. The theme of all events at which alcohol is served must be primarily social, cultural or educational. Alcohol may be implied in campus advertising of the event to graduate and professional students using conventional phrases such as \"happy hour\" or \"cocktail reception.\" 2.Student organization events marketed and open to the general public or to undergraduate students are not permitted to include alcohol. 3.Persons planning events should remember that the vast majority of events at WashU take place without alcohol, that most members of the undergraduate community are not of legal drinking age, and that many members of our community do not drink alcohol beverages at all. 4.The following are examples of prohibited depictions of excessive alcohol consumption in the advertisement or promotion of events: Excessive or underage consumption or use of alcoholic beverages All-you-can-drink activities Drinking games Price specials on alcohol Promotions or prizes featuring alcohol C. Event Location 1.Student organizations should check in advance with the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program, WUSM Facilities (https://facilities.med.wustl.edu/), Danforth Event Management (https://eventmanagement.wustl.edu/ ), the 351Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) appropriate WashU office for the reservation of specific event locations and any separate guidelines (including reservation deadlines) applicable to that space. Where separate guidelines are applicable and may conflict with the guidelines herein, the more restrictive guidelines should be followed. 2.When alcohol is permitted, the space must be secured (or, for outdoor locations, roped off as necessary) to ensure that proper admittance and alcohol distribution can be regulated easily and effectively. D. Alcohol Types 1.Only beer and wine are permitted. 2.Hard liquor \u2014 including (but not limited to) grain alcohol, punches and mixed drinks \u2014 is not permitted at events. 3.Glass bottles are not permitted on campus and are discouraged at off-campus venues. 4.Kegs or other bulk containers of alcoholic beverages are not permitted. E. Food and Alternative Beverages 1.Food must be provided at all events where alcohol is served. The food options must include plentiful and appetizing nonsalty foods that are readily available, free, and displayed in an attractive manner. 2.Nonalcoholic beverages, including water, should also be readily available and free. 3.The food and nonalcoholic beverages should be replenished several times throughout the event so that they are continuously available. F. Distribution of Alcohol 1.In compliance with Missouri law and university policy, alcohol must be served in a controlled manner and may not be freely accessible. A central point of distribution must be designated to allow for proper identification. 2.Alcohol must not leave the confines of the event. The \"responsible contacts\" and security staff are responsible for ensuring that alcohol does not leave the event. 3.Under the law, no one who is under the age of 21 years or who is disorderly, disruptive, visibly intoxicated, or known to be a \"habitual drunkard\" may be served. 4.Regardless of who is managing distribution, the age of all attendees must be verified. Acceptable forms of identification are limited to the following: (1) a current driver's license from any U.S. state; (2) a U.S. military identification card; (3) a state of Missouri special identification card; or (4) a passport. Please note that a foreign driver's license and a special identification card from a state other than Missouri are not acceptable forms of identification.5.If the server is not checking identification before serving each drink and if persons under 21 years old are permitted at the event, those guests who are 21 years old or older must be designated with a wristband or otherwise in a clear manner that is not easily replicated. For example, it is not permissible to mark hands with a marker or pen. 6.Those who serve alcohol and those who check proof of age and identification for any event may not consume or be under the influence of alcohol during the event. 7.Only one drink at a time may be served to each person. Each drink is not to exceed 12 ounces of beer or 5 ounces of wine. Guests are limited to a total maximum of one drink for each hour of the event (e.g., if the event lasts three hours, a guest may be served three drinks over the entirety of the event). 8.Alcohol distribution must conclude 30 minutes before the event ends. 9.Options for distribution must be discussed with and approved by the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. Depending on the nature and location of the event, options may include the following: a.Student organization servers: Student organization members may order, set up, and control distribution of the alcohol at the event independently in compliance with these guidelines if attendance is less than 40 guests, including members of the sponsoring organization(s). Prior to the event, the student organization must designate which member(s) will act as server(s). Servers must always be present at the location where the alcohol is provided in order to monitor guests' consumption and to ensure that no persons under the age of 21 years receive alcohol. The practice of \"self-serve,\" in which individual guests serve themselves from a common container or source, is prohibited. b.Third-party bartenders: Student organization members may purchase alcohol, and a third-party bartending company with the requisite liquor license or permit may set up and control distribution of the alcohol at the event. Bartenders will be responsible for checking the identification of the guests. c.Third-party caterers: Student organizations may contract with a third-party vendor with the requisite insurance and liquor license or permit (e.g., Bon Appetit (http://wusm.cafebonappetit.com/catering/), Aramark) to acquire, set up, and control distribution of the alcohol at the event, including checking the identification of the guests. Some university event spaces require a third- party caterer to be used for the service of alcohol or food. Student organizers must check policies and guidelines in advance with the Office of 352Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program, WUSM Facilities, Danforth Event Management, or the appropriate WashU office. If there is any possibility that event attendees may be less than 21 years old, student organizers must use option b or c to distribute alcohol. If alcohol is offered for sale (e.g., cash bar), if admission is charged, if donations are solicited to attend the event, or if money is otherwise changing hands between the guests and the organization for the event (e.g., charge for cups or glasses, charge for tickets), then the distribution of alcohol may only be provided through option c. 10.Off-campus events: If an event is held at an off-campus venue and alcohol is being provided by the student organization, the student organization must use option c, unless such service is provided by the venue. The owner of the event space must assume liability for the event, and the owner or caterer must have the requisite liquor permit and acceptable liability insurance. Organizations should check with the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program to ensure that all requirements are understood. 11.The selling of alcohol may not be used as a fundraiser for the sponsoring organization. G. Drinking Games and Other Games of Chance 1.There may be no games of chance, drinking games, contests, or other similar activities that induce, encourage, or result in the consumption of alcohol. Examples include but are not limited to beer pong, flip cup, kings, caps, Jenga, quarters, or other games in which binge drinking is encouraged. H. Responsible Contacts 1.At least one individual from the student organization per 25 attendees must be designated as a \"responsible contact\" for the event. More responsible contacts may be required based on the size, type and location of the event. Training for those wanting to serve as responsible contacts is available through the Office of Medical Student Affairs or the student services office of the applicable WUSM program. 2.Responsible contacts are not to consume or be under the influence of any alcohol prior to or during any portion of the event, including setup and cleanup. The responsible contacts must remain the same individuals throughoutthe entire event. These individuals are responsible for overseeing and ensuring the safety of the event, the distribution of alcohol, and the implementation of this policy throughout the entire event. 3.Responsible contacts are required to introduce themselves to the security guards, the venue representatives and WashU Protective Services. One responsible contact should serve as the primary liaison with these individuals/agencies. 4.Responsible contacts should monitor the consumption of alcohol by guests and take appropriate action by calling the police for emergency medical services if any guest displays signs of intoxication and is in need of medical attention. 5.The responsible contacts must end an event during which these guidelines are not being followed or other significant problems arise that jeopardize the security of the event or the safety of students. Security staff or Protective Services should be available to assist with closing down an event per the contacts' request. University staff may close an event at any time if the security of the event is jeopardized or if the safety of students is at risk. A university staff representative may be required to attend large-scale events. I. Attendance and Proper Identification 1.Participants who intend to consume alcohol must show proof of minimum drinking age by presenting a government-issued photo identification. Washington University identification, driver's licenses, and state or federally issued identification cards may be checked for validity at the point of entrance. Fake identification cards will be confiscated; students risk disciplinary action and/or referral to off-campus law enforcement authorities if they present false identification. 2.A line for admission should be in a well-lit area and well organized. A security guard may be responsible for checking proof of legal age and affixing wristbands. J. Guest Policy 1.For events at which guests are permitted, each WashU student is allowed to bring one guest. Students are responsible for the conduct of their guests, and guests must enter with their hosts. 2.Guest misconduct could lead to disciplinary action for the WashU student, and the guest could be subject to prosecution off campus. Verification of age and identity (i.e., driver's license or state or federally issued identification card) will be required of all attendees at the entrance to the event. 353Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) K. WashU Police Department and WUSM Protective Services 1.The WashU Police Department (WUPD) or WUSM Protective Services should be notified of all on-campus programs for which alcohol has been requested. Such events may require the presence of officers or security guards or the implementation of other security measures. Costs associated with security will be the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. L. Security 1.Private security guards may be required to assist with the safety of participants and the security of the facility when total attendance involves more than 100 attendees, as determined by WUPD or WUSM Protective Services. For all events that require security, student organizations should anticipate that a minimum ratio of three guards plus one additional guard for every 50 attendees may be required. The sponsoring organization is responsible for contacting and arranging for guards or for ensuring that the venue provides appropriate security staff. 2.WUPD or WUSM Protective Services should be involved in planning for the most effective use of the contract security contingent prior to the event. An example of how guards may be stationed is as follows: At least one guard would be stationed at the main entrance of the event to check for WashU student identification, to monitor the guest policy, and to help determine if anyone who appears to be intoxicated should be refused entry. A second guard would be assigned to the point of alcohol distribution and, depending on the security services provided, could monitor or check identification for proof of legal age and assist with pulling drink tabs from wristbands, if applicable. Other guard(s) would serve as roamer(s) and be responsible for monitoring legal drinking, access to event space, and all entrances. Additional guards may be required based on the nature of the event and the expected attendance. Security costs are the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. 3.Security staff must come from a licensed and bonded security company. However, some off-campus venues may prefer to have their own staff serve in this capacity. The security guards, bartenders, caterers or designated organization members (depending on the nature of the event) are required to verify the age of each participant with identification that provides the date of birth. If the event isheld outdoors or in an unsecured area, distinct identification (e.g., wristband, stamp) is required to identify attendees who are 21 years old and older; this is to ensure that those passing through the event do not receive alcohol. M. Post-Event Cleanup 1.For any event on campus at which alcohol is being served, the student organization planning the event must make arrangements for custodial services when the space reservation is made. Service requests should include additional trash cans and recycling bins. Large events must have cleaning staff during the hours of the event to remove trash and clean restroom facilities. All expenses are the responsibility of the sponsoring organization. Guidelines for Professional Conduct in Teacher/Learner Relationships and Policy Against Medical Student Mistreatment The Teacher/Learner Relationship Effective learning is possible only in an environment in which students can trust their teachers to treat them fairly and with respect. For purposes of this policy, a teacher shall be defined as any person subject to School of Medicine policies, such as a member of the School of Medicine faculty to whom a student is assigned during a course or clinical rotation. A teacher may also be defined as an attending physician, fellow, resident, research mentor, student, nurse or other person charged with supervising the education of a student. One manner in which the teacher/learner relationship is unique is that students may be vulnerable, depending on many of their teachers for evaluations and recommendations. In addition, medical education includes mastering not just pathophysiology but also the essentials of professional behavior, as set forth in our Guiding Principles of Professionalism (p. 387). We also recognize that students learn professional behavior primarily by observing the actions of their teachers as role models. Unprofessional, offensive, disrespectful or abusive behavior by teachers is antithetical to the standards of professional conduct that medical students are expected to master. These behaviors by teachers may also be self- perpetuating, as students come to believe that such behavior is appropriate when they assume the role of teacher. As we strive to create an environment of mutual respect, all faculty, staff and students are expected to abide by the Abusive Conduct Policy (http://hr.med.wustl.edu/Policies/Pages/AbusiveConduct.aspx). 354Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Behaving in ways that embody the ideal student-teacher relationship fosters respectful behavior, minimizes the likelihood of student mistreatment, and optimizes the educational experience for students. The following practices are examples of ways in which teachers and learners can encourage a positive learning environment conducive to the exchange of ideas among all who participate in the learning process: 1.Teachers a.Be prepared and on time. b.Provide learners with the most current materials. c.Treat students fairly, respectfully, and without bias related to their race, color, age, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, veteran status, disability or genetic information. d.Give students timely, constructive and accurate feedback. e.Distinguish between the Socratic method, where insightful questions are a stimulus to learning and discovery, and overaggressive questioning, where detailed questions are repeatedly presented with the endpoint of embarrassment or humiliation of the student. 2.Learners a.Treat teachers, peers, patients and members of the health care team fairly, respectfully, and without bias related to their race, color, age, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, veteran status, disability or genetic information. b.Respect patients' privacy. Under no circumstances should you discuss a patient online or post a patient's photo online, even if the patient gives you permission. c.Be conscientious with your electronic presence. Voicemail, email and other electronic communications (e.g., blogs, social media sites, smartphone apps, photographs, published writing) should be thoughtfully composed. Treat all individuals in the learning environment with respect and understanding. d.You have the right to free speech. However, in order to foster a community of professionalism, you and your peers are encouraged to approach one another professionally and to abide by the Washington University Code of Conduct. e.Treat fellow students as colleagues, not competitors. f.Take responsibility for maximizing your educational experience by addressing conflicts and discomforts that may impede your learning. g.Be an enthusiastic learner. h.Be trustworthy and honest. i.Be prepared and punctual. j.Know your limitations, and ask for help when needed. k.Put the patient's welfare first and ahead of your educational needs.l.Know and understand each patient's medical history, diagnoses, treatment and status. m.Take the initiative to educate yourself about each patient's illness. n.Be compassionate. Student Mistreatment The School of Medicine prohibits behavior that is abusive or that involves the mistreatment of students or others in the learning environment. We take issues of mistreatment seriously and aspire to a culture of zero tolerance for instances of abuse, mistreatment and disrespect. Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to maintaining an environment free from discrimination, harassment of any type, and abuses of authority. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has defined mistreatment in previous Graduation Questionnaires as follows: \"Mistreatment arises when behavior shows disrespect for the dignity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process. It can take the form of physical punishment, sexual harassment, psychological cruelty, and discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age or sexual orientation.\" The behaviors listed below are provided as examples of mistreatment and offensive behavior by the AAMC. However, we recognize that there are nuances to interpersonal interactions. Students who feel that they may have been subjected to mistreatment are encouraged to follow the procedures outlined in the Steps for Reporting Student Mistreatment section of this policy. The goal of this process is to provide the best learning environment possible. Examples of Potential Mistreatment Public humiliation Threats of physical harm Physical harm (e.g., being hit, slapped, or kicked) Requirements to perform personal services (e.g., shopping, babysitting) Offensive sexist remarks/names Denial of opportunities for training or rewards based solely on gender, race, sexual orientation or ethnicity Lower evaluations or grades because of gender, race, sexual orientation or ethnicity rather than performance Unwanted sexual advances Being asked to exchange sexual favors for grades or other rewards Racially or ethnically offensive remarks/names Offensive remarks/names related to sexual orientation 355Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Steps for Reporting Student Mistreatment The university takes allegations of student mistreatment by faculty, residents, staff or other students very seriously and strongly encourages its faculty, staff and students who are witness to such conduct to report it immediately, without fear of retaliation, to any of the following three deans: the senior associate dean for education, the associate dean for student affairs, or the associate dean for medical student education. These individuals will offer guidance and support \u2014 described below \u2014 to the student and discuss informal and formal options to resolve the matter. For more information, please visit the website of the Office of Medical Student Affairs (https:// mdstudentaffairs.wustl.edu/ ). Students may also consult with a medical student ombudsperson as a confidential resource. The medical student ombudsperson can provide guidance as well as mediation, directly or indirectly, between the student and the offender. Students may also choose to report student mistreatment via a link on the Canvas learning management system student commons homepage or via the Oasis curriculum management system. The end-of-clerkship and elective surveys have questions regarding mistreatment, where incidents can be reported in real time. These reports are confidential. The Office of Medical Student Affairs will receive all reports and will follow up with the reporting individual, if identified, to offer guidance, support and options for resolution to the student. If sufficient information is provided, the report will be passed on to the clerkship director and department chair after student evaluations are finalized for the course or clerkship in which the event occurred. Reports will be reviewed quarterly by a Learning Climate Committee. This committee will be chaired by the associate dean of student affairs and will consist of a medical student, an advisory dean or deans, the director of graduate medical education (or their designee), a hospital staff member, and the medical student ombudsperson. Aggregate reports will generally be forwarded to department chairs quarterly for monitoring purposes. Confidentiality and Anonymous Reporting The university will strive to protect, to the greatest extent possible, the confidentiality of persons reporting mistreatment and of those accused of mistreatment. Because the university may have certain legal obligations (e.g., in response to allegations of sexual harassment), the university cannot guarantee complete confidentiality where it would conflict with the university's obligation to investigate meaningfully or, where warranted, take corrective action. Even when some disclosure of the university's information or sources is necessary, it will be limited to the extent possible. The university will keep confidential all records of complaints, responses and investigations to the extent permitted by law.If the student is not comfortable reporting to one of the individuals identified above, the student may choose an intermediary who can then directly communicate information about the incident to these individuals while maintaining anonymity. Students may also submit anonymous reports via the Oasis curriculum management system in real time or when filling out course evaluations. Anonymous reports will be shared with the clerkship director and the department chair. If a student insists on confidentiality or anonymity, the university may be limited in its ability to respond and take action with respect to the report . Bias Report and Support System (BRSS) In addition, Washington University students, faculty, staff and community members who have experienced or witnessed what they perceive as incidents of bias, prejudice or discrimination involving a student can report their experiences to the university's Bias Report and Support System (BRSS) (https:// diversityinclusion.wustl.edu/brss/ ) team. If, for any reason, students do not want to provide identifying information when filing a report, they have the option to fill out the BRSS form (http://diversity.wustl.edu/students/mosaic/bias-report-support- system/bias-report-form/ ) anonymously online by selecting the \"For Information Only\" option. Please note that a brief description of the incident will be included in the quarterly summary report . If an individual submitting a report selects the \"For Support and Referral\" option, a member of the BRSS team will meet with the individual and refer that person to the appropriate university policy and administrator. Note that these non-anonymous BRSS reports on the WUSM campus are sent to the assistant provost, who assists WUSM students with navigating their programs and connects them with the relevant policies and contacts within those programs. Informal and Formal Options for Possible Resolution Informal Options If you feel comfortable dealing with the situation without assistance, you can communicate either orally or in writing with the person whose behavior was offensive. The most useful communication will have three parts: 1.A factual description of the incident(s), including date, time, place and specific action 2.A description of the writer's feelings, including any consequences of the incident 3.A request that the conduct cease Frequently, such a communication will cause the offensive behavior to stop, particularly when the person may not be aware that the conduct is offensive. If you would like to proceed informally but with the assistance of someone else, you may do the following: 356Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) 1.Ask the person's supervisor (i.e., the department chair, dean, director, housing office representative, academic adviser, or a trained WUSM faculty member) to speak to the person whose behavior was offensive. The purpose of such conversations is the cessation of offensive behavior. You should note that these individuals may be obligated to report the incident or conduct you disclose to the university for further investigation and action. 2.Consult with one of the advisers listed in the Additional Resources section below. These individuals are specifically charged with responding to mistreatment inquiries and complaints. They are thoroughly familiar with WUSM's mistreatment policy and are available to consult with victims, those accused of engaging in mistreatment, witnesses, and supervisors of parties to a complaint. They can provide information about informal actions that might remedy the situation and discuss university policies and procedures for resolving complaints. 3.Ask the adviser to mediate or arrange for mediation. Mediation is discussion and negotiation with the help of a third party, and it is designed to permit the parties to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of a dispute. If the person complaining of mistreatment seeks mediation, the person accused of mistreatment agrees, and the adviser concludes that the mediation would be consistent with the university's legal obligations in responding to and preventing discrimination or discriminatory harassment, then the adviser may mediate or arrange for mediation. Formal Options Should informal resolution be unsuccessful or inappropriate under the particular circumstances alleged, the student will be referred to the applicable university policies and procedures for filing a formal complaint. The university will initiate an investigation into the allegations under the appropriate policy and take disciplinary action as contemplated by the applicable procedures. For example, if a student asserts that a faculty member has engaged in mistreatment in the form of sexual harassment, the university's Sexual Harassment Policy would be followed. Education The School of Medicine will provide ongoing education to promote a respectful and positive learning environment. The purpose of this education will be to provide definitions and standards for an optimal learning environment in an effort to inform students and educators about policies and processes for reporting offensive behavior and learner mistreatment. This educational information will be provided by the Learning Climate Committee. The policy will be posted in the Bulletin and in the clerkship and course director handbooks, and itwill be reviewed with students during orientations. In addition, educational sessions may be provided at departmental and division meetings, resident sessions, staff meetings and curriculum committee meetings. Additional Resources The following is a list of Medical Student Advisers who may provide guidance when addressing some of the potential issues discussed in the above guidelines: Kathy Diemer, MD, Assistant Dean for Career Counseling (https://residency.wustl.edu/ ) Eva Aagaard, MD, Senior Associate Dean for Education (https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/school-medicine-names- new-leader-medical-education/ ) Thomas De Fer, MD, FACP, Associate Dean for Medical Student Education (https://md.wustl.edu/contact/medical- student-education/ ) Lisa Moscoso, MD, PhD, Associate Dean for Student Affairs (http://mdstudentaffairs.wustl.edu/contact/) Medical Student Ombudsperson (Confidential Adviser) (https://ombuds.med.wustl.edu/ ) Student Rights Policies Policy on Student Rights Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects student information. The law also gives individual students certain rights: The right to inspect and review education records The right to seek the amendment of education records The right to consent to the disclosure of education records The right to obtain a copy of the school's FERPA policy (http://sites.wustl.edu/universityregistrar/student-records/ ferpa-privacy/washington-university-ferpa-policy/) The right to file a complaint with the FERPA office in Washington, D.C. Student Directory Information Although most information about a student is considered private and no one other than school officials (i.e., faculty and staff) with a legitimate educational interest may have access to it without the written consent of the student, certain categories of information designated as \"directory information\" may be disclosed by Washington University without obtaining the prior consent of the student. 357Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Through WebSTAC (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/ ), Washington University students have control over the release of their directory information. Information with the \"directory information\" designation is as follows: Full name Home and local addresses and telephone numbers Email address Photographic, video or electronic image (picture) Academic division and major field of study Dates of attendance Previous schools attended Graduation dates and degrees received at Washington University Class (affiliated degree year) Academic awards Participation in intercollegiate activities Height and weight (National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III athletes only) Refer to the full text of the Washington University FERPA Policy (http://sites.wustl.edu/universityregistrar/student-records/ferpa- privacy/washington-university-ferpa-policy/) for more information. Privacy Information for Parents In accordance with federal law under the FERPA, the university may choose to release information about a student's academic performance to a parent if the student is claimed as a legal dependent on that parent's most recent federal income tax return. However, the university is not required to do so and prefers that students take the initiative to disclose and discuss academic goals and progress with their parents. Students With Disabilities Policy It is the goal of Washington University to assist students with disabilities in removing the barriers their disabilities may pose and to provide support as these students face the challenge of pursuing an education at Washington University. Washington University recognizes and accepts its professional, legal and moral responsibility to avoid discrimination in the acceptance and education of qualified students with disabilities and to provide reasonable accommodations to such students consistent with the principles embodied in the law. These guidelines apply to students seeking admittance as well as to those who become disabled while they are enrolled. Washington University makes every effort to ensure that all qualified applicants and students can participate in and take full advantage of all programs and opportunities offered within the university. Washington University encourages and givesfull consideration to all applicants for admission. Washington University does not discriminate in access to its programs and activities on the basis of age, sex, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion, color or national origin. All students in educational programs at the School of Medicine, those seeking admittance, and those who become disabled while they are enrolled must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty and the profession. In this regard, we will be guided by the principles outlined below. A. Responsibilities of the Student 1.Disclosure of disability It is the responsibility of a student who has a disability to disclose this fact and to request accommodation from the dean for student affairs or the program director. The school encourages students with disabilities to identify themselves as early as possible to optimize the mobilization of resources and available accommodations. 2.Diagnosis of disability Students who are having academic difficulty that may be a consequence of a disability are encouraged to avail themselves of diagnostic services that may lead to accommodations. Furthermore, such students are encouraged to explore with the administration of their academic unit the possibility of a disability if the inquiry is relevant to educational performance and there is evidence of educational performance problems. 3.Documentation of disability and request for accommodation The disability, its functional impact and the requested accommodation(s) must be documented. If the student discloses a disability and requests accommodation, the school requires documentation of the disability from a qualified professional. Unless there are extraordinary and compelling circumstances, the student is financially responsible for the costs related to this documentation, which must be performed by an appropriately educated and trained professional. The information provided by the professional must be factual, objective and technically valid, and it must establish clearly that the disability substantially limits one or more of the student's major life activities. The professional(s) who evaluate the student should identify options for the management of the disability. Based on this information, the affected student should then request, in writing, the relevant accommodations. The student should work together with the dean for student affairs or the program director to arrive at a plan for reasonable accommodations. The school may also require a second expert opinion for which the school may be financially responsible under extraordinary and compelling 358Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) circumstances. The school reserves the right to request as much detailed information from the student and/or the verifying professional(s) as is necessary to assess the scope of the disability and/or the reasonable accommodations. B. Responsibilities of the School 1.Review of requests for accommodation Requests for accommodations will usually be reviewed by the dean for student affairs or the program director. An ad hoc assessment team may be convened that may include the dean for student affairs, the educational program director (or curriculum supervisor), selected members of the Disabilities Oversight Committee (refer to Section B.5 below), and other consultants as appropriate to the individual circumstances. The assessment team usually should include the following people: (1) individuals who understand the curriculum in question; (2) a person who is knowledgeable about the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (3) a person with the authority to authorize accommodations and cause them to be implemented. 2.Responsibilities for accommodation The School of Medicine is responsible for the costs incurred to make accommodations that are not unduly burdensome or unreasonable. Accommodations may include but may not be limited to academic modifications that do not fundamentally alter the nature of the program, auxiliary services, modifications of the circumstances and methods of qualification examinations, and classroom modifications. The school's responsibility to accommodate ends when a student with a disability does one of the following: (1) refuses reasonable accommodations; (2) is unable, with reasonable accommodations, to fulfill the essential requirements of the program; (3) fulfills the essential requirements and graduates; or (4) transfers to another institution. The school is not required to provide an accommodation that fundamentally alters the nature of the program, that is unduly burdensome or that is unreasonable. 3.Confidentiality Information pertaining to a student's disability and accommodations will be maintained in a file that is kept confidential and separate from the student's academic record. Appropriate faculty, staff and administrators may be informed regarding the student's disability, limitations, restrictions and accommodations when they have a need to know such information. 4.Application of the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) policies The policies and procedures of the school regarding promotion and retention are documented for each academic unit. These policies and procedures govern the relationship between the school and all students, including those with disabilities. The school is not obligated to retain astudent with a disability who poses a significant threat to the health or safety of others when there is no reasonable accommodation that either eliminates or sufficiently reduces that risk. 5.Disabilities Oversight Committee There shall exist a standing Disabilities Oversight Committee composed of members designated by the dean of the School of Medicine. The committee shall have the following responsibilities: (1) performing a periodic review of requests for accommodations and accommodations granted; (2) providing recommendations regarding accommodations for disabilities; and (3) serving as requested on a disability appeals committee. This group serves as a resource regarding issues of significance to the institution and to students with disabilities. C. Appeals A student with a disability who believes that a request for accommodation has been improperly denied or who perceives that they have been discriminated against on the basis of a disability should direct their appeal to the dean of the School of Medicine. As needed, the dean of the School of Medicine may assemble an advisory group to review appeals and make recommendations. This group may include but may not be limited to the chair of the committee that oversees the academic evaluation and advancement of students for the particular academic unit, students, and/or representatives of the Disabilities Oversight Committee. MD: Admissions Policies Advanced Standing Transfers Policy for Medical Students Background LCME Standard 10.7 calls upon accredited schools to ensure that any student accepted for transfer demonstrates characteristics comparable to the other students in the class that they will join. Further, the school must accept transfers into the final year only in rare and extraordinary circumstances. Washington University School of Medicine has historically offered a third-year advanced standing (transfer) program that conformed to the LCME standard. Curricular reform has led us to re-examine this policy. Unlike the Legacy curriculum, which had a 2+2 structure that mapped readily onto other schools' curricula, the Gateway Curriculum is both unique and integrated. A transfer student would not have an experience substantially equivalent to that of their classmates. Designing custom alternative programs for each transfer student would be impractical and contrary to the program's philosophy. The Gateway Curriculum involves 359Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) continuous benchmarking of progress against competencies and program objectives. A transfer student would not have this continuous benchmarking. It is therefore not possible to offer transfers into the Gateway Curriculum. Policies/Requirement Washington University School of Medicine does not accept advanced standing (transfer) students from other medical schools. Guidelines It is not possible to transfer into the MD degree program at Washington University, either as an MD-only candidate or as an MD-PhD. This policy does not preclude Washington University medical students from transferring internally into the Medical Scientist Training Program. The Washington University School of Medicine Advanced Standing Transfers Policy for Medical Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on May 13, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Policy on the Final Authority of the Committee on Admissions Background LCME Element 10.2 requires that the \"final responsibility for accepting medical students\" rest with a formally constituted admission committee, with specified authority, composition, and rules of operation. Policy The Committee on Admissions (COA) has final authority for determining the acceptance of all candidates for the MD degree at Washington University School of Medicine. The COA is assembled by the Associate Dean for Admissions and is drawn from the faculty and staff of the School of Medicine, with the majority drawn from the full-time faculty. Final decisions for the acceptance of an applicant during the regular season (prior to May 1) are made by the Steering Committee, a committee of the whole at which all COA members have seat, voice, and vote. Five voting COA members must be present at Steering, and the majority of voting members present must be members of the faculty for a quorum to be reached at Steering. After May 1, during the waitlist phase, final decisions are made by the Leadership Subcommittee on behalf of the COA. The selection of individual medical students is not influenced by political or financial factors, in accordance with our policies on external factors and conflicts of interest.The Policy on the Final Authority of the Committee on Admissions was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Policy on the Selection of Students Background LCME Element 10.3 calls upon the faculty to establish criteria for student selection and to develop and implement effective policies and procedures regarding medical student application, selection, and admission and to make available to all interested parties its criteria, standards, policies, and procedures. Policy The selection process that has been developed by the Committee on Admissions identifies applicants whose life experiences, personal attributes, academic achievement, and career goals align with the mission and vision of WUSM (https://medicine.wustl.edu/about/mission/ ) and the guiding principles of the Gateway Curriculum (https://sites.wustl.edu/ gatewaycurriculum/about/guiding-principles/ ). The purpose is to identify candidates who will contribute to the medical profession and who are most likely to enrich and benefit from our learning environment. Our process follows the AAMC principles of holistic review (https://students-residents.aamc.org/choosing- medical-career/holistic-review-medical-school-admissions/ ). Furthermore, the AAMC Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students (https://www.aamc.org/services/admissions- lifecycle/competencies-entering-medical-students/ ) are the overall dimensions on which students are evaluated. All of the committee's rubrics and forms have been linked to these Core Competencies. The Policy on the Selection of Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Policy on External Factors Background LCME Element 10.2 requires that the final responsibility for selecting medical students must reside with a formally constituted faculty committee and that the selection of individual medical students for admission is not influenced by any political or financial factors. This policy, together with the Policy on the Final Authority of the Admission Committee, is intended to clarify the role that external factors may play. 360Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Policy Persons or groups external to the Committee on Admissions may assist with the identification of applicants, but they do not have decision-making authority. The selection of individual students at WUSM must not be influenced by factors exogenous to the admissions process, such as political or financial factors. The Policy on External Factors was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Absences & Leaves Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations Background The profession of medicine requires the utmost commitment of time and energy to patient care and research activities. While the development of this commitment begins in the preclinical years, it is further practiced and developed during clinical training. The clinical year at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) comprises 48 weeks of required core clinical experiences. The fourth year encompasses a 44-week time block and requires MD students take a minimum of 36 weeks of credit (32 weeks of electives plus four weeks of Capstone). MSTP students are required to take a minimum of 12 weeks of credit (eight weeks of electives plus four weeks of Capstone). All students on clinical rotations have a scheduled two-week winter recess break and a three-day spring break. All clinical students have a two-week break between the end of the third- year clinical rotations and the start of the fourth-year elective rotations. During every clinical rotation, each student is expected to participate fully in all activities of the clinical rotation until the designated end time of the clinical rotation or the start time of a holiday break. This regularly requires participation beyond formal weekday hours to include evening and nighttime call and clinical responsibilities on weekends. In keeping with LCME standard 12.4, all students requiring access to necessary diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic care for both acute and chronic health concerns are to be excused from clinical training per the Washington University School of Medicine Access to Healthcare Services Policy. (p. 363) Students must recognize that clinical teaching, learning and evaluation are dependent on the student's presence and participation in every aspect of the clinical rotation. While students will not be graded down only because of an excused absence, time spent away from the rotation may decrease learning and impede effective evaluation.Policies In the event that a student finds that an absence from a clinical rotation is unavoidable, they must complete an absence notification form that will be sent to the clinical course director and the Director of Medical Student Education and Student Affairs. Students must also notify their clinical supervisors by email. If a student is ill or has a personal emergency, they are responsible for completing an absence notification form as soon as possible. If the absence extends beyond two consecutive days, the Director of Medical Student Education and the Office of Student Affairs will be notified. It is recognized that a student may, on a rare basis, desire to be excused from clinical activities for professional or significant personal events. Travel prior to or following observed university holidays and breaks that occurs outside of the officially designated times/dates on the MD Program Academic Calendar does not constitute a significant personal event or unavoidable absence. For all students on clinical rotations, the Clinical Curriculum Committee has agreed upon the following limitations on the maximum number of days of absences (both planned and unplanned) from clinical rotations. Type of Course MD Students MSTP Students and Interviewing Fourth-Year MD Students* 2-week elective 1 day 1 day 3-week clerkship 1 day 1 day 4-week elective 3 days 5 days 4-week clerkship 3 days 3 days 5-week clerkship 3 days 3 days 8-week clerkship 4 days 4 days 9-week clerkship 4 days 4 days *Residency interviewing season is typically from mid- October through January. Any additional days off would require approval by the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and the elective course director. If a student misses more than the maximum number of allowable days of absences for a given clinical rotation, the consequence rendered will be at the discretion of the clinical course director and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or the Associate Dean of the Office of Medical Student Education. Failure of the student to notify the clinical course director of their absence after consideration of the particular circumstances of the absence will result in the filing of a professionalism concern form (PCF). 361Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Guidelines All non-clinical electives and the Capstone course may have separate attendance requirements and absence procedures. Please refer to the course syllabus for details. Students are encouraged to make up missed work on rotations in which this can result in meaningful learning and should discuss this option with the clinical course director. At the discretion of the clinical course director, any student who misses portions of the clinical experiences due to planned and/ or unplanned absences that exceed the maximum time may be required to utilize winter recess, spring break or free time at the end of the third-year clinical rotations to complete the 48 weeks of mandatory clinical rotations. A concerning trend of absences may result in a review of professional integrity by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES), at the discretion of the Dean of Student Affairs. MSTP students are encouraged to do the following: Meet with the Assistant Dean for Career Development early for assistance in residency planning. Consider returning to the MD program to allow for 18 to 24 months to complete MD training to allow flexibility for interviewing and USMLE exams. Discuss planned absences with clinical course directors early, prior to a clinical rotation, to better allow placement on a team to optimize the educational experience. We believe this guideline strikes an appropriate balance between increased flexibility for the MSTP students and assuring a meaningful educational experience on the core clinical rotations. The Washington University School of Medicine Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations was last approved by the Oversight Committee on Medical Student Education on May 3, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Oversight Committee on Medical Student Education. Phase I Attendance Policy Background The profession of medicine requires the utmost commitment of time and energy to learning/education, patient care, research and other scholarly activities. The development of this commitment begins in Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum. Students must recognize that teaching, learning and assessment in both clinical and nonclinical settings are dependent on the student's presence and participation in their education. Time spent away from an educational experience may decrease learning and impede effective assessment.In keeping with LCME standard 12.4, all students requiring access to necessary diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic care for both acute and chronic health concerns are to be excused from required learning activities. Please refer to the Access to Healthcare Services Policy (p. 363) for additional details. Policies/Requirement Students are expected to attend all required sessions within Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum as specified within the learning management system. In the unusual circumstance that a student finds that they are unable to attend a required session, the student must complete an absence notification form in the learning management system that will be sent to the faculty lead, with a copy sent to the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE). This form must be completed prior to the session that they will miss or as soon as possible after the session if missed due to sudden illness or emergency. In addition, students unable to attend a team activity should notify their team members by email. In the case of immersions, students must also notify by email the clinical team to which they have been assigned. In the event that an absence is unavoidable, students will work with the faculty leads to develop a remediation plan for the missed session. All required assignments associated with a missed session must be completed. Faculty directors may require additional makeup work for missed sessions. Faculty leads may also designate some sessions as those that cannot be missed except under extreme circumstances because they cannot be made up. These sessions will be noted in the learning management system and should only be missed under extreme, unavoidable circumstances such as a medical illness or family emergency. Failure to attend a required learning activity without providing notification is considered an unprofessional behavior. Attendance data will be tracked longitudinally by OMSE within the learning management system for all phases of the curriculum. An absence will be recorded even when makeup work for a missed session is completed. Data will be monitored by the Director of Assessment in collaboration with OMSE and will be reviewed by the Competency Attainment Committee as evidence contributing to attainment of competency in PROF-2: Exhibit high standards of professional integrity. Guidelines Central monitoring of absences will reside with the Office of Medical Student Education and the Director of Assessment. A concerning trend of absences may be discussed with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Coaching and Student Success to ensure appropriate student support can be offered and provided. Faculty directors of required Phase 1 sessions will include a specific faculty contact in the learning management system associated with all required sessions. 362Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) The Washington University School of Medicine Phase I Attendance Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body on Feb. 19, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body . Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy Background The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), per element 12.4, expects that a medical school provides its medical students with timely access to needed diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic health services at sites in reasonable proximity to the locations of their required educational activities and has policies and procedures in place that permit students to be excused from educational activities to seek needed care. This LCME requirement is aligned with Washington University School of Medicine's (WUSM) dedication to providing access to support and high-quality care for the physical, emotional and mental well-being of its students. To achieve this, the Student Health Services team provides students at WUSM with efficient, accessible, high-quality care, without undue financial burden, in order to prevent and treat health problems that may interfere with a student's educational and professional goals while attending WUSM. The Student Health Services Office is located on the Medical School Campus and provides a full range of primary care medical, mental health, health promotion and wellness services. The staff consists of physicians, nurses, psychologists, and administrative support for those clinicians. Policies In order to access these health services, medical students will be excused from classes or clinical activities. The following procedures will be followed: A. Student responsibility 1.The student is responsible for notifying the office of the relevant director of the educational activity (e.g., the clerkship director) and, if applicable, the supervising clinician of their clinical team as soon as possible. This is for both routine preventative appointments and acute incidents. 2.For additional details regarding student responsibilities in the event of a planned or unplanned absence for students on clinical courses, please refer to the Absence Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations (p. 361). B. Responsibility of directors of required educational activities (e.g., the clerkship director)1.Directors will work with students to ensure that students can access healthcare services in a timely manner and as needed. 2.If a student encounters any barrier to timely access to necessary health services, they are to notify the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Ombuds. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will address the concern with the clinical or course director and take appropriate action. The Washington University School of Medicine Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education on March 2, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education. Leave of Absence (LOA) Policy Return of students from involuntary leave of absence requires clearance of both the director of Student Health Services and the associate dean for student affairs. I.Voluntary LOA: A student may request a leave of absence for academic or personal reasons by submitting a statement in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Such a statement should include indication of the beginning and anticipated ending dates and a brief statement of the reason (academic or personal). Requests for leaves of absence must be approved by the associate dean for student affairs. Leaves of absence shall be granted for no more than one year, but in unusual cases may be renewed by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) for additional time after discussion with the associate dean for student affairs. Students requiring a personal leave of absence for medical reasons must submit a supporting letter from the director of Student Health Services. A written statement of medical clearance will be required before the student may return from such a leave. II.Involuntary LOA: If there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities, the following procedures apply: A.The chancellor or his designate may impose an involuntary leave of absence when there is evidence that a student has committed an offense under these rules or the University's Judicial Code, and when there is evidence that the continued presence of the student on the university campus or as a participant in a clinical rotation poses a substantial threat to themselves, to patients, or to the rights of others to continue their normal university function and activities. 363Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) B.Imposition of the involuntary leave of absence may result in denial of access to the campus, prohibition of class attendance and/or prohibition of participation in clinical rotations. C.If an involuntary leave of absence is imposed, the suspending authority shall prepare a written notice of the imposition and shall have the notice mailed certified or personally presented to the student. The written notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons therefore and a brief statement of the procedures provided for resolving cases of involuntary leave of absence under these rules. D.The student shall be given an opportunity to appear personally before the suspending authority within five (5) business days from the date of service of the notice of imposition of the involuntary leave of absence. If the student asks to appear personally before the suspending authority, only the following issues shall be considered: 1.Whether the suspending authority's information concerning the student's conduct is reliable; and 2.Whether under all the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities. E.Within one week of the date of imposition of the involuntary leave of absence, the suspending authority shall either file a statement of charges against the student with the University Judicial Board, and shall have the statement or charges served, by mail or personal service, upon the student and the dean of the school or college or director of the program in which the student is enrolled, or initiate proceedings under these rules to convene a Disciplinary Committee. F.A temporary suspension shall end 1.when rescinded by the suspending authority, or 2.upon the failure of the suspending authority to promptly file a statement of charges with the University Judicial Board or a Disciplinary Committee, or 3.when the case is heard and decided by the University Judicial Board or the Disciplinary Committee. Return of students from involuntary leave of absence requires clearance of both the director of Student Health Services and the associate dean for student affairs. III.LOA Impact on Financial Aid: Students receiving financial aid should be advised that at the end of sixty (60) days or more leave of absence, the grace period for loan repayment during a leave of absence may be exhausted. In such cases there will be an obligation for the student to start payments. According to the federal rules under which loans are made,the use of a grace period during a leave of absence will generally mean that the schedule for loan repayment may be changed. Students who are receiving financial assistance should consult with the Financial Aid Office to determine the implications of a leave of absence for their financial aid. IV.LOA Impact on Tuition: A student returning from a leave of absence of one year duration or less will maintain the same tuition rate. Students returning after more than one year leave of absence will assume the tuition rate of the class they are rejoining. Appeals of this policy should be submitted in writing to the registrar. Please refer to the Financial Information (p. 392) section on Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal & Refunds Policy and the effect of a leave of absence on tuition and other financially related matters. For additional information please review the Student Information for Leave of Absence or Withdrawal (PDF) (http://bulletin.wustl.edu/medicine/policies/md-absences/ Leave_of_Absence_Withdrawal_Handout_2018.pdf). Policy on Student Status and Benefits During Research Years or Leave of Absence MD/PhD Student status is maintained while in the research phase of the MD/PhD programs. During research years, students are registered in either the graduate school or under the program granting the master's degree. Both student health and disability coverage are provided by the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences. Master's/MD Student status is maintained while in the research phase of the MSCI and MPHS programs. Both student health and disability coverage are provided. Five-Year MD Program Research Year at WUSM Student status is maintained throughout the approved research year. In exceptional circumstances, a second research year may be permitted. The student may receive a stipend, but may not be considered an employee of the university. Students are registered in the School of Medicine. Both disability and student health coverage are required and are payable by the student. Outside funding often covers such fees. 364Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Approved Research Year Away Student status is maintained throughout the approved research year. Students are registered in the School of Medicine. Both disability and student health coverage are optional with proof of like coverage. The cost of either elected coverage is payable by the student. Outside funding often allows these costs. Leave of Absence Leave of Absence Year at WUSM Student status is not maintained during the leave of absence though benefits of student health coverage and disability insurance are optional throughout an approved leave. Costs are payable by the MD program students. MD/PhD students may request support for these costs from the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences if funds are available. The Office of Financial Aid should be consulted for information regarding loan repayment and grace periods when on a leave of absence. Leave of Absence Year Away Student status is not maintained during the leave of absence away from Washington University School of Medicine. Both disability and student health coverage are optional with proof of like coverage. The cost of either elected coverage is payable by the student. MD: CAPES - Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism The policies and procedures listed below are adopted by the faculty and administration of the School of Medicine concerning review of student academic performance and professional integrity. Overall academic and professional evaluation of students at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will be made by the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES). The Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students operates under the Rules Governing Review of Student Performance. Please visit the CAPES (p. 365) section below for more information. Rules Governing Review of Student Performance Preface This document describes procedures adopted by the faculty and administration of the School of Medicine concerning review of student academic performance and professional integrity. Students are encouraged to read this information for a thorough understanding of the contents. Any questions arising from the procedures laid out herein should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs or the Office of the Registrar.Major revisions to this document will be approved by the Academic Affairs Committee. Questions about this document may be directed to: Lisa Moscoso, MD, PhD Associate Dean for Student Affairs Michael Donlan, PhD Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs, Registrar Updated Jan. 25, 2018 CAPES - Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students Purpose and Jurisdiction Students at the Washington University School of Medicine must demonstrate the ability to synthesize and apply knowledge and the capability of becoming a safe and effective physician. In addition, they must demonstrate the principles of professionalism including sound judgment, honesty, integrity, responsibility, a sensitivity and compassion for individual needs, and compliance with applicable laws, policies and regulations. Serious or repeated academic failures or breaches of these principles in professionalism will be referred to the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) for review. Throughout the enrollment of a student, it is within the jurisdiction of the CAPES to terminate the enrollment of a student who has demonstrated serious academic failure or a breach of professionalism. The deliberations of the CAPES are generally positive in approach and are committed to the ultimate aim of assisting students to successfully complete the courses of study required by the school. The principle that careful selection of students will minimize attrition from the school is strongly endorsed by the CAPES. The text contained herein outlines rules governing the review of student performance. For further information, refer to the Guiding Principles of Professionalism (p. 387) in the Policies section of this Bulletin. Responsibility of the Committee The ultimate responsibility of the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) is to assess whether each student meets the academic and ethical standards necessary to enter the profession of medicine. To accomplish this mission, CAPES undertakes the following tasks: Student Advancement: The CAPES annually recommends promotion of students who have successfully completed all requirements of the current academic year to the studies of the subsequent year. Degree Recommendations: The CAPES recommends to the Executive Faculty those students who have successfully completed all prescribed requirements of the school and are qualified to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree. 365Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Academic Remediation Reviews: When a student is in need of academic support services, the CAPES will recommend student status and remediation measures, which may include entry of a student into an Individualized Study Program. Disciplinary Action: The CAPES will review cases requiring disciplinary action due to unprofessional behavior or a breach of integrity. Students for Whom the Rules Apply All students engaged in preclinical and clinical education requirements for the MD degree Students in all years of the Five-Year MD program All students in joint and dual degree programs including but not limited to MD/MPH, MD/MSCI and MD/PhD (MSTP) programs taking preclinical or clinical portions of their MD education Joint or Dual Degree Students: When a student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is found in violation of the other program's academic or professional integrity policy or is found to have committed any disciplinary violations, including violations of the University Student Conduct Code, such matters may be brought to the attention of the CAPES for review and further action. Notwithstanding decisions made by the other schools or programs, the CAPES reserves the right to take further action when a student is found in violation of such policies. If a student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is not meeting academic performance expectations of the other program or school such that the student's status in that program or school may be impacted, the CAPES reserves the right to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to the student's status at WUSM. CAPES Membership Appointed and ex officio membership : Twelve voting faculty members of the CAPES are appointed for a four- year term by the dean of the School of Medicine following nomination by the department heads and/or associate deans. Faculty members may be reappointed to serve on the CAPES. Membership will include both clinical and preclinical department faculty. In addition, the CAPES membership will include, in ex officio capacity, the registrar (nonvoting) and the associate dean for student affairs (nonvoting). The senior associate dean, the associate deans for medical education, admissions and diversity programs, and the director of Student Health Services may attend the CAPES meetings as nonvoting participants. Chair: A faculty member will be appointed by the dean from within the CAPES committee to serve as chair. The term of the chair will be four years and may be reappointed. Guests:1.When the committee is addressing issues related to academic performance, a course director who is not a member of the CAPES but who submitted a Fail/ Incomplete grade for a student who is to be discussed at the meeting will be present at the meeting to provide information regarding the student's performance. A course director may send a designated representative or may submit information in writing. In the event that a course director or designated representative is not present or sufficient information has not been forwarded, final action for the student will be deferred until adequate information is available. 2.Similarly, when the committee is addressing issues of professionalism, the individual filing the professionalism concern form will be present for the meeting or in some instances may be allowed to submit information in writing. 3.Any faculty, administrator or staff may be invited at the discretion of the chair. Meeting Frequency and Quorum The CAPES meetings must occur in a timely manner after final examinations or re-examinations, as soon as practical after grades are submitted to the registrar. Generally grades will be submitted to the registrar within 10 days of completion of an examination. A meeting of the CAPES may also be convened at any time such that timely review of a matter is deemed necessary. Seven voting members must be present to consider academic or disciplinary actions. Grades Grade Scales Courses in the first- and second-year curriculum are evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Third- and fourth-year courses use a graded scale. Specific grades for each grade level are detailed in the Evaluation and Grades (p. 381) section of this Bulletin. Grade Submission Final grades will be submitted online within 10 business days of the final examination or final class meeting for the first two years. For the third and fourth years, grades are due within four weeks of the receipt of standardized examination scores or the last day of the rotation if no examination was given. Grade Appeals Students may appeal a grade with the course director by filing a grade appeal request form (https://registrar.med.wustl.edu/ resources/#Forms ). Grade appeals must be filed within 10 business days after the grade has been posted. 366Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) If reasons beyond the student's control delay the appeal past the July 15 deadline, the registrar must be notified so that the final transcripts, grade distributions and class rankings for the match process can be held pending resolution of the matter. If this notice is not received by the registrar prior to the deadline, the new grade cannot be accepted. Students participating in the residency match process should also notify the office of career counseling whenever a grade appeal is in process. After the course director considers any appeal, they will indicate the resolution for the appeal on the grade appeal form and forward it to the registrar and the associate dean for student affairs. No grade changes are permitted for the prior academic year after July 15. Grade Remediation The CAPES may invoke remediation requirements for individual courses that are different from those determined by the course director. In such cases, the CAPES determination will supersede that of the course director. The CAPES may also require the student to repeat a full academic year or portion thereof if it is judged necessary given the academic history. Occasionally, in order to remediate a failed course in the first or second year , students are permitted to complete equivalent course work at other institutions with the permission of the responsible department and written notification to the registrar. Grade Point Average, Ranking and Distribution The School of Medicine does not calculate grade point averages. Hours of credit appearing on the transcript reflect clock hours scheduled for the course or clinical rotation. For the purpose of residency applications only, students are placed in the upper, middle or lower third of the class according to a formula which considers weighting of courses in each academic year. This ranking is not recorded on the permanent academic record and does not appear on transcripts. It may appear in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation ( MSPE). At the conclusion of the academic year, when all the official grades have been received, the official transcript, in addition to listing courses and grades achieved, gives the grade distribution in each course with the exception of elective and selective courses. Please visit the Evaluation and Grades (p. 381) section of this Bulletin for more information.Academic Support and Accommodations Tutoring Students experiencing difficulty in any course may request tutorial assistance. Such requests should be initially directed toward the course director and thereafter to the associate dean for student affairs. Students who are repeating courses will be offered tutorial assistance, and the CAPES may also require it. There is no charge to the student for tutorial assistance. Individual Study Program Students who have difficulty handling the normal academic course load will enter an Individual Study Program (ISP) requiring five years to complete rather than four years. The intent of an ISP is to optimize the prospect that the student will successfully complete the curriculum. An ISP may be requested by the student or recommended or required by the committee. 1.ISP: Scope and Sequence The content and sequence of courses will be determined by the associate dean for student affairs with the input from the student, relevant course directors and the CAPES. The plan for execution of an ISP will be recorded in the student's file in the Registrar's Office and a copy will be provided to the student. 2.ISP: Examination Schedules Unless extenuating circumstances exist, ISP students are required to take the examinations for a particular course in their usual temporal relationship to the course work. Requests for exceptions should be recorded in the student's file in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Approval of such requests is considered according to the Washington University School of Medicine guidelines for exam administration ( p. 381) found in the Policies section of this Bulletin. 3.ISP: Single Fail or Incomplete Grade In the event that a single Fail or Incomplete grade is recorded for a student after entry into an ISP, the CAPES will again review the student's record. Consequences may include remediation, repeat of the course or dismissal from the school. 4.ISP: Grounds for Dismissal Students on an ISP who have not successfully completed and received a grade of Pass or above in all required courses of the first- and second-year curricula by the start of the second six-week period in the year of the clinical clerkship may be dismissed from the school. 367Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Accommodations It is the responsibility of students to alert the CAPES regarding personal concerns, health problems, or any other factors that may be adversely affecting their academic performance, and to bring such matters to the attention of the director of Student Health Services or the associate dean for student affairs for possible accommodations (p. 358). Indications for Review of Academic Performance \"Indications for Review of Academic Performance\" refers to the guidelines used at the school in the event a student either fails exams or a course or fails to complete a course in the requisite time. In general, the school guidelines for the \"Indications for Review of Academic Performance\" are as follows: Exam Failure Exam failures can warrant meeting with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) and/or lead to referral to the CAPES. Consult the conditions below for further details relevant to each student-year level. Single Course Failure - Meeting with the ADSA In the event of any initial failure of a course the student will meet with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) to formulate a remediation plan in coordination with the course director. Multiple Course Failures - Referral to the CAPES Two or more courses in one year If either a failing or incomplete grade in two or more courses occurs in a single year, the student's academic performance will be referred to the CAPES for review and determination of a course of action. Three courses (cumulatively across multiple years) If either a failing or incomplete grade in three courses occurs across multiple years, the student's academic performance will be referred to the CAPES for review and determination of a course of action. Individualized Study Program (ISP) Refer to the ISP section (p. 367) within this CAPES policy for full details on guidelines pertaining to the review of students engaged in an ISP. Time Constraints Three-year rule:No student may take more than three years to complete the course work required for the first two years of study. Time periods included in an approved leave of absence are not counted in these three years. Two-year rule: In the absence of extenuating circumstances or an approved leave of absence, no student may take more than two academic years to complete the course work required in any individual curricular year. Time periods included in an approved leave of absence are not counted in these two years. Maximum Attempts at Passing a Course Students have a maximum number of three attempts to pass any individual course during enrollment in the school. Joint or Dual Degree Program Students If a medical student enrolled in a joint or dual degree program is not making satisfactory academic progress or is not meeting academic performance expectations of the other program or school such that the student's status in that school or program may be impacted, the CAPES reserves the right to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to the student's status within the School of Medicine. Further details pertaining to joint or dual degree program students are listed in the section describing students for whom the rules governing student performance apply. Note: Specific conditions warranting review of academic performance are detailed below for each student-year level. Conditions for review of student performance due to professionalism issues are found in the policy section regarding professionalism. First-Year Students - Indications for Review of Academic Performance All first-year courses must be completed before the start of the second-year curriculum. Failure to meet this requirement typically means one of the following conditions has occurred: Failure of a Single Exam (for First-Year Medical Students) Failure of a single exam is not an immediate indication for review of academic performance by the CAPES. However, failure of a single exam that comprises a significant portion of the final grade (typically 20% or more) must be reported by the course director to the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA). The course director may allow one attempt at remediation of the exam at a time the course director prescribes. The scheduling of the remedial exam will be agreed upon by the course director and the student, but it should generally not extend beyond 30 days after the end of the course. Days of recess for winter and spring break will not be counted in the 30 days. A grade of \"E\" (i.e., temporary grade signifying the pending make-up of a failed exam) will be submitted by the course director if the remedial 368Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) exam is not accomplished within the course dates. This grade will stand on the academic record until it is replaced with a valid final grade of Pass or Fail. Grades of \"E\" that are not resolved within 30 days will be replaced with a grade of Fail (F). In rare circumstances, the ADSA may approve an extension of this deadline. If the student successfully remediates the exam, and has otherwise passed the course, a Pass (P) will be recorded by the registrar. A student may remediate only one examination in any course. Failure of Two or More Exams The ADSA may request that the CAPES reviews performance of a student who has failed two or more examinations. In such cases, the CAPES will recommend a course of action. Failure of a Course If a student receives a Fail/Incomplete grade in a single first- year course, the ADSA will meet with the student to formulate a remediation plan in coordination with the course director. The remediation plan may include the following options: Take a re-examination as approved by the course director. Enroll in and successfully complete, at the level designated by the course director, a summer course at a different institution, such a course being completed and passed by the beginning of the second year. If a student fails to successfully complete an approved summer course or fails the re-examination taken to remediate a failed course, they will be referred to the CAPES for review and recommended course of action. The CAPES may require the student to enter an ISP or be dismissed from the school. The CAPES may permit a second re-examination. If the second re- examination is failed, the student will be dismissed from the school. Failure of Two or More Courses A student for whom the registrar has recorded a Fail/Incomplete grade in two or more courses during the first year will be referred to the CAPES for determination of a course of action. The committee may decide to permit the student to take re- examinations, if a re-examination has not already been taken. Such re-examinations will generally occur during the inter- academic year break. If a re-examination is failed the student may be required to enter an ISP or be dismissed from the school. Second-Year Students - Indications for Review of Academic Performance Students in their second year will be referred to either the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) or the CAPES for review and resolution of a recommended course of action when any one of the following conditions has occurred:Conditions for Meeting with the ADSA for Second-Year Students Failure of a single interval exam within a year-long course or failure of one block-long course (for Second-Year Students): An initial failure of a single exam does not signal an automatic referral to the CAPES. A second-year student who receives a final grade of Fail or Incomplete in a single interval exam in a year-long course will first meet with the ADSA. A second-year student receiving a failing/incomplete grade in one block-long course must first meet with the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA). Re-examination Scheduling and Resolution Re-examinations for year-long courses will generally be offered during the inter-academic year break, prior to entry into the third year. Re-examinations for individual block-long courses will generally be offered at a time determined by the course director and the ADSA. All such re-exams must be offered to students and completed prior to the start of the next academic year. Students failing the re-examination of a single block-long course (or failing a re-examination of a single year-long course) will be referred to the CAPES to determine a course of action. If the examination is failed for a third time, enrollment will be terminated. Deferral of Clinical Rotation Start Date The CAPES may allow the student to defer beginning the clinical rotations so that re-examinations may be taken up to six weeks after the beginning of the usual cycle of clinical clerkships. Such extra time used for study and preparation will ordinarily mean that the student will not have the usual unscheduled time in the elective year. Note: No student is permitted to begin Clinical Rotations of the Third Year until all first- and second-year courses have been successfully completed. If Re-examinations Are Not Allowed ISP: In the event that the CAPES decides to not permit re- examination, an ISP may be recommended. Dismissal/Termination: The CAPES has the option to recommend any such student be dismissed. Conditions for Referral to the CAPES for Second-Year Students Second-year students will be referred to the CAPES for review and resolution under any of the following categories: 369Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) 1.Failure of an interval exam in one year-long course and one block-long course 2.Failure of two interval exams in year-long courses 3.Failure or Incomplete recorded in any re-examination 4.Failure or Incomplete grade in one year-long course 5.Failure or Incomplete grades in two or more block-long courses Remediation for Second-Year Students Reviewed by the CAPES Re-examinations allowed: The committee may permit the student to take re-examinations in the courses for which a Fail or Incomplete has been recorded (provided that a re-examination has not already been taken for a given course). Such re-exams will generally occur during the inter-academic year break. Note: In the event that a Fail/ Incomplete grade is recorded after a re-examination, the CAPES may require that a student enter an ISP or that enrollment in the School of Medicine be terminated. The CAPES may decide that a second re-examination may be offered. Cumulative Academic Review (at End of Second Year) Prior to promotion to the clerkship year, the CAPES will review the cumulative academic record of each student brought forth by the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) to determine whether the student's academic performance justifies advancement to the clinical phase of the medical education without warning. Typically, multiple remediated examinations and/or failing grades during the first two years of the curriculum will raise concerns about the student's knowledge and readiness to participate in clinical care of patients. Students with overall records indicating globally poor performance may have one of the following actions taken upon them with written notification: Required to repeat specific preclinical course work Advancement to Clinical Year with Academic Warning, with a required meeting with the ADSA in order to - Review and pursue available resources for academic intervention Review and plan an effective clerkship schedule to consider schedule changes helping to facilitate successful clinical experiences Recommend students seek tutorial assistance through each clerkship director and address any additional or unique circumstances Probation - Contingencies for continued enrollment on probationary status and for return to good standing will be specified by the CAPES.Dismissal - Globally poor performance may be deemed grounds for dismissal by the CAPES. In addition, a third-year student who is advanced with academic warning and then fails any component of a clinical clerkship may be dismissed from the school. Indications for Review of Academic Performance for Third and Subsequent Years Failure of any core clinical rotation without successful remediation will prevent proper advancement toward the student's degree and may result in significant consequences for career planning. For these reasons, the following list itemizes the conditions under which the CAPES committee will convene. Failure of One Course Required for Third or Subsequent Years The ADSA will meet with any student for whom a single Fail/ Incomplete/E grade has been recorded for a course beyond the second year of the MD curriculum. Discussion will include the requirements stipulated by the relevant course director in order to remediate the academic encumbrance. Options will generally include a re-examination or the repeating of all or a portion of the course. If a single failing grade for a clerkship course or elective has been recorded, the student may be referred to the CAPES for review and course of action. If a Fail grade has been entered following the prescribed remediation, the student will always be referred to the CAPES to determine a course of action . When such a student is referred to the CAPES, the committee may permit a re-examination or retaking/ repeating of all or any portion of the course. If the course is failed a third time, the student will be dismissed from school. Failure of any Component of a Clerkship while on Academic Warning A student who advances to the clinical years under academic warning, and who fails any component of a clerkship will be referred to the CAPES for action including possible dismissal from the school. If Poor Academic Performance is Reported for Two or More Courses The ADSA may request that the CAPES review performance of a student who has been reported as having demonstrated poor academic performance in two or more courses at interval evaluations conducted throughout the courses. In such instances, the CAPES may determine a course of action. 370Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Failure of Two or More NBME Subject/Shelf Examinations Any student who fails to achieve a passing grade on any two or more NBME subject/shelf examinations conducted as part of any clerkship evaluation will be referred to the CAPES for review and course of action. Note: A passing grade for any subject/shelf examination is defined as any score greater than or equal to the 10th percentile as reported by the NBME. Recording of Failed Grades, Remediation, Re-examinations, Repercussions, or Dismissal (for Students in their Third Year and Beyond ) A student who fails any clinical component of a clerkship or elective will have a Fail grade recorded on the permanent academic record. At the discretion of the course director or the CAPES, the student must repeat either the portion failed or the entire clerkship or elective in order to remove the academic degree encumbrance. The failing grade will, however, remain visible on the permanent academic record. Any new passing grade for any such remediated course will display on the transcript; thus, both the original failing grade and the newly recorded grade for the course will be visible on the permanent academic record. In addition, a failing grade for clinical clerkships will be officially recorded onto the permanent academic record whenever a student fails the subject/shelf examination for the second time. A failing grade is defined as a score of less than the 10th percentile as reported by the NBME. For students referred to the CAPES for failed/incomplete grades, the committee may endorse or amend the remediation recommendations of the corresponding course director(s). In the event a student fails a course remediation defined by the course director and approved by the CAPES, the CAPES may require that the clerkship rotation be repeated or that enrollment of the student in the school be terminated. Students will generally be permitted three attempts to achieve a passing grade in any clerkship course. If three failing NBME subject examination grades or final clerkship grades have been submitted for a course, the student will be dismissed from the school. Procedures Concerning Review of Academic Performance A. Convening a Meeting Actions for Academic Review of students shall be referred to the CAPES for consideration by way of the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA) or registrar. The ADSA will convene a meeting of the CAPES, notifying the student in writing regarding the reason for the review and the date, time, and place of the meeting. A meeting of the CAPES may be convened at any time when a timely review of an issue is deemed necessary.B. Attendees The associate dean for student affairs, the registrar, and the course director(s) or their designated representatives shall present the matter to the CAPES in a closed and confidential CAPES meeting. C. Student Responsibility All students will be asked to be available to appear before the committee to provide additional information relevant to the concern. If the student fails to be available to appear at the meeting, the committee may postpone the meeting or may conduct the meeting and impose sanctions without the student present. Failure of a student to appear or provide information requested by the CAPES may result in the committee's filing a professionalism concern form. Meetings may be rescheduled at the discretion of the CAPES chair. It is the responsibility of the student to alert the CAPES of any extenuating circumstances or contributing factors that should be considered regarding the student's status. The student shall be permitted, upon request in advance of the CAPES meeting, to appear before the CAPES on their own behalf. At the student's request, they may be accompanied by a member of the faculty, staff or fellow student of the school. D. Student Record Considered A student's entire academic and professionalism record will be considered in deliberations regarding student status. E. Meeting Minutes A record of the CAPES meeting shall be preserved and will be available for review by the School of Medicine's Appeals Committee, as necessary. F. Outcomes Possible Actions taken by the CAPES may include but are not limited to dismissal, suspension, probation, defined penalty, advancement with academic warning, remediation, and/or additional oversight. The CAPES may also rule that the MSPE/Dean's Letter should include a citation regarding the matter. The CAPES decision shall be made by simple majority unless the vote is for dismissal which requires a three-fourths majority. G. Notifying Students of Final Committee Decisions The associate dean for student affairs will inform the student verbally of the decision of the CAPES. The registrar will inform the student in writing within 10 business days. 371Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Indications for Review of Professional Integrity Matters involving a possible breach of professional integrity shall be brought to the attention of the associate dean for student affairs. The individual(s) raising the questions of possible misconduct shall present a Professionalism Concern Form (https://registrar.med.wustl.edu/resources/#Forms ) providing detailed written information as necessary. Individuals submitting such forms are reminded of the need for complete confidentiality regarding all matters of conduct. Behaviors inappropriate to the medical profession shall include but are not limited to: cheating or unauthorized use of materials during examinations abuse misrepresentations other seriously improper conduct in relation to patients or colleagues breach of confidentiality and trust misconduct in violation of university policies violation of the University Student Conduct Code illegalities substance abuse failure of judgment including that related to noncompliance in the treatment of any personal medical condition misrepresentation or failure in personal actions or meeting obligations any combination of the above items, and others which might raise serious unresolved doubts about the integrity of the student with regards to entering the practice of medicine For more information, consult the Guiding Principles of Professionalism (p. 387) under the Policies section of this Bulletin. Procedures Concerning Review of Professional Integrity At the discretion of the associate dean for student affairs, in cases of serious or repeated breaches of professional integrity, the associate dean for student affairs will convene a meeting with the associate dean for admissions, the associate dean for medical student education, or the senior associate dean for medical education to review the complaint(s) and to decide whether further action is necessary. If further inquiry is deemed necessary, the associate dean for student affairs and either the associate dean for medical student education, the associate dean for admissions, or the senior associate dean for medical education will discuss the complaint with the student. If the two associate deans deem that further action is warranted, the following procedure will occur:A. Convening of Meeting The associate dean for student affairs will convene a meeting of the CAPES. Whenever possible, the CAPES shall convene within two weeks after the initial meeting between the student and the associate dean for student affairs. If the person bringing the complaint is a member of the CAPES, they will not vote but may participate in the discussion. If the person bringing the complaint is not a member of the CAPES, they will be asked to present the complaint and will then be excused. The CAPES chairperson will oversee the procedures of the meeting. The registrar will record the minutes. B. Gathering of Pertinent Information and Meeting Attendees Prior to the meeting, the associate dean for student affairs will forward information concerning the matter to the committee. In addition the associate dean for student affairs will inform the student in writing regarding the time, date and place of the meeting. A copy of the complaint will be provided to the student. The notification shall state that the proceedings are confidential. The student may bring a faculty member, staff member or fellow student for guidance and support. If this person is not a fact witness to the complaint, they may not address the committee. C. Student Responsibility Any student to be considered at a CAPES meeting will be asked to be available to appear before the committee to provide additional information relevant to the concern. If the student fails to be available for the meeting, the committee may postpone the meeting or may conduct the meeting and impose sanctions without the student present. Failure of a student to appear or provide information requested by the CAPES may result in the committee's drawing adverse conclusions. Meetings may be rescheduled at the discretion of the CAPES chair. D. Student Record and Pertinent Documentation/Materials The CAPES will consider evidence which tends to prove or disprove the alleged conduct. If the CAPES finds that the student engaged in misconduct, it may consider additional evidence of prior conduct, evidence as to the charged student's character, the student's entire academic and disciplinary record, or any other evidence which would assist the CAPES in determining appropriate action. The chair of the CAPES will rule on whether or not evidence or testimony will be considered. The CAPES has neither the advantages nor limitations inherent in a court of law. During the meeting the student will have access to the written evidence presented and may present evidence and fact witnesses on their own behalf. The student should be prepared to discuss the circumstances of the complaint after which the CAPES will excuse the student from the room. 372Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) E. Objective Approach By Committee The purpose of the CAPES meeting is to provide fair and prompt review of the inquiry. The committee is not positioned in an adversarial role against the student, but simply serves to review the evidence as presented and determine a decision regarding disciplinary action if necessary. The decision as to whether the student committed the alleged act will be made solely on the basis of evidence and testimony presented at the meeting. Innocence of the student will be presumed. A CAPES member must find in favor of the student unless the member is persuaded that it is more likely than not that the student engaged in the alleged misconduct. F. Outcomes Possible Actions taken by the CAPES may include but are not limited to dismissal, suspension, probation, defined penalty, fine and restitution, advancement with academic warning, remediation and/or additional oversight. Contingencies for continued enrollment on probationary status and for return to good standing will be specified by the CAPES in each individual case. The CAPES may also rule that the MSPE/Dean's Letter should include a citation regarding the matter. The CAPES decision shall be made by simple majority unless the vote is for dismissal which requires a three-fourths majority. G. Notifying Student of Committee Decisions The associate dean for student affairs will inform the student verbally of the decision of the CAPES. The registrar will inform the student in writing within 10 business days. H. Meeting Minutes and Confidentiality The record of such proceedings will be held confidentially with access restricted to committee members, the student involved and relevant members of the administration. I. Disclaimers The university does not tolerate retaliation against individuals who bring forward complaints or who participate in the CAPES process. Unless determined by the associate dean for student affairs that extraordinary circumstances exist, the student will be permitted to continue in the usual academic activities during CAPES proceedings. However, if there is a reasonable basis for believing that the continued presence of the student on campus or in clinical rotations poses a substantial threat to the student, to patients, or to the rights of others to engage in their normal university functions and activities, the procedure outlined under the school's Leave of Absence Policy (p. 361) will apply.J. Both Academic Performance and Professionalism Concerns Exist Should a student be referred to the CAPES for an issue involving both academic performance and professionalism concerns, the procedures for Professionalism Concerns will be followed. Appeals Process The School of Medicine has the right and responsibility to assure that each student, during the time of enrollment, demonstrates levels of academic achievement and ethical stature appropriate to the practice of medicine. The school must also ensure provision of fairness in discharging those rights and responsibilities. As such, an appeals process is in place as outlined below: A. Request for an Appeal Within 14 working days of the date on which an academic or disciplinary decision is rendered by the CAPES, the student may request in writing to the registrar, that the School of Medicine's Appeals Committee review the record of the CAPES decision to determine that the appropriate CAPES procedures were followed or that the Appeals Committee requests that the CAPES consider additional, new relevant information which was not previously presented to the CAPES for good cause. The letter to the registrar should include the basis for appeal as well as any new relevant information and an explanation as to why it was not timely presented to the CAPES. B. Establishing an Appeals Committee An Appeals Committee, composed of faculty members appointed by the dean of the School of Medicine, shall be created to review appeal of decisions by the CAPES. Members of the CAPES may not be appointed to the Appeals Committee. A quorum of this committee shall consist of five members. C. Review by the Appeals Committee The Appeals Committee shall review the record of the CAPES decision solely to determine whether the pertinent CAPES procedures were followed and whether all relevant information was considered by the CAPES. If the appeal is based on a contention that all relevant information was not presented to the CAPES, the written appeal must provide the Appeals Committee with adequate reason why the student did not present this information at the CAPES meeting in question. In all cases, the Appeals Committee shall not substitute its judgment of the facts or its opinions of the merit of the matter for those of the CAPES. 373Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) D. Appeals Committee Decision Types 1.Remand the case to the CAPES The Appeals Committee may decide to remand the matter to the CAPES for reconsideration with its explanation for the remand. If the matter is remanded to the CAPES, all documents, minutes of the Appeals Committee meeting, and information submitted by or for the student in support of the appeal will be made available to the CAPES. 2.Denial The Appeals Committee may decide to deny the appeal. E. Decision Notification to the Student The Appeals Committee shall provide its decision in writing to the student, the dean of the School of Medicine, the associate dean for student affairs and the registrar. The associate dean for student affairs shall determine whether the student may continue their curriculum pending the Appeals Committee review of a CAPES decision. F. Student Appeal to the Dean Within 10 business days of the date of an Appeals Committee decision, the student may request in writing that the dean of the School of Medicine review the decision of the Appeals Committee. The decision of the dean of the School of Medicine shall be final. Glossary The following definitions are applied when the indicated terms are used in relation to the foregoing rules concerning review of academic performance and professional integrity: Academic Warning, Advancement with A supervised status that may be imposed if a student's cumulative academic review indicates that special oversight is warranted. Refer to the sections on Cumulative Academic Review and Academic Warning for additional information. Action, Disciplinary An action, including counseling and penalties, taken by the School of Medicine, after consideration of the disciplinary problem. Administrative Withdrawal Termination of a student's enrollment from or eligibility to return to the School of Medicine by the university where the student has: A. failed to register and has not sought a leave of absence; or B. not returned from an approved leave of absence within the designated period of time and where an extension of the leave of absence has not been timely requested and approved by the CAPES.Dismissal, Academic Involuntary separation of a student from the School of Medicine because they have not met the academic requirements. Dismissal, Disciplinary Involuntary separation of a student from the School of Medicine as a result of action taken because of misconduct. Good Standing As a record or transcript notation, it signifies that the student is eligible to continue, to return, or to transfer elsewhere. It implies good academic standing as well as good citizenship and replaces such terms previously used as honorable dismissal, honorable withdrawal, withdrawn, voluntary withdrawal, eligible to return and clear record. Grade, Incomplete Indicates there is still a possibility of credit after further work. Used when the instructor is not prepared to give a final mark for the term in view either of sickness of the student or some justifiable delay in the completion of certain work. It is accompanied by a note that explains the circumstances and indicates how and when the incomplete may be resolved. A definitive mark for the term is recorded on the official transcript when the work is completed and the incomplete grade is removed. In case the work is not completed within the time allowed, the recorded grade will be changed to fail. Permanent Academic Record The all-inclusive abstract of academic achievement. This is also commonly referred to as the official educational record or official transcript. Probation Probation status may be for academic and for disciplinary reasons. Academic probation is the result of unsatisfactory scholarship. It is not a penalty but a warning and provides an opportunity to improve. Usually the student is required to make regular specified improvement in his record in order to avoid dismissal. Disciplinary probation is the middle status between good standing and suspension or dismissal. The student remains enrolled but under stated conditions according to school policies. Disciplinary probation covers a stated trial period during which it is determined whether the student is returned to good standing having met the stated requirements or dismissed from enrollment at the end of the period for failure to meet the stated requirements. Professionalism Concern Form 374Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) A form completed by a member of the university community to communicate an instance of unprofessional behavior to the associate dean for student affairs. Serious or repeated instances of unprofessional behavior may be referred to the CAPES by the associate dean for student affairs. Suspension Suspension is an involuntary separation of the student from the school but it differs from dismissal from enrollment in that it implies and states a time limit when return will be possible. Thus, suspension may extend for a specified time, until a specified date or until a stated condition is met. Withdrawal A release from enrollment. A student may request that they be allowed to withdraw from enrollment. Such requests are directed to the registrar or the associate dean for student affairs. When a student has requested withdrawal status, the school, by action of the CAPES, will determine whether the withdrawal will be annotated with good standing or not in good standing in the official academic record. Such annotations may be accompanied by explanations in the official educational record.

CAPES Booklet A booklet of this information (PDF) (http://bulletin.wustl.edu/ medicine/policies/md-assessment/CAPES_Booklet.pdf) that includes a table of contents and an index is also available.MD: Clinical Supervision Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations Background Part of Washington University School of Medicine's mission is to develop and maintain excellent clinical programs to provide outstanding care. To fulfill this mission as an academic teaching hospital, we have created this clinical supervision policy to direct our clinical health care teams with the oversight of our medical students. LCME Standards 9.2 and 9.3 require that a medical school ensure members of the school's faculty provide supervision of medical student learning experiences throughout required clerkships. Furthermore, we must ensure that medical students in clinical learning situations involving patient care are appropriately supervised at all times to ensure patient and student safety. We must also ensure that the level of responsibility delegated to the student is appropriate to their level of training and that the activities supervised are within the scope of practice of the supervising health professional. For the purposes of this policy, the following definitions will be used. Direct supervision will mean that the supervising physician is physically present (or continually on virtual telehealth visits) with the student and the patient. Indirect supervision will mean that the supervising physician is not physically (or continually on virtual telehealth visits) present with the student and the patient but is immediately available to provide direct supervision (or to join the telehealth visit) upon request, thus requiring that the supervising physician remain physically present within the hospital or other site of patient care. The supervising physician may include any member of the physician healthcare team, including residents, fellows, and attending physicians. There are also some situations in which it is appropriate that direct supervision be provided by a nurse or other healthcare provider, so long as the specific clinical activity falls within their scope of practice as specified below. Policies Supervision of medical student learning experiences involving patient care is provided on clerkships and other clinical courses by members of the school's faculty. Faculty oversee the clinical curriculum by setting expectations for appropriate physician healthcare team members about the level of student supervision required with patient care activities and the level of responsibility delegated to the student. Course directors are responsible for communicating supervision requirements according to a student's level of training to members of the 375Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) physician healthcare team. These teams are made aware of student clinical expectations, the level of student supervision, and the level of responsibility given to a student according to the student's level of training. Supervision will need to be defined by the clinical environment and patient care activity. Below are several examples of types of patient care activities. Physical Exam Students will be equipped with the basic skills necessary to perform general physical exam techniques commensurate with their level of training as they enter the clinical training environment. At the discretion of the physician healthcare team and in accordance with course-specific guidelines, students are able to perform general physical exam techniques under indirect supervision, excluding techniques defined as \"sensitive.\" Some physical exam skills are considered sensitive and will always need to be performed under the direct observation of a chaperone who is the same gender as the patient, even if the physician healthcare team determines that the student is capable of performing these exams under indirect supervision. These include \u2014 but are not restricted to \u2014 external genitalia exam on any patient, rectal exam on any patient, and breast exam on any person identifying as female. Infant external genital exams can be performed under indirect supervision without a chaperone at the discretion of the supervising physician. Pelvic examinations must always be performed under the direct supervision of a member of the physician healthcare team. Please refer to the \"Patient's Rights\" policy for additional information regarding pelvic bimanual exams performed when the patient is under anesthesia. Procedures Students may not perform procedures without direct supervision by a member of the physician healthcare team or another health professional so long as the procedure is within that professional's scope of practice (e.g., a nurse supervising a venipuncture). If any member of the physician healthcare team has concerns about violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy, they are to contact the course director for immediate investigation of the situation. The course director is responsible for notifying the Office of Medical Student Education of any suspected violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy. Students will not be down- graded or in any other way penalized for reporting concerns about suspected violations of the Clinical Supervision Policy.Guidelines If a student has concerns about a lack of clinical supervision, they are encouraged to discuss this with either the course director or the Office of Medical Student Education. If the issue is not resolved to satisfaction, the student can then approach the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, the Senior Associate Dean for Education, or the Office of the Ombuds for WUSM. The Washington University School of Medicine Clinical Supervision Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Rotations was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on June 11, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Continuous Quality Improvement Background The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), per element 1.1, expects that a medical school engages in ongoing planning and continuous quality improvement processes that establish short- and long-term programmatic goals, that result in the achievement of measurable outcomes that are used to improve programmatic quality, and that ensure effective monitoring of the medical education program's compliance with accreditation standards. Continuous quality improvement is designed to create a seamless system for monitoring and improving medical school programs and should be transparent to all relevant stakeholders. Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to exceeding these standards. Policies/Requirement A. Monitoring of accreditation standards will be led by the Program Evaluation and Continuous Quality Improvement (PE/ CQI) unit in collaboration with appropriate person(s), unit(s) and/ or department(s). The following process will take place annually or more frequently as needed: 1.The data collection instrument element requirements will be sent to the responsible person(s), unit(s) or department(s) who will be asked to review, edit, add and/or remove information that fulfills the required response. The information will be organized and tracked by the PE/CQI unit using various software and project management tools. 2.The PE/CQI unit will review the submitted information to assess whether the information fulfills LCME and institutional requirements based on research, benchmarking, Secretariat calls, annual internal surveys and Association of American Medical Colleges survey data. 376Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) 3.For areas in which WUSM is not meeting expected metrics (as created and vetted with WUSM stakeholders) or when new requirements emerge, a plan of action will be defined including responsible person(s), resources needed, timeline for completion and evidence of improvement. 4.Results of the improvement plan will be shared with appropriate individuals, administration, and committees such as the Committee on Oversight of Medical Student Education. 5.The PE/CQI unit will continually monitor the success of the implemented plan to determine if additional improvement is required. 6.If conditions of improvement are not met, the concern will be brought to the attention of the Senior Associate Dean for Education for further action. B. For areas not specifically required by the LCME or the data collection instrument, the PE/CQI unit will use a similar process as outlined above. The Continuous Quality Improvement Policy was approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on May 30, 2019. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Monitoring of Student Time Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to providing our students with an excellent education that is balanced with the need for learners to have sufficient time for self-directed learning and overall well-being. In keeping with Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) standard 8.8, WUSM is responsible for monitoring the amount of time medical students spend in required learning activities in the Gateway Curriculum. This monitoring includes the total number of hours medical students are required to spend in clinical and educational activities during clerkships, the latter being accounted for in WUSM's Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations (p. 380). For the purposes of this policy, required learning activities include clinical duty hours, all scheduled didactic activities, required preparatory work for didactic activities, scheduled clinical skills exercises, required community engagement, required coaching sessions, and summative assessments during Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum.Policies Please see WUSM's Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations (p. 380 ) for policies and guidelines regarding the monitoring of student time on clinical courses within the legacy curriculum of WUSM. All students will be excused from required learning activities during all official Washington University holidays. All students will also be excused to access health services as described in WUSM's Medical Student Access to Healthcare Services Policy (p. 363). Time spent on all required learning activities will be accounted for in the learning management system of WUSM. All students spend no more than 35 hours per week on all required learning activities, including required preparatory work for said learning activities, while enrolled in any of the nonclinical courses of Phase 1 of the Gateway Curriculum. Students are to spend no more than 50 hours per week on all required learning activities during their enrollment in the Clinical Immersions of Phase 1, inclusive of clinical experiences, course- specific classroom-based activities, coaching and online work. Student workload during required courses of the Gateway Curriculum will be monitored by the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE) for each Phase 1 course through canvasing of the learning management system and through internal and external surveys of students. In the event that there are concerns regarding the adherence of a course to the WUSM Policy for Monitoring Student Time, data substantiating said concerns will be presented by OMSE to the appropriate course lead. If not corrected, information will be sent forth to the appropriate governance structure for evaluation, monitoring and change management. The Committee on Oversight of Medical Student Education and any relevant subcommittees will charge the appropriate individuals or offices with improvement plans as indicated. Guidelines The above restrictions on student workload represent the upper limits of time that students can spend on required learning activities. Course directors are also welcome to utilize less time per week, as appropriate. All course directors are encouraged to proactively communicate to students the expectations for required preparatory time for all learning activities (including immersions). These expectations can be informed through the use of course workload estimators. To ensure that the time devoted to scheduled instructional activities is accurately reflected in course plans, course directors are encouraged to use best practices, applicable Academy of Educator workshops, and/or consultation with the Instructional Design Studio. 377Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Course directors are strongly encouraged to be considerate of the periodic need for breaks during scheduled required learning activities. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Monitoring Student Time was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body on Jan. 4, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education governing body . MD: Medical Student Mistreatment Reporting and Monitoring Policy I. Student Mistreatment Definition As explained in our Abusive Conduct (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/ abusive-conduct-policy/ ) and Discrimination and Harassment (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment-policy/ ) policies, the School of Medicine is committed to maintaining an environment free from behavior that is abusive, discriminatory, or harassing or that involves the mistreatment of students or others in the learning and working environment. For definitions and examples of conduct that would be considered mistreatment prohibited by the university, please refer to these policies. This document identifies the mechanisms and protocols for students to report mistreatment against them or for other individuals to report student mistreatment they have observed. This document also outlines the systems in place aimed at monitoring, addressing, and preventing the mistreatment of students in the learning environment. II. Steps for Reporting Student Mistreatment The School of Medicine strongly encourages students who feel they have experienced mistreatment \u2014 and those who feel they have witnessed mistreatment of a student \u2014 to report it immediately, without fear of retaliation, using the following resources: 1.WashU Confidential Concern Reporting Portal Students and other community members may submit a report through the WashU Confidential Concern Portal (https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/ gui/57349/ ). Washington University Human Resources receives all reports and will direct these reports to appropriate university or hospital administrators for a prompt response. The reporting portal allows for individuals to submit concerns anonymously, if preferred, and it allows for bidirectional communication through the portal via a password, even if the report is submitted anonymously. 2.Any of the following deans:Senior Associate Dean for Education (https:// education.med.wustl.edu/about/leadership-team/ ) Associate Dean for Student Affairs (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/office-of- Dean for Medical Student Education (https:// md.wustl.edu/resources/offices-and-contacts/medical- student-education/ ) Confidentiality and Anonymous Reporting When receiving a confidential report, the university will strive to protect, to the greatest extent feasible, the confidentiality of persons reporting mistreatment and of those accused of mistreatment. Because of legal obligations, the university cannot guarantee complete confidentiality where it would conflict with the university's obligation to investigate meaningfully or, where warranted, to take corrective action. For example, if a report identifies conduct that would fall within Title IX (https:// hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment-policy/ ), the university may have an obligation to investigate and take further action that requires disclosure of all or part of the information contained in the report to the person accused as well as to appropriate administrators. In addition, if a report identifies conduct that poses a significant threat to the health or safety of an individual, the university may also need to investigate and take further action that requires the disclosure of information contained in the report. Even when some disclosure of the university's information or sources is necessary, it will be limited to the extent possible. The university will keep confidential all records of complaints, responses, and investigations to the extent permitted by law. Anonymous reports may be submitted through the reporting portal. If a reporter wishes to remain anonymous, the university may be limited in its ability to respond and take action with respect to the report. III. Options for Possible Resolution Students who believe they have been subjected to mistreatment or other reporters who believe they have witnessed student mistreatment have several options available if they wish to seek resolution of a situation. At any time, they may consult with a Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator (see below), whose responsibilities include assisting students, faculty, and staff with questions regarding university policies and options for addressing concerns about mistreatment. If a student or reporter feels comfortable dealing with the situation without assistance, they can communicate either orally or in writing with the person whose behavior is of concern. The most useful communication clearly describes the conduct of 378Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) concern as well as its impact on the student and a request that the behavior should stop. Frequently, such a communication will cause the behavior to stop, particularly when the person may not be aware of its impact. If a student or reporter would like to discuss a situation and possible options for resolution with the assistance of someone else, they may also consider the following: (1) asking a trained WUSM SAFE (Supporting A Fair Environment) Committee member to meet with them or to speak to the person whose behavior is of concern; or (2) consulting with one of the advisers listed below about other potential options to remedy the situation. As previously mentioned, these individuals may be obligated to report the incident or conduct disclosed to the university for further review (e.g., sexual assault or harassment, threat of harm to self or others). Students may also initiate a more formal complaint process, which could involve a committee hearing, by contacting a Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator. If it has not already done so, the university will initiate an investigation into the allegations under the appropriate policy and, if substantiated, take disciplinary action as contemplated by the applicable procedures. For example, if a student asserts that a faculty member has engaged in mistreatment in the form of sexual harassment, the university's Discrimination and Harassment Policy would be followed. The university will remain in communication with the student throughout the university's investigation and response. The university may be limited in its ability to disclose personnel information or other action taken in response to a complaint. The university will only be able to return communication made by anonymous reporters if the reporter creates a password and logs back into the reporting portal to access information about the incident. IV. Monitoring and Education The School of Medicine will provide ongoing education to promote a respectful and positive learning environment. The purpose of this education will be to communicate the school's standards of behavior and professionalism for an optimal learning environment and to commit to informing students and educators about policies around behavioral expectations and processes for reporting mistreatment. The policies and reporting protocols will be posted in the Bulletin and in the course syllabi, and they will be reviewed with students during orientation. Data from the reports submitted to the portal and to the deans identified above will be aggregated for review by the SAFE Committee. The SAFE Committee will systematically review these data on a regular basis, in addition to internal and external survey data, when doing the following: (1) assessing trends and the overall climate in learning areas at the School of Medicine; (2) making any recommendations for changes to the policies and the reporting and response mechanisms in place; and (3)developing action plans to implement targeted educational interventions based on the data received. The SAFE committee will regularly report its findings and recommendations to the Academic Affairs Committee and to the Committee on Medical Student Education (COMSE). Aggregate reports will also be regularly forwarded to department chairs for monitoring purposes. V. Medical Student Advisers The following is a list of faculty advisers who may provide guidance when addressing some of the potential issues discussed in the above guidelines: Senior Associate Dean for Education (https:// education.med.wustl.edu/about/leadership-team/ ) Associate Dean for Medical Student Education (https:// Associate Dean and Title IX Compliance Office (https:// titleix.wustl.edu/) Discrimination and Harassment Response Coordinator (https://hr.wustl.edu/items/discrimination-harassment- policy/) School of Medicine Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (https://diversity.med.wustl.edu/ ) VI. Additional Resources Medical Student Ombudsperson (Confidential Adviser) (https://ombuds.med.wustl.edu/ ) Medical Student Peer Advocates (https://md.wustl.edu/ resources/wellness/ ) Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center (https://students.wustl.edu/relationship-sexual- violence-prevention-center/) The Medical Student Mistreatment Reporting and Monitoring Policy was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Aug. 12, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. 379Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) MD: Duty Hour Policy for Medical Students on Clerkships and Other Clinical Rotations Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to the creation of effective learning environments that balance the importance of meaningful participation in clinical activities with the need to support equilibrium among student clinical responsibilities, learning, and personal health and well-being. The following policies and guidelines are set taking into account the effects of fatigue and sleep deprivation on learning and patient care. In keeping with Standard 8.8 of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, clerkship directors, directors of clinical electives, and the Office of Medical Student Education are responsible for monitoring duty hours and ensuring that these are adjusted as necessary. Duty hours are defined as all clinical and required academic activities related to medical student education, including patient care (both inpatient and outpatient), administrative duties (e.g., completion of paperwork, dictation of charts), the provision of the transfer of patient care (e.g., check- in, check-out), time spent in-house while on call, and scheduled academic activities (i.e., required academic conferences). Time spent in self-directed study or practice performed after the student has left the hospital (or after the student has been told that they can leave) does not count toward duty hours. Policies Students must not be scheduled for more than 80 clinical duty hours during a seven-day week, averaged over a four- week period. Students must have a minimum of four periods of 24 consecutive hours off over four weeks. Note: Official WUSM school breaks and holidays should not be counted toward this minimum time-off requirement. Weekends that are adjacent to holidays (e.g., Labor Day) are not considered official holidays. Students must not be on overnight call more frequently than every third night. Overnight shifts that do not extend a student's duty hours during the workday, such as those that might occur in Emergency Medicine or Obstetrics, are not included. Students must have access to call room facilities during overnight call shifts that extend a student's duty hours during the workday. Students cannot be on call for more than 24 successive hours, with an added period of up to four hours for continuity, educational debriefing, and didactic activities. No new patients should be assigned to students after the 24-hour call limit.Students must have at least 14 hours off from clinical work and required educational activities following 24 hours of in- house call. Students will have at least 10 hours off between scheduled work periods, including all activities within the definition of duty hours above. All students on clinical rotations will have all official Washington University holidays off, regardless of whether the student's team is on-call or post-call the day of the holiday. On the workday immediately preceding the holiday, students will be dismissed by 5 p.m. and will not be assigned call duties or regular clinical duties until the day immediately following the holiday at the time set forth by the clerkship director, chief resident, or clinical elective director. In the case of clerkships/rotations with evening or night shifts, an equivalent amount of time off will be provided in as immediate proximity to the holiday as is possible to minimize additional loss of clinical exposure. All clerkship students are to be excused from clinical duties by 5 p.m. on the evening before they are scheduled to take an assigned National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam. Please refer to the Clinical Absence Policy (p. 361) for additional details regarding excused time off from clinical duties. Individual clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives may choose to implement duty hour guidelines that are more restrictive than the above. However, duty hours may not exceed the above regulations. If a student has concerns about duty hour violations, they should discuss it first with the clerkship director or the director of the clinical elective. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, they may approach the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, or the Office of the Ombuds for WUSM. Guidelines It is strongly suggested that clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives take into consideration additional student workload created by required assignments or other required learning activities when monitoring student duty hours. Examples include but are not limited to e-learning activities, required writing assignments, and quizzes. Duty hours data will be collected via end-of-clerkship course evaluations and clinical elective course evaluations, which are completed by students after each clerkship and clinical elective. Clerkship directors and directors of clinical electives will review duty hours data after each rotation to address any concerns and to adjust requirements as necessary. 380Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) The Office of Medical Student Education will review the data quarterly to address any concerns and to adjust requirements as necessary. Quarterly data will be presented to the Committee on Oversight of Medical Student Education and its subcommittee, the Clinical Curriculum Committee, which will charge the appropriate individuals or offices with improvement plans, when necessary. The Duty Hour Policy was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on Nov. 5, 2019. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. MD: Evaluation and Grades More information about assessing student performance and integrity can be found in the Assessing Academic Achievement and Professionalism (p. 365) section of this Bulletin . Following are general guidelines for exams administered in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Additional requirements may be posed by the individual course director. Washington University School of Medicine Formative Assessment and Feedback for Medical Students Policy Background Formative assessment and feedback are critical to high- quality medical education, and, as such, they are central to the educational mission of Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). In keeping with LCME Standard 9.7, WUSM is committed to ensuring that each medical student is assessed and provided with formal formative feedback early enough during each required course or clerkship to allow sufficient time for improvement. For the purposes of this policy, formative assessment is defined as any no/low stakes assessment performed during the learning experience for the purposes of providing formative feedback. Formative feedback is defined as information communicated to a medical student in a timely manner that is intended to modify the student's thinking or behavior to improve subsequent learning and performance in the medical curriculum. Policies All students must receive meaningful formal formative assessment of and feedback on their performance during each of the required courses and clerkships of all phases of the Gateway Curriculum at WUSM. At minimum, this feedback should occur at the midpoint of the course or clerkship, although formative assessment and feedback occurring before and after this point are also encouraged.Required courses or clerkships that are less than four weeks in length must provide an alternate means by which each student can measure their progress in learning at a point that still allows sufficient time for improvement. Directors of required courses and clerkships are responsible for documenting that each student has received formative assessment and feedback. The Committee for Oversight of Medical Education (COMSE) will conduct oversight of student responses on both internal and external surveys for all required modules and clerkships. In the event that a given module, course, or clerkship fails to demonstrate that each student has received formative assessment and feedback, additional inquiry will be conducted by the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. In the event that a consistent pattern of noncompliance is identified, the COMSE will make specific recommendations for remediation. Guidelines Quality feedback ought to include reinforcement of things done well, identification of room for improvement or omissions, and specific strategies for improvement. Evidence for this feedback in the form of specific examples and observations should also be included. The Washington University School of Medicine Formative Assessment and Feedback for Medical Students Policy was last approved by the Oversight Committee on Medical Education on Oct. 5, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Oversight Committee on Medical Education governing body. Washington University School of Medicine Narrative Assessment Policy Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to providing the highest quality medical education to our students who are preparing to lead the future of health and medicine. Narrative assessment provides students with the critical guidance needed to improve performance. Acknowledging the importance of narrative assessment, the LCME element 9.5 requires that students receive narrative feedback on competency development, including non-cognitive achievement. The purpose of narrative assessment is to ensure that students are provided feedback on their development and progress, with sufficient time to receive support in bringing their performance onto a better trajectory, when necessary. 381Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Policies Narrative assessment is a required component of the assessment of each student in the Gateway Curriculum at WUSM across all competency domains. Narrative assessments of a medical student's performance will be provided when all of the following curricular conditions are met: Students work in small groups of less than or equal to 12 members. Students in small groups work together as a team toward a shared goal. Small groups of the same composition are observed longitudinally by the same faculty member for at least three sessions, with a ratio of one faculty member to one student team. Narrative assessment can be provided in courses that do not meet these criteria, provided there is documentation that the nature of the interaction allows for meaningful feedback regarding the indicated competencies. The Washington University School of Medicine Narrative Assessment Policy was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education governing body on Oct. 4, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Education governing body. Washington University School of Medicine High-Stakes Exam Expectations for Medical Students in All Phases of the Curriculum The term high-stakes exams is used to denote all summative assessments, which are those assessments that evaluate student learning against intended course outcomes at the conclusion of instruction. Within the preclinical curriculum, the term includes all events for which the activity type is listed as \"Exam.\" Within the clinical curriculum, the term includes NBME Shelf Exams. Students are required to take all examinations at the originally specified time. A student may be excused from this rule for extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the associate dean for student affairs (ADSA). Examples of extenuating circumstances include personal illness and personal or family emergency. Doctor appointments of a routine nature or personal obligations such as weddings, birthday celebrations, or other planned personal or family commitments are generally not considered to be extenuating circumstances for which students can be exempted from the regularly scheduled exam date.All makeup exam requests go through the ADSA. The ADSA then submits the approved request to the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE), and the OMSE will then transfer and track the requests granted. Course directors should refer all makeup exam requests to the ADSA. Students who are unable to attend a scheduled examination should promptly contact the ADSA. Students should also notify the course director(s); in cases related to personal illness, students should also contact Student Health Services. The OMSE handles all exam rescheduling, and examinations will only be rescheduled after approval by the ADSA. The timing of the rescheduled examination will be determined by the OMSE in collaboration with the course director(s). Students are expected to be punctual and should be assembled in the designated exam area before the official start time of the exam. Tardiness will not be excused except in extenuating circumstances. For purposes of the exam, \"tardiness\" will be defined by the course director or exam proctor. The course director will set expectations and determine consequences for exam tardiness. Students are expected to place all personal items, including muted cell phones, in designated areas. Students are expected to follow all proctor instructions. Students must not share study materials, exchange information, or collaborate or communicate with others during the exam. After taking the exam, students must not share information about the exam with anyone who has not yet taken it. Exam Expectations for Faculty Exams should be proctored by the course director or a designee appointed by the course director comfortable with proctoring and exam administration guidelines. NBME subject exams are proctored by or coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs. Administration should be fair to all students. If the faculty member answers a substantive question or clarifies an issue, the same should be communicated to all students, including those in separate rooms or at different times. Reasonable adjustments should be offered to students who require special accommodations, including a separate testing room or additional time. Course directors are notified of these students through the associate dean for student affairs. 382Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) If a student behaves inappropriately, the course director should notify the associate dean for student affairs immediately (refer to examples in the Cheating section below (p. ) regarding inappropriate behaviors). All requirements of students should be communicated to all students prior to the start of the exam. Special Accommodations Any student needing accommodations for exams should review the school's Students with Disabilities Policy (p. 358) in advance of exams. Students needing accommodations should meet with the associate dean for student affairs in advance of exams to discuss their request. The associate dean for student affairs will inform course directors of approved exam accommodations. Cheating The following examples are intended to be representative of behaviors that constitute cheating in the context of an exam. This is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. Looking at or copying from another student's test Collaborating with another student during the test without authorization Using lecture notes or textbooks during an exam without authorization Possessing crib notes during an exam Using signals/signs to obtain answers from others Using a calculator, cell/smart phone, smart watch, computer, or any other device or learning aid without authorization (This includes storing, receiving, and/or accessing course matter stored on such devices.) Obtaining assistance in answering questions on a take-home exam without authorization Obtaining advance copies of exams or quizzes by any means Having someone else take an exam in your place Feigning illness or submitting misleading statements to avoid taking an exam at the scheduled time Changing an answer on a graded test and claiming the question response was incorrectly marked wrongUnited States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Students who matriculated prior to 2014 and who anticipate practicing clinical medicine are required to take the USMLE Step 1 and 2 examinations. Beginning with the class matriculating in 2014, all students are required to take the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 prior to graduation. The USMLE is designed to \"assess a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills, that are important in health and disease and that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care.\"* The USMLE represents a single uniform examination for medical licensure in the United States, and, as such, is a minimum requirement for obtaining a medical license. The USMLE consists of three separate examinations: \"Step 1 assesses whether you understand and can apply important concepts of the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with special emphasis on principles and mechanisms underlying health, disease, and modes of therapy. Step 1 ensures mastery of not only the sciences that provide a foundation for the safe and competent practice of medicine in the present, but also the scientific principles required for maintenance of competence through lifelong learning.\" Step 1 is taken after completing the second year at Washington University School of Medicine. \"Step 2 assesses whether you can apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. Step 2 ensures that due attention is devoted to principles of clinical sciences and basic patient- centered skills that provide the foundation for the safe and competent practice of medicine.\" Step 2 exams are taken after completing the third year but prior to graduation from Washington University School of Medicine. \"Step 3 assesses whether you can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient management in ambulatory settings. Step 3 provides a final assessment of physicians assuming independent responsibility for delivering general medical care.\" Step 3 is taken following graduation and during internship/residency training. Further information can be obtained from the USMLE Bulletin of Information (https://www.usmle.org/bulletin/) published by the National Board of Medical Examiners. This is available, along with application forms and additional information, on the USMLE website (http://www.usmle.org ). 383Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) *The quoted material throughout this section is from the USMLE website (https://www.usmle.org/). Grading System I. First and Second Year Courses in the first-year and second-year curriculum are evaluated on a Pass (P) or Fail (F) basis. For purposes of the final official grade records of the School of Medicine, grades used for the first year and second year are as follows: P = Pass, indicating satisfactory performance F = Fail; any grade of F remains on the student's academic record. When the course is repeated or remediated the new grade will appear as a separate entry in addition to the failing grade. L = Successful audit NG = Course credit earned, students not graded W = Withdrawal from a course Z = Unsuccessful audit Valid temporary grades include the following: E = Temporary grade, makeup of failed exam pending I = Incomplete, temporary grade pending completion of course requirements, replaced with an F if not removed within one year (In rare instances, the Committee on the Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students [CAPES] may grant an extension. Incomplete indicates that, because of a delay excused by the course director, the student has not completed the requirements to pass a course.) II. Subsequent Years For purposes of the final official grade records of the School of Medicine, the following grades are used for subsequent years: H = Honors, reflecting a truly outstanding performance HP = High Pass, awarded for excellent/very good work P = Pass, indicating satisfactory performance F = Fail (Any grade of F remains on the student's academic record. In clinical clerkships that have a subject examination, students must score at or above the 10th percentile of the national pool of students taking the examination to pass the clerkship. If a student fails a shelf examination for the second time in a third-year clerkship, an F is recorded on the permanent record.) When the course is repeated or remediated, the new grade will appear as a separate entry in addition to the failing grade.Cr/NCr = Credit/No Credit for select second- and fourth-year courses L = Successful audit NG = Course credit earned, students not graded W = Withdrawal from a course Z = Unsuccessful audit Valid temporary grades include the following: E = Temporary grade, makeup of failed exam pending (In clinical clerkships that have a subject examination, students must score at or above the 10th percentile of the national pool of students taking the examination to pass the clerkship. If a student fails the subject examination once, the grade of E will be recorded. Upon successfully retaking the subject examination, the new grade will replace the grade of E on the permanent academic record. If the shelf examination is failed a second time, the grade of F is recorded on the permanent academic record.) I = Incomplete, temporary grade pending completion of course requirements, replaced with an F if not removed within one year (In rare instances, the CAPES may grant an extension. Incomplete indicates that, because of a delay excused by the course director, the student has not completed the requirements to pass a course.) Grade Notification Policy Background The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) element 9.8 requires that all final grades be recorded and available to students within six weeks of the end of a course or clerkship. Given this requirement, departments are asked to report final grades for clerkships and electives within 4 weeks of the course ending and within 14 calendar days for preclerkship courses. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that no grade is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the end of the course/clerkship/elective/ sub-internship, as mandated by our accrediting body. Policies The Medical School Registrar is responsible for monitoring and reporting that all grades for preclerkship courses are submitted in the learning management system within 14 calendar days of the course ending. The process outlined below will be followed in all instances when course directors fail to meet this expectation: If grades are not submitted by the 14th calendar day, the Medical School Registrar will notify the course director via email requesting grades within three calendar days or an explanation why grades cannot be submitted. The Assistant Dean of Curriculum and Foundational Sciences will be copied on this email. 384Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) If the grades or an explanation is not received within three calendar days, the Medical School Registrar will notify the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education, who will directly address the concern with the course director. For instances in which extenuating circumstances prevent the submission of grades within 14 calendar days, the Medical School Registrar will collaborate with the course director and the Assistant Dean for Curriculum and Foundational Sciences to determine an appropriate deadline and will ensure the grade is recorded in the learning management system within six weeks of the end of the course. The Medical School Registrar is responsible for monitoring and reporting that all clerkship and elective grades are submitted within four weeks of the course ending. The process outlined below will be followed in all instances when clerkship and elective directors fail to meet this expectation: If grades are not submitted by the end of the four th week, the Medical School Registrar will notify the clerkship or elective director and the program manager via email requesting grades within three calendar days of notification or an explanation why the grades cannot be submitted. The Assistant Dean of Curriculum and Clinical Sciences will be copied on this email. If the grade or an explanation is not received within three calendar days of notificatio n, the Medical School Registrar will notify the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education, who will directly address the concern with the course or clerkship director. For instances in which extenuating circumstances prevent the submission of grades within four weeks, the Medical School Registrar will collaborate with the clerkship or elective director and the Assistant Dean for Curriculum and Clinical Sciences to determine an appropriate deadline and will ensure the grade is recorded in the learning management system within six weeks of the end of the course or clerkship. Course, clerkship or elective directors who fail to submit 100% of grades within six weeks of the end of a course, clerkship or elective will meet with the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education with notification to the relevant department chair or designee. Guidelines Communication: The expectations for return of grades should be shared with course, clerkship and elective directors at least annually. All course, clerkship and elective directors should be encouraged to create a streamlined process for the completion and integration of student evaluations in order to meet grade submission deadlines.Reminders: Course, clerkship and elective directors should receive reminders prior to the deadlines for grade entry outlined by this policy. Ideally, automatic email reminders can be generated from the learning management system starting the week prior to the end of the course and continued on a weekly basis reminding course directors to submit grades. The office of Medical Student Education will send an email to preclinical course directors at the conclusion of their course reminding them of grade submission deadlines. Monitoring: Central monitoring will occur in the office of the Medical School Registrar. Monitoring should include review of grade reports quarterly to identify missing grades as well as documentation of explanatory notes, extenuating circumstances, and trends of non-compliance. Data will be shared and made available to the Office of Medical Student Education and the Program Evaluation and Continuous Quality Improvement Unit for collaboration efforts and office function. Grade reporting data will be shared quarterly with the appropriate curriculum committee(s). Monitoring of temporary grades: The Medical School Registrar will review reports quarterly to identify students with an E or I grade and will notify the appropriate course/ clerkship director and student.

Pre-Clerkship Grade Appeals For more information about grade appeals, please visit the Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism (p. 365) section of this Bulletin. 385Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Clerkship Grade Appeals Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) is committed to rigorous, equitable, and credible processes for the assessment and grading of our students. Students who do not feel their grade accurately reflects their performance because of (1) a failure to follow a course's stated processes for gathering and judging assessment evidence or (2) unfair bias have the right to appeal the grade. The Grade Appeal Policy at WUSM is in place to allow for the identification and \u2014 if confirmed \u2014 remediation of a systematic error in the assessment and/or grading process outlined in the relevant course syllabus and/or policies. In keeping with LCME standards 9.9, 10.3, and 11.6, we adhere to the following policy for the appeal of all clerkship grades at WUSM. Policy If a student believes there was a systematic error in the assessment and/or grading process or the presence of bias as stated above, they may file a formal appeal. Students wishing to appeal their grade must do so by filing a Grade Appeal Form (https://wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6YFTYDqu1I5c5ds/ ) within 10 business days after final grades are due for a given course per WUSM's Grade Notification Policy (p. 384). Grade appeals received after this deadline will not be accepted unless approved by the Director of Student Assessment and the Registrar in the case of unusual circumstances outside the student's control (e.g., a clerkship posts a final grade after WUSM's deadline). The student must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the appeal and pertinent documentation. Any factors not directly relevant to the assessment of performance within the specific course/clerkship (e.g., a student's stated career goals) cannot be taken into consideration when processing a grade appeal. The Clerkship Director, Associate/Assistant Clerkship Director, and/or their designee will investigate the basis of the student's appeal. They will meet with the student (either in person or via virtual meeting) and any other stakeholders as needed to investigate the appeal, following which they will render a decision. If the student still perceives systematic flaws in the process or bias impacted the final outcome of the grading and/or appeals process, they can submit a second appeal to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. They must do so within 10 business days of the decision of the Clerkship Director/ Associate/Assistant Clerkship Director during the original appeal. The Associate Dean for Medical Student Education will convene an ad hoc appeals committee to adjudicate the appeal based on adherence to the stated processes of the clerkship for assessment and grading. In the event that this ad hoc committee finds systematic flaws or bias in the grading process, they willrender a new review of the assessment evidence and a new judgment. The appeals committee will reach a decision by majority vote ordinarily within 21 days of receipt of the second appeal. The Associate Dean for Medical Student Education retains discretion to make reasonable adjustments to this timeline as necessary. If identified, patterns of failure to adhere to procedures by a grading committee will be addressed by the Director of Student Assessment. In the event that evidence of bias in the grading process is found, this will be considered a failure of the original grading decision to adequately adhere to the predetermined processes, and the appeals committee will issue a new grade. The appeals committee must also provide a summary of the evidence to the course director, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, and the Director of Student Assessment. Further handling of the matter will take place according to WUSM's Policy Against Medical Student Mistreatment and other applicable policies. Guidelines Students are advised that feedback from any one individual front-line assessor does not guarantee a specific grade. Front- line assessors are not in a position to grade students. The perceived absence of formative/constructive feedback from any individual front-line assessor similarly does not guarantee a specific grade. Receiving insufficient feedback cannot be the sole basis for a grade appeal. If a student feels that they are getting insufficient feedback, even after asking, they are encouraged to discuss this with the course director before the end of the course. When relevant, mid-course/clerkship feedback is not a guarantee of any specific final clinical grade. Students actively participating in the residency match process should also notify the office of career counseling whenever a grade appeal is in process. The Washington University School of Medicine Clerkship Grade Appeals Policy was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on July 8, 2021. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Remediation For more information about remediation, please visit the Assessing Academic Achievement & Professionalism (p. 365) section of this Bulletin. 386Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) MD: Professionalism Preamble Medicine is one of the oldest of the learned professions. A professional is one who is in command of a specialized body of knowledge and skills, and is given specific rights not typically allowed to the public. Along with those rights, the professional has specific responsibilities or duties not generally expected of the public. The singularity of medicine is that it deals with human health. Patients are potentially at their most vulnerable when establishing a relationship with a physician. That the patient's relationship with their physician involves a dependency that encompasses life and death adds further to the uniqueness of this relationship. The label of professional is not a right but must be earned. The special contract physicians have with society has professionalism as its foundation. Professionalism consists of fundamentally important qualities including altruism, compassion and empathy, respect for patients and health care workers, commitment to ongoing excellence, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, accountability, recognition of limits, collaboration, and duty to society. Professional development is an ongoing process at all levels of training and practice. The purpose of this document is to outline those elements of professionalism expected of our medical students. It is not meant to be all-encompassing, providing exact guidelines for all possible situations. While this document was developed with medical students in mind, it is generally applicable to all medical professionals. The goal of the Washington University Medical Center is to provide patient care, medical education, and biomedical research of the highest quality. Accomplishing this goal depends in part, also, on an atmosphere of mutual respect and collegiality among all those who work and study here. This document focuses on the special issues presented by the teacher/learner relationship, as well, and applies to all years of the medical school curriculum. Guiding Principles of Professionalism Professional Responsibility 1.Students have a responsibility to actively participate in their education and to work to improve the educational environment for future students. 2.Students should have a willingness to pursue lifelong, self- directed learning, which is an essential attribute of any professional.3.Students should act responsibly in their personal and academic lives with regard to meeting deadlines, financial obligations and other comparable responsibilities. 4.Preparation for class and during clinical rotations sets a good example for peers, maximizes every student's learning opportunity, and demonstrates respect for the teachers and peers. a.Respecting one's peers in a classroom or in the hospital setting includes behaviors such as arriving on time, exhibiting respectful body language, listening attentively, turning off cell phones and allowing all present to engage in discussion. 5.Students should report to the appropriate supervisor potentially serious errors that others have committed. 6.Students should contribute to their community. a.Students are encouraged to participate in the first- and second-year teaching groups. b.These provide a service to the larger St. Louis community, while teaching students how to communicate with people of diverse backgrounds. c.Students are encouraged to serve at the Saturday Neighborhood Health Clinic and other community service and teaching activities. 7.Students should be aware of the larger social and economic context in which disease occurs, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen their knowledge about this topic. Competence and Self-Improvement 1.In order to function at the expected level, students should attend to their own physical and emotional health. a.The experience of being a medical student can be physically and emotionally challenging. Students need to be able to identify when they are overwhelmed to the point where they may not be able to function appropriately. Students are encouraged to seek educational assistance and/or the emotional support of others in these instances. 2.Recognizing and admitting errors in patient care are key to being a good physician. a.Students should view mistakes as part of learning. Assuming responsibility for mistakes is critical for professional development. b.Developing productive strategies for dealing with mistakes and non-confrontational ways of correcting them is essential. 3.Feedback, advice and criticism from residents, fellows and faculty fosters personal and professional development, and should be taken in the context of mentoring. 387Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) a.Students should assume that opinions of their faculty/ residents/fellows that may seem unclear are usually solidly founded, and accept feedback regarding their performance openly and maturely from individuals more experienced than they. b.Students should provide suggestions and examples for improving the mentoring environment by forthrightly evaluating their instructors. 4.Students should identify and correct errors in patient care as soon as possible or notify those who can correct it. 5.Students should balance personal and professional interests. a.Students should not over-commit. b.Students should communicate schedule conflicts to course directors, lecturers, and/or house staff. Respect for Others and Professional Relationships 1.Students should conduct themselves with manners and consideration of all others, and be respectful of others' time. 2.While individual effort is important in developing a medical knowledge base, much of what students learn in medical school will depend on a collaborative effort with their peers. a.From the first day of medical school, students should encourage each other and collaborate with their peers when appropriate in the learning environments of lectures, small group discussions, and lab sessions. In doing so, they are laying the foundation for the truly collaborative nature of medicine. b.During the clinical years, students should understand that their peers are a valuable resource. Likewise, a student should assist peers in patient care responsibilities. c.In all cases, students should respect the work and learning opportunities of their classmates and they should share educational opportunities with their peers. Professional behaviors include listening to other's presentations, and encouraging others' opportunities to present, ask/answer questions, admit patients, participate in surgical cases/procedures, or perform duties. 3.Respect for the ethnic and cultural diversity of classmates provides for a more nurturing environment for all. a.Students should be aware that their classmates come from a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds and that they will have differing lifestyles and viewpoints. This diversity is an important resource in our community, contributing to the personal and professional growth of all. b.Students should be sensitive to the importance of these issues and should seek opportunities to enhance appreciation of multiple cultures through dialog, educational opportunities, etc.4.Students should be supportive of peers during difficult times in their personal and professional lives. a.Students must appreciate that their peers may have issues in their personal or professional lives (e.g., family, medical, academic, or administrative problems) that may affect their interactions with others. In these circumstances, students should make every attempt to be sympathetic and to offer their support to those students. 5.Participation and teamwork enhances the educational experience. a.The learning process is a partnership between students and faculty. Students should actively participate in this partnership by providing feedback to professors by way of evaluations and surveys. b.Contributing to the overall functioning of the team maximizes both learning and patient care in the clinical setting. 6.Understanding the appropriate venues for feedback to house staff/fellows/faculty is critical to successfully resolving conflicts. Students should be aware of the hierarchy of the team, and appropriate mechanisms for handling disagreement with faculty/residents/fellows. Conflicts can be translated into productive outcomes if handled appropriately. For additional helpful information, reference the university Code of Conduct (https://universitycompliance.wustl.edu/ code-of-conduct/ ). 7.Maintaining a professional relationship with teachers (including faculty/residents/fellows and TAs) is important, especially during times when these teachers are in a position to grade or evaluate the student. a.Students should avoid behaviors that could potentially be construed as attempting to influence the faculty, for example running personal errands. b.The university has specific codes and regulations regarding romantic relationships between a student and a teacher, including faculty/resident/fellows outlined in the Consensual Relationships Policy (https:// hr.wustl.edu/items/consensual-relationships/ ). Students engaged in such relationships should review these codes and avoid any situation that can cause potential conflict of interest in the academic setting. 8.Patients should be treated as individuals in the context of their family, culture and community. Personal bias should be subordinated when possible to further the therapeutic relationship. 388Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) a.Use of offensive language or gestures is unacceptable. b.At times, some religious beliefs will require the use of alternative care approaches. c.Students, like practicing physicians, should not refuse to participate in the care of a patient with a communicable disease unless this represents a meaningful threat to the student's own health. In contrast, a student who is verbally or physically threatened by a patient may ask to be excused from care of that patient. 9.Students should treat hospital staff with appreciation and respect as they are vital members of the health care team. Honesty and Integrity 1.Student work should be original. a.Only authorized resources should be used during examinations, quizzes or graded course work. WUSM has a zero tolerance policy for plagiarism (https:// studentconduct.wustl.edu/academic-integrity/). b.When students are aware that a classmate has submitted work that is not their own (cheated), they should discuss this situation with the course director and/ or the associate dean for student affairs. 2.Students must respect patients' rights and maintain confidentiality, in accordance with HIPAA guidelines. a.Students should be ever aware that patients are ill and have the right to refuse care, particularly when poorly provided. b.Patient information should only be discussed with appropriate people at appropriate times. c.Patient records should not be photocopied carelessly or removed from appropriate areas. d.Patient information should be disposed of appropriately to prevent careless transmission of patient information. 3.Students should clearly communicate their abilities and level of training to patients. a.If a student does not know the answer to a patient's question, it is the student's responsibility to admit this lack of knowledge. b.Even if other members of the health care team introduce students to patients as \"doctor,\" the student should never do so as it leads to a false perception of expertise on the patient's part. c.Students should always be truthful with the house staff and other medical staff in terms of patient care and never compromise patient care as a consequence of personal gain. 4.Students should not participate in any aspect of patient care if under the influence of a substance that may compromise the student's judgment or otherwise cause the patient harm. Likewise, students should report any member of the health care team who may be participating in patient care while under the influence of a judgment-impairing substance.5.Any student who is impaired by physical or psychological illness should excuse themselves from patient care responsibilities, and should also respect recommendations to do so from colleagues or supervisors. 6.Although students are often tired or under stress, they should attempt to maintain an appropriate level of composure at all times. 7.Students should be appropriately attired for all patient care duties. 8.Students should carefully consider their participation in benefits provided by pharmaceutical companies or other medically-related businesses. 9.Students should respect the laws of federal, state and local governments in both professional and private life. Transportation Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Assignments Background The primary goal of the medical program at Washington University School of Medicine is to provide the highest quality education possible to its students resulting in the development of competent and caring physicians. Among the core curricular activities necessary to accomplish this are intensive and meaningful patient care rotations. Though most clinical assignments will be located on the Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University campus, some required clinical assignments are located off campus. In keeping with LCME standards 5.5 and 6.4, this is to ensure appropriate resources for clinical instruction in both ambulatory and inpatient settings with adequate numbers and types of patients. Policies A listing of clinical rotations requiring transportation will be available to students. This list will be updated annually by the Office of Medical Student Education (OMSE). All students are required to make themselves aware of these rotations well in advance so that they are familiar with travel requirements. Gas, mileage, parking fees, and ride or public transportation fares are not reimbursed by the school. In order to more equitably distribute both on and off campus assignments, a system for centrally monitoring students' travel for off-campus clinical assignments will be available to clinical course directors and will be overseen by the Clinical Curriculum Committee (CCC). When applicable, students will have the opportunity to submit their ranked choices for clinical assignments in advance. A record of student choice with subsequent alignment and nonalignment with clinical assignment will be included in this system. 389Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Medical students will be required to travel to off-campus clinical rotations when these are assigned by the clinical rotation course director. In order to avoid inequitable distributions of these assignments, a student's stated lack of access to a private vehicle should not be considered in and of itself when creating these assignments. Students who do not have access to a private vehicle will consult the \"Guidelines\" section of this policy item for recommended options. If a student believes that they have been unfairly assigned, they should discuss it first with the clinical course director. If the issue is not resolved to satisfaction, they may approach the Assistant Dean for Curriculum and Clinical Sciences with their concerns. Guidelines Clinical course directors should consider a student's current choice for assignment in the context of the degree to which their prior choices aligned with prior assignments. Clinical course directors should work to accommodate students who indicate a preference for a particular off-campus assignment as opposed to one that is on site. Course directors should be aware of the significant amount of time incurred by students who are assigned off site in their commutes to and from campus when scheduling required learning activities on campus. When available, telecommunication strategies should be used as a way to mitigate this burden. Clinical courses that require a subset of enrolled students to travel to off-campus assignments are encouraged to consider changes in scheduling that compensate for the lost travel time. Students without direct access to a car are advised of the following options for travel. These may include carpooling, ride services (e.g., taxi, Uber, Lyft), public transportation, rental car service, or biking/walking. Mutually acceptable trades in clinical assignments between peers can be considered at the discretion of the clinical course director, although there are no guarantees that these can always be accommodated. The Washington University School of Medicine Transportation Policy for Medical Students on Clinical Assignments was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on April 6, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education.

MD: School of Medicine Policy for Non-University-Affiliated Speaker Compensation Background Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) recognizes the importance of having individuals from outside of the WUSM community contribute to the educational goals of students in the MD program. The following policies apply to the financial compensation of individuals who do not have formal ties to Washington University in St. Louis and who function as speakers to medical students in the core curriculum of the MD program. In keeping with element 9.1, WUSM ensures that all non-university- affiliated instructors are familiar with the relevant learning objectives of the course or clerkship and that they are prepared for their roles in teaching. Policies/Requirements All requests for external speakers should be presented for review by the Senior Manager in the Office of Medical Student Education at least 21 days prior to their inclusion in learning sessions. The Office of Medical Student Education may exercise discretion in accepting late requests made under rare extenuating circumstances. Speakers who require little to no advanced preparation for their involvement (e.g., someone sharing their lived experience as a patient) will be compensated $50 per session in addition to reimbursement for parking or public transportation.Speakers who will have a leadership role in an instructional session (e.g., via a lecture or facilitated discussion) that will require substantive advanced preparation of more than 5 hours will be compensated $200 per session in addition to reimbursement for parking or public transportation. For situations in which the requested speaker compensation exceeds the rates established above, requests should be submitted for review by the Office of Medical Student Education; final approval will be given by the Executive Director for Education Administration and Finance in the Office of Education Administration & Finance unit at least 60 days prior to the speaker engaging in any session-related activities. In all cases, a narrative explaining the need for a higher rate \u2014 along with supporting documentation demonstrating that an effort to negotiate the speaker's rates to remain within the WUSM policy parameters has occurred \u2014 must be submitted. For any guest speaker sessions to be recorded and any other artifacts captured (e.g., photos) and to be later made available through the WUSM Office of Medical Student Education, explicit permission from the guest speaker must be provided, with details on where these materials will be housed and how they will be used in the future. The Washington University School of Medicine Policy for Non- University-Affiliated Speaker Compensation was last approved by the Committee on the Oversight of Medical Student Education on Sept. 13, 2021.

Financial Information for the School of Medicine This page presents financial information for the programs and degrees offered by the School of Medicine. Refer to the tabbed sections for specific financial information about individual programs. Medical Students Financial Assistance The ability to finance a medical education at Washington University does not influence the student selection process. As all students accepted for admission have proven scholastic ability, financial assistance is awarded to qualifying U.S. citizens and permanent residents solely on the basis of documented financial need that cannot be met by student and family resources. Students who consider themselves financially independent of their parents must arrange for loans to replace the amount of support parents are analyzed to have the potential to contribute. The School of Medicine's Office of Financial Aid (Campus Box 8059) will assist students with making these arrangements. In responding to the Admissions Committee's offer of admission, an accepted student will be directed to the student financial aid portal, Net Partner (https://netpartnerstudent.wustl.edu/), to indicate what type of aid they are applying for. The Financial Aid Office acknowledges the student's intent and provides instructions for completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Everyone applying for financial aid must complete a FAFSA and designate Washington University School of Medicine, School Code #G24620, as a recipient. Medical school financial aid application documents and detailed instructions are made available after January 1. The financial aid application materials solicit information about the applicant and their parents, including a detailed description of resources and liabilities. If an applicant's parents are separated or divorced, the financial information is required from both biological parents, excluding the income and assets of their spouses, if remarried. If the applicant is married, similar information is required of the spouse. The school expects the applicant to complete and submit the financial aid documents 392Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) within two weeks from the date the applicant receives them. Official copies of both biological parents' individual U.S. income tax returns and the applicant's official IRS transcripts complete the data required for financial aid consideration. While \"permanent residents\" of the United States are eligible for most federal financial aid programs, need-based financial aid from Washington University is only awarded if the applicant and both biological parents can provide official, audited documents with the same detailed information as provided on a U.S. income tax return. All information is held in strict confidence. Financial aid awards are credited toward the payment of tuition and fees. If there is an excess of funds on a student's account after tuition and other charges, the Registrar's Office will issue a refund check. The loan portion of an award will be funded through the resources of the School of Medicine or through the Federal Direct Loan program. Financial aid awards are made for a given academic year. Beginning with the 2019-20 academic year, any need-based scholarship awarded will be fixed for all future years. Students may reapply for federal loans in succeeding years if they remain in good academic and personal standing. The committee holds that students receiving assistance have an obligation to notify the committee in writing if their financial situation changes, for example, through employment or the receipt of a scholarship not anticipated at the time the application was submitted. First- and second-year students are urged not to accept employment during the academic year. A number of fourth- year students find employment in hospitals within the Medical Center. The personnel office may provide assistance to students' spouses seeking employment. Tuition Stabilization Policy for Medical Students Background LCME standard 3.2 indicates that the medical program should offer sufficient opportunities, encouragement, and support for medical student participation in research and other scholarly activities. The proposed policy aligns with standard 3.2 and a student-centered learning environment. The School of Medicine encourages student research and participation in additional study outside of the traditional medical curriculum. Policies As of July 1, 2020, all matriculating students will benefit from a tuition stabilization plan, which provides that the tuition rate at matriculation will remain constant for up to 10 consecutive years. The stabilized rate will expire ten academic years after matriculation. Therefore, students whose medical education is interrupted for any reason for more than six years will be charged at the rate of the class they rejoin. Appeals of this policyshould be submitted in writing to the Medical School Registrar prior to the 10-year limit and any required increase in tuition. Appeals will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the ultimate decision resting with the Registrar/Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs. The Washington University School of Medicine Tuition Stabilization Policy for Medical Students was last approved by the Academic Affairs Committee on April 9, 2020. All substantive edits to this policy require approval by the Academic Affairs Committee. Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility When a student is enrolled in the curriculum of the MD program, the following policy applies regarding standards for Satisfactory Academic Performance (SAP). Federal regulations require that students receiving Title IV financial aid maintain SAP. The minimum GPA requirements needed to maintain eligibility for Satisfactory Academic Progress are dictated by the specific program of study. In each case, per the requirements of 34 C.F.R. 668.34(a)(4(ii), the federal student aid program requires a minimum of a C average to maintain eligibility for aid, but an individual degree or certificate program may have a higher minimum GPA for federal Satisfactory Academic Progress. This policy presents the standards adopted by the Washington University School of Medicine and applies to all MD students. SAP is evaluated annually, at the end of each academic year. If a student is not maintaining progress, they will be notified by the Committee on Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES) and the director of financial aid via their WUSM e-mail, and they will be ineligible, or \"suspended,\" for federal aid for future terms unless they appeal their status and it is approved by CAPES and the director of financial aid. An appeal must contain the extenuating circumstances surrounding the failure to meet SAP, such as illness, injury, or other circumstances beyond the student's control. In order to be compliant in maintaining SAP and thus eligible for federal financial aid, students must be satisfactorily progressing toward their academic objectives. Federal regulations require the following measurements for determining SAP: time frame and quantitative/qualitative requirements. Time Frame Requirement The maximum time frame of full-time enrollment for the completion of each program is as follows: Four-year MD program: 6 years Five-year MD program: 7.5 393Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Periods of non-enrollment are not counted in the measurement of satisfactory academic progress; however, all periods of attendance, regardless of whether or not the student received Title IV aid, are counted. This policy is applied in the context of each individual student's enrollment status in order to accommodate the student who does not enroll on a full-time basis. For example, if a student enrolls in a four-year program, the full-time student would meet the 150% maximum rule (as per Title IV guidelines) after six years of full-time enrollment, and the half-time student is expected to complete the program within 12 years. If a student vacillates between full-time and half-time enrollment, that student would have a maximum time frame of between six and 12 years, and the maximum time frame for that student would be continuously adjusted. If a student reaches a point where they cannot complete their program within the 150% maximum, that student becomes ineligible for federal aid for all future semesters. Quantitative/Qualitative Requirement Academic requirements for the MD degree include the satisfactory completion of the curriculum designated by the faculty. The progress of each student working toward an MD degree is monitored carefully by the Committee on Academic and Professional Evaluation of Students (CAPES). Refer to the Assessing Academic Achievement (p. 365) section of this Bulletin for more information. A student failing to meet the standards of satisfactory progress as determined by CAPES shall be placed on financial aid suspension. The student will be eligible for aid when they achieve SAP, or the student may appeal. Students who choose to appeal must state the reasons for failing to meet SAP (e.g., injury/illness of the student, death in the family or other special circumstance) and what has changed in the student's situation so that they can now make SAP. If the student successfully appeals, the student will be placed on financial aid probation and may receive financial assistance for one term. At the conclusion of this period, the student must have achieved compliance with each standard or be progressing per their individual academic plan to receive additional aid. A student who does not achieve compliance with each standard by the conclusion of the probationary period is suspended from financial aid eligibility. The Office of Student Financial Aid must notify a student of implementation of probationary status and/or suspension. The Director of Student Financial Aid shall have primary responsibility for enforcement of this policy. The Office of Student Financial Planning shall ascertain at the time of each disbursement of funds and prior to certification of a financial aid application that the student is in compliance with the policy.Cost of Education For the first-year class matriculant, tuition and estimated expenses for the 2021-22 academic year are listed below. Students will benefit from a tuition stabilization plan, which provides that their annual tuition and fees of $69,250 will be constant for up to 10 consecutive years. The stabilized rate will expire 10 academic years after matriculation. The items listed below provide an estimate of the expenses for a single student in the 37-week first-year class. The total of these figures suggests a basic minimum budget of approximately $90,030. Allowances for entertainment, travel, clothing and other miscellaneous items must be added to this estimate. Tuition and fees (includes Student Health Services and Microscope Lending Plan): $69,250 Books and and personal: $2,550 Policy for International Students The admission decision at Washington University School of Medicine is based on academic and personal merit and not on the ability of the student to pay the costs of education. However, individuals who are not citizens of the United States of America or who do not hold U.S. Permanent Resident Visa status, including DACA students, are not eligible for financial aid due to regulations covering many programs used by the school to fund financial assistance. Therefore, in order for the school to complete the required documents which are necessary for issuance of a visa, the student must document, by a date and in a manner designated by the school, that the necessary amount of funds, as established by the school, is available to pay the costs of education (tuition and living expenses) for the anticipated period of enrollment, normally four years. Documentation of the required amount of financial resources may be by a letter of credit or by deposit of funds in an escrow account with a bank designated by the school. Awards and Prizes At two annual events, Washington University School of Medicine publicly recognizes and rewards outstanding scholarship, research accomplishments and community service of individual students.

Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal and Refunds Policy The university billing system provides a central financial account against which most student expenses incurred at the university will be posted, including but not limited to tuition, housing charges, parking and library fines. This policy, when referring to tuition and other charges, includes any and all charges posted to this account. All payments of tuition and other university charges are due and payable on the dates specified in the published calendars of the programs in the School of Medicine. Failure of a student to register when required, and pay tuition and other charges incurred on or before the date specified in the published calendar, may result in a late fee of $50 to be added to the amount due. The late fee may be imposed seven days after the due date if full payment has not been received. Tuition and other charges are usually payable twice a year, at the start of the academic year, and again at the middle of the academic year, as listed on the schedule on the academic calendar. In addition to the $50 late fee, any payment due from the student and not paid by the specified date will accrue interest at the current market rate in effect on the first business day of the month in which the payment is due. This fee will be imposed on any accounts not paid in full within 30 days of the due date. Any amount not paid when due (plus accrued interest thereon) must be paid in full within three months of the due date to avoid potential suspension from classes, unless a deferred payment is approved by the registrar due to extenuating circumstances. If a student fails to make payments within three months of the original due date, the school will not release the student's academic record, grade reports or transcript, pending settlement of the unpaid account. A student who has not satisfied all of their 398Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) delinquent financial obligations to Washington University (e.g., tuition, university housing, parking) one month before the end of the academic year will not be allowed to progress to the next academic year, nor can they be issued a diploma. Federal financial aid funds for the next academic year cannot be disbursed until all prior year balances are paid in full. Students who rely on financial aid funds to meet their obligations should submit their applications for processing according to application deadlines published by the Office of Student Financial Planning. Deadlines allow for receipt of financial aid funds by payment due dates if applications are filed by the deadline. The Office of Student Financial Planning will assist students with loan applications and financial planning upon request. A student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the school will receive a pro rata refund of tuition and appropriate fees. The refund will be based on the ratio of the class days enrolled (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class days in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the School of Medicine shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from the school, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to the school on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined above, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Office of the Registrar or Student Financial Planning. Merit-Based Scholarships In 1978, the School of Medicine established a scholarship program that based selection on merit rather than financial need. As one of the first merit scholarship programs for medical students, the Distinguished Student Scholarship Program has recognized and rewarded academic excellence and personal achievement for 33 years. And, to honor outstanding alumni of Washington University, the Medical Center Alumni Association created in 1989 the Distinguished Alumni Scholarship Program. In 1998, the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Association committed to funding one full-tuition, four-year scholarship to a student in each entering class. Beginning with the 2002-03 academic year, one additional \"named\" scholarship was made available through the generosity of a donor.Most merit-based scholarships are awarded to students in the first-year class and are subject to annual renewal. Recipients of these scholarships are expected to maintain academic excellence. If a scholarship is not renewed, the student may file for financial aid from the school. For scholarship recipients who document financial need above the full-tuition scholarship, additional funds are available to provide support up to the total cost of education. Scholarship recipients may not concurrently participate in the school's Medical Scientist Training Program, the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program, or the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. Now known collectively as the Distinguished Scholars Program, its aim is to attract and enroll the most outstanding students in the School of Medicine, thus enriching the scholarly environment and broadening the scope of learning for all students. Scholarship recipients are selected on intelligence, character, personal accomplishments and goals, motivation for medicine, aptitude for science, leadership potential, communication skills and diversity of life experience. Scholarships awarded under this program include the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Scholars, Danforth Scholars in Medicine, Distinguished Alumni Scholars (DAS), Distinguished Faculty Scholars (DFS), and Distinguished Student Scholars (DSS). Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Association Scholarship One full-tuition, four-year scholarship will be awarded to a student in each entering class beginning in 1999. Selection of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Medical Staff Association Scholar is the same as for the Distinguished Student Scholarship. Danforth Scholars in Medicine Named in honor of William H. and Elizabeth Gray Danforth, the chancellor and first lady of the university from 1971 to 1995, the Danforth Scholars Program is a tribute to their legacy of exemplary leadership and service. Distinguished Alumni Scholarships Up to four full-tuition scholarships are awarded annually to members of the entering first-year class. The application procedure and selection process are the same as for the Distinguished Student Scholarships. Since 1989, Distinguished Alumni Scholarships have been named in honor of the following individuals: Leonard Bacharier, MD Thomas Bailey, MD Thomas Baranski, MD, PhD Walter F.

Health Professions The following policy applies to students pursing graduate/ professional training in Applied Health Behavior Research (p. 409), Audiology and Communication Sciences (p. 410), Biology and Biomedical Sciences (p. 410), Biomedical Engineering ( p. 410), Biostatistics ( p. 410), Clinical Investigation (p. 410), Medical Physics (https:// radonc.wustl.edu/education/master-of-science-in-medical- physics/), Occupational Therapy (p. 410), Physical Therapy (p. 410), Population Health Sciences (p. 410), and Public Health (p. 410). General Information Registration, Payments, and Withdrawal & Refunds Policy The university billing system provides a central financial account against which most student expenses incurred at the university will be posted, including but not limited to tuition, housing charges, parking and library fines. This policy, when referring to tuition and other charges, includes any and all charges posted to this account. All payments of tuition and other university charges are due and payable on the dates specified in the published calendars of the programs in the School of Medicine. Failure of a student to register when required, and pay tuition and other charges incurred on or before the date specified in the published calendar, may result in a late fee of $50 to be added to the amount due. The late fee may be imposed seven days after the due date if full payment has not been received. Tuition and other charges are usually payable twice a year, at the start of the academic year, and again at the middle of the academic year, as listed on the schedule on the academic calendar. In addition to the $50 late fee, any payment due from the student and not paid by the specified date will accrue interest at the current market rate in effect on the first business day of the month in which the payment is due. This fee will be imposed on any accounts not paid in full within 30 days of the due date. 408Bulletin 2021-22 School of Medicine (10/14/21) Any amount not paid when due (plus accrued interest thereon) must be paid in full within three months of the due date to avoid potential suspension from classes, unless a deferred payment is approved by the registrar due to extenuating circumstances. If a student fails to make payments within three months of the original due date, the school will not release the student's academic record, grade reports or transcript, pending settlement of the unpaid account. A student who has not satisfied all of their delinquent financial obligations to Washington University (e.g., tuition, university housing, parking) one month before the end of the academic year will not be allowed to progress to the next academic year, nor can they be issued a diploma. Federal financial aid funds for the next academic year cannot be disbursed until all prior year balances are paid in full. Students who rely on financial aid funds to meet their obligations should submit their applications for processing according to application deadlines published by the Office of Student Financial Planning. Deadlines allow for receipt of financial aid funds by payment due dates if applications are filed by the deadline. The Office of Student Financial Planning will assist students with loan applications and financial planning upon request. A student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the school will receive a pro rata refund of tuition and appropriate fees. The refund will be based on the ratio of the class days enrolled (from the first day of classes to the termination date) to the total number of class days in the term for which tuition and fees were paid. It is understood that the date on which a student formally notifies the Registrar's Office in writing of the decision to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the School of Medicine shall be regarded as the termination date, with no retroactive clause to be accepted. A prospective date will be accepted, however. If tuition and fees were paid entirely or in part by financial aid from the school, the refund will be applied first to the total repayment of the accounts from which financial aid was drawn, with any remaining refund balance given to the student. Financial aid received in excess of the costs of tuition and fees must be refunded by the student to the school on the same pro rata basis as calculated for the tuition refund outlined above, per \"Return of Title IV\" federal guidelines. Any questions about these policies may be directed to either the Office of the Registrar or Student Financial Planning. Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility All Non-MD Students: The minimum GPA requirements needed to maintain eligibility for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) are are dictated by the specific program of study. In each case, per the requirements of 34 C.F.R. 668.34(a)(4(ii), the federal student aid program requires a minimum of a C average to maintain eligibility for aid, but an individual degree or certificate program may have a higher minimum GPAfor federal Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a student's grades fall below the required GPA for the program when the SAP review is performed, the student is not considered to be maintaining SAP. Students enrolled in various School of Medicine degree programs should refer to the specific policies of their primary program: Applied Health Behavior Research (https://crtc.wustl.edu/programs/degrees/ahbr/), Audiology and Communication Sciences (https://pacs.wustl.edu/), Biology and Biomedical Sciences ( p. 410), Biomedical Engineering (p. 410), Biostatistics (https://biostatistics.wustl.edu), Clinical Investigation (https://crtc.wustl.edu/programs/ and Population Health Sciences (http://www.mphs.wustl.edu/ ). SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester or term. To be considered to be maintaining SAP and thus be eligible for federal financial aid, a student must maintain the program's minimum program requirements for cumulative GPA and pace (i.e., credit earned for at least 67% of the credits attempted). The degree must also be completed within the maximum time frame allowed for the program (i.e., no more than 150% of the credits required). For example, if the program requires 120 credits to complete, the student must be able to complete the program by attempting no more than 180 credits. To determine how many credits are required to complete the program, the student should consult the school's Bulletin. If the student cannot complete the program without attempting more than 150% of the credits required, the student is not considered to be maintaining SAP. Students who fail to meet SAP requirements after one semester will be placed on a \"warning.\" Students on a warning will continue to be eligible to receive aid for the following semester or term. Students not meeting SAP at the end of the warning will be notified of their loss of aid eligibility by the Office of Student Financial Planning via their Washington University e-mail address. A student who becomes ineligible for aid by failure to meet SAP requirements may also appeal to reestablish aid eligibility. The student's appeal will be reviewed by the school's dean's office and the Office of Student Financial Planning. An appeal must contain the extenuating circumstances surrounding the failure to meet SAP, such as illness, injury, or other circumstances beyond the student's control.
