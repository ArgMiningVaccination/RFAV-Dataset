The good news is that it's not necessarily a problem on its own, and there are natural, simple ways to experience relief from occasional gas and bloating. In this article, we'll share several tips for maintaining [digestive health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/digestive-health) and relieving gas and bloating naturally, as well as a few strategies for helping prevent them from happening in the first place.* Before we get there, let's briefly review why gas and bloating happen. Why Gas and Bloating Happen First of all, it's important to remember that gas is normal. Expelling it is, too. The gas in your stomach or bowels has to go somewhere. Your eating habits and the fermentation process of specific foods primarily cause gas.REF#1050It may leave you feeling bloated, or you will simply burp it or pass it.REF#1045 Bloating occurs when your GI tract fills with gas or air. Your stomach doesn't necessarily get bigger than usual, though it can, but it feels that way and is often quite uncomfortable.REF#1045 Eating Habits How you eat your food can affect how much air you swallow and gas you produce. For example, when you eat quickly, gulp, and don't chew your food thoroughly, you swallow more air, which your body needs to expel.REF#1045 Fermentation of Food The [good bacteria](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/understanding-the-microbiome-tips-to-maintain-a-healthy-gut) in your large intestine break down any food that your small intestine didn't digest, leading to a fermentation process that produces gas, which you later pass.REF#1045 Certain foods cause more gas than others as they pass through your digestive tract. For example, lactose-containing foods and beans can cause more gas than other options, as you may well know from firsthand experience.REF#1045 It's also true that some foods bother certain people more than others. Talk to Your Doctor As we mentioned, gas and bloating aren't usually problems in and of themselves. They typically do not require medical care. Chronic gas and bloating may indicate an underlying issue, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), stomach ulcers, H. Pylori, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, it's best to talk to your doctor if you have concerns about gas, bloating, or abdominal discomfort. Consult your healthcare provider about possible food allergies and intolerances that may trigger gastrointestinal upset. It's also a good idea to talk to your doctor or a naturopathic physician before adding herbal supplements to your regimen. There are many [herbal options](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/indigestion-relief), and a naturopathic or holistic doctor can guide you to the best herbs for your particular concerns.* Let's turn now to easy, natural ways to relieve gas and bloating.* Gas and Bloating Relief: 7 Natural Options* 1) Practice Mindful Eating Some causes of gas include talking while you're eating, overdoing it with food, or eating when you feel upset.REF#1045 This is why it's important to eat slowly, chew your food well and without talking, and stop eating when you first start feeling full. Practicing mindful eating can help you to eat slowly and consume the right amount. Mindful eating simply means being present and aware of the eating process. For example, avoid multitasking during your meals. Smell your food, notice the tastes, and chew it thoroughly. With mindful eating, you'll enjoy your food more, make it easier for your body to digest nutrients, and probably even feel fuller quicker. 2) Get Comfortable It may sound strange, but it turns out that tight-fitting clothes can contribute to gas.REF#1045 Wearing tight-fitting clothes, particularly around the waistline, can contribute to gas and bloating by restricting the movement of the digestive system, making it more difficult for gas to pass through, trapping gas in the intestines. Do what you can to help your body by wearing loose-fitting bottoms\u2014pants that don't hug you too much around the waist should do the trick. 3) Know your Food Sensitivities As mentioned earlier, some foods may cause more gas and bloat than others. If you want to get to the bottom of which specific foods might trigger you, keep a food diary: Write down what you eat for each meal and note when you experience gas and bloating. Here are a few foods that are known to cause problems for many people:REF#1045 - Carbonated drinks - Spicy or fatty foods - Beans - Wheat - Broccoli - Cabbage - Onions [Garlic](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/garlic) - Apples - Prunes - Artificial sweeteners like sorbitol, mannitol, and maltitol Limiting fiber may help reduce bloating and gas.REF#1049 While fiber can promote digestive health, fiber is not digested in the small intestine and instead moves to the large intestine, where it is broken down by gut bacteria, leading to gas production. A [low-FODMAP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390324/) (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet is a dietary approach that limits certain types of carbohydrates that are poorly digested and can cause digestive symptoms. This [diet](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/fodmap-diet-support) involves eliminating foods for some time, then gradually reintroducing them to identify trigger foods. Reducing fiber intake may not be suitable for everyone and may worsen symptoms if you have a medical condition such as constipation or diverticulitis. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet. 4) Move Your Body [Physical activity](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/6-herbs-to-help-you-hiit-the-gym) promotes healthy digestion, and research suggests that taking a slow walk after a meal could relieve gas and bloat. In one study, researchers found that \"mild physical activity [such as walking] enhances intestinal gas clearance and reduces symptoms in patients complaining of abdominal bloating.\"REF#1046* Physical activity can also helpreduce stress, which can contribute to digestive issues. Stress can disrupt the normal function of the digestive system and lead to a buildup of gas in the intestines. By engaging in [physical activity](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/8-ways-exercise-helps-support-your-health-and-wellbeing), you can help reduce stress and promote a more relaxed state, which can help reduce gas and bloating. 5) Drink Herbal Tea If you often turn to a [cup of hot herbal tea](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-tea-every-time) after a big meal, you're on the right track! [Peppermint](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/peppermint) tea. [Chamomile](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/chamomile) tea and Lemon Balm are herbal teas that can specifically help with gas.*REF#1045 That's why we include Peppermint and Chamomile in Gaia Herbs' [Gas & Bloating Herbal [Fennel](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/fennel), [Licorice](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/licorice), [Star Anise](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/star-anise), and [Caraway](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/caraway).* After a meal, simply pour one cup of freshly boiled water over a tea bag, cover it, and let it steep for 10 minutes before enjoying. 6) Use a Natural Laxative Each person's body behaves differently, so paying attention and listening to your body is important. If bloating and constipation go hand-in-hand, you may want to focus on addressing constipation. One review notes that \"many of the therapies advocated for the treatment of bloating are primarily aimed at improving the transit of stool through the colon.\"*REF#1048 In other words, they keep things moving. To do this, turn to a gentle laxative, such as Gaia Herbs' [Natural Laxative Herbal Tea](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/natural-laxative-herbal-tea) or [Natural Laxative](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/natural-laxative) tablets.* Our USDA Certified Organic herbal tea uses a blend of traditional herbs known to support the body's natural elimination processes and works gently overnight to soothe occasional constipation.* Natural laxative tablets work similarly, using a blend of herbs, including [Senna Leaf](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/senna), [Aloe](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/aloe), and [Dandelion](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/dandelion), to support the body's natural elimination process and soothe occasional constipation.* 7) Natural Remedies & Herbal Supplements for Digestion* The following are herbs and spices to help relieve [bloating](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-support-healthy-digestion-during-the-holiday-season-beyond) and flatulence:*REF#1045 - Star Anise (Melissa officinalis) - Chamomile - discuss different ways to use [herbal supplements for digestion](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-support-healthy-digestion-during-the-holiday-season-beyond) and recommend other home remedies that may provide digestive support. Essential Oils Some essential oils, such as peppermint oil, may help calm the muscles in the digestive tract, soothing gas and bloating. Dilute a few drops of peppermint oil in a carrier oil (such as coconut or olive oil) and rub it onto the abdomen. Digestive Enzymes Digestive enzyme supplements contain natural enzymes to help break down and digest food. These enzymes are like the ones that are naturally produced in the body to aid digestion but extracted from natural sources, such as fruits and vegetables. When taken with a meal, these supplements can help to support the body's natural digestive process and soothe symptoms of gas, bloating, and indigestion. Digestive Bitters Taking bitters before your meals is one way to support digestion before you even start chewing.* Digestive bitters prime your digestive system and [help get it ready for the food you're about to eat](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/digestive-health).* Bitters contain bitter-tasting plants such as dandelion, gentian, and wormwood, which support the production of digestive enzymes to break down food and absorb nutrients.
