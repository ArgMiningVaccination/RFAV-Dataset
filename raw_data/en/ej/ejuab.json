Although vitamin D supplementation is recommended in clinical prac- tice, the benefits of vitamin D testing prior to vitamin D supplementation remain unknown. We conducted a systematic literature search to identi fy the clinical and economic evidence related to testing for vitamin D for at -risk groups defined by the Swiss Federal Commission of Nutrition (FCN). We further examined the literature regarding the clinical effect of vitamin D supplementation in the same at -risk groups. If no benefit from supplementation can be shown, then benefits of testing can be ruled out, if these tests aim to inform the decision to supplement. In regards to vitamin D testing for the defined at-risk groups (persons with bone disorders, older adults, obese individuals, pregnant women, people with dark skin, and athletes ), no primary studies were identified which assess health outcomes. Economic results for testing in older adults were mixed and non-conclusive . In one study, it was estimated that f or older people as well as for people with darker skin, overall costs are lower if supplementation of vitamin D without prior vitamin D testing is given instead of implementing a vit- amin D testing and treatment strategy. In regards to vitamin D supplementation, we pursued a systematic but non-comprehensive approach to the literature search and selection, which carries a potential risk of bias . On this basis, the evi- dence on effectiveness of vitam in D supplementation was generally mixed and not conclusive. Based on the scoping report the feasibility to produce a full HTA has been considered. A full HTA would not be justified at present due to the absence of clinical studies evaluating vitamin D testing. Only after such studies have become available could the topic be re- considered. Vitamin D testing is recommended for patients where it is medically necessary, and this is not disput ed in the present report. The lack of available evidence for vitamin D testing for defined at -risk groups from our review , could be informative in guiding a decision policy on vitamin D testing.

A central research question is presented and a system atic literature search is conducted to determine whether sufficient evidence is available to conduct a full HTA . The main focus of the literature search is to identify studies evaluating clinical effectiveness and economic impact of vitamin D test ing. A second objective is to identify studies evaluating clinical effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation. Operational key questions covering the EUnetHTA main Core- organisational issues are formulated. The target population(s), the appropriate comparator and the relevant health outcomes are defined. In the report the analytical methods that are to be used when a HTA is pursued are descri bed. Based on quantity and quality of the extracted evidence the feasibility of pursuing a HTA is judged. Analysis of the individual study outcomes is not the objective of the scoping report. HTA Scoping Report 10 1. Policy Question The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is reviewing the reimbursement by the Swiss compulsory insurance of vitamin D testing compared to no vitamin D testing and/or supplementation of vitamin D without prior vitamin D testing in defined risk groups because the clinical utility of vitamin D testing has been questioned. Currently, vitamin D testing is reimbursed by the Swiss compulsory health insurance for any individual regardless of their level of deficiency risk. This report from FOPH aims to evaluate the available clinical and economic evidence o n vitamin D testing. Over the last 10 years, the amount of prescriptions for vitamin D testing has increased steadily in Switzerland, leading to substantial increases in costs. In a report by the Federal Commission of Nutrition (FCN), it was recommended t hat vitamin D testing is undertaken in groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency 1. Questions have been raised about the clinical utility of vitamin D testing prior to vitamin D supplemen- tation. Supplementing without vitamin D testing is an alter native treatment pathway recommended in various western countries. Certain groups at risk may profit from vitamin D testing, as it may inform the decision of a physician of whether to prescribe a vitamin D supplement or not. Also the result of a vitamin D test can inform what the optimal vitamin D dose is for a patient according to his/her level of deficiency. In addition, the ques- tion, which groups at risk profit from vitamin D supplementation, is a topic of ongoing debate. Therefore, simultaneously to addressing vitamin D testing, this scoping report extracts and presents available evidence supporting or not supporting a clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation in certain groups at risk where FCN recommended vitamin D testing . If no benefit from s upplementation can be shown, and if vitamin D tests aim to inform the decision to supplement, then benefits of testing can be ruled out a priori. This perspective becomes particularly relevant in the absence of evidence for testing. 2. Research Question The central research question (CRQ) investigates: the clinical utility and economic impact of vitamin D testing in groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency. HTA Scoping Report 11 3. Medical Background Vitamin D Vitamin D , also known as calciferol, is a lip osoluble vitamin obtained either through synthesi s in the skin through exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight 2, or from dietary sources and supplements 3 4. Several forms of vitamin D exist, of which vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol are the most active forms. Vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. Vitamin D2 is derived from plants while vitamin D3 is derived from animal sources and exposure to sunlight which is the main source 5. Naturally v itamin D rich foods include fatty fish (salmon, tuna, sardines etc.), egg yolks, fish liver oil an d certain types of mushrooms 3 6. Fortified foods (although banned in several countries) such as milk and butter as well as sunlight exposure are more efficient vitamin D sources. Sunlight as source of vitamin D is dependent on age, seasonality, sun exposure, skin pigmentation and sun protective means . It can be difficult to obtain the recommended daily vitamin D intake from natural vitamin D sources only, therefore the use of vitamin D supplements may be necessary in certain subpopulations . Bone metabolism is characterized by continuous and lifelong bone formation and resorption 7. Particularly in childhood, bone metabolism is increased and adapted to the needs of skeletal growth 8. Vitamin D and calcium have a pivotal impact on bone health during pediatric age when nutritional rickets and impaired bon e mass acquisition may occur. Besides these classic skeletal actions, recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D exerts other significant extraskeletal actions. Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies impair bone density and muscle function at any age, f rom childhood and adolescence onwards. Additionally negative effects on the immune system, diabetes incidence and cardio- metabolic function have been shown 9. Vitamin D Metabolism and Physiology Vitamin D from sunlight exposure, food or supplements first undergoes hydroxylation in the liver producing 25- hydroxyvitamin D. In the kidneys, a second hydroxylation occurs producing 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D 5. This step can also occur in the prostate, colon and breas2 10. Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF23, serum calcium and phosphate levels regulate the renal synthesis of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D 11. The major role of vitamin D is to stimulate intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Adequate blood levels of calcium and phos phate are dependent on an adequate level of vitamin D 12 13. Calcium and HTA Scoping Report 12 phosphate are important for bone growth, remodelling and mineral ization, but also for other physiologic fonctions, such as muscle functioning 14. Therefore, calcium deficiency may also be responsible for muscle tetany, besides its negative effect on bone metabolism 15. The fine regulation of blood levels of calcium and phos phate depends additionally on hormones such as parathormone (PTH) and calcitonin 16 17 . Vitamin D is also believed to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentation, apoptosis and metabolism 3 5 18 19. Figure 1. Vitamin D Synthesis and Metabolism 20 Vitamin D D eficiency Various thresholds for vitamin D deficiency have been defined 1. The FCN classification is outlined in Table 1. HTA Scoping Report 13 Table 1 . Serum 25(OH)D Concentrations and Classifications 1 Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency Bone pain and muscle weakness, two symptoms associated with vitamin D deficiency, are rarely mentioned by the patient to the physician or recognized by the physician as beeing due to vitamin D deficiency 5. In adults, prolonged vitamin D deficiency is known to contribute to or exacerbate osteoporosis 5. Besides bone pain, the clinical presentation of osteoporosis is low trauma or spontanous bone fractures. Prologned vitamin D deficiency can also lead to osteomalacia in adults, characterized by bone softening and muscle weakness 5. In children, prolonged vi tamin D deficiency may cause brittle bones or rickets, the pediatric equivalent of osteomalacia caused by inadequate bone mineralization leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities 5. Vitamin D Supplementation and Vitamin D Testing Regarding to vitamin D testing, a distinction has to be made between the therapeutic setting and the preventive setting. In a therapeutic setting, when suspecting a vitamin D deficiency, testing of vitamin D may have its role in the diagnosis and the evaluation of the response to treatment. In the preventive setting, vitamin D testing is questioned. Testing is not an explicit prerequisite for vitamin D supplementation and physicians can prescribe vitamin D supplementation in order to prevent a vitamin D deficiency. Individuals may also get v itamin D supplements from their pharmacist or start vitamin D supplementation at their own initiative. Several specialized societies advise against the routine HTA Scoping Report 14 screening of vitamin D status and recommend a strategy of primary prevention of deficiency throu gh universal low -dose vitamin D supplementation for all young children and pregnant women 21-24. Supplementation with a dose of 600 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day is recommended for adults. Risks of overtreatment with vitamin D appear to be low and related immediate adverse effects (i.e. poisoning) are reported rarely 25-27. Most studies of vitamin D supplements have used doses of 400- 1000 IU/day, have not been associated with evidence of adverse effects, and it is generally held that doses u p to 2000 IU/day are safe 28. However, recent literature has shown that high intermittent vitamin D supplementation (bolus doses) can increase the risk of falls and fractures 29. Vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium has been associated with various positive effects on health outcomes, in particular with respect to falls and fractures in elderly 30 31, muscle strength32, bone density 33 and physiological function 34 , type 2 diabetes mellitus 35 36, gestational diabetes 37, some types of cancer 35 38-41 but not all 42 43, overall mortality 44 as well as cancer -related mortality 43. Some studies report an effect on cardiovascular diseases 45 46 whereas some others do not 42 47. Although vitamin D supplementation with 800 IU per day is a recommended clinical practice, the benefits of compulsory testing in risk groups prior to supplementation remain unknown. One interest in vitamin D testing may be monitoring adherence to vitamin D supplementation. 4. Technolog y 4.1. Technology Description The vitamin D status of an individual can be determined on a regular blood draw by measur ing serum concentrations of 25- hydroxyvitamin or of to 25- hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D has a short circulating half -life and low er serum concentrations, making it more difficult to measure. However, the level of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D still needs to be determined in some cases, such as re nal failure, granuloma disorders as well as in some rare inborn errors of metab- olism 48. There are different techniques available for measuring the serum levels of both forms of vitamin D (e.g. enzyme immunoassay, radioimmunoassay, high- performance 48 50 51. HTA Scoping Report 15 Recommendations of the Federal Commission of Nutrition on Vitamin D T esting In Switzerland, FCN recommends vitamin D testing in individuals at high risk for severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L). The FCN recommends vitamin D supplementation in all individuals with serum vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L1. Subpopulations considered to be at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency according to the FCN, are listed in Table 2 . The FCN developed this list of s ubpopulations1 by adapting the list of groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency provided by the US Endocrine Society 21. No evidence is referenced by the FCN in their recommendation on testing 1. Table 2 . Subject Groups at High Risk of Severe Vitamin D Deficiency according to FCN 1 Costs of Vitamin D Testing In various countries, vitamin D testing has increased significantly over the last years 52-54. In Switzerland, the number of vitamin D tests has increased from about 9'500 in 2006 to about 1'179'000 in 2016. This increase is associated with a rise in costs to about CHF 60 million in 2016 (Figure 2 , Source: SASIS Tarifpool). HTA Scoping Report 16 Figure 2. Yearly Cost s for Vitamin D Tests in Switzerland, 2006 - 2016 Coverage Policy of Vitamin D Testing In Switzerland, the laboratory analyses for vitamin D reimbursed by the compulsory health insurance55 are listed on the Analysenliste ( list of laboratory analys es, annex 3 of the Krankenpflege- Leistungsver- (position 1006.00) 56. The position 1006.00 includes the measurement of the total level of serum vitamin D (vitamin D2 plus vitamin D3). Even if the level of vitamin D2 and D3 are not measured simultaneously, the position 1006.00 can be only billed once on behalf of the compulsory health insurance 56. At present the reimbursement by the compulsory health insurance of vitamin D testing is not restricted to specific risk groups . In some countries, such as Canada, France or Germany, the reimbursement of vitamin D testing by health insurances has been limited to certain risk groups. For example, in Ontario, Canada, vitamin D testing reimbursement is restricted to persons with osteoporosis and osteopenia, rickets, malabsorption syndromes, renal disease, or persons on medications that affect vitamin D metabolism 57. In Alberta, Canada, the introduction of an additional criterion requiring clinicians to identify the medical indication for vitamin test ing in a patient, led to a 92% reduction in the number of vitamin D tests 58. In France, vitamin D testing reimbursement is restricted to persons with rickets or osteomalacia, older adults with recurrent falls, monitoring of kidney transplant in adults and persons who hav e undergone bariatric surgery 59. In Germany, the statutory health insurance covers the vitamin D testing only if the medical necessity is given 60. Medical necessity is not further defined. The presence of a chronic disease such as bronchial HTA Scoping Report 17 asthma or multiple sclerosis is not a reason for v itamin D testing coverage, but clinically manifest rickets or osteomalacia are. 4.2. Alternative Technologies An alternative to vitamin D testing all subjects at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency, as recom- mended in the 2012 FCN report 1, is supplementing all high- risk individuals without prior vitamin D test- ing. 5. HTA key questions The aim of this scoping report is to explore a central research question (CRQ) on vitamin D testing; and also to explore an upstream research question (URQ) on vitamin D supplementation to select the ap- propriate target groups for the CRQ. In order to evaluate the utility of vitamin D testing in a full HTA, one central research question and an upstream research question are formulated. The central research question (CRQ) investigates: the clinical utility and economic impact of vitamin D testing in groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency. Clinical utility is assessed in CRQa and economic impact in CRQb. 5.1. Additional question The upstream research ques tion (URQ) investigates: clinical effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in the FCN -defined subpopulations at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency. 6. PICOS Table 3 shows the PICO S covering clinical utility and economic impact of vitamin D testing and the PICOS for vitamin D supplementation. HTA Scoping Report 18 6.1. Populations The different groups at high risk of severe vitami n D deficiency, as defined by the F CN 1, form the different target populations for the CRQ and URQ . We did not consider any other populations than those defined in the FCN report . For instance, w e did not consider populations with asthma, COPD or multiple sclerosis. Although these groups may also be considered as having a high risk of sev ere vitamin D deficiency , they were not defined in the FCN report from 2012. Excluded are groups where vitamin D testing is medically necessary for diagnosing the following dis- eases: osteoporosis, rickets, osteopenia, malabsorption or g ran- uloma forming disorders . Persons using drugs affecting vitamin D metabolism, persons on chronic ster- oid medication, and person s under strict medical treatment such as persons post organ transplantation and persons with cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes) and sickle cell anaemia are also excluded. In these groups vitamin D testing is not being quest ioned. Also for children with symptoms 1, or with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency ( e.g. children treated with classic anti - epileptics 61, chronic intestine- , liver-, kidney diseases 62 63, during glucocorticoid therapy 64-66 or need for osteoporosis prophylaxis) , 25-OH-D-measurement should be performed 67. The measurement of vitamin D levels in children at risk treated with pharmacological doses is advised to check correct dosage, com pliance 68 and to prevent intoxic ations or nephrocalcinosis 25. 6.2. Intervention The technology of interest is v itamin D testing , and there is a CRQ a for clinical evidence for vitamin D testing and a CRQb for economic evidence of vitamin D testing. For the URQ vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium is the intervention. High dose intermit- tent vitamin D supplementation (bolus doses for >1 month) are excluded, a s depicted in the PICOS -Box in Table 3. High intermittent vitamin D supplementation has been associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures 28. This is why bolus studies of vitamin D supplementation have been excluded. It was beyond the scope of this report to consider certain factors , which may modify the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation such as adherence and dosage, but we did consider the effect of co-admin- istration of vitamin D with calcium . See keyword search strings for more details ( Appendices 1 -3). 6.3. Comparator The technology chosen as comparator is no vitamin D testing/screening and /or vi tamin D supplemen- tation without prior testing of vitamin D for CRQa and CRQb. For the URQ the com parator is no vitamin D supplementation, which means placebo, no treatment or regular care for the URQ , as depicted in the PICOS -Box in Table 3. See keyword search strings for more details ( Appendices 1-3). HTA Scoping Report 19 6.4. Outcomes Clinical health outcomes for vitamin D testing and vitamin D supplementation are divided in bone health- related and non- bone health- related outcomes. Outcomes related to bone health are e.g., rickets, oste- omalacia, PTH (parathyroid hormone) concentrations , bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral con- tent (BMC). I ndirect bone health- related outcomes are fractures , muscle strength or physical perfor- mance. Non- bone health- related outcomes can vary for each group at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency defined by FCN . To address the CRQ , any health outcome is considered as depicted in the PICOS -Box in Table 3. To address the URQ, critical health -related outcomes per risk group were selected by clinical experts as depicted in Table 4. A nutritionist was also consulted for feedback on the selection of outcomes . 6.5. Study Design For the CRQ, any comparative study was eligible for inclusion in our review . For the URQ only umbrella reviews (UR) , HTA reports, SRs (including Cochrane reviews) and MAs (including network MAs/indirect treatment comparisons) were eligible for inclusion in our rev iew, as depicted in the PICOS- Box in Table 3.

Systematic Search Strategy 7.1. Outcomes A systematic literature search was conducted to extract the available evidence in- vestigating clinical and economic effects of vitamin D testing in vario us groups at risk. A synthe- sis of the evidence is presented. A summary and an analysis of the individual outcomes are the objective of a full HTA, if commissioned. Furthermore, a systematic literature search was conducted to extract the available evidenc e investigat- ing which group(s) at risk profit from vitamin D supplementation in terms of improved bone- related or non-bone- related outcomes. In addition to extracting and synthesizing the evidence, the outcomes are summarized. The selected evidence for vitamin D testing (CRQ) and vitamin D supplementation (URQ) is presented in PRISMA flow diagram s in Chapter 8, summarized descriptively in Chapter 9 and presented in tables showing the characteri stics and results of the studies in Chapter 13. 7.2. Search Strategy and Procedure : Effectiveness Three systematic literature search strategies are followed to address CRQa and CRQ b, as well as the URQ . Search Strategy 1: CRQ a for clinical evidence of vitamin D testing Search Strategy 2: CQR b for economic evidence of vitamin D testing Search Strategy 3: URQ for clinical evidence of vitamin D supplementation Search Strategy 1: CRQa. The searches for clinical evidence for CRQ a were performed on 15th January 2019 using MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) , Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) data- base, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL) and Epistemonikos . Search Strategy 2: CQRb: The search for economic evidence for CRQb was performed on 4th January 2019 using MEDLINE (OVID) , EMBASE (OVID) and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD ) database. Details on k eyword search strings and use of search filters are presented in Appendices 1 - 3. Search Strategy 3: URQ: The searches for clinical evidence for URQ were performed on 15th January 2019 using MEDLINE (OVID) , EMBASE (OVID) , Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) data- base, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL) and Epistemonikos . HTA Scoping Report 22 7.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Studies were included when they were published between January 2000 and January 2019. This was because two experts in the field of nutrition confirmed to us that literature on vitamin D supplementation representing the groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency defined by the FCN only started being published from 2000 until December 2018. Only English language studies were considered (as most published scientific literature is in English) ; therefore, we may have missed relevant literature in other languages . Studies with vitamin D supplementation in combination with calcium were included . On the other hand, studies with bolus dose vitamin D supplementation (i.e. high dose intermittent vitamin D supplementation (>1 month)) were excluded. Also, other forms of vitamin D fortification as an inter- vention were excluded. Differences between the three search strategies regard ing different interven- tions, outcomes and study types are described in Table 3. Although for CRQa and the URQ Cochrane CENTRAL and Epistemonikos were searched, these databases were not searched for the review of economic studies (CRQb). 7.4. Screening and selection procedure A total of six reviewers conducted the 1st level screening of all titles and abstracts. A minimum of 5% of the literature was screened in duplicate, prior to single screening. Single screening was only started after confirmation of high agreement (>95%) between the pairs of reviewers. The full selection of titles and abstracts were screened wit h a focus on the FCN -defined at -risk groups described in Table 3. Titles and abstracts that are deemed appropriate from 1st level of screening as they demonstrated possibility of satisfying the PICOS criteria in Table 3, underwent full -text screening. Discrepancies between review- ers were double screened by other members of the review team. Resulting articles were selected for data extraction. Only for Search Strategy 3: URQ (clinical evidence of vitamin D supplementation) , an additional selection procedure was applied, given the large body of available evidence. Strict criteria were applied to select studies in a transparent and reproducible manner. The c riteria include: Only considering the outcomes paired to the relevant risk group (henceforth referred to as \"out- come -risk group pair s\"; e.g. falls in older adults ) listed in Table 4. After full -text screening, all umbrella reviews ( URs) which addressed a relevant outcome- risk group pair were included. URs specifically refer to review s compiling evidence from multiple reviews into one accessible and us eable document. URs focus on broad conditions or problems for which there are compet ing interventions. This is done by highlight ing reviews that address HTA Scoping Report 23 these interventions and their results 69. We classified as URs reports , which focus on identifying systematic reviews and synthesizing their results . Only i f no UR for an outcome- risk group pair was identified, we included all Cochrane reviews that were identified as addressing the outcome- risk group pair. Only if no UR or Cochrane review for an outcome- risk group pair was identified, we included the most recent SR addressing the outcome- risk group pair . If the most recent SR was of a low quality rated by the Assessing Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) check- list 70, we additionally included the second most recent SR addressing the outcome- risk group pair if available. For the URQ only, we may have excluded some relevant studies assessing bone mineral density as an outcome during titles and abstracts screening. This is because we originally did not plan to include bone mineral density as an outcome for the URQ but only decided to do this after titles and abstracts screen- ing. 7.5. Search Strategy and Procedure legal, ethical, social and organizational issues The systematic literature search in this scoping report did not address evidence pertaining to legal, ethical, social and organizational issues related to the HTA topic. This search will be performed in the HTA report, if commissioned. 8. Synthesis of Evidence Base 8.1. PRISMA Flow Diagram PRISMA flow diagram s for the three search strategies are presented in this section in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines 71. 8.1.1. Vitamin D Testing (Clinical; CRQa) The systematic literature search identified 4, 641 studies of which 1, 749 were duplicates. Titles and a b- stracts screening resulted in 84 studies for full text screening. In the full text screen ing, 81 studies were excluded; the reasons for excluding these studies are presented in the PRISMA diagram in Figure 3 and listed i n Appendix 9. Three studies ( one SR72 and two HTAs73 74) were included in the final review. The c haracteristics of the selected studies are presented in Appendix 4. The findings of t he st udies are described in Chapter 9. HTA Scoping Report 24 Figure 3.

Titles and abstracts screening resulted in 16 studies for full text screening. In the full text screening, 13 studies were ex- cluded; the reasons for excluding these studies are presented in the PRISMA diagram in Figure 4 and listed in Appendix 10. Three studies were included in the final review. Figure 4.

Characteristics of the selected studies are tabulated in Appendix 5 and results in Appendix 6. Findings are described in Chapter 9. 8.1.3. Vitamin D Supplementation (URQ) The systematic literature search identified 6,525 studies of which 2,480 were duplicates . Titles and ab- stracts screening r esulted in 835 studies for full tex t screening. In the full text screening, 813 were ex- cluded; the reasons for excluding these studies are presented in the PRISMA diagram in Figure 5 and listed in Appendix 1 1. 21 studies were included in the final review. C haracteristics of the selected stud- ies are tabulated in Appendix 7 and results in Appendix 8. We used the AMSTAR checklist only for the URQ, to assess the quality of the URs and SRs identified from the URQ systematic literature search. We agreed to use the following AMSTAR scoring classifica- tion specified by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH): low quality re- view (score 0 to 3), medium quality (score 4 to 7), and high quality (score 8 to 11) 70. Quality of the reviews was generally assessed as high for pregnant women (median AMSTAR score of 11), medium for older adults (median AMSTAR score of 6), athletes (median AMSTAR score of 6) and persons with bone disorders (median AMSTAR score of 5), and low for obese individuals (median AMSTAR score of 2). AMSTAR scores assessed for each individual review that we included for the URQ , are presented in Appendix 8. Our study selection procedure meant that we focused on umbrella reviews for the majority of outcomes, and only included systematic reviews where an umbrella review was not identified. Such a procedure may mean that we excluded recently published systematic reviews of relevance. In comparison with a full-scale, much more resource- intensive systematic review approach, a certain risk of bias is implied. Furthermore, some umbrella or systematic r eviews could be classified into both the bone disorders and in the older adults groups. In these cases, we as signed the review to the bone disorders group if the authors stated a focus of their review was on persons with a bone disorder or es pecially high risk of having a bone disorder , and otherwise assigned the review to the older adults group. Furthermore, we classed Bolland et al (2018) as an UR 77. Although they looked at indivi dual trials, they also synthesiz ed previously published meta- analyses. For data extraction of Bolland et al (2018) 77, we only extracted the results of the subgroup analyses focused on daily vitamin D supplementation ( and therefore excluded trials of bolus vitamin D supplementation). The methodological quality of the review by Bolland et al has been questioned 78. Bolland et al excluded all trials that compared combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation, with placebo.

Findings 9.1. Findings of Vitamin D Testing 9.1.1. Clinical effectiveness of vitamin D testing (CRQa) Three studies were identified, which were published between 2012 and 2015. The three studies included one SR (LeBlanc et al (2015) 72), two HTA reports (CADTH 2014a 73, CADTH 2014b 74) and zero em- pirical studie s. LeBlanc et al (2015) conducted a systematic search for randomized trials of the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D testing versus no testing, and found zero randomized trials evaluating this 72. CADTH (2014a) conducted a sys tematic search for empirical studies of the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D testing in northern populations, and found zero empirical studies evaluating this 73. CADTH (2014 b) conducted a systematic search for empirical studies of the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D testing in the general population, and found one empirical study evaluating this , but the study had a retrospective design thus was not eli gible for our report 74. In summary, we could not identify any randomized trial -based evidence on vitamin D testing. 9.1.2. Costs and cost -effectiveness of vitamin D testing (CRQb) We identified one costing study and two cost -effectiveness studies of vitamin D testing; findings are summarized below and described and tabulated in Appendix 6. Costs and budget impact A HTA published in 2015, reported a UK costing and budget impact study conducted by the York Health Economics Consortium (YHEC) for a submission to NICE (National Institute of Health and Care Excel- lence) 24. The target populations (aligned with groups at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency as defined by the FCN) were older people (aged 65 and over) and people with darker skin. Assessed were costs and budget impact of vitamin D testing in risk groups and subsequent daily 3000 IU vitamin D supplementation for those deficient ( vitamin D testing and treatment strategy for the deficient ), and vit- amin D supplementation of daily 1000 IU without prior vitamin D testing within each risk group (no vita- min D testing and supplementation strategy for all) . For older people as well as for people with darker skin, overall costs were estimated to be lower if supplementation of vitami n D without prior vitamin D testing was given instead of implementing the vitamin D testing and treatment strategy. Vitamin D testing all UK persons aged 65 or above (population size of 9,176,882 of which 11% were assumed in the study to be vitamin D deficient) , was estimated to result in higher (incremental) costs of GBP 25,359,122 relative to providing vitamin D supplementation without prior vitamin D testing for these HTA Scoping Report 29 people. Vitamin D testing all UK persons with dark skin (populati on size of 15,733,034 of which 69% were assumed in the study to be vitamin D deficient) , was estimated to result in higher (incremental) costs of GBP 160,181,034 relative to providing vitamin D supplementation without prior vit amin D testing for these people. Cost -effectiveness A USA economic evaluation by Lee et al in 2012 assessed the cost -effectiveness of selective vitamin D supplementation following a vitamin D test, versus vitamin D supplementation without prior vitamin D testing , or no vitamin D supplementation, in older women and men (65- 80) 75. Effectiveness estimates were based on a MA of vitamin D supplementation (rather than vitamin D testing) showing that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of falls , although Lee et al did not precisely state which MA they used to parameterize the economic model . Costs and quality -adjusted life years (QALY) were evaluated over a 3- year period. A willingness -to-pay threshold of USD 50,000 per QALY gained was used . For females aged 65- 80 years the vitamin D testing and supplementation strategy was 52.8% likely to be the most cost -effective strategy (as 52.8% of simulations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated the highest net monetary benefit was for this strategy), compared to 36.3% probability for the vitamin D supplementation without prior vitamin D testing strategy . Using the same threshold for males aged 65- 80 years , vitamin D testing and supplementation was 54.3% likely to be the most cost -effective strategy compared to just 38.2% probability for the vitamin D supplementation without prior vitamin D testing strategy . The authors did not estimate incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs) . The French economic evaluation by Zarca et al in 2014 76 assessed the cost -effectiveness of : i) vitamin D testing all older adults aged 65 years without previous hip fracture followed by vitamin D supplementation of those measured as v itamin D deficient and ii) vitamin D supplementation of all older adults without previous hip fracture followed by a test three months after initiation and subsequent treatment adaptation for older adults aged 65 years without a previous hip fracture. Effectiveness estimates were based on two MAs of vitamin D supplementation (rather than vitamin D testing ), which indicated vitamin D supplementation reduces hip fracture risk 79 80. Costs and QALYs were evaluated over the lifetime of the individuals. It was found that for a willingness -to-pay threshold of over EUR 6,000 per QALY, the strategy of vitamin D testing all ol der adults without previous hip fracture followed by vitamin D supplementation of those measured as vitamin D deficient (strategy (i)) was the most likely strategy to be cost -effective. Strategy (i) produced an ICER of \u20ac5,219 per QALY compared to no vitami n D supplementation. HTA Scoping Report 30 In summary, economic results for testing in older adults were mixed and non- conclusive. For older adults as well as for people with darker skin, overall costs were estimated to be lower if supplementation of vitamin D without prior vit amin D testing is given, in comparison with a strategy of vitamin D testing and treatment for the deficient. Conversely, both cost -effectiveness studies that we identified reported that initial vitamin D testing in older adults and subsequent supplementation for the deficient was more cost -effective than initial vita- min D supplementation for all older adults. Both these cost -effectiveness studies based their effect es - timates on meta- analyses which indicated vitamin D supplementation is effect ive at improving falls and fracture outcomes. 9.2. Findings of Vita min D Supplementation (URQ) Study findings in a tabulated format are presented in Appendix 8. 9.2.1. Descriptive Presentation Table 4 refers to more outcomes than are reported in this section, as there were no SRs for some outcomes . For persons with bone disorders, we only identified reviews addressing fracture and BMD outcomes . For obese individuals, we only identified reviews addressing BMD outcomes. For athletes, we only identified reviews addressing injury, physical performance and muscle strength outcomes. For persons with dark skin, we did not identify any reviews addressing the outcomes listed in Table 4. FCN Group 1: Persons with Bone Disorders This section describes the results of the reviews focusing on older adults who have a bone disorder or especially high risk of acquiring one. The studies identified included populations with high fracture risk, low BMD/osteoporosis and previous hip fracture. The effects of vitamin D supplementation may differ in such persons compared to general populations of older adults. URs/ SRs focusing on patients with a pre-existing history of osteomalacia or rickets were not identified. We found fewer studies on vitamin D supplementation in older adults with bone disorders , and they involved smaller sample sizes than stud- ies in general populations of older adults. Fractures (people with high fracture risk ). An UR by Maclean et al (2008) 81 assessed effect s of vitamin D supplementation relative to placebo on the fracture risk in people with a high risk of fracture (e.g. 50% of trial participants with previous osteoporotic fracture at baseline) . In the UR, t wo SRs were identified for vertebral fracture published by Avenell et al (2005) 82 and Stevenson et al (2005) 83. They involved 2745 and 109 participants in the pooled analyses , respectively. Both reported no significant HTA Scoping Report 31 effects for vertebral fracture (RR of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo =3.97 (95% CI : 0.44 to 35.45) in Avenell et al (2005) ; RR of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo =1.02 (95% CI: 0.44 to 2.32) ) in Stevenson et al (2005) ). In the UR, one SR was identified for non- vertebral fracture published by Stevenson et al in 2005 83 (213 participants) , which reported no significant effect (RR not numerically reported but depicted as non -significant in forest plot ). In the UR, one SR was identified for hip fracture (updated in 2014 by Avenell et al with 2820 participants 84), which reported no significant effect (RR of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo=1.08 (95% CI: 0.72 to 1.62) ) in 2014 update. Fractures (people with low bone density or osteoporosis). A SR by Qaseem et al (2017) 85 evalu- ated 68 studies on vitamin D supp lementation alone (without calcium) in persons with low bone density or osteoporosis, and assessed that the effect on fracture risk was uncertain due to mixed findings across MAs/ RCTs ; the authors evaluated the quality of the studies to be of a moderate quality from GRA DE assessment . Second fracture (person s after first hip fracture). A SR by Egan et al (2008) identified one relevant RCT including 76 participants of the effect of vitamin D plus calcium supplementation on the risk of second hip fracture in persons recovering from their first hip fracture 86. Over 12 months, 8% (n=3) of the vitamin D plus calcium group experienced a second fracture; whereas 14% (n=5) of placebo group experienced a second fracture. Due to the small sample size, the statistical significance of this difference between groups was not assessed. Bone mineral density (female elderly nursing home residents). A SR by Parikh et al (2009) 87 iden- tified three relevant RCTs on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD in nursing home residents . All three RCTs comprised of female nursing home residents aged at least 79 years; thus the majority were likely to have osteoporosis. All three RCTs found that vitamin D plus calcium supplementation was associated with higher BMD outcomes after 18 to 24 months ; however, confidence intervals were not reported . In summary, the evidence of effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally mixed and sparse for persons with a bone disorder . FCN Group 2: Older Adults Falls . A total of three URs were identified assessing the effect of vitamin D supplement ation alone on falls (Stubbs et al (2015 a), Medical Advisory (2008) and Poscia et al (2018) ). Stubbs et al (2015a ) 88 and Medical Advisory (2008) 89 indicated no effect on falls resulting from vitamin D supplementation HTA Scoping Report 32 alone. However, Poscia et al (2018) 90, reported a reduction in falls in three of the SRs that they identi- fied. Three URs were identified which assessed vitamin D co -administered with calcium (Stubbs et al (2015 a) 88, Poscia et al (2018) 90 and Medical Advisory (2008) 89), all three indicated a resultant reduction in falls , although Medical Advisory (2008) found this reduction was evident for women only (RR=0.83 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.95) ; 2,121 women from two trials)89. Four URs 77 91 -93 were identified, which assessed mixed studies of vitamin D either alone or with calcium . Of these one UR 77 report ed a statistically sig- nificant reduction in falls from daily vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium (Bolland et al (2018) subgroup results , RR=0.92, 95% 0.87 to 0.98). A nother UR also indicat ed a reduction in falls from vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium (Scragg et al (2012) ) 91, but the other two URs indicat ed no effect on falls from vitamin D with or without calcium (Theodoratou et al (2014) 92 and Stubb s et al (2015 b) 93). Only one UR on the effect of vitamin D supplementation with calcium on fall - related fractures or fall -related injuries was identified, which was published by Medical Advisory in 2008 89. This UR reported a non-significant reduction in to studies vitamin D and calcium, 3,980 participants) and fall -related injuries (RR=0.48 (95% CI: 0.12 to 1.84) , one study, 148 women). Fractures . Out of the two URs assessing vitamin D supplement ation alone (Vestergaard et al ( 2011) 94 and Poscia et al (2018) 90), both indicated no effect on fractures (either vertebral o r non- vertebral) . Out of the two URs identified assessing vitamin D co- administered with calcium (Vestergaard et al (2011)94 and Poscia et al (2018)90), both indicated a reduction in fract ures from supplementation, although Vestergaard et al 94 indicated that this reduction was evident for non- vertebral but not for vertebral frac- ture, both based on low -quality evidence. Out of the three URs identified assessing mixed studies of vitamin D supplementation either alone or with calcium , two indicated no effect on fractures (Theodora- tou et al (2014) 92 and Bolland et al (2018) subgroup results ) 77, although the third UR (Scragg et al (2012) ) 91 indicated a reduction in some types of fractures . Muscle strength . Two URs for muscle strength outcomes in older adults w ere identified published in 2018 and 2014, respectively. The 2018 UR was published by De Spiegeleer et al 95, and identified two SRs by Anagnostis et al (2015) and Beaudart et al (2017) . Evidence of improvement in muscle strength from vitamin D supplementation in women was observed in the review by Anagnostis et al 96, but in the review by Beaudart et al 97, no effect of vitamin D supplementation was found. The 2014 UR by Theo- doratou et al 92 identifie d one MA comprising three RCTs that found non- significant improvement in lower extremity muscle strength from vitamin D supplementation (standardised mean CI: - 0.11 to 0.20) ). HTA Scoping Report 33 Physical performance. Two URs for physical performance out comes from vitamin D supplementation in older adults published in 2018 and 2014, were identified. The 2018 UR was published by De Spie- geleer et al 95 and identified two reviews (one UR and one SR); with the first review finding improvement in the timed- up-and-go test from vitami n D supplementation in 50% of included RCTs, and the second review reporting no improvement in gait based on studies of limited methodological quality. The 2014 UR was published by Theodoratou et al 92 and identified one MA comprising three RCTs that observed improvem ent (i.e. reduction) in the balance sway from vitamin D supplementation mineral density . Unlike the other outcomes in this section, which were based on a systematic search, we carried out a non- systematic search to identify SRs evaluating BMD. For older adults, one UR for a BMD outcome was identified which was published by Bolland et al in 2018 (subgroup results ) 77. In this UR, a subgroup meta- analysis of daily vitamin D supplementation was carried out by the authors , in which data was pooled from 18 RCTs . In the subgroup analysis, no statistically significant improvement in lumbar spine BMD from daily vitamin D supplementation was observed (weighted mean percentage difference=0.15% (95% CI: - 0.13 to 0.4 4)). All-cause mortality. The most recent UR we identified for all- cause mortality was from Poscia et al (2018) 90. The UR concluded that vitamin D supplementation did not have a significant effect on all - cause mortality in a population of post -menopausal women and older men ( for vitamin D supplementa- tion alone compared with no vitamin D supplementation, RR=0.9 9 (95% CI: 0.94 to 1.03) : for vitamin D co-administered with calcium supplementation compared with no vitamin D supplementation, (95% to 1.02) ). However, an UR by Scragg et al (2012) 91 identified two SRs which both indi- cated no statistically significant reduction in mortality when vitamin D is administered alone but a statis- tically significant reduction in mortality from supplementation when vitamin D is co- administered with calcium to people ag ed 60 years . Cancer -related mortality. A Coch rane review by Bjelakovic et al (2014) 98 identified and pooled the results of four RCTs that included 44,492 participants in total , to assess the effect of vitamin D supple- mentation on cancer -related mortality in postmenopausal women and older men. The authors found that, based on moderate quality evidence, vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer by Husebo et al (2016)99 on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pain in persons with dementia identified one relevant RCT , which found no significant effect of Vitamin D3 supplementation (p>0.10 for all pain measures administered to persons with advanced dementia) . HTA Scoping Report 34 Findings for subpopulations of older adults Stakeholders made us aware of the following three studies: Cameron et al (2018) 100, Tricco et al (2017) 101 and Zhang et al (2019) 102, which however were not eligible for inclusion according to our pre- defined selection criteria. We report these analyses due to concerns that effects may be stronger or better v isible in some subpopulations of older adults . These studies include participants with mean age of 65 years for the main analysis. A Cochrane review published by Cameron et al in 2018 100 found, in a subgroup of participants in care facilit ies and hospitals, that vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of falls 0.76 to 1.12) of fractures (RR=1.09 (95% CI : 0.58 to 2.03), 4, 464 participants ). A network meta- analysis published by Tricco et al in 2017 101 found, in a subgro up of participants re- ceiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation combined with clinic -level quality improvement strate- gies (e.g. , case management) and multifactorial assessment and treatment (e.g. , comprehensive geri- atric assessment), that the study intervention reduced the risk of injurious falls (odds ratio=0.12 (95% CI: 0.03 to 0.55; 41,596 participants ). A systematic review published by Zhang et al in 2019 102 found, in subgroups supplemented with differ- ent modes of vitamin D, that both, vitamin D2 (RR=1.03 (95% CI: 0.98 reduce all -caus e mortality . However, the authors reported that all -cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation (P for interaction=0.04). In summary, the evidence of effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally mixed for older adults . FCN Group 3: Obese Individuals Bone mineral density (BMD) . Unlike the other outcomes in this review , which were based on a sys- tematic search, we carried out a non- systematic search in July 2019 to identify SRs evaluating BMD. For obese individuals, a SR from Bassatne et al (2019) 103 performed a search from 2010 to 2018 and identified one RCT assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD in obese individuals. The RCT ad ministered vitamin D3, and observed no significant differences between groups regarding change in BMD. HTA Scoping Report 35 In summary, the evidence of effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally sparse for obese individuals . FCN Group 4: Pregnant Women Pre-eclampsia. An UR by Browne et al (2016) 104 identified one SR assessing pregnancy -related out- comes (e.g. pre- eclampsia, low birthweight, maternal gestational diabetes, preterm birth) from vitamin D supplementation in pregnant w omen. The SR was updated in 2019 by Palacios et al 105. Both the original systematic review and its update in 2019 , found zero RCTs on the effect of vitamin D supple- mentation on pre- eclampsia in a Western country . Low birthweight. An UR by Browne et al (2016) 104 identified one SR assessing pregnancy -related outcomes from vitamin D supplementation in pregnant w omen. The SR was updated in 2019 by Palacios et al 105, and the combined searches found one Western country trial on the effect of vitamin D supple- mentation on low birthweight , which reported no statistically significant effect (RR for vitamin D mono- therapy relative to no intervention was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.23 to 1.21) based on a sample of 126 women) . Maternal gestational diabetes. An UR by Browne et al (2016) 104 identified one SR assessing preg- nancy -related outcomes from vitamin D supplementation in pregnant w omen. The SR was updated in 2019 by Palacios et al 105. Both the original systematic review and its update in 2019, found zero trials on the effect of vitam in D supplementation on maternal gestational diabetes in a Western country . Preterm birth. An UR by Browne et al (2016) 104 identified one SR assessing pregnancy -related out- comes from vitamin D supplementation in pregnant w omen. The SR was updated in 2019 by Palacios et al 105, and pooled the results of seven trials across developed and developing countries on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on preterm birth (< 37 weeks) . The SR found the RR of a preterm birth of vitamin D monotherapy relative to no intervention was 0.66 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.30), and concluded that vitamin D monotherapy supplementation may make little or no difference in the ris k of having a preterm birth based on low certainty evidence. Offspring bone mineral content (BMC) . Unlike the other outcomes in this review , which were based on a systematic search, we carried out a non- systematic search to identify SRs evaluating BMC . For the offspring of pregnant women, a 2014 SR by Harvey et al 106 identified one RCT assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women on offspring bone mineral content . There was no sig- nificant difference in the BMC of the forearms of babies born to these women between the intervention and comparator groups (mean bone mas s outcome of 3.19 units at birth in the vitamin D and calcium group, 3.10 units at birth in the \"no intervention\" group; no p value reported). The SR also evaluated that the RCT had a high risk of bias. HTA Scoping Report 36 Maternal bone mineral density. Unlike the other outcomes in this review , which were based on a systematic search, we carried out a non- systematic search to identify SRs evaluating BMD . For pregnant women, a SR by Cranney et al (2007) 33 was identified , and found zero trials on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women on maternal bone mineral density . Maternal fractures. We found one SR on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women on maternal fractures, which was published by Cranney et al in 2007 33, and identified zero trials. In summary, the evidence of effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally sparse for preg- nant women. FCN Group 5: Children and Adults with a Dark Skin Tone No appropriate SR w as found, but a future SR for which the protocol has been published ( Cashman et al (2019)) 107 may be of relevance . FCN Group 6: Athletes Injury. We identified a SR by Farrokhyar et al (2017) 108, which found no RCTs evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on injury in athletes. Physical perf ormance. We identified a SR by Farrokhyar et al (2017) 108, which found seve n RCTs evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on physical performance outcomes in athletes. The SR found no significant improvement in physical performance from vitamin D supplementation, as no significant between- groups differences were found in vertical jump height (0.92 cm ( 95% CI: -0.55 to 2.44) ), press (2.05 ( 95% CI: -5.5 to 9.6) ) s ( 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.12) ). Muscle strength. We identified a SR published by Chiang et al (2017) 109 (rated low quality by AM- STAR) , which found four trials evaluating the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation and two trials evalu- ating the effect of vitamin D2 supplementation on muscle strength. In the SR, v itamin D3 was shown to result in an improvement in muscle strength (p 0.05 in two trials; non- significant improvements in mus- cle strength in the other two trials). Vitamin D2 was found to be ineffective at i mpacting muscle strength in both trials (p>0.05 in each of the two trials). HTA Scoping Report 37 In summary, the evidence of effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally mixed/sparse for athletes . 10. Feasibility of HTA and Conclusions The focus of the present report was to identify studies , which have assessed the effect of vitamin D testing on clinical outcomes in select ed FCN- defined risk groups, rather than to explore the mechanisms by which vitamin D testing may improve clinical outcomes. In the systematic literature search, we found a lack of clinical evidence for vitamin D testing for persons with bone disorders, older adults, obese individuals, pregnant women, people with dark skin, and ath- letes , as we identified three reviews but no primary studies . Also, the study situation regarding the cost - effectiveness of vitamin D tests is limited. Therefore, conducting a full HTA on vitamin D testing could not be expected to yield additional, meaningful results . In populations who are likely to have low vitami n D status, vitamin D testing may be helpful in promoting adherence to prescribed supplementation, and informing the correct vitamin D dosage. A vitamin D test is useful and necessary for risk groups if a differentiated vitamin D supplementation with indiv idual sat- uration according to a pre-existing level of vitamin D deficiency is aimed for 110. However, n o definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of vitamin D testing sinc e no trials have been con- ducted to directly assess the impact of vitam in D testing on health outcomes (a previous HTA from the Washington State Health Care Authority in the USA in 2012 also came to this conclusion 49). Economic results for testing in older adults were mixed and non-conclusive. In regards to vitamin D supplementation, we pursued a systematic but non- comprehensive approach to the literature search and selection, which car ries a potential risk of bias . On this basis, the evidence on effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation was generally mixed and not conclusive. We conclude that there is not sufficient evidence that would support the utility to test vitamin D in persons with bone disorders, older adults, obese individuals, pregnant women, people with dark ski n, and ath- letes . Vitamin D testing is recommended for patients where it is medically necessary, and this is not disputed in the present report. The lack of available evidence for vitamin D testing for defined at -risk groups from our review, could be infor mative in guiding a decision pol icy on vitamin D testing. HTA Scoping Report 38 11. Outlook The scoping report aims to map the existing literature in the field of interest in terms of the volume, nature, and characteristics of the primary research. The scoping report of a body of literature is used to analyse the complexity and/or heterogeneity of the topic. Based on the scoping report the feasibility to produce a full HTA has been estimated. A full HTA on vitamin D testing cannot be justified at present due to the absence of clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D testing. Only after such studies have become available can the topic be re- considered. 12. References 1. Federal Commission for Nutrition.
