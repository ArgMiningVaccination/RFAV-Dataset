Symptoms of an abruption usually include bleeding and abdominal pain. Abscess: A pus-filled cavity; an abscess in the breast of a nursing woman can result from untreated mastitis, or breast infection. Symptoms of an abscess include throbbing pain, swelling, tenderness, localized heat and fever. Treatment includes antibiotics and possible surgical drainage. Active labor: Part of the first [stage of labor](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/labor-and-delivery/childbirth-stages/three-phases-of-labor.aspx) when the cervix dilates from approximately six to 10 centimeters. Active labor lasts an average of four to 10 hours. The contractions during active labor are strong, long (40 to 60 seconds each) and frequent (three to four minutes apart). Acupressure: A form of [complementary and alternative medicine](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/week-24/complementary-and-alternative-medicines.aspx) that has roots in ancient Chinese medicine.

[Acupuncture](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy-acupuncture.aspx): A form of complementary and alternative medicine. Thin needles are inserted in select locations of the body and stimulated and manipulated through the skin to help ease pain and balance the body's energy flow. In pregnancy, acupuncture can be used to combat morning sickness, labor pains and back pains. Read This Next Afterbirth: The placenta and membranes after they have been delivered from the uterus during the third stage of childbirth. Afterpains: Cramping triggered by the contractions of the uterus in the postpartum phase as it shrinks and makes its normal descent back into the pelvis. Alexander technique: Teaching conscious control over posture and movement, this technique can be used in childbirth education to help women cope with labor pain. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): A protein produced by the fetus that can be detected in the mother's blood most accurately between weeks 15 and 18 of pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein test: A blood test given to an expectant mother typically between weeks 15 and 18 of pregnancy to screen for an increased risk of the baby having certain birth defects. High levels of AFP may be associated with spina bifida (a neural tube defect) or an increased chance of problems with baby's growth later in pregnancy; low levels may be associated with Down syndrome. The test is used to decide whether more invasive testing, such as an amniocentesis, should be considered. Alveoli: Tiny milk-producing sacs that are arranged in clusters throughout the breast. Each breast has hundreds of alveoli. Once the milk is produced, it's secreted into tube-shaped ducts that travel to the nipple. Amenorrhea: Absence of menstruation. [Amniocentesis](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/prenatal-testing-amniocentesis/): A diagnostic test to determine whether the fetus has any abnormalities. Performed anywhere between weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy (though more commonly between weeks 16 and 18), amniocentesis tests the fluid inside the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby. The fluid, which contains the baby's skin cells, is drawn from the uterus through a hollow needle inserted through the expectant mother's abdominal wall and is tested for chromosomal abnormalities, genetic abnormalities, or other diseases. Amnioinfusion: Injection of a sterile saline solution into the amniotic sac when there isn't enough amniotic fluid, when there is thick meconium staining or to prevent the umbilical cord from being squeezed during delivery when the level of amniotic fluid is too low. Amniotic fluid: The clear fluid in the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus during pregnancy. Amniotic fluid cushions the fetus, protects it against infection, stabilizes its temperature and helps a baby's lungs develop.
