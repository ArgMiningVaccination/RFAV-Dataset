A great acupuncture point for overall health is ST36 or Stomach 36. Arguably one of the most important points, ST36's main function is to strengthen the spleen and stomach to make Qi and blood to resolve Damp. But what does this actually mean?

Repeat this twice a day for 7 days. Don't have a moxa stick? Give yourself a small massage at home! Press down to stimulate the point, and do this every day or so for a couple of minutes.
