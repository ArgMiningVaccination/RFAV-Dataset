The zones of inhibition against these organisms were greatest for camphor, menthol, thymol, and eucalyptus oil. Interestingly, there were large zones of inhibition and a synergistic effect when a mixture of components was used against T rubrum and T mentagrophytes.36 The in vitro activity of thymol, a component of TCS, was tested against Candida (subspecies zygis) activity, which was superior to Thymus mastichina, and all 3 compounds had similar MIC and minimal lethal concentration values. The authors showed that the antifungal mechanism was due to cell membrane damage and inhibition of germ tube formation.37 It should be noted that Candida species are less common causes of onychomycosis, and it is not known whether this data is applicable to T rubrum. In another study, the authors investigated the antifungal activity of Thymus pulegioides and found that MIC ranged from 0.16 to 0.32 L/mL for dermatophytes and Aspergillus strains and 0.32 to 0.64 L/mL for Candida species. When an essential oil concentration of 0.08 L/mL was used against T rubrum, ergosterol content decreased by 70 %, indicating that T pulegioides inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis in T rubrum.38 Clinical Observations and Clinical Trial There is one report documenting the clinical observations on a group of patients with a clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis who were instructed to apply TCS to affected nail(s) once daily.36 Eighty-five charts were reviewed (mean age, 77 years), and although follow-up was not complete or standardized, the following data were reported: 32 (38%) cleared their fungal infection, 21 (25%) had no record of change but also no record of compliance, 19 (22%) had only 1 documented follow-up visit, 9 (11%) reported they did not use the treatment, and 4 (5%) did not return for a follow-up visit. Of the 32 patients whose nails were cured, 3 (9%) had clearance within 5 months, 8 (25%) within 7 months, 11 (34%) within 9 months, 4 (13%) within 11 months, and 6 (19%) within 16 months.36 A small pilot study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of daily application of TCS in the treatment of onychomycosis in patients 18 years and older with at least 1 great toenail affected.40 The primary end points were mycologic cure at 48 weeks and clinical cure at the end of the study graded as complete, partial, or no change. The secondary end point was patient satisfaction with the appearance of the affected nail at 48 weeks. Eighteen participants completed the study; 55% (10/18) were male, with an average age of 51 years (age range, 30-85 years). The mean initial amount of affected nail was 62% (range, 16%-100%), and cultures included dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and molds. With TCS treatment, 27.8% (5/18) showed mycologic cure of which 4 (22.2%) had a complete clinical cure. Ten participants (55.6%) had partial clinical cure and 3 (16.7%) had no clinical improvement. Interestingly, the 4 participants who had complete clinical cure had baseline cultures positive for either T mentagrophytes or C parapsilosis. Most patients were content with the treatment, as 9 participants stated that they were very satisfied and 9 stated that they were satisfied. The average ratio of affected to total nail area declined from 63% at screening to 41% at the end of the study (P<.001). No adverse effects were reported with study drug.40 NCR Lacquer Background Resins are natural products derived from coniferous trees and are believed to protect trees against insects and microbial pathogens.41 Natural coniferous resin derived from the Norway spruce tree (Picea abies) mixed with boiled animal fat or butter has been used topically for centuries in Finland and Sweden to treat infections and wounds.42-44 The activity of NCR has been studied against a wide range of microbes, demonstrating broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria and fungi.45-48 There are 2 published clinical trials evaluating NCR in the treatment of onychomycosis.49,50 In Vitro Data Natural coniferous resin has shown antifungal activity against T mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, and T rubrum in vitro, which was demonstrated using medicated disks of resin on petri dishes inoculated with these organisms.46 In another study, the authors evaluated the antifungal activity of NCR against human pathogenic fungi and yeasts using agar plate diffusion tests and showed that the resin had antifungal activity against Trichophyton species but not against Fusarium and most Candida species. Electron microscopy of T mentagrophytes exposed to NCR showed that all cells were dead inside the inhibition zone, with striking changes seen in the hyphal cell walls, while fungal cells outside the inhibition zone were morphologically normal.47 In another report, utilizing the European Pharmacopoeia challenge test, NCR was highly effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as C albicans.42 Clinical Trials In one preliminary observational and prospective clinical trial, 15 participants with clinical and mycologic evidence of onychomycosis were instructed to apply NCR lacquer once daily for 9 months with a 4-week washout period, with the primary outcome measures being clinical and mycologic cure.49 Thirteen (87%) enrolled participants were male and the average age was 65 years (age range, 37-80 years). The DLSO subtype was present in 9 (60%) participants. The mycologic cure rate at the end of the study was 65% (95% CI, 42%-87%), and none achieved clinical cure, but 6 participants showed some improvement in the appearance of the nail.49 The second trial was a prospective, controlled, investigator-blinded study of 73 patients with clinical and mycologic evidence of toenail onychomycosis who were randomized to receive NCR 30%, amorolfine lacquer 5%, or 250 mg oral terbinafine.50 The primary end point was mycologic cure at 10 months, and secondary end points were clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance. Clinical efficacy was based on the proximal linear growth of healthy nail and was classified as unchanged, partial, or complete. Partial responses were described as substantial decreases in onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and streaks. A complete response was defined as a fully normal appearance of the toenail. Most patients were male in the NCR were 64, 63, and 64 years, respectively. Trichophyton rubrum was cultured most often in all cases were from T mentagrophytes. A summary of the results is shown in Table 2. Patient compliance was 100% in all except 1 patient in the amorolfine treatment group with moderate compliance. There were no adverse events, except for 2 in the terbinafine "}
