And your Minster chiropractor understands that the pain relief may come too slowly for our suffering Minster back pain patients. So Minster Chiropractic Center keeps up on natural pain relievers that may be relieving in the interim. Natural herb pain relievers most accepted are curcumin, turmeric, white willow bark, boswellia serrata, and devil's claw. Alone or in combination, these herbs may be a Minster back pain sufferers best friend. So how do they work? What are they? Well, curcumin is a natural product and member of the ginger root family. It's an herb, known for its spiciness yet its ironic calming effect on stomach upset. It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent. Minster Chiropractic Center's daily rival in chiropractic practice! Research suggests that curcumin may reduce swelling and help ease symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Researchers even suggest the therapeutic potential of curcumin for spinal cord injury.
