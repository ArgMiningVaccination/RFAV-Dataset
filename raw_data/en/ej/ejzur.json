At the award ceremony, she was presented with the World Fantasy Award trophy\u2014at the time, a bust of H. P. Lovecraft, an influential fantasy and horror writer. He was also a notorious racist. Though Okorafor is a Black writer who identifies as Nigerian-American and Igbo, her greatest professional achievement was honored with the image of a racist [1](#f1) ( [\"Lovecraft's racism\"](#b29)). The choice of Lovecraft as the World Fantasy Award model, a choice that stood for over thirty-five years, and the lack of embarrassment in presenting Love-craft's head to a Black woman [2](#f2) illustrate two broad tendencies in fantasy literature and its wider culture. First, fantasy has a long-standing problem with whiteness. By whiteness, I refer not to a biological marker like skin color, but to a system of power and privilege developed and maintained by \"deliberately contrived ruling-class\" (Allen 3) maneuverings. This system socially constructs a center of white dominant norms, and marginalizes, or pushes out and keeps out, those who do not fit within those norms. These actions operate in society at a structural level and are \"a set of cultural practices that are usually unmarked and unnamed\" ( [Frankenberg 1](#b13)). No one declared the World Fantasy Award a white award, but it was very much a white award. Second, inclusion of diverse writers for award consideration does not, by itself, solve this problem of whiteness. Increasing racial representation in fantasy award nominations, important as it is, without naming and addressing the system of whiteness leaves the structural problems in place. [End Page 81] The problem of whiteness in fantasy (imaginative narratives about worlds that bend, defy, or contradict our rules of reality, along with the broader cultures associated with those narratives such as fandom and marketing) is not limited to the genre's awards. Many of the genre's more popular works nestle themselves in white, European, medievalesque worlds\u2014from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth to C. S. Lewis's Narnia to Terry Brooks's Shannara to Lloyd Alexander's Prydain to J. K. Rowling's Hogwarts. These worlds, predominantly populated by white people saved by white heroes, cast whiteness as pervasive yet leave it unnamed and uninterrogated. The result recreates the dominant culture of whiteness within the confines of the fantastic. Nnedi Okorafor is an out-spoken critic of white hegemony and colonialism in fantasy culture. She has spoken publicly, for example, against the World Fantasy Award trophy ( [\"Lovecraft's racism\"](#b29)). While her fiction, both children's and adult, also subverts many of the implicit biases surrounding the assumed normativity of whiteness often found in fantasy genres, [3](#f3) scholarship focusing specifically on her consideration of whiteness is uncommon. Scholars more often have focused on Okorafor's postcolonial critique of Western modes of being and knowing. Both Alice Curry and Judith Rahn, for example, have explored ways Okorafor expands Western concepts of the human. Curry argues that Okorafor's \"hybrid identities\" (38), notably Sunny's agency in the \"visible and invisible\" (38) worlds of the physical and the magic world, call into question Western ideas around ecocriticism. Okorafor's writing, according to Curry, reveals an \"animistic mode of being-in-the-world that successfully deconstructs the human-environment or culture-nature dichotomy\" (38) at the root of ecocriticism. Likewise, Judith Rahn considers the \"narrative shifts\" (83) in Okorafor's Lagoon, where human, animal, and alien beings all take on a narrator role. Rahn argues the novel \"questions the singularity of human experience and underlines the interconnectedness of all life on earth\" (83). Other scholars have focused on Okorafor's postcolonial vision in expanding concepts of genre. Joshua Yu Burnett, for example, highlights a compelling aspect of Okorafor's texts\u2014a multilayered criticality. She plays concepts against each other, sometimes to dizzying effect. Of Okorafor's novels The Shadow Shaper and Who Fears Death, Burnett writes that they \"conduct a postcolonial revision of speculative fiction and a speculative revision of postcolonialism\" (133). It is worth noting that while Burnett focuses on the young adult novel The Shadow Shaper, he does not consider the young adult aspects of the text and, in fact, only mentions its young adult status in passing. In contrast to Burnett, Louisa Uchum Egbumike focuses more explicitly on the role Okorafor's novels play as children's texts. Egbumike argues that Okorafor's engagement with children's literature, specifically her crafting of the pre-colonial Ekpe or Leopard Society as a contemporary [End Page 82] anti-colonial movement, is particularly relevant as most decolonial literature from the African continent focuses on narratives marketed to adults. Okorafor's children's literature, however, creates new \"sites of resistance to (neo) colonial constructions of Africa\" (144). This paper carries on the work of these scholars as I consider the multilayered nature of Okorafor's children's text Akata Witch\u2014how the novel expands the possibilities, yet questions the limitations of the fantastic. While I write extensively on Okorafor's decolonial work, this paper expands the literature around Okorafor by focusing explicitly on her engagement with whiteness as a target of decolonialism. To help understand the context of whiteness in fantasy literature and, in turn, ways Okorafor's texts function as an intervention to whiteness, I draw on Andre Carrington's work in Speculative Blackness. Carrington critiques one of the primary modes of analysis in scholarship on race and representation in speculative literature [4](#f4) (fantasy and science fiction broadly defined)\u2014the tendency to highlight underrepresentation of disenfranchised groups. Building on the work of Stuart Hall who calls for a full consideration of blackness that includes but then goes beyond a critique of white hegemony, Carrington stresses the need to look at \"the generative quality of marginality in the popular imagination\" (13). In other words, the critique of whiteness is sufficient to raise awareness of hegemony but insufficient to form new visions that can replace that hegemony. Something more, something generative, is needed. It is within this context that Carrington calls for a specific critique of the \"overrepresentation of whiteness\" (17) in speculative literature, in contrast to focusing on the underrepresentation of minoritized voices. While scholarship that questions underrepresentation is critical work, it does not, according to Carrington, get directly to whiteness, \"the source of the problem\" (17), thus leaving hegemonic structures in place. While it is important to raise awareness of underrepresentation, a sole focus here leaves whiteness at the center of social power, resulting in a \"failure to acknowledge even the existence of whiteness as a socially significant racial identity\" (16). To dismantle whiteness in speculative genres such as fantasy, Carrington offers a twofold solution: first, to refract white fantasy back to the reader as to \"dislodge Whiteness and patriarchy from the genre's identity\" (19) and second, to employ speculation, including fantasy, as a productive space in Black cultural production that extends conceptualizations of blackness. In a similar vein, Ebony Elizabeth Thomas in her book The Dark Fantastic posits that Western fantasy is written by, about, and for white readers. One result of fantasy's hegemonic center is \"the implicit message that readers . . . of color receive as they read [fantasy] texts is that we are the villains (23 emphasis in original). Thomas calls for a \"shift away from white heroic protagonists and illuminating the imaginary stories of people of color\" (11). Much of Thomas's book considers the ways [End Page 83] whiteness interprets and portrays \"the dark other in fantasy texts, and how those texts can be emancipated\" or freed from the cycle of whiteness that frames Western fantasy. She also points out that the best solution may not be emancipation but to side-step Western fantasy to allow Black and Brown writers the freedom to create their own stories on their own terms. Okorafor's novel Akata Witch, published one year after Who Fears Death, captures this tussle between decentering whiteness and allowing black speculative fiction to create something new. Sunny, the protagonist of Akata Witch, is an albino Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can perform juju (or magic). In Okorafor's world, those who can perform juju are Leopards, receiving magic ability through a spiritual heredity from both parents. Those who have no ability are called Lambs. Sunny fits into neither category. She is a free agent\u2014one who can perform juju but lacks a direct spiritual heredity (Sunny's grandmother, not her parents, was a Leopard). In the novel, Sunny joins three other children\u2014Nigerians Orlu and Chichi, and African-American Sasha (from Chicago's South Side)\u2014to undertake rigorous training in the magic arts under the direction of mentors called scholars. Together, the four children form an Oha coven, \"a group of mystical combination, set up to defend against something bad\" (84). Their studies prepare them to battle Black Hat, a US-funded ritual killer preying on local children. In this paper, I trace the anti-racist possibilities of the fantastic in Nnedi Okorafor's Akata Witch. Specifically, I argue marginality\" ( [Carrington 13](#b6)) that destabilizes whiteness in children's fantasy literature. She does this by incorporating disenfranchised voices of transnational youth of color to create new visions of marginalized subjectivities. First, I consider Okorafor's decentering of whiteness in the real. By examining the character Sasha, a Black American child who experienced racial violence at the hands of Chicago police officers, I show how Okorafor uses the exclusion of Black children from full US citizenship as a test case for the decolonial possibilities of the fantastic. Second, I move to Okorafor's decentering of whiteness in the genre of the fantastic. I show how she complicates decoloniality by crafting an inclusive magic community (Nigerian Leopards) to counteract the racism in the real. Her depiction of Leopard treatment of free agents, however, suggest there is a level of artifice to the inclusivity in the fantastic. I show how Okorafor's Leopard community, and in turn the genre of the fantastic, is infiltrated by colonial notions of white hegemony. Finally, I examine Sunny's marginality to show how she embodies Carrington's \"generative quality of marginality,\" that extends the possibilities of the fantastic. I show how Sunny grows from a marginalized free agent, to a Leopard who reclaims aspects of her marginalized identities, to ultimately one who reclaims marginality itself. [End Page 84] Decentering Whiteness in the Real: Sasha and the (Excluded) Black Citizen To think through Akata Witch's work to \"dislodge\" ( [Carrington 19](#b6)) whiteness from the center of fantasy, I first turn to the real, where Okorafor uses Sasha's back-story as a Black American from Chicago to explore the decolonial potential of fantasy literature. Specifically, the case of Sasha opens up questions around hegemonic notions of racialized belonging in relation to US citizenship. Sasha was sent to Nigeria as punishment for using juju to assault a police officer, a grave violation of Leopard rules. According to Sasha's account, his forbidden use of juju on a Lamb police officer was to defend a woman of color from the officer's abuse. The roots of Sasha's grievances, however, run deeper than a singular event with the police officers. He calls out the Chicago police for their brutality, iterating the idea that US racism is systemic: \"[The police] were harassing me and my friends,\" Sasha said. \"They were pushing around this girl I know. And they were just . . . they were abusing the power they were given! Y'all don't know what it's like for a black man in the US. And y'all certainly don't know Chicago cops on the South Side. Here everyone's black, so you don't have [this type of trouble].\"(60) Sasha makes two important observations regarding his trouble with the law. First, he explicitly frames his experience as a racialized one\u2014a situation specific to \"a black man.\" Second, he contextualizes this racialized experience within the US civic system. He is \"a black man in the US.\" When he contrasts his life in Chicago to the lives of those in Nigeria, he indicates that his civic experience in the US remains outside a white norm. This was not an individual instance of police violence but is instead an act within a system of whiteness under which Black subjects live. While Sasha is a legal citizen of the US (by birth), his experiences in Nigeria point to an unsaid racialized normativity of US citizenship, an idea reiterated in an argument between Sasha, an African American, and Orlu, a Nigerian. Orlu accuses Sasha of coming to Nigeria because he was in trouble in the United States and of hiding the fact from the other children. When he pushes Sasha to \"tell [the children] in original). While Orlu means American [5](#f5) as an insult, it is worth noting that black stands as an unintentional qualifier of Sasha's US citizenship. He is not called a \"troublemaking American\" but a \"troublemaking black American.\" The word \"black\" becomes a marker of difference, where white is the implied norm. Even though Sasha is surrounded by Black Nigerians, a Black Nigerian reminds him that his blackness marginalizes him in his home country. [End Page 85] Elizabeth Cohen's work around race and childhood in US citizenship, which calls attention to the unsaid role of race and whiteness in citizenship, underscores the weight Sasha lives under. She claims the US civic imaginary operates under racialized rules of inclusion/exclusion. [6](#f6) The \"fundamental principles of American public law,\" she argues, \"have contributed to an understanding of citizenship driven by concerns of difference, particularly racial difference, ascribed among native-born citizens. This internal differentiation domestically produces foreignness that renders ostensible citizens . . . foreign despite their native birth\" ( [\"Carved\" 32-33](#b7)). In other words, although people of color, like Sasha, are technically brought into the fold of official citizenship, they remain excluded or foreign despite their official status. When Sasha is subject to police violence or uneven school discipline, the text reiterates his standing as a member of \"marginal native-born groups who have continually been deprived of full citizenship within the American polity\" ( [\"Carved\" 33](#b7)). Complementing her work around race and citizenship, Cohen also writes about children's access to full citizenship. She argues that children are largely denied full civic belonging as they are viewed \"not as an ever-present segment of the populace, but rather as future adults\" ( [\"Neither Seen Nor Heard\" 221](#b8)). [7](#f7) Okorafor incorporates the marginalized position of children as citizens by ascribing the lives of Sasha and the other children in the Oha coven as precarious. The Leopard Council, a select group of advanced scholars who govern Nigerian Leopard affairs, makes the decision to send the children into battle against Black Hat when they are clearly unprepared. Other groups of Leopards have fought Black Hat before but they all died in the process (310), a fact that does not escape the children. When the children realize their deaths are distinct possibilities, the Leopard Council says they \"will continue to [send people to fight] until Black Hat is taken down . . . More is at stake than your lives\" (310). The children learn their place: they are not a unique group of child heroes but one group among a line of many others. Others have gone before; others will follow. The reality of their possible demise stands in contrast to the toothless danger often faced by white heroes in white fantasy. The white Pevensies of Narnia are the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve who must sit on their thrones at Cair Paravel, according to the prophecy. White Harry Potter, also a child of prophecy, is \"the boy who lived,\" marked with a lightning bolt on his forehead. For these white fantasy heroes, there is only one way their stories could end. The children of the oha coven, however, become \"disposable bodies\" ( [Giroux 72](#b14))\u2014tools of adult (full citizen) initiatives that can, if necessary \"disappear.\" If their precarity is not clear in Akata Witch, then certainly it is evident within the wider library of children's fantasy as the possibility of their death, as opposed to the certainty of life available to most fantasy heroes, rests on them like a halo. The children's disposability reiterates that Black children like [End Page 86] Sasha, in essence, suffer through a double bind. They are excluded from full citizenship until adulthood because they are children, yet in adulthood they are also excluded because of racial difference. Okorafor's Nigerian setting compounds her inquiry into exclusionary US anti-blackness, while offering a backdrop for decolonial threads of the fantastic. In contrast to the punishment Sasha received in the US, Nigeria becomes a place of healing for Sasha, providing him with much-needed guidance and mentorship\u2014comforts often not afforded to a young Black male in the United States where the judicial system tends to be less forgiving. In Nigeria, Sasha sits under the guidance of Anatov, an African-American scholar who has moved to Nigeria. He recognizes that Sasha is a young Black man who \"has no respect for authority\" (114), something Anatov calls a \"recipe for disaster\" in the United States. Anatov makes no excuses for Sasha and can punish him severely; yet he also recognizes the gifts the young man has, like photographic memory and a proclivity for multilingualism. Anatov offers a spirited defense of Sasha (and Chichi who shares Sasha's nonconformist attitude toward rules) that critiques US schooling and its inappropriate discipline of Black students. In addition to his photographic memory, Sasha has a lot of energy. You see the problem? He knows too much. He's always ahead. So how do you expect him to respect just anyone? How can you expect him to sit still? . . . Most people would dismiss Chichi and Sasha as disrespectful, uncouth children who can't even get through a year of school. They'd insist they were destined to be criminals and streetwalkers. Doctors would prescribe Ritalin for their ADD and then throw their hands up, perplexed, when it didn't work.(114) Anatov's defense points to the systemic biases Black children live under in US schools. While police violence is a pressing concern, Anatov spotlights the dangers school discipline ( [Fenning and Rose](#b12)) and other real world social institutions can play in Black life. From disproportionate punishments ( [Bryan](#b4)) to misdiagnoses of ADHD ( [Moody](#b21)) to reporting discipline issues to the police ( [Martin and Beese](#b20)), the wide-ranging unequal experiences of Black children in US schools is well documented. In Nigeria, however, Anatov can claim that both Sasha and Chichi are \"destined for great, great things\" (115), a pronouncement made possible by the distance Nigeria affords from purportedly colorblind [8](#f8) social systems. Decentering Whiteness in the Fantastic: The (Inclusive?) Leopard Community Okorafor's casting of Sasha as the excluded Black child citizen illustrates Akata Witch's decolonial work in the real. I now turn to her critique of the fantastic, where she utilizes the Leopard community's complex relationship [End Page 87] with inclusivity to highlight the ways whiteness colonizes the fantastic. While the Leopard community can appear inclusive, their ostracization of Free Agents, an ostracization with white colonial roots, speaks to the decolonial limits of the fantastic. Nigerian Leopards are able to practice juju across boundaries of language, ethnicity, nationality, and religion. This inclusivity is set down in the first pages of Akata Witch, which depicts a page from a Leopard training manual that informs juju learners \"a Leopard Person goes by many names around the world. . . . All people of mystical true ability are Leopard People\" (6). \"All people\" makes a bold claim of universality, an idea affirmed when Sunny, still learning about juju, questions Chichi and Orlu about their Leopard identities. She asks: \"So you guess,\" \"Here in Nigeria, we call ourselves Leopard People.\"(35-36) Here, Sunny tries to make sense of her new Leopard friends by ascribing an English term for a practitioner of juju\u2014witch. In response, Orlu does not deny the English term. Instead, he uses the phrase \"here in Nigeria,\" implying that the name may change according to location but the people are the same. Chichi later offers a clarification when she says, \"[Leopard People have] always been around, all over the world. In some countries, we're called witches, sorcerers, shamans, wizards. . . . So it's not just black people\" (78). Akata Witch presents a fantasy universe where the normative worldview assumes inclusion. When Chichi equates European and Nigerian Leopard names, she provides a small nudge away from the genre's white hegemonic center. Leopard People, then, functions as more than an umbrella term for those with juju ability. It is a universalist label that unifies \"countries,\" ethnicities, and races. Three examples of this unification stand out in the Leopard gatherings of the novel. First, the Leopard Council that sends the children to face Black Hat consists of African Americans, Igbo, and Arabs. Another example occurs when Chichi calls up a dangerous masquerade, or West African spirit, to impress other children at a Leopard festival. People flee \"call[ing] for Allah, Legba, Chukwu, Jesus, Mawu, God, Chineke, Oya, Ani, Asaase, Yaa, Allat, and many other deities to protect them\" (278). And finally, when Sunny visits a Leopard bookstore, she finds texts written in a plethora of languages: \"Hausa, (75). The implication is that these multilingual texts are all accessible to West African Leopards, as long as they know the language. An Igbo Leopard can weave the same spells as a German Leopard. [End Page 88] While the idea of an inclusive magic community, a citizenship granting community, one that stands in opposition to the marginalizing divisions seen through Sasha's experiences, is intriguing, rifts in the Leopard community complicate its decolonial power. Akata Witch avoids the simplistic dichotomy of an exclusive US (real) and an inclusive magic (fantastic) community. Instead, the text presents a complex picture of colonization within the genre, where whiteness impacts both realms. An important example occurs when Sasha tells the other children about the US juju headquarters in New York City, one of the regional governing bodies of the Leopard world. Of the US headquarters, Sasha says: I don't consider [the New York City office] the head of anything. It doesn't represent black folks . . . everything's biased toward European juju. The African American headquarters is on the Gullah Islands in South Carolina. We call it Tar Nation.(79) The Leopard governing bodies suggest that, like racism in the real, racism in the fantastic is both systemic and, at times, perpetuated within its own communities. Sasha's charges against the New York juju offices also hint that ideologies of whiteness can enter from the Lamb world. The novel reminds readers that whiteness is inveterate; it transcends boundaries, even magical ones. Prejudice in the novel is not relegated to the US Leopard community. The novel also grapples with Nigerian prejudices toward free agents who are viewed as weak and unable to learn. Most of this prejudice is directed at Sunny, the only free agent we meet in the book. However, the marginalization of free agents in Akata Witch is intriguing because, rather than make their treatment a fantasy parallel to oppression in the real, Okorafor depicts it as another layering of whiteness within the genre. Much of the prejudice against free agents stems from the demeaning caricatures penned in Fast Facts for Free Agents (FFfFA), the instruction book for Leopard People like Sunny. The author of the book is a Nigerian woman who studied in Europe and the United States. Her experiences in the West would seem to offer Sunny a model for Nigerian Leopard-ness as the two share Nigerian roots and Western education. However, the author of FFfFA returned to Nigeria with the idea that the West was \"where . . . the truly civilized ideas were being knitted\" (112), racist, colonial ideas Anatov says the author developed while living abroad. She harbored particular disdain for African Americans (112). The instruction manual and the author's learned prejudices thrust colonial undertones into the narrative (\"civilized\" is a word tinged with colonial residue), creating an ironic tension embedded in the text's universalist proposition. FFfFA is a source of emotional chaffing for Sunny as it describes her, a free agent, as ignorant, powerless, helpless, and unknowledgeable (96), impressions held by many [End Page 89] of the novel's Leopards. Anatov speaks of the book with repulsion, calling the author's ideas \"vile\" (113). Chichi concurs, calling the author \"a bitch\" (113). This reaction suggests some key members of the juju community reject her ideas. Yet when Sunny is browsing at a Leopard bookstore, a customer \"sucked his teeth\" (154) in disgust when he found out she was a free agent. Clearly, prejudice and exclusion remain in the community. What must be reiterated is Akata Witch's explicit highlighting of the misguided inspiration for the demeaning caricatures of free agents is colonial (and racial) attitudes picked up by the author of FFfFA during her time in the West. The world of Leopard People, where the labels of witch or Leopard differ but the magic purportedly remains the same, is influenced by Western ideologies that divide and exclude groups by physical features or, in this case, (spiritual) heredity. The Generative Quality of Marginality: Possibilities of the Fantastic Carrington shows that awareness raising of whiteness by itself can leave a gap in the pursuit of meaningful, anti-racist change. Decentering hegemonic norms requires new visions of subjectivity and agency that can upset and replace those norms. Where Sasha's experience raises awareness of norms, an act that initializes decentering whiteness, the case of the Leopard community's inconsistent inclusivity shows this work is thorny, incomplete. In this section I examine the character Sunny who, I argue, embodies Carrington's generative speculation that envisions new modes of marginalized subjectivity by reclaiming marginalized aspects of her identity, including albinism, gender, and age among others. Throughout the book, Sunny reclaims identities that are pushed outside of the norm. Chichi, for example, calls her \"half ghost\" (16) when they first meet, a label meant to insult her as an albino. Later, Sunny claims it, telling the children \"[she's] practically a ghost\" (111) when she boasts about sneaking past watchful adults. She also reclaims her free agency. Where Fast Facts for Free Agents separates Leopards and free agents into distinct groups, Sunny's juju acumen, indistinguishable from other Leopards, shows the distinction is arbitrary. In fact, much of Sunny's Leopard-self contradicts the colonial-infused ideas of the instruction manual. The manual suggests Sunny will struggle to learn juju (96) yet she excels rapidly. The text also says she will \"not be able to help [her]self\" (96) yet Sunny manages to problem solve when faced with difficult spells or when missing potion ingredients. Most telling, FFfFA labels free agents as \"the scourge of the Earth\" (43) yet Sunny saves the world. Each of these identities are excluded by some hegemonic norm. Nigerian Lamb society excludes her because she is an albino; Nigerian Leopard society excludes her because she is a free agent; patriarchy excludes her [End Page 90] because she is a girl; the Leopard Council strips her of agency because she is a child; US society pushes her to the margins because she is Black. Her reclamation of marginality, however, is more than the sum of these constituent parts. Okorafor speaks to the multiplex subjectivities (and subjectivity) of transnational youth of color, a sentiment echoed by the St. Lucian poet Derek Walcott in his poem \"The Schooner Flight.\" Walcott writes that he is Black, Dutch, and English, and has, like Sunny, a \"colonial education.\" His conclusion: \"either I'm a nobody, or I'm a nation. [9](#f9)\" Okorafor captures this powerful dichotomy/duality as she turns Sunny the nobody into a nation. Of Sunny's many intersecting identities, albinism plays one of the more complex roles in her marginalization. Aiyetoro and Olaoye, writing about Okorafor's interweaving of magic and science fiction, focus on her depiction of albinos where they point out \"to be a young albino in Nigeria is to possess a body that naturally depicts vulnerability and places the albino in the position of victim in society\" (233). Okorafor, however, complicates this oppression by wading into the conflation of albinism and whiteness. Albino children in Nigeria face severe bullying, including the insult \"oyindo\" or white person. As an albino girl in Nigeria, Sunny is ostracized by her classmates (11-12) when they label her white and an akata (12), which she defines as \"bush animal\" or \"black Americans or foreign-born blacks\" (11). Sunny's classmates (12) and her brothers (39) both reflect this reality when they utilize white to insult her, a label she resists with anger. A Lamb classroom scene early in the novel provides a clue as to the source of Sunny's resistance. In one of the clearest connections to colonialism, Sunny's teacher, a white woman named Miss Tate, berates her Nigerian students for poorly written assignments. She shames the students for not using \"proper English\" (8) and reads their papers aloud with exaggerated accents, calling their English \"rotten\" (9). The teacher then demands that Sunny, who wrote a strong essay, punish the other students. Miss Tate forces Sunny to stand at the front of the classroom holding a ruler. Each student walks to the front and Sunny must slap their open palms with the ruler. As the punishment proceeds, Sunny breaks down in tears. Miss Tate then takes the ruler from Sunny and punishes the remaining students herself. In the aftermath of this ordeal as Sunny is surrounded in the schoolyard by incensed classmates, they direct their hate toward her instead of the teacher. \"Did you like seeing that white woman beat us like that? Does it make you happy because you're white, too?\" (emphasis in original 12) The initial thrust of the tension is racial as Sunny's Nigerian classmates tie her in solidarity with her white teacher. Albinism is the hook upon which Sunny's classmates can make this connection\u2014albinism whitens Sunny's skin, so she is therefore white. Sunny's classmates then label her an akata, an epithet that targets her US birth. Theresa Heyd, through a sociolinguistic analysis of Nigerian emigrants' [End Page 91] online chat, offers fascinating insight into the connotations surrounding the word akata. When akata refers to African Americans, the word implies notions of, according to Nigerian participants in her study, \"hoody trash . . . from the worst low down ghetto,\" Welfare dependency, drug dealing, and \"no regards for the institution of marriage\" (43). Sunny is not a Nigerian to her Nigerian classmates; she is an outsider embodying Nigerians' negative, white-driven stereotypes of African Americans. All these threads connect to show Okorafor's brilliance in constructing her title Akata Witch. Sunny is viewed as a witch because she's albino, but viewed as white for the same reason. She is called akata because she is Black, but US born. She is the best student in her class, but attributed the worst stereotypes by her classmates. Sunny reclaims and reinvents these markers of identity in her own image. One way, albeit an awkward way, to read Sunny's albinism is the physical trait that marks her as a dweller of two worlds, inhabiting both Black and white identities. She is not only a Black Nigerian in this paradigm but also a white American. While this is a clunky interpretation, it is one that Okorafor flirts with when she incorporates albinism into Sunny's Leopard identity. In Akata Witch, Okorafor builds into her fantasy world a special place for disability, including albinism. Physical or mental traits that are ostracized or misunderstood in the Lamb world provide special ability in the Leopard world. For example, Orlu is dyslexic but as a Leopard, dyslexia gives him the ability to \"undo\" (113) or reverse others' spells. Regarding Sunny, albino Leopards are \"half ghost and half human\" (16) who live \"one foot in this world and one foot in another\" (23). The ability to cross between worlds manifests itself in the gift of invisibility, a skill Sunny uses to avoid detection and even walk through walls. To extend the metaphor of an albino dwelling in two worlds (the spirit world and the real) into the realm of racial identity carries some merit when considering Sunny's grandmother who is the source of Sunny's juju ability. Sunny's grandmother also had the gift of invisibility. However, Sunny's grandmother describes herself in a letter as \"born with black, black, black skin\" (344). Okorafor shows Nigerians labeling Sunny white, while her power comes from her Black grandmother. Equating Sunny's albinism with whiteness is an uncomfortable proposition. To call Sunny's \"wooly blonde hair\" (7), for example, a marker of two races fails to grasp both the concept of whiteness and the diversity within Black cultures and ethnicities. Yet, Okorafor can often be iconoclastic in her writing. Burrnett, for example, argues that Okorafor channels the Trickster in her fiction, sometimes taking an uncomfortable position in order to \"fuck with [you]\" (135). Equating albinism and whiteness is a position Okorafor would ultimately condemn as she crafts Sunny to be a proud Black girl, not a facile symbol of racial unity. Whatever her intensions, Okorafor poses albinism [End Page 92] as a complicated dance with oppression on the African continent. Despite decolonial efforts in the region, whiteness still carries tremendous privilege in West Africa. Femi Akomolafe, equating albinism and whiteness in his writing for New Africa, points out a contradiction between the deference paid to white visitors and the oppression inflicted on native albinos. He laments that a \"European face will open any door,\" yet West Africans insult albinos with the moniker \"oyinbo,\" or white person. Yet Okorafor plays with the contradiction, destabilizing the surety of whiteness by upsetting the colonial tenet that those in power get to ascribe cultural belonging. In other words, one way whiteness maintains hegemony is by limiting the power to determine who is white to those who are white. Simply put, white people get to decide who is white. When those in power are able to determine who belongs and who does not, whiteness maintains its footing. However, when Okorafor opens Sunny up to her classmates' ire, she turns Akomolafe's contradiction into a coup. As Sunny's Black classmates ascribe white themselves, they claim agency and shift, even if subtly, the power of whiteness. Akata Witch disturbs the foundations of whiteness as it upsets one of its basic premises. With whiteness unsettled, Sunny is now in position to reclaim her knotted nodes of oppression. A more compelling explanation than reading Sunny as both Black and white is, I argue, to read her as a reclamation of marginalized identities. She manifests a complicated relationship to marginality, which stands out when Sunny visits a Leopard festival and plays soccer [10](#f10) on an all-boys team. Gender politics underscore the game as she is the only girl playing in the tournament and the first girl to play soccer at the festival in fifteen years (265). Sunny shows off her talent, earns a spot on the team, and plays a starring role. Okorafor uses the soccer game to comment on the extensive difficulties for girls as trailblazers. To earn a spot on the team, each boy must dribble the ball with his feet, then kick it into the corner of the net. Unsurprisingly, the boys do not want Sunny on the team so she is given more stringent requirements. She must dribble and shoot like the others while also playing against two boys. During the match, she is targeted by the older boys who try and succeed in hurting her. She is left with \"bruises on her shins and cuts on her knees\" (260). While Sunny plays well, scoring a goal and setting up another, Okorafor avoids the clich\u00e9 of the talented though under-appreciated child who saves the day (or wins the game, in this case). Her team still loses (262). Despite the loss, Sunny's play is a learning opportunity. It is her first time playing on a team (something she discovers she likes) and it allows her to test the limits of her physical ability (261). Through the game, she recognizes the patriarchic structures and biases she needs to work against: she is aware of the extra requirements placed upon her and is cognizant of [End Page 93] the violence directed toward her because she is a girl. The violence and hate affect her more deeply than her ostracization over her albinism (256). Yet, she works against this oppression with success. While her team lost, she also embarrassed the older boys and earned the respect of the spectators. Her team celebrates their loss while the older boys glower in their win. Most notably, Sunny becomes an empowering role model for other girls and a stereotype breaker to many of the boys. At the end of the game, for example, one boy compared her to the Brazilian soccer great Pele and a girl tells Sunny she was her inspiration. The other girl \"always wanted to play, but didn't know [she] could.\" She also tells Sunny \"the girls who come after you will know now\" (265) that they can play. Undercutting these moments of empowerment, however, are moments of male intervention on her behalf, which sometimes undermine her own agency. She passes the difficult challenge to make the team on her own merit, but only gets to take the test in the first place because Sasha intimidates the young coach into allowing her to try out. He advocates for her again when she chooses a position. Her preferred position is striker, a highly involved offensive position; but she is prepared to take the less exciting position of defender just \"to be out there\" (246) on the field. She is prepared to sell herself short. Sasha again intervenes, telling her \"let me handle it\" (246). Even her position as a role model is doubtful. While other children celebrate her inspirational performance, she is compared to another young girl, Onyeke Nwankwo, the first girl to play in the festival soccer game (Sunny is the second). As important as Nwankwo's groundbreaking experience was, she seems to have little noticeable impact. Before the game, Sunny never mentions her and there is no indication in the novel that she or any other character is familiar with the girl's name. The girl who approached Sunny after the game said she did not know she could play even though Nwankwo had already set a precedent. The inspiration was always there. A futility hangs over her (and Sunny's) accomplishments. These conflicting acts of agency show reclaiming identity is knotty and thorny, a messiness seen in a mundane soccer game and in the book's climax\u2014Sunny's final confrontation with Black Hat. The villain falls to the Oha coven who are able to succeed where older groups failed because the children are able to surprise Black Hat because \"he is arrogant and has no respect for young people\" (310). As Black Hat faces defeat, he commits suicide to complete an evil juju ceremony that releases the masquerade Ekwensu, an evil spirit of destruction foretold earlier in the book. As a narrative, the final showdown between Ekwensu and Sunny is fairly anticlimactic. Sunny faces Ekwensu, says one word\u2014\"return\" (327)\u2014which causes the masquerade to sink screaming into the ground. There are no other spells or action sequences. [End Page 94] The whole event occurs in little more than a single page. The encounter does, however, provide rich insight into Sunny's reclamation of marginality. When Sunny meets Ekwensu, \"her fear of everything left her . . . She knew how the world would end. She knew that someday she would die. She knew her family would live on if she died right now. And she realized that she knew Ekwensu\" (326). The recognition of her mortality and the acceptance of her temporal insignificance (\"her family would live on\") give her knowledge of the destroyer. She knows the monster in the moment she reclaims her \"disposab[ility]\" ( [Giroux 77](#b14)) as an expendable (according to the Leopard Council) child. At this moment, Sunny moves beyond reclaiming her marginalized identities and reclaims marginality itself. Perhaps Sunny's most bold act of reclamation is her anti-racist redemption of US citizenship. Throughout Akata Witch Sunny embodies a number of conflicting, contradictory labels, which crisscrosses from Black to white to European to African to American identities. She is raised Catholic, for example, but practices juju. [11](#f11) Her favorite books are fantasy novels by Virginia Hamilton, a Black American writer, and Roald Dahl, a white Brit. However, she struggles to stay awake when she attempts Purple Hibiscus by the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (39). As Akata Witch progresses, Sunny as a Nigerian-American grows more in her Nigerian identity. This transition appears most clearly through her juju development. When Leopards cast a spell, music surrounds them while their \"spirit face,\" (68) a physical image of their spirit, appears over their face like a West African tribal mask. When Sunny calls up her spirit face early in her studies, her juju surrounds her with \"classical music\" (68) like \"ballet.\" (69) Western European music remains connected to her spiritual power twenty pages later when \"classical music\" (86) appears again during practice. When she practices her a spell over one hundred pages later, however, the music shifts to Nyanga Tolotolo. Despite this transition, the novel resists a narrow bildungsroman where Sunny transitions from American to Nigerian identity. Instead, Sunny's Nigerian and American identities intertwine. When Sunny's classmates call her white, she shouts back, \"I'm not white!\" (12) The label she prefers is American. She claims it, for example, when Chichi makes fun of her Igbo accent (16). American is also a label ascribed to her by others. When she signs up to play on the football team, she wavers when asked her nationality. As she tries to explain her US birth and her Nigerian parents, the football coach asks, \"so, you're Nigerian?\" Sasha interjects, \"No. [she's] American\" (253). This happens again when Sunny's mentor Sugar Cream tells other mentors [12](#f12) that Sunny \"is American . . . though she's Igbo and speaks the language\" (303). American is her primary identity; \"though\" suggest her Igbo identity is secondary. By developing Sunny's Nigerian identity, yet keeping her chosen and ascribed [End Page 95] identity American, Okorafor helps delink US citizenship from white norms by creating a US American identity independent of whiteness. At the end of the novel when the evil masquerade Ekwensu sinks back to the underworld, Sunny looks at the masquerade disappearing into the ground and thinks of the Wicked Witch of the West melting (327). Okorafor ties Sunny's victory in Nigeria with another US character's victory in Oz. This move tethers her own fantasy, Akata Witch, to one of the jewels of US children's fantasy. Interestingly, though Sunny's Nigerian identity blossoms over the course of the novel, she is not reminded of a Nigerian story but an American one. I imagine Okorafor is being cheeky here when she connects her story at its climax to the quintessential American fantasy. She metaphorically slides Akata Witch onto the bookshelf next to the great Oz. It is a bold gesture that allows Okorafor to reclaim one of her own aspects of marginalization as a writer of speculative fiction. She ushers Akata Witch from fringe [13](#f13) fantasy to essential. I believe Okorafor does more here than provide a playful statement about the importance of her novel, however. She also reiterates Sunny as a complete US citizen, a protagonist as American as Dorothy from Kansas. However, where Dorothy longs for Kansas, and it ultimately rewarded with a return, Sunny as a transnational citizen knows she is always already home. Her US identity is not excluded or denied but hums within her. She is American in the United States, in Nigeria, in the real, and in the fantastic. In this paper, I have first tried to show how Akata Witch illustrates what a generative text can do as the novel shifts the center of whiteness within the genre. Okorafor's racialization of the juju headquarters, for example, reframes understandings of traditional fantasy tropes as it crystalizes the overrepresentation of whiteness. Reading other fantasy texts through the lens of Akata Witch shows how such texts are not colorblind but actively silence Black voices through omission. For example, reading Harry Potter, one of the most widely read children's fantasy texts of the last quarter century, through Akata Witch (in this case, the depiction of the juju headquarters) allows us to flip the colonial fantasy script in order to see the whiteness infiltrating Rowling's Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts faculty. They are in fact the white Ministry of Magic and the white faculty of Hogwarts. This insight, coupled with Akata Witch's generative depictions of the Black Leopard community, raises fascinating questions about silenced and omitted experiences in fantasy literature. If Hogwarts is a white school of magic, where do the UK's Black magicians set up home? Birmingham? Brixton? [14](#f14) What have Black Leopard communities in the United States and UK established to find their own belonging in the juju world? What does Compton's or New Orleans' Diagon Alley look like [15](#f15)? By wielding Akata Witch as a critical lens to refract the colonial trappings of [End Page 96] the fantastic, Okorafor reveals the genre's overrepresentation of whiteness. I imagine Okorafor, both an iconoclass and self-proclaimed tree hugger, angling the lens above whiteness just right, watching it smoke, pop into flames, and slowly ash. I also imagine her smiling as she watches a bud sprout from the scorch marks. Reading fantasy texts through Akata Witch enables reading in terms of absence and omission, allowing a thread of questions that unearth worlds buried (or silenced) within worlds. Conclusion In the title of this piece, I ask if the genre of fantasy can free itself from its white, male, hegemonic roots, a question Jamaican Canadian speculative writer Nalo Hopkinson also ponders in her introduction to So Long Been Dreaming, an edited volume of post-colonial fantasy and science fiction. Hopkinson, who has wrestled with \"the unholy marriage of race consciousness and science fiction sensibility' (7), channels Audre Lorde to ask if a venture such as Okorafor's is even possible. She recognizes that \"to be a person of colour writing [speculative] fiction is to be under suspicion of having internalized one's colonization\" (7). Where Audre Lorde argues \"the master's tools [fantasy this case] ( [Master's Tools 110](#b19)), Hopkinson reframes the action. Rather than dismantle, she wishes to \"undertake massive renovations\u2014[to] build me a house of my own\" (8). In other words, Hopkinson wants to make fantasy anew, even though recognizable elements of the genre remain. The children's speculative writer Zetta Elliott also suggests the genre of fantasy needs de-colonial revision. In her article \"The Trouble with Magic,\" she asks if \"the genre can respond to and/or reflect the realities of marginalized children\" (17). As she wrestles with the limitations of the fantastic, she channels the work of Celestine Woo to suggest \"a hybrid approach\" (18) that is dissatisfied with simplistic notions of Black lives. Western fantasy, according to Elliott, is insufficient to capture the lived experiences of people of color. She calls her own hybrid genre \"Afro-urban,\" (27) to describe a type \"of black magic\" that could reasonably exist and be accessed by youth within New York City\" (27) or other metropolitan areas. Okorafor herself seems to align with a hybrid approach. She calls her own writing Africanjujuism\u2014\"a subcategory of fantasy that respectfully acknowledges the seamless blend of true existing African spiritualities and cosmologies with the imaginative\" (Africanfuturism). To Okorafor then, her fiction is not fantasy that bends reality but a portrayal of the real, where the African elements are \"not something merely made up.\" Primary to Okorafor's idea is the non-Western core of her fiction; yet, her decolonial stories are still a \"subcategory of fantasy.\" All three [End Page 97] writers recognize the colonial legacy in mainstream fantasy. While they do not walk away from the genre, all adapt the speculative in their own way. Can fantasy free the fantastic from whiteness? Western fantasy, with its colonial baggage, seems insufficient. The Black speculative, whether Hopkinsons's renovations to the genre, Elliott's Afro-urban magic, or Okorafor's Africanjujuism, hold more promise as stories like Akata Witch undermine the tenets of whiteness, despite resting in a wider \"conservative [fantasy] genre\" ( [Baker 438](#b3)). As I have shown through much of this paper, Akata Witch beckons us to ask what is the real, what is the fantastic, and how both can be decolonized through productive speculation. Okorafor's vision of the fantastic provides rich possibilities for new modes of belonging. Her critique of US anti-blackness and her reimagination of citizenship in Akata Witch reveal the white-saturated nature of fantasy narratives, rewires the narrative, and advocates for Black lives, Black dreams, and Black extrospection.

His research focuses on race and representation in children's and young adult speculative literature, reader engagement with speculative literature, and anti-racist education. He has published in Research in Diversity in Youth Literature and has a chapter in Approaches to Teaching the Works of Octavia E. Butler with MLA Press. His current project explores the racialization of escape in children's fantasy literature. He also thinks he's a poet. Notes [1.](#f1-text) This statue still sits on her bookshelf. Okorafor took inspiration from another World Fantasy Award winner\u2014China Mieville. Rather than refuse the award, she accepted it. However, she cheekily turned the trophy around to face the wall so Lovecraft cannot see her while she works ( [\"Lovecraft's Racism\"](#b29)). [2.](#f2-text) Nnedi Okorafor is not the only person of color to be offered the bust. The Japanese writer Haruke Murakami won the award in 2006 and Sofia Samatar, an American writer of Somali descent, won in 2014. In 2015, the trophy was changed to that of a gnarled tree in front of a moon. [3.](#f3-text) For a blistering example of her fiction that critiques whiteness, read her short story \"The Magical Negro\" in her collection Kabu-Kabu. You won't be sorry. [4.](#f4-text) Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms fantasy, the fantastic, and speculative literature interchangeably. I ask if fantasy can free the fantastic, and later ask if fantasy can free fantasy. These are the same questions. The difference in word choice is stylistic. While there can be nuances to each term (for example, in The Dark Fantastic, Ebony Elizabeth Thomas says \"the fantastic captures the wonder of stepping into a world-that-never-was, and immersing yourself in it in a way that speculative fiction does not\" [8]), many scholars use the terms broadly to refer to similar notions of imaginative literature. Contemporary scholars of fantasy such as Farah Mendlesohn, Brian Attebury, and Ebony Elizabeth Thomas often use the terms interchangeably, sometimes on the same page. [5.](#f5-text) I recognize the problematic nature of using the term American to refer only to US citizens. Canadians, Mexicans, Brazilians, and other citizens of the North, South, and Central America are all equally American. However, Akata Witch, which is written for a US audience, sometimes uses the term in a narrow way. Any standalone use of the word \"American\" in this paper refers specifically to US citizens or US identity. [6.](#f6-text) Cohen's language around exclusion helps me frame the situation around Black individuals in Akata Witch. However, the basis of her writing rests on the idea of cultural assimilation, a problematic idea here as it rests on a hegemonic foundation of citizenship. To require Black citizens to assimilate without questioning the concept of citizen \"negates [Black] identity by forcing people into a homogeneous mold that is untrue to them\" ( [Taylor 43](#b32)). Black Americans face exclusion from full citizenship as they are expected to conform to a mold yet are never allowed to be part of or shape that mold. [7.](#f7-text) Cohen's argument contradicts some basic tenets of child citizenship. Scholars such as Abbie Ventura and Megan Musgrave, in separate works of children's literature criticism, base their arguments on the assumption that children hold a position in society (that of citizen), a position that comes with benefits and responsibilities. However, Cohen is helpful in thinking of children who occupy a relegated position in society becoming liminal subjects whose civic engagement is transitory and preparatory. There are ways children are viewed, not as citizens, but as pre-citizens. [8.](#f8-text) By colorblind, I refer to the unexamined belief that a person does not see race. When novels do not explicitly mention race, it contributes to a perpetuation of white as the assumed norm. Charles Taylor speaks of something similar when he talks about \"difference blind\" dispositions. \"'Blind' liberalisms,\" Taylor says, is still a \"reflection of particular cultures\" (44). [9.](#f9-text) I first heard of Walcott's poem in an interview with the Black speculative writer Nalo Hopkinson. The interview is located in the back of her powerful book [Report from Planet Midnight (73)](#b16). [10.](#f10-text) Similar to Okorafor's use of American, I recognize that almost the entire world uses the word football to describe the game Sunny participates in. However, the text uses the word soccer so for the sake of consistency, so do I. [11.](#f11-text) In Okorafor's universe, juju and Christianity are not mutually exclusive belief systems, contrary to US evangelical protestant theology. Here too is a subtle but powerful decolonial moment in the text. [12.](#f12-text) This is another interesting section that speaks to the animosity between Nigerians and African Americans, an issue that surfaces repeatedly in the novel. The context of Sugar Cream's declaration is a final, grave meeting between Sunny, the other children of the oha coven, and the Leopard Council. Sunny and Sasha as US citizens bear the ire and distrust of two senior Leopards. Sugar Cream comes to their defense, though not all members of the Council accept her response. Immediately after she shares her support for Sunny, one council member \"scoffed [and replied] \"They don't teach them to understand others, they teach them to expect others to understand them,\" he said in English. He humphed and said, \"Americans\" (p. 303). In this case, however, the tensions between Black Americans and Nigerians get clouded by a colonial history. The distrustful council members do not trust the children simply for their Black Americanness, but also for the colonial interference of US oil corporations and the US government's funding of Black Hat. This is a fascinating tension to explore in another paper. [13.](#f13-text) Okorafor is now an established star in the science fiction and fantasy community. She has won a multitude of awards including three of the most coveted: The World Fantasy Award, The Nebula, and The Hugo. Her novel Who Fears Death is currently being developed as an HBO series, produced by Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin. However, when Akata Witch was published three months before she won the World Fantasy Award, her reputation was more muted. [14.](#f14-text) The city of Birmingham and the Brixton neighborhood of London have some of the largest Black populations in England. [15.](#f15-text) Using Okorafor's text as a decolonial lens to think about the Potter world is pertinent considering the controversy surrounding Rowling's depiction of world magic communities. For example, her website \"Pottermore\" (which was rebranded as Wizarding World in 2016) listed four schools of magic on the European continent (in Scotland, France, Sweden, and Russia) but only one on the entire African continent, though the latter has a population greater by half a million and claims an ancient magic tradition. The continent of Asia has only one school in Japan. North America has one. South America has none.
