You'll remember an instinctive mechanism that you can access at any time for self-regulation, healing and maintaining homeostasis. It is very different from ordinary shaking. As it moves through you it unravels physical, emotional and psychological tension while bringing about a parasympathetic (rest n digest) state of deep relaxation. In this state biological functions, such as metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, heart rate, etc. operate at their optimal state for promoting health and well-being. Through regular maintenance with Shaking Medicine you let go of the pains and tensions inside of you that do not serve you and 'resonate' back into a more present-centered-grounded-loving-child-like innocent state of equilibrium and balance.

Cacao is an amazing plant medicine - a powerful aphrodisiac, mood enhancer, and an antioxidant that protects the heart. It is densely packed with nutrients and proven to be the most pharmacologically complex food in nature. It can improve your memory, reduce heart disease, shed fat, boost immunity, increase blood flow and nutrition to the brain, heart and skin - the whole body is nourished. Cacao contains the neurotransmitters and chemicals responsible for wellbeing, as well as anandamide, known as the bliss molecule that leaves us feeling euphoric, moderating pain perception, as well as assisting in regulating appetite and mood. When high quality cacao beans are prepared for ceremony as they will be in this offering, all the mood enhancing nero-chemicals in cacao become particularly active. Sacred cacao ceremony participants often report heightened awareness, focus and intensified sensations. Cacao is not only healing for the body, but also for the soul and spirit as it is heart opening and an amazing meditation aid. Radha works with Shaman Keith Wilson's cacao, carefully and ethically sourced premium beans that are made into paste around the magical lake Atitlan. Cacao Shaman Keith was the pioneer of the revival of Cacao as a sacred ceremonial drink in Guatemala. The tradition of drinking ceremonial cacao originates in the ancient culture of the Mayas in Central America. It was believed to carry the spirit of fertility and abundance. The goddess of chocolate, Ixcacao, was also known as the 'queen of love and pleasure', connected with the energy of the heart. Later cacao was served in ceremonial context in nowadays Mexico, in the Azteca and Olmec cultures. *********** with Radha Iveta and Sarah Wolfe Sarah Wolfe & Shaking Medicine \"Being a teacher and practitioner of a disciplined yoga style, alongside battling an eating disorder for years, throughout my life the concepts of control and pushing harder have, prior to Shaking Medicine, really directed many of the choices in my life. Over the years I've explored many different modalities for strengthening, conditioning and maintaining the overall health of my physical body, getting at times quite consumed and caught up in it all. The practice of Shaking Medicine is a complete medicinal delivery for all layers and aspects of our Body Mind Spirit. Combining hyper arousal and deep relaxation to create a whole and complete healing practice. It is part of my everyday ritual today as it allows me to cultivate a deeper connection to myself in a loving way. I highly recommend Shaking Medicine to anyone interested in cultivating deeper presence and awareness, anyone who may be suffering from dis-ease or inflammation.
