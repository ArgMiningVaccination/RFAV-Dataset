ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: President Oyinkansola \"Bukky\" ACHE Spotlight Oyinkansola Ogunrinde Education Cardiology BY MICHAEL CORTELLI, MD COVID-19 has strained hospital and healthcare worker resources worldwide. The United States has not experienced a pandemic of this magnitude in over 100 years. According to CDC statistics, as of August 2021, there have been almost 3 million hospitalizations over the previ-ous 13 months in the U.S. alone. Despite this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, Memorial Healthcare System has risen to the challenge and has played a pivotal role in managing this crisis \u2014 from organizing and opening some of the early testing sites in South Florida, to accepting patients from other geographic locations because of the advanced thera-pies we offer. Specifically , Memorial Cardiac and Vascular Institute and Critical Care Services at Memorial have been instru-mental in providing the treatment neces-sary to care for those patients with advanced and aggressive diseases. This ranges from cardiac and vascular inter-ventions in patients with acute thrombo-sis (i.e., acute myocardial infarctions, BY ANDRE LIGHTBOURN The healthcare industry is diverse and ever-changing. Some healthcare busi-nesses provide treatment through clini-cal services, others focus on manufactur-ing medical equipment and pharmaceu-ticals, and some provide health infor-matics or insurance coverage to eligible clients. Across all corners of the industry , there's high demand for individuals who understand the complexities of business and can apply their knowledge to advance organizational growth and opportunity . Earning a Healthcare MBA can help you develop the business expertise and practical skills needed for leadership roles, such as hospital administrator, pharmaceutical brand manager, or even Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in the healthcare landscape. With a combina-tion of industry specific healthcare train-ing and holistic business coursework, Florida International University (FIU)'s Healthcare MBA (HCMBA) can prepare you to advocate for your ideas, influence major facility decisions, and be part of the business conversations that directly impact funding, equipment, research, and patient services.

Guatemalan-Maya Center (GMC) in Lake Worth received the largest grant at $300,000. Nate Cousineau, senior program officer of Quantum Foundation, described GMC as \"a grass roots organization that's working in the heart of the community . They've been around a long time, and their services continue to adapt to meet the needs of their community .\" He said the organiza-tion offers various health and social services by bringing local providers together to present services directly to clients. \"You could pretty much walk through their doors with a need, and they would find a way to meet it.\" Regarding the grant for GMC, Cousineau said, \"One of the great things they're look- ing to do is open a type of clinic - whether a mobile van or bus, or a clinic at their site hasn't been determined; some components still need to be ironed out. But the grant was an opportunity to fund a trusted organization that's meeting a specific need in that community that no one else is.\" He went on, \"We're hoping the funding first provides additional stability for current programming.

And at the risk of being a bit too schmaltzy , this seems like a good time to recog-nize that we have a lot of good things right here, right now , despite still being terribly stressed by the Covid pandemic and its \"forever-effects.\" Carol, who even after 50+ years still tries to broaden my horizons and shrink my waist size, recently suggested we try to embrace the concept of hygge. A Scandinavian practice, hygge is all about finding com-fort and contentment through cherishing the little things. Or as Carol has encouraged our grandkids since they were little ... to be cozy and relaxed. We both multi-task too much and often are guilty of missing out because we've been moving too fast to enjoy what's right in front of us. Very recently , we lost an old friend to Covid with whom as recently as Christmas we'd been making plans to see for the first time in decades. But life got in the way , our visit didn't happen and it's our loss now. So hopefully this wake-up call will be the epiphany we need to stop and smell the roses. Happy Hygge to all. K.I.S.S.

One unfortunate result of the pandemic is that many peo- ple delayed preventative medical screenings because they wanted to avoid exposure to COVID in doctors' offices. In early 2021, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) found that two-thirds of doctors were seeing an increase in patients with advanced disease and nearly 75% had patients who had missed routine cancer screenings, leading to delayed diagnoses and treatment. A survey by the non-profit Business Group on Health discovered 94% of employers are anticipating an increase in 2022 medical spending attributable to more cases of advanced disease because of delayed treatment. Many businesses are seeing an increased interest in emergency savings accounts through payroll deductions. Mental health is also priority for employees this year. Employees are seeking easy access to care, extra resources, and understanding from their colleagues and employers. As we all learn to live with the reality of endemic COVID, mental health benefits will con-tinue to be an important piece of any employee benefits package. A trend in 2021 Open Enrollment was employers adding additional mental health benefits and resources, a sign many employers recognize the pressures employees have been under. Many of my groups requested these plans, including options that provide mental health benefits to the employees waiving health insurance. More employers are offering voluntary mental health benefits \u2014 not every employee will take advantage of these programs, but it's an option for those who want it. As employers continue to navigate 'The Great Resignation', taking care of current employees will remain a top priority . Businesses should consider providing benefits to part time and contingent workers. Additionally , thinking beyond the traditional vision, medical, and dental insurance, some employers are offering student debt products, child care support, home office stipends, pet insurance, and other options that allow employ-ees to customize their benefits to their unique needs. As an employer, consider encouraging employees to seek medical care they delayed. Make sure your plan provides mental health benefits and that these benefits have been properly communicated to employees. Summer Westerbur, founder of Kairos Insurance Group, is experienced in all types of insur- ance including employee benefit packages, product liability, general liability, professional liability and building insurance.

CMS is driving this transition with the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program, which ultimate-ly links a clinician's Medicare reimbursements with how many points they earn. CMS sets the requirements of the MIPS pro-gram based on the MACRA law , and for the 2022 reporting peri-od, failure to comply or earn enough MIPS points results in an automatic 9% penalty on annual Medicare Part B claims. This equates to a reimburse-ment reduction of $90,000 for every $1 million billed to Medicare. Starting in the 2022 Reporting Period, 1 out of every 2 clinicians will be penalized. It can be challenging to know what to do to earn MIPS points, optimize your score, and protect your reimbursements given there are many nuances and commonly misun-derstood aspects about the MIPS program. However, one of the things you can control is the MIPS reporting partner and corresponding reporting method you choose. Given the complexity in earning MIPS points, it's critical to select the right partner and methodol-ogy , as all reporting options are not the same. Your Doctor In Touch CCM program is coordinating with Health eFilings, a CEHRT and national leader in automated MIPS reporting, and the most comprehensive and effec-tive choice, with a 100% success rate. They use a cloud-based, ONC-certified software that fully automates the process and does all the work without requiring IT resources, administrative support or workflow changes. Health eFilings will save you significant time, be a turnkey process and maximize reimbursement by earning you the most MIPS points. These benefits are enhanced when working with our quality Next Gen CCM pro-gram. With what's at stake this year and beyond, you can't afford to make mistakes with MIPS. Finally , if you haven't filed for the 2021 MIPS reporting period, it is not too late. But time is of the essence, reach out now to find out more.

What is driving this demand? Some say that it is the industry's move to value-based care, which focuses on quality care versus volume-based care. As a practicing pediatric neurosurgeon, I have spent much of my career serving in combined clinical and lead-ership roles in various healthcare organ-izations. In questioning whether care quality differs in healthcare organiza-tions led by physicians I've found little evidence-based research measuring hos-pital performance relative to physician CEOs versus non-physician CEOs. As such, I chose this research topic as I pur-sued my Executive Doctor of Science in Healthcare Leadership degree at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In 2021, my dissertation \"Reported Clinical and Financial Performance of Hospitals with Physician CEOs Compared to those with Nonphysician CEOs\" was pub-lished in the American College of Healthcare Executives' (ACHE) Journal of Healthcare Management's November/December 2021 issue. Since existing leadership theory and some research suggest a relationship between technical expertise and success in leading highly technical organiza-tions, I hypothesized that hospitals led by physician CEOs would report higher levels of clinical and financial perform-ance compared to hospitals with non-physician CEOs. The single-year, cross-sectional analysis of U.S. acute care hos-pitals showed no differences in reported performance. The sample population included 190 hospitals, half (95) with non-physician CEOs and half with physician CEOs, randomly selected from over 1,900 AHA database U.S. medical surgical hospitals with more than forty beds. All CEOs had at least one year of tenure. Three stan-dard reported quality measures were chosen: actual/ predicted central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLAB-SI) rates, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rates, and pneumonia 30-day risk-adjusted excess readmission rates. Financial performance was evaluated based on hospitals' return on assets and operating margin. The study also con-trolled for 13 hospital characteristics and market factor variables. This analysis did not support the hypotheses that hospitals with physician CEOs report better clini-cal and financial perform-ance than hospitals with nonphysician CEOs (at the 95% confidence level). The data did demonstrate that physi-cians were more likely to be the CEOs of teaching hospitals, nonprofit hos-pitals, and larger hospi- tals. Physicians were also more likely to lead hospi-tals owned by a system. This was a very focused review and therefore sub- ject to a number of limitations. This study does not imply causality due to the retrospective nature of a cross-sectional data analysis. Second, this study used a single year of data, which for many rea-sons may not be representative of longer-term performance. CEO tenure is impor-tant, as there is often a lag between the CEO's appointment and CEO-driven changes in organizational outcomes. This study included CEOs with more than one year in the position, resulting in over 25% of CEOs with less than two years' tenure. Finally , the study did not examine additional hospital characteris-tics and/or CEO leadership traits which may be better predictors of clinical or financial performance. As previously mentioned, there has been little empirical work done compar-ing the performance of hospitals with physician CEOs versus non-physician CEOs. More work in this area could be useful to inform hospital CEO recruit-ment and selection processes. Future studies may consider independent vari-ables of hospital size, teaching status, not-for-profit ownership, or clinical lead-ers in other professions such as nurses, therapists, and technicians. This work adds to that discussion, and hopefully will be useful. In conclusion, while it may be appeal- ing - and would certainly be efficient - to be able to ascribe outsized impact of a single, measurable leader characteristic (such as being a physician), this study's data do not strongly support that. It turns out that, like leadership itself, lead-ership selection is a complicated busi-ness and there are likely no simple solu-tions to help organizations choose the leader best suited to maximizing hospital performance.

Without addressing the pros and cons of this, the most recent sta-tistics show that more than 65 percent of physicians over age 55 have been sued.\" While the vast majority of these suits are not successful, it still costs physicians time and money to put up a defense. \"It can be a life-changer,\" said Gompers. \"That's why it's important to be insured by a company that has your best interests in mind and can provide competent counsel that shares your same priorities and objectives.\" Although Florida doesn't require profes- sional liability insurance, some insurance plans and programs do require physicians to have this coverage, as do many hospi-tals, surgical centers and imaging centers. Bare doctors may also find that they have trouble recruiting new young doctors into a practice unless that practice is covered. \"Physicians can still be held liable for judgements against them, even though they feel they are protected by working within a larger system,\" said Gompers. \"And in some institutions where the employees are fully covered, an independ-ent physician may find that they get thrown under the bus if no one is repre-senting their interests; the other physi-cians or health system may gang up against them, blaming the independent physician and forcing their insurer to go after that plaintiff more heavily .\" He adds that many doctors think erro- neously that they will be dropped from lawsuits once the plaintiff finds out they are bare. \"More common is that the plain-tiff's attorneys \"persuade\" the bare doctors to testify against their co-defendants in return for favorable treatment,\" he said. \"In contrast, when all of the co-defendants are insured with the same carrier, there is a strong unity of defense that wins many cases.\" He notes that the average cost of defend- ing a case that doesn't go to trial is between $25,000-$50,000; if it goes trial, it can cost $100,000-$250,000. \"If you ultimately lose, in order to keep your license you'll end up writing a check for a minimum of $250,000,\" said Gompers. \"And if you don't pay it within 60 days after exhausting all appeals, the board will suspend it.\" In addition to HIPAA protection and some cyber protection, Gompers notes that the most important benefit of profes-sional liability insurance is that it includes license defense. \"In Florida, when a pro-fessional liability claim is filed, it is incum-bent on the plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorney to advise the state, who will invariably open up a Department of Health investigation looking at that physi-cian,\" he said. \"While many asset protection attorneys tell their clients that they have successfully put together a plan that bulletproofs their assets against judgements, unless they're willing to give you an affidavit in writing that should it be breached they'll pay it for you, you need professional liability cover-age,\" he added. \"The fact is, things that they think might be bulletproof maybe aren't, and that's not something you want to learn while a court of law sorts it out.\" For more information, contact Bill Gompers at bill@dannagracey.com, (888) 777-7173 or visit www.dannagracey.com.

How they got to where they are? Yale University highlights certain notable alumni and provides insights into how the alumnus' career path has shaped them and how they have shaped the world. Recently Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), in conjunction with Yale School of Medicine, highlighted a Florida healthcare attorney , Ben Assad Mirza. Understanding the path to career suc- cess and fulfillment is not easy , but in healthcare, people like Ben Mirza are finding new ways to achieve. They take the time and the steps to: 1. Start by defining the space (aka industry) and the people (aka customer) they find the most satisfaction in serving. 2. Look for gaps in service (aka market opportunities) of what the customers are seeking. 3. Tool-up for gaining the ability to serve. 4. Take time to serve from the heart, without regard to compensation. 5. Once these \"dues\" are paid, the uniqueness of the service, niche and financial returns leads to new horizons for those willing to pave new paths. To understand the new horizon that Ben Mirza has embarked upon, read the following Yale article excerpt or visit www.MirzaHealthLaw.com. What is your current job? As an attorney representing healthcare organizations from hospitals to physician groups, health care private equity firms, software companies, and diag-nostic testing labs and facilities - I passionately represent my clients' legal positions in transac-tions and before courts. I prose-cute and defend claims for my clients. I started the firm MIRZA | Healthcare Law partners. In our firm, we help senior healthcare administrators, physicians and in-house legal counsels, who are overwhelmed by the competition and economic squeeze they see coming. We protect their contrac-tual rights and litigate if needed. We are former large healthcare institution attor-neys protecting the small guys. Describe your work and why you find it rewarding/challeng- ing. I usually represent \"golden nuggets\" - the small precious healthcare businesses. When my clients are in a squeeze or hit-ting full stride, I feel it. I am here to help guide them through the process and dili-gently represent their position. Conversely , I am also there when my clients need to do a \"reality check\", and when we interact, I speak from the heart and what I would do if I was running their business. When the clients come back to me repeatedly is when I feel most rewarded. I know my clients have many choices. I know they have serious concerns. Of all the choices, they chose me as their legal guide. It is my responsibility and my honor to protect and guide them. How did YSPH prepare you for your current work? YSPH taught me the evolution of how the healthcare industry has progressed over the last 100+ years. Because of YSPH, I understand the trajectory of where my clients need to go. Without the YSPH training, my ability to guide clients would be simply limited. In the health-care law space, it is not only important for attorneys to know the law , but also the business and the practical side of how businesses are evolving. When I engage with clients, I do it confidently because of my training at YSPH. YSPH actually changed the way I practice law. I am forever grateful. Do you have a favorite YSPH experience you can share? My favorite YSPH experiences are understanding healthcare policies and the conversations on campus. Walking on campus, one really feels the sense of history . I really enjoyed my professors, and their insights are invaluable to me. The administrative team at YSPH makes you feel like family and their welcoming warmth is incredibly generous. The col-lection of restaurants in New Haven is incredible too; and East Rock is where I went to catch my solace. What advice do you have for current students? The advice I have for current students is to be engaged on campus and do as many things as you can, for your time at YSPH will fly by . Each interaction is invaluable. When you go to class, listen to each lecture and think about how that information or process is being applied in the real world. Talk to the YSPH staff regularly . They are incredibly refreshing and humble, and they have insights that we students surely did not have at the time we were there. Stay in touch with your friends and they will be your sup-port. Were there any faculty or staff mentors who influenced your YSPH experience? The faculty and staff at YSPH are incredible, starting with Dr. Mayur Desai, who is the \"AP student whisperer.\" Dr. Yusuf Ransome showed us a side of humanity that we rarely see. Dr. Mark Schlesinger taught us how our govern-mental health system got where it is today and where it is going. Dr. Zack Cooper explained the economics of healthcare and how money impacts deci-sion making. Dr. Jason Schwartz helped us figure out the maze of healthcare play-ers and processes. Dr. Howard Forman led engaging colloquiums and brought transparency to ACHE student board meetings. Dr. Melinda Pettigrew made me realize that microbials can and will change my life and Dr. Catherine Yeckel explained to us the obesity pandemic. The YSPH administrative team is incred-ible too. Associate Dean for Student and External Affairs Dr. Frank Grosso always brought a firm hand and sensibility to discussions. Career Services Director Felicia Spencer gave us grounded career guidance. Admissions Director Mary Keefe is instrumental in bringing incred-ibly talented students to YSPH. Student Affairs Director Stacey T uttle helped us balance our curriculum and goals in life. And of course Dean Sten Vermund is at the helm and always direct and humble in his conversations no matter who he is talking to. What an incredible team of people I was blessed to meet.

Departing Fort Lauderdale at 6 a.m. can put you on the ground in Philadelphia by 8:15 a.m. This past Monday , that was the plan. Probably , like all the other passengers that morning, I was up at four and headed out to the airport to navigate what would hopefully be a short TSA line. Minutes before boarding, the dread-ed announcement came. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are still waiting on one crew member. Once they arrive, we will begin boarding. Right now , we are looking at about a half hour delay .\" Did this per-son hit traffic? Not likely at this hour. Arriving late on an incoming flight? Doubtful as well. As other passengers moaned and speculated, because of where I was seated, I had the inside scoop. \"He probably slept in again,\" I heard the supervisor whisper to the gate agents. \"We could be delayed for a while.\" A half hour turned into an hour. At the one hour 20-minute mark, I overheard the supervisor tell the agents, \"Now , he says he is too sick to come in. We are looking for a sub.\" One hour turned into two. The tension and frus-tration from the other passengers continued to grow. By the time they announced that anyone with connecting flights should start rebooking, I thought society was literally going to break down around me. Now , far be it for me, to compare healthcare to air travel, but the same thing may be going on in our organizations every day . Often, we can do everything nearly per-fect, but one bad apple ends up ruining everything. We make excuses on why the receptionist, nurse, janitor, or whomever, keeps hurting what would other-wise be excellent patient care and experience. Who on your team is holding you back? Simply identify , retrain, or eliminate them. Your patients and their fami-lies will thank you. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

Physician Leadership Needed to Expand Access to Mental Health Services According to the 2022 Mental Health America report, Florida ranks 49th in the nation in access to care for patients with mental illness. The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained resources and highlighted the failings of our current health care system to ensure access to those that need support. While the State of Florida has taken steps to focus resources and attention on this critically important matter, it is clear that more must be done. Florida has been taking steps to build infrastructure to expand access to mental health services. Following one of the Grand Jury reports in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland in 2018, Governor DeSantis signed a bill into law creating the Florida Commission on Mental Health and Substance Abuse. The charge of the Commission is to \"examine the current methods of providing mental health and substance abuse services in the state and to improve the effective-ness of current practices, procedures, programs, and initiatives in providing such services; identify any barriers or deficiencies in the delivery of such services; and rec-ommend changes to existing laws, rules, and policies necessary to implement the Commission's recommendations.\" While the Commission continues to consider recommendations for changes in the laws and rules associated with access to treatment, there are a couple immediate steps that public officials can take to expand services for those in need. It is here where physicians really need to be engaged in discussions to encourage lawmakers to insti-tute meaningful change. There has been a significant increase in mental health services being rendered via telehealth since the start of the pandemic. During the 2022 Florida Legislative Session, lawmakers are considering several bills that would advance telehealth serv-ices in the State. One bill would add \"Audio-Only\" to the formal definition of Telehealth in the Florida Statutes. This is an important step forward for the state given the inability of many elderly residents and those in rural communities to access the technology and broadband required to effectively executive formal telehealth visits. For those with limited infrastructure or proficiency with technology , Audio-Only services can truly be a lifeline. Another bill would require insurance carriers to pay the same rate for telehealth services as they would for a physician providing in-person care. This payment parity legislation is in effect in a number of states nationally and is an important safeguard for patients that have existing relationships with clinicians who are managing their chronic conditions and mental health. Another measure that could be taken immediately is requiring the Medicaid Managed Care Companies to have sufficient mental health professionals in their net-works. There have been several recent articles in South Florida highlighting this issue that is facing patients in our community . Mental health services are a covered benefit for Medicaid beneficiaries and if these reports are correct, some insurers are limiting utilization of this benefit simply by having insufficient mental health professionals in their network. Your DCMA continues to advance pro-physician and pro-patient measures in our community . The significant deficiency we have in access to mental care services for patients demands our full attention. Your leadership is committed to continuing to press for solutions as we prepare for the full impact of the pandemic on mental illness to be revealed.

We're also hoping it can be a catalyst for this new clinic to be able to give them the kickstart they need to take their medical services to the next level, and to meet the persistent medical needs of their clients.\" Seeking to help organizations that are working to improve the health of Palm Beach County residents is the purpose of Quantum Foundation's grants. Cousineau explained, \"We work in the community to identify programs and ini-tiatives that are moving the needle to improve the health of residents here in Palm Beach County . One of the most important criteria is, are they making a meaningful impact in their work in the community .\" He said the foundation works with the organizations throughout the application process, and presents the proposals to the grants committee and board of trustees. \"We're fortunate that they have such incredible experience, varied back-grounds, and broad knowledge on our committees and board . . . their engage-ment is a vital layer to our vetting and approval process. Ultimately , the final funding decisions sit with them.\" Other organizations receiving funding during this period are ones providing dental care to wounded veterans, special-ized care to Cystic Fibrosis patients, medical equipment and supplies to adults and children, child counseling, and meals to seniors and childcare sites, among many other services. Cousineau said Quantum has different levels of grants, ranging from sponsor-ships of a health fair, funding for smaller grassroots organizations that meet basic needs, or larger grants for more extensive work. Those receiving the larger amounts are required to submit two reports every six months: one a financial report detailing how the funds have been spent to date, which must line up with how they proposed to spend them; and a programmatic report, telling what they've accomplished during that time, such as how many people they have served or the number who have received treatment. Cousineau concluded, \"One of the great things about our foundation is we have the ability to approach and improve health from a number of different angles.\" He said the term \"health\" encompasses many things that help make up a large portion of someone's overall well-being. \"It's not just access to a doctor, which is vital, but also the com-munities people live in, their ability to get healthy food, job opportunities, edu-cation, housing - a lot of areas influence health, and our funding over the last two quarters of 2021 reflect many of those areas. Ultimately , we're looking to improve the health of Palm Beach County residents. Each of these organi-zations is doing that in a very distinct and unique way , and we're excited to help them continue their great mis-sions.\" Quantum Foundation was created approximately 25 years ago with pro-ceeds from the sale of JFK Hospital, which sold for $135 million. The pro-ceeds are invested in the market, and since that time, the finance and invest-ment committee, which Cousineau said is \"incredibly savvy and has done a won-derful job,\" has grown the corpus to $175 million, while still enabling the foundation to give away $160 million to hundreds of nonprofit organizations.

The Mount Rushmore of directors. While the title of \"Director\" is probably on their business card, if you were to ask them to describe what they do, they would probably answer you in one word. \"Storyteller.\" While every-one has a story to tell, not everyone can tell a story . I've spent twenty-five years focusing on narra-tive and the importance of Storytelling as a documentary filmmaker. I also have a wealth of experience working in televi-sion advertising as a director and pro-ducer. I've learned that everyone has a story , but not everyone can tell their story authentically and compellingly . What we used to consider entertain- ment has been re-labeled as \"content.\" Business owners would contact me and request estimates to produce videos for their website. The scenario would go like this. \"We have a script, and we want it to say this, or can you help us make it look and sound like this commercial we saw on television.\" Most of these people had no copywrit- ing or advertising experience, but they had built a business from the ground up. As a business owner myself, I can empathize. They were successful entre-preneurs and thought, I can do this! I'd say , \"that's great that you have a script, but does it reflect your business and who you are as a business owner? And does it have the message that you have in mind? Is this the message your audience expects from you? I'd ask them to tell me about the busi- ness's history , who started it, and why . We would talk about the ups, downs, goals, competitive advantages, and where they wanted to go. The answers to these questions are still fascinating to me. They stirred my curiosity and cre-ativity because they had the context. Through communication and conversa-tion, a story would begin to take shape and was often the complete opposite of the initial concept. Social media platforms disrupted tra- ditional storytelling mediums of radio and television by democratizing who can tell a story , when they can tell that story and how they can tell it. There have been tremendous upsides in the forms of creativity , inclusiv-ity , and a massive reduction in costs that leveled the advertising playing field for businesses, non-profits, and individuals. Using strategic planning and targeting, we can all find an audience that aligns with our values and wants to hear our story . But there also are down- sides. Businesses and organizations often miss the mark, using a scatter- shot approach of posting an abundance of \"content\" that doesn't have context. It lacks narrative and devalues their story's significance. It also lacks authenticity . While it may be easy to grab a stock photo or video and attach some relevant terms about your business, today's con-sumers value and appreciate authenticity and will see through regurgitated attempts to engage them. We're in an era where a company's story and the founder's journey drive consumer engagement and decision making. Spanx and its founder Sara Blakely come to mind. She's transparent about her journey from fax machine salesperson to CEO of a company that is a staple in the women's shapewear mar-ket. She owns her narrative about the ups, downs, dreams deferred, and her eventual success. Her narrative is authentic, and it makes her story and the story of her company compelling. We're now living in what will be forev- er known as the \"new normal,\" and we'll be talking about the COVID era for the foreseeable future. The last year has been challenging for all of us and crippling for the healthcare sector. The narrative we're currently experiencing adds value to who we are and where we want to go. We will be telling the story of workers on the front lines of COVID, the lives lost, the lives saved, and most importantly , how this event changed our lives. Storytelling is and will always be a valuable tool as we move forward because it teaches, challenges, and inspires us! So, how will you make use of your nar- rative? How will you tell your story? Will it be authentic and compelling? For more information, contact Chad Tingle at (305) 794-7201 or chad@crownstreetfilms.com. Narrative and the Importance of Storytelling BY CHAD TINGLE Lee Health Relocates Regional T rauma Center to Gulf Coast Medical Center As part of a major expansion to better serve the Southwest Florida community , Lee Health has relocated its Regional Trauma Center from Lee Memorial Hospital to Gulf Coast Medical Center. To prepare for the trauma center relocation, Gulf Coast Medical Center underwent an extensive $315 million expansion project, which added 268 new inpatient beds, bringing the hospital's total bed count to 624 from 356.

Around Alison Mincey Margaret Dimond PrWell Offers Pain Relief Without NSAIDs PrWell launches P rRel f, a first-of-its-kind organic gummy that provides a safe and effective alternative to NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.) Millions of people rely on NSAIDs to control symptoms of chronic pain and inflammation, however, NSAIDs come with some risk. Studies have shown they may cause toxicity to one's liver, kidneys, and upper GI-tract. PrRel f combines powerful flavonoids from Skull Cap and Green Tea to provide extraordinary anti-inflammato-ry support, while added benefits of Boswellia and T urmeric supercharge the anti-inflammatory action. CBG and Delta-8 isolate round out the overall analgesic effects. Unlike NSAIDs that may cause undesirable side effects, P rRel f is a combination of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) ingredients, that have shown no toxi-city over periods of long-term use. It is a COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor. P rRel f's convenient form makes it easy to consume, and the Appleberry flavor is derived from organic fruit extract. Kindred Rehabilitation Services and South Florida Health Announce Plans for Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospital Kindred Rehabilitation Services and South Florida Health announced a joint venture to build and operate a 40-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital located on land adjacent to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.

Box 19268 Plantation FL 33318 Well, let's talk about the SFHHA. 2022 is a year of revitalization. We, like you, have learned what does and does not work during a never-ending pandemic. We all thought that virtual meetings would be our future. I know that most non-profit organizations in early 2020 shifted gears and transitioned to virtual meetings in an abundance of caution and a dearth of informa-tion, at that time, on this circulating virus. In the beginning, this was exciting technology time! Using platforms like ZOOM, Teams, etc., our usual face-to-face, family-style meetings turned into technological wonders (at least, for me). We increased our ZOOM subscription to take advantage of more available options and our aggressive schedule of educational programs was underway . Through the first few months of 2020, when more people than not were working from home, attendance at our virtual events was amazing. Depending on the subject of the programs, attendance was routinely in the 50+ range. We further pivoted our annual healthcare summit conference to a virtual event bringing in international speakers to talk about the challenges being presented by the COVID-19 response and attendance continued to exceed expectations. Then, realities set in. Our usual sponsors began to question whether their value expectations were being met when our events were virtual versus face-to-face. At the same time, our Board of Directors, consisting mostly of healthcare professionals, and our medical director were all advising that in the interest of public safety and consistent with the experiences that all our chief executives were having at their hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and medical clinics, we needed to remain virtual. Moreover, our attendance began to decline as our members and friends began to suffer the \"too much on my plate,\" real-ity as many had to return to work after having worked from home and staffing realities left little time, or desire, to participate in one more virtual event. Well, we are two years down the road and are now seeing the Omicron variant, hopefully , burning itself out. What we also know is that over the last two years, we have gained much more knowledge about the many faces of COVID-19 and how to protect ourselves from being infected (masking and distancing) or, if infected, what we need to do individually (vaccination and booster) to minimize the chance that we might require hospitalization. Yes, 2022, will be a year of revitalization. With advice and counsel from our Board of Directors and our medical director, we will be pivoting yet again to offer more face-to-face opportunities this year. In several planning sessions with our Board, we have iden-tified an exciting array of programs that we believe will hit the mark for our entire membership. In the coming weeks, look forward to receiving a survey from us asking for your input. What we have also discovered over this last two years is that what seem to be important topics to us, do not necessarily resonate with our members and friends. 2022 will be an exciting year. Cheers!

A new Lee Health internal medicine res- idency clinic has opened as part of the recently announced Florida State University College of Medicine Internal Medicine Residency Program at Cape Coral Hospital/Lee Health. The program received initial accredita- tion in September and approval to begin recruiting its first class of residents, who are expected to begin training on July 1. The residency program, which takes three years to complete, is approved to accept 12 residents a year for a total of 36 at full capacity . \"Through this new residency program and clinic, Lee Health is developing well-educated, highly trained physicians, creat-ing greater accessibility to needed care in the community ,\" said Dr. Maja Delibasic, program director of the Internal Medicine Residency Program at Lee Health/Cape Coral and associate professor of Clinical Sciences at Florida State University College of Medicine. \"Our hope is that the majority of the residents we train stay here in Southwest Florida once they complete their residency .\" While the residency program will be based at Cape Coral Hospital, it will offer opportunities for residents to also train and see patients at the new Cape Coral Internal Medicine Residency Clinic with oversight from several faculty physicians who will begin practicing at the clinic once it opens. The new clinic - formerly a bank - underwent extensive renovations before opening to the public. It has ten exam rooms, a room for small outpatient proce-dures, and a designated room for vaccine administration and blood work. Plans are being made for the clinic to have a psy-chologist and social worker in the future. The residency program is currently in the recruitment process, receiving nearly 1,700 applications to date, including more than 1,000 in the first 24 hours. Match Day will take place on March 18. FSU College of Medicine is also the aca- demic sponsor of a family medicine resi-dency program at Lee Memorial Hospital, a Global Health Fellowship program, and a postdoctoral psychology fellowship training program. This will be the fourth academic teaching program Lee Health offers in partnership with the Florida State University College of Medicine. Barry University's College of Nursing and Health Sciences is proud to showcase a celebration of Black History Month with a touching alumni tribute. The joy of one incredible alum overcoming family trau-ma, then going on to secure a prestigious healthcare administrative fellowship is cer-tainly noteworthy , but when a brother and sister both accomplish these feats, it's a story we are honored to share. \"The Durojaiye Siblings: A Shared Journey of Dreams\" will make its premier at a Virtual Watch Party on February 19, 2022 at 7:00 pm. Assistant Professor, Dr. Jeffrey Ritter, will host the evening and will lead a virtual Q&A with the Durojaiye Siblings, and Oyinkansola Ogunrinde, president of ACHE of South Florida (ACHE-SFL), immediately following the film premier. \"It is exciting to know our College of Nursing and Health Sciences has been part of creating this first-ever documentary highlighting two former CNHS graduate students. I am grateful these distinguished alums are willing to share their journeys with the world. I think many who watch this film will see qualities within them-selves exemplified in siblings Bukky and Dapo. I believe their grit and dedication to reaching their dreams will inspire you. It is stories like this that showcase the pride we have in our students and their incredible commitment to improving both healthcare and the lives of others,\" Dr. John McFadden, Dean. The film takes us on a journey , as the Durojaiye Siblings take a chance on the Nigerian VISA lottery , move together to the United States and succeed first in banking, then in a dual master's degree program at Barry University , which propels each to a competitive fellowship opportu-nity at renowned U.S. hospitals. The film, written by Zac Rigg and filmed by Antonio Paris and Francisco Roa, intro-duces (Bukky) and Oladapo (Dapo) Durojaiye. Along with their imme-diate family members, the pair entered the Nigerian lottery taking a chance for a future in America. As luck would have it, the siblings were both selected and moved together to Missouri in July 2014. Learning a new culture and creating con-nections proved an arduous task, but through commitment and determination they created a path full of integrity , dedica-tion and an obvious passion for helping others. Starting part-time, then promoted to full time, the siblings both earned promotions and started bright futures in banking. Dapo enjoyed banking, but wanted to return to his original career plan - to work in healthcare, so he researched and started the Master of Science in Health Services Administration and Master of Science in Public Health, a dual degree program at Barry University . Intrigued, Bukky was quick to enroll in the dual degree program as well and their experiences ignited a for-midable desire that could not be extin-guished.

Having grad-uated over 1,000 students to date, it is worth noting that U.S. News and World Reports ranks the pro-gram as the number one Health Administration program in Florida and further as the number one Health Care Executive MBA program in the United States. Leveraging our expertise in delivering health management and policy education and wishing to draw from a broader pool of less experienced applicants, in 2017 we launched an in-residence Master of Health Management and Policy (MHA) program geared toward early careerists. This resident MHA program serves also as a suitable option for applicants await-ing acceptance and matriculation into medical school. We further offer joint MD/MBA and JD/MHA degrees as well as a health administration undergradu-ate major and minor, each of which draw a significant number of pre-med and other service-oriented stu-dents. Several years ago, Miami Herbert Business School's HEMBA program adopted the gold standard for compe-tency development and achievement, the National Center for Healthcare Leadership (NCHL) compe- tency model, which was also applied to MHA program development. The pur-pose of implementing this model was to assure that the programs could develop through their curricula the knowledge and skills necessary for graduates to excel in the field of practice. It was well understood among the academic and professional communities that, with the appropriate tools, graduates could suc-cessfully lead organizations to deliver quality outcomes, including the skills necessary to confidently assume chal-lenges and advance innovative solutions to the complex problems of health serv-ices delivery today . To develop high levels of competence, students are exposed to exceptional fac-ulty , including two former Secretaries, U.S. Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, PhD, who served also in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Alex M. Azar, JD. Faculty are led by University of Miami President, Dr. Julio Frenk, former Secretary of Health, Mexico, and Dean, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as Dr. John Quelch, Dean, Miami Herbert School of Business, for-merly Senior Associate Dean, Harvard Business School, and Dean, London Business School. We are uniquely positioned in the mar- ketplace, as the HEMBA and MHA pro-grams are dually accredited by the Assembly of Accredited Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME). In addition, we belong to the Business Alliance for Health Management Education (BAHM), mem-bership of which comprises a small group of 17 of the most prestigious Business School based Health Management programs globally , includ-ing Harvard, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania (Wharton), and the University of California, Berkeley . Furthermore, we actively engage with professional colleagues through the Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA), recent-ly spearheading the planning of its 2021 Annual Meeting, providing keynote speakers, and serving on committees as well as the board of directors. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensi- fied the need for healthcare trendsetters equipped to solve complex operational issues while harnessing opportunities for innovation. Miami Herbert's HEMBA and MHA programs prepare executives, health care professionals, and early careerists to meet such challenges. With its distinguished business faculty , adja-cent ties to UHealth, the University of Miami's medical school, and partnerships with health care leaders worldwide, our programs offer rich learning experiences that position graduates for executive and other leadership roles across the health-care landscape.

BY SUZANNE J. WOOD, PHD, MS, FACHE 16 February 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News HEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE EDUCATION As the first months of 2022 begin to unfold, so does the opportunity for a new beginning. This year, let our New Year's resolution be to establish and maintain health care environments that are as healthy for nurses as they are for their patients. We have the knowledge and tools necessary to accom-plish this resolution. Linked to pioneers like Florence Nightingale, nursing has long been considered the most trusted profession. We know that without high-quality , appropriately staffed nursing care, health care sys-tems are unsustainable. Without nurses, hospitals can't save lives. Consequently , the well-being of nurses is central to provision of health care and to the viability of health care systems. During the COVID-19 pandemic these past two years, frontline health care workers have faced well-documented struggles that have taken a deep, ongoing toll\u2014mental, emotion-al, and physical. Nurses, such as those caring for patients with COVID-19, often provide a near-constant presence at the patient's bedside for extended periods. Thankfully , there exists an evi-dence-based blueprint for improving nurse well-being that can guide us toward fulfilling our 2022 resolution. The central elements of this blueprint are encompassed in the standards of a healthy work environment. Healthy work environ-ments will attract and retain nurses. Compensation is just one of many factors that must be considered. In my recently coauthored editorial for the American Journal of Critical Care, I outlined the six standards for establishing and sustaining healthy work envi-ronments that have been articulated as essential by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN). The six standards are: skilled communication, true collaboration, effective decision-making, appropriate staffing, meaningful recognition, and authentic leadership. These standards, taken together, will enable nurses to control nursing practice, deliver excellent care, and be full partners in health care delivery . Healthy work environments maximize the contributions of nursing, improve nurse well-being, and have the potential to mitigate the stresses accompanying pandemic care. What is required is the will and the resources to create and maintain healthy work environments, and this com-mitment is even more urgent in our current crisis. We have learned a great deal in the two years since we celebrated the first-ever International Year of the Nurse and Florence Nightingale's 200th birthday in 2020. Despite health system staffing crises and many other challenges that have come to light amid this ongoing pandemic, there is still much to be opti-mistic about when it comes to the nursing profession. Among those reasons for optimism I count our school's 563 nursing students and 550 public health and health science students, not to mention the more than 600 students we graduated in 2021. New students are committing to the health professions in droves with their eyes wide open. Veteran nurses are finding new ways to make a difference through advanced degrees, advocacy , research, and leadership. They will propel nursing toward new horizons. To help realize their vast promise and potential, I and other nurse leaders must seize this moment to fully embrace the imperative of a healthy work environment, authentically live it, and engage others in its achievement. Restoring the well-being of nurses through improving the health care work environment will have broad benefits for patients, families, the health care team, health systems, and society . The need is urgent, and the time is now. We at the University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies are committed to this novel, optimistic, world-changing profession. Cindy L.

Our resident physi-cians have completed their medical degree and are in training to special-ize in Internal Medicine. As a commitment to improving access to outstanding primary care services to patients and the community , Holy Cross Health has a same-day primary care prac-tice, MD ASAP , which is staffed by University of Miami - Holy Cross Health Internal Medicine faculty and resident physicians. MD ASAP targets patients who need same-day care, need to estab-lish with a new primary care doctor or are unable to see their own doctor. Our residents practice in two sites, one in the Holy Cross Health medical office build-ing across from the Holy Cross Healthplex and the other at the Holy Cross office in Wilton Manors. Involving our resident physicians in MD ASAP as part of their training has many benefits: Volume of diseases: Be - cause we see a vast array of patients, many for a same-day appointment through MD ASAP , resident physi-cians are introduced to diverse illnesses with an acute presentation every day during the work week. This allows the patients to have their illness addressed immediately and enables resident physicians to learn from the sheer volume of cases that come in. Collaboration and continuity of care: The team-based approach to care, the team's full access to electronic medical records and the fact that patients who are seen through MD ASAP are referred back to their primary physician if there is one, means that resident physicians learn to better collaborate, communicate and provide continuity of care. We have 42 residents in our offices at different times maintaining that continuity and commu-nication. Our approach allows for a more in-depth assessment and a plan tailored specifically to patients with services designed to help those in need. Resident physicians utilize their interpersonal communication skills to communicate and develop a rapport with patients which is critical. Residents also hone their communication skills collaborating with fellow residents and staff physi-cians. Partnerships: The partnerships that are created between the hospital, physician groups and clinical practices increase the access resident physicians have to other physicians and to a large referral net-work. Pipeline for physicians: Residencies can lead to full-time positions with hos-pitals and physician groups. That's a ben-efit to both the resident physician and the physician practice group. For resi-dent physicians, that means a full-time position in an already-familiar environ-ment. For the hospital and physician group, this ensures that the best and brightest resident physicians will contin-ue providing the highest quality health-care in South Florida. A win-win-win: Patients benefit twofold with access to a team approach to care, as well as longer appointment times that allow more face time with our physicians. Our resident physicians ben-efit from exceptional training and future career opportunities, particularly in South Florida where there is an increas-ing demand for primary care physicians. The hospital system benefits by having access to exceptional resident physicians added to their staff; while referring physicians can rest assured that their patients will be served expeditiously and with the utmost compassionate care, with records sent to referring physicians for follow-up care. As a primary care physician for 30 years, training the next generation of doctors has been the most fulfilling part of my career. I am so fortunate to contin-ue this mission as director of the Internal Medicine Residency Program at Holy Cross as we partner to deliver the highest quality of care to our vibrant and unique community .

Thanks to advance-ments in cardiac care, how-ever, new options are now available for patients suffer-ing from many types of heart disease. Today , minimally inva- sive approaches designed to treat heart conditions can offer alternatives to tradi-tional open surgeries. Structural heart spe-cialists can replace heart valves and repair structural heart defects without the large incisions used in standard open-heart sur-gery . These small incision surgeries and \"transcatheter\" procedures are less inva-sive and often result in less pain, less scar-ring and a shorter recovery period. Structural heart disease refers to defects in the valves, or walls of the heart cham-bers. The term also encompasses condi-tions that one is born with, acquired by injury , infection or developed over time by aging. Structural heart conditions may and Additionally , arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation may have structural heart implica-tions because they can lead to blood clots forming within the left atrial appendage of the heart. Recognizing the need for maore advanced treatment options, The Robson Heart & Vascular Institute at Jupiter Medical Center created a dedicated Structural Heart Program. Led by William Kokotos, M.D., a pioneer in structural heart procedures, his addition to the hos-pital's heart center further expands the treatment options for patients with heart disease. Dr. Kokotos was Chief of Cardiac Surgery at NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island (NYULH-LI) prior to his tenure at Jupiter Medical Center. He initiated and directed the program that performed the first commercial percutaneous mitral valve repair on Long Island, NY. Under Dr. Kokotos' direction, specialists at Jupiter Medical Center recently intro-duced innovative alternatives for patients suffering from life threatening or life alter-ing cardiac issues including: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): treats patients diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis. During the procedure a catheter is inserted via an artery . The catheter is used to place a new valve with-in the diseased valve. Once the new valve is secure, the catheter is removed. The replacement valve takes over for the dis-eased valve and helps regulate blood flow from the heart. MITRACLIPTM : This is a percutaneous minimally invasive procedure to treat a leaking mitral valve. It is used as an alter-native for the high-risk patient, rather than undergoing traditional open cardiac surgi-cal intervention. This is a catheter-based procedure that is performed from the groin. WATCHMANTM: The WATCH- MANTM procedure offers an alternative for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) who need an alternative to blood thinners. The WATCHMANTM implant is designed to close the heart's left atrial appendage. The device permanently reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation related stroke. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of stroke as we get older. TAVR, MITRACLIPTM and WATCH- MANTM are just some of the revolution-ary cardiac procedures at Jupiter Medical Center. Additional structural heart proce-dures include: \u0081 Transcatheter mitral valve replacement al fibrillation. Convergent procedure \u0081 Minimally invasive treatments to pre- vent thrombotic complications associated with atrial fibrillation. These treatments include the watchman device and thoraco-scopic ligation of the left atrial appendage. Patients suffering from cardiac condi- tions should talk to their doctor about their individual diagnosis and treatments that may be right for them.

How do you diagnose can- cer-related cardiac condi-tions? The team at the Diagnostic Center utilize advanced echocardiograms that measure how your heart muscle contracts to check your heart health. They use echocardiograms to create 3D models of your heart to see how well it pumps blood. To say that running the Diagnostic Center has been challenging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is an understatement. Safety protocols to pro-tect patients and healthcare personnel have been in place from the beginning - and throughout the pandemic's surges \"We have our routine mix of cardio- vascular patients that come from our car-diologists, and on top of that, there's our cancer patients, which are coming straight from the oncologists,\" explains Socrates V . Kakoulides, M.D., a cardiolo-gist with Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute and medical director of the Institute's Diagnostic Center, who has training and expertise in echocardiogra-phy and nuclear cardiology \u2014 advanced tests utilized in the diagnosis, manage-ment and follow-up of patients with heart disease. \"Some of these patients are being referred from our physicians who are fol-lowing them clinically ,\" he said. \"And then throughout the year, depending on whether or not we're going through a surge here, we have patients who are recovering from COVID or may have been exposed to COVID. And so how do we keep our patients safe while they're in our space. It's a challenge - but we are getting it done.\" The advanced echocardiograms at the Institute's Diagnostic Center deploy a technique known as \"strain imaging.\" In cardiac imaging, the diagnostic medical sonographer can measure the rate of deformation of the ventricular wall in various dimensions, providing are more precise view of early myocardial (heart's muscular tissue) dysfunction. Heart fail-ure can be detected, which is when the lower left chamber of the heart (left ventricle) gets bigger (enlarges) and cannot contract sufficiently to pump the right amount of oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body . In cancer patients, gru- eling chemotherapy ses- sions can have an effect on the heart, especially in those with underlying health issues, such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclero-sis (hardening of the arteries). The so-called strain echocardiography has functioned so well at the Institute's Diagnostic Center, that Baptist Health is looking to expand this imaging capabili-ty to other diagnostic facilities through-out the system. \"The reason why we do these echo studies on cancer patients is to make sure that they don't suffer from cardiac dys-function while getting chemotherapy ,\" said Dr. Kakoulides. \"And, obviously , there are medical therapies that can be used to intervene so that we can keep patients on their chemotherapy should they develop heart dysfunction.\" Echocardiographic imaging is vital for patient monitoring during what is known medically as \"cardiotoxic cancer therapy .\" Left ventricular ejection frac-tion (LVEF) is the most commonly used parameter for identifying left ventricular dysfunction. But LVEF may lack sensitiv-ity needed to detect subtle changes in cardiac function caused by early muscle cell damage from cardiotoxic cancer treatment. Jorge L. Hernandez, a cardiac/vascular sonographer at the Institute, said there's a particular protocol for cardio-oncology patients. \"Strain echocardiography is particular to patients with cardio-oncology issues because the strain is can pick up changes in their left ventricular function, or left ventricular wall, motion that the blind eye can't see,\" explains Mr. Hernandez. \"So, we have state-of-the-art machines that have strain echocardiography and they allow us to provide a superior qual-ity echocardiogram. It requires extra training for the technologists and certain physicians that are trained in under-standing strain echocardiography . And that sets us above a lot of facilities that can't provide this service.\" Cardiology Cancer Patients with Heart Issues Benefit from Advanced Imaging T ech at Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute's Diagnostic Center Dr. Socrates V .

HILL UHealth - University of Miami Health System is home to cardiac and vascular experts who pioneer and advance the lat-est diagnostic and surgical procedures. As an academic-based cardiac and vascu-lar center, patients are provided with innovative, research-based approaches to clinical care for even the most complex cases. Leading experts from cardiology , cardiac surgery , and vascular surgery work collaboratively with subspecialists from several disciplines. In 2021, the American Heart Association and Mitral Foundation rec-ognized UHealth with the Mitral Valve Repair Reference Center Award for demonstrating a record of superior clini-cal outcomes resulting from evidence-based, guideline-directed degenerative mitral valve repair. Joseph Lamelas, M.D., chief and program director of car-diac surgery at UHealth and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said of the recognition, \"This is truly a team effort, and we are proud to be able to offer our patients the best pos-sible outcomes in their journey to better heart health.\" Dr. Lamelas pioneered a minimally invasive approach to cardiac surgery called \"The Miami Method.\" He performs five to seven mitral valve repairs and/or replacements each week. His approach, which offers quicker recovery , and reduced risk of infection and complications, is especially promis-ing for high-risk patients who otherwise have limited surgical treatments. These excellent patient outcomes have been recognized with maximum star ratings by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. For patients with irregular heartbeats, the Center for Atrial Fibrillation offers leading-edge personalized care and inno-vative diagnostic tools and treatments that are only available at UHealth. Chief of the cardiovascular division, Jeffrey Goldberger, M.D., M.B.A., is the princi-pal investigator of a National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial that exam-ines the role of epicardial fat on heart function and disease. Dr. Goldberger, a renowned electro- physiologist, also developed \"4D\" MRI, an innovative approach to accurately measure the velocity of blood flow in the heart. Known for its comprehensive treatment options and risk modification programs, UHealth's expert cardiology team delivers in-depth and comprehen-sive care to each patient. \"We are com-mitted to improving the health and well-being of every AFib patient,\" said Dr. Goldberger. \"Our center will continue to be in the forefront of advancing care for this progressive disease.\" Luanda Grazette, M.D., M.P .H., profes- sor of medicine at the Miller School and director of Advanced Heart Failure, Heart Failure Recovery and Therapeutic Innovation, oversees the newly expand-ed Heart Failure Program's advanced interventions that help prevent disease progression. This includes stem cell treatment and research, heart transplant at the Miami Transplant Institute at UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital, and ventricular assist device (VAD) place-ment. Through the cardiovascular division's Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine Program, UHealth offers specialized care to patients with lipid disorders, high cholesterol or high triglycerides and other conditions that carry high risks for major vascular disease complications.

SOUTH FLORIDABroward Health is committed to investing in advanced cardiac services upgrades. With its more than 50-year history of provid-ing heart care, Broward Health is considered a leader in cardiovas-cular treatments. As one of the nation's top 10 largest public hospital systems, Broward Health's multidiscipli-nary team of experienced car-diac team provides comprehen-sive clinical, surgical and reha-bilitative care. Advanced Care Close to Home Both Broward Health Coral Springs and Broward Health Imperial Point recently expanded cardiovascular offerings with state-of-the-art cardiac catheterization labs to provide patients with advanced and life-saving cardiac procedures close to home. \"When it comes to a heart attack, time is of the essence,\" said Mammen P . Zachariah, M.D., Director of Cardiovascular Services, Broward Health Imperial Point. \"Having a cardiac catheter-ization lab close to home allows our mul-tidisciplinary medical team to quickly determine crucial and life-saving next steps in treatment.\" At Broward Health Imperial Point, the cath lab and interventional radiology suite is on the ground floor -- just steps from the Emergency Department. This provides cardiac patients and their fami-lies with a more seam-less experience. The new cardiac suite includes two procedures rooms, seven patient care bays, an isolation room, a room devoted to echocardiograms, three diagnostic stress lab sta-tions, and a spacious waiting room equipped with the latest patient monitoring technology . The comprehen-sive cardiac and interventional radiology unit seamlessly combines interconnected services, providing patients with the high-est quality , timely care. \"Patients also have access to screenings and diagnoses as well as treatment for car-diovascular conditions such as chest pain, heart attacks, heart failure, heart valve problems, cardiogenic shock and more,\" said Randy Gross, CEO of Broward Health Imperial Point. At Broward Health Coral Springs, patients also have access to advanced screenings and diagnoses in the hospital's expansive cath lab that includes four patient care bays and is equipped with the latest patient monitoring technology . \"The goal of our cath lab is to help improve the overall health of the com-munity where our physicians perform a variety of diagnostic tests associated with cardiac and vascular diseases, so patients are treated closer to home,\" said Jared Smith, CEO of Broward Health Coral Springs. A Leader in Cardiac Technology In bringing the latest in cardiac care to Florida, Broward Health Medical Center recently established a robotic electro-physiology program to treat heart rhythm disorders. By partnering with Stereotaxis, a global leader in innovative robotic technologies for cardiac arrhyth-mias, the Fort Lauderdale hospital expands access to advanced minimally invasive heart treatments. Broward Health Medical Center is the only hospital in South Florida offering robotic-assisted procedures to treat patients suffering from arrhythmias and is the first in Florida, and among the first in the nation, to adopt the latest Genesis Robotic Magnetic Navigation system. Broward Health Medical Center was also the first hospital in Broward County to offer patients with non-valvular atrial fib-rillation (NVAF), an alternative to long-term next-genera-tion WATCHMAN FLX Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) implant. The WATCHMAN FLX, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may re duce the risk of stroke in patients with NVAF who need an alternative to oral anticoagulation therapy . Since its inception, more than 300 proce-dures have been performed in seven years. In addition to being the first in bringing this technology , Broward Health is part of a large-scale clinical trial looking to expand the patient population eligible for the Watchman FLX. A clinical study , partly conducted at Broward Health Medical Center, revealed that the WATCHMAN FLX had a success rate of about 99%, said Ahmed Osman, M.D., medical director of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Lab at Broward Health Medical Center. \"We can discontinue blood thinners and have just as much pro-tection from stroke,\" he said. Additionally , Watchman FLX protection is continuous, unlike blood thinners, which must be stopped before and after surgery . Other benefits include potentially reducing risks of complication and possi-bly accelerating patient recovery . \"We are hoping that all patients who have AFib will have the chance of coming off blood thinners,\" Dr. Osman said. The re-imagined cardiac cath labs, clini- cal trials and the use of first-in-its-kind technology are just a few examples of Broward Health's multilayered approach to advanced cardiac care with a focus on enhancing patients' health and wellness.

Myocarditis is defined as inflammation of the heart muscle, and it can result from a viral infec-tion, immune-mediated disease, or immunomodu-latory treat ments. There can be a wide range at presentation, but symptoms generally in - clude chest pain, difficulty breathing, and/ or palpita-tions. Mild presentations of myocarditis can resolve with minimal to no treat-ment. Severe myocarditis can reduce the heart's ability to pump, elicit abnormal rhythms of the heart (arrhythmias), and result in permanent damage. This condition has been reported to affect the heart in adolescent boys after Covid-19 vaccination. Clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines lacked sufficient power to detect this rare complication. Now that more than 6 billion doses of the vaccine have been administered worldwide, cases of myocarditis follow-ing COVID-19 vaccination have been reported. This rare side effect has sparked a lot of media attention, resulting in many rumors on social media and beyond. Research coordi-nated by the medical com-munity has provided answers to these questions. Notably , a large case series out of England, including more than 38 million adults ages 16 and older, has studied the inci-dence of myocarditis in patients after COVID-19 vaccine or infection. This is the largest study to date of cardiac outcomes after COVID-19 vac-cination or infection, and the findings are published in the December 2021 issue of Nature Medicine. Fortunately , post-vaccine myocarditis remains rare, with occurrence ranging between one and ten for every million patients, depending upon the type of vaccine and patient demographic. Post-vaccine myocarditis was more likely to be seen in patients younger than 40 years. It was also more likely to occur after receiving an mRNA vaccine, and most occurred within the first week after vaccination. However, the myocarditis was typically mild, with symptoms resolving in a short time frame and with minimal treatment. The study also reports on the inci-dence of myocarditis after testing posi-tive for COVID-19. Importantly , patients were at least 4x more likely to have myocarditis from COVID-19 infection than from the vaccine. Also, heart disease from COVID-19 infection is more severe and may require a longer hospitalization or more involved treatment. In addition, the study observed an increased risk of pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias for those who tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Researchers and physicians generally agree that the vaccine is a safer option, when compared to the cardiac risks of getting the COVID-19 infection itself. Nowadays, there is a lot of misinforma-tion which can be misleading or confus-ing. When it comes to making an impor-tant decision about your health, be sure to talk to your own doctor about any questions or concerns you may have. They should be able to answer most questions about the vaccine and help you determine which option is best for you. Dr. Elliot Pearson is a Pediatric Cardiologist at KIDZ Medical in Palm Beach County. Findings reported in Nature Medicine: Post-vaccine myocarditis remains rare, occurring between one and ten times for every million patients. Post-vaccine myocarditis is more likely to occur in patients younger than 40. Myocarditis is more likely to occur after an mRNA vaccine. Patients were at least 4x more likely to have myocarditis from COVID-19 infection than from the vaccine. Heart disease from COVID-19 infection is more severe and may require a longer hospitalization or more involved treatment.Myocarditis Is Rare After Vaccination, According to New Research BY ELLIOT PEARSON, MD Cardiology 26 February 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsDelray Medical Center Uses New Ensite X System for Cardiovascular Procedures Delray Medical Center marks another milestone becoming the first hospital in Palm Beach County to use the new Ensite X EP System for cardiovascular EP procedures. This technology uses HD images to collect data providing accurate and linear visualization for physicians to map out any area of the heart. Electrophysiologist Dr. Yoel Vivas was the first physician in the county to use this new sys-tem at the hospital. \"I am truly honored to be able to perform the first procedure in Palm Beach County using the Ensite X System,\" said Dr. Vivas. \"Delray Medical Center is always looking at ways to invest in the latest life changing technology so we can provide the very best cardiac care to patients in our community .\" Some of the benefits to using the Ensite X technology include: \u0081 Redefined signal quality for mapping \u0081 Map 1,000,000 points without limitations \u0081 Address Bipolar Blindness capturing and enhancing better images \u0081 10x faster mapping and data collection \"This is just another way we are providing top notch cardiovascular services to our patients who can get the highest quality care right here in Palm Beach County ,\" said Dr. Jean-Pierre Awaida, medical director of the catheterization-lab at Delray Medical Center. \"The accuracy and imaging of this new device will give patients better outcomes and overall cardiovascular health.\" Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center Becomes First Hospital in Florida to Perform New Procedure for Atrial Fibrillation Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center reports it is the first hospital in the state of Florida to now offer the new LARIAT/Convergent Hybrid AF proce-dure for patients who have atrial fibrillation, or A-Fib. This technique combines left atrial appendage closure with the LARIAT and the Convergent proce-dure to ablate both the inside and outside part of the heart tissue causing A-Fib. This gives patients a bet-ter chance of curing their A-Fib, and reduce their risk of stroke. Dr. Nishant Patel and Dr. Matthew Kolek were the first two physicians to perform this type of procedure. \"1 in 4 adults over the age of 40 will develop A- Fib in their lifetime, but this new hybrid procedure is now giving people an opportunity to no longer suffer with this disease and be able to resume their daily activities,\" said Dr. Nishant Patel cardiotho-racic surgeon on staff at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. \"This hospital is at the forefront of new procedures for cardiac care, and our community has access to them right here in our backyard.\" Unlike traditional surgical treatments, the LARIAT procedure is completed through small punctures in the skin, so in addition to less pain, the patient ben-efits from a shorter recovery time and less risk of complications. The Convergent procedure effectively treats patients with chronic atrial fibril- lation. It utilizes radiofrequency to block irregular electrical signals by producing lesions, or scar tissue, on the heart.

This is why Redmond Burke, M.D., director of cardio-vascular surgery at Nicklaus Children's Hospital, has made it his life's mission not only to try to reduce the trauma of care for each patient over their lifetimes, but to leverage the power of information technol-ogy to improve medical outcomes. \"I always felt like a heart program should have a philosophy of care: Why are we here?\" he explained. \"My philosophy is to reduce the trauma of care for all of the children we touch with heart defects. \"Opening a chest and cutting a heart can be traumatic for both patients and their families,\" he continued. \"I wanted to focus on ways of accomplishing surgical goals with less trauma, fewer big incisions, less bleeding, and less injury to babies' bodies.\" Dr. Burke first became interested in becoming a heart surgeon in high school, when he saw a picture in a magazine of the first heart transplant. \"It captured my imagination,\" he said, \"so I went into my schooling oriented toward becoming a heart doctor, and I worked as hard as I could to get there. \"The hardest heart surgery you can do is on the smallest hearts, and that's the area I fell in love with,\" he added. \"Luckily , I had the dexterity required, and was able to train with the best surgeons in the world at Children's Hospital Boston. Then I went on to build my own heart program in Miami in 1995, and I have never regretted one moment of my career choice.\" As an attending cardiac surgeon at Children's Hospital Boston, Dr. Burke pio-neered minimally invasive interventions using endoscopic surgical techniques for congenital heart surgery , designing instru-ments and techniques in the laboratory . He subsequently performed a series of surgi-cal firsts, including the world's first plication, ligation. After graduating from Stanford University , he received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School and served as chief resident in cardiovascular surgery at Children's Hospital Boston before becoming the director of cardiovascular surgery at Miami Children's Hospital (now Nicklaus Children's Hospital) at the age of 36. An inventor and software developer, Dr. Burke also worked with colleagues to cre-ate the first database for congenital heart disease nationwide. \"I was blessed to be raised in Cupertino, CA, a few years before Apple was built in a garage three blocks from my house; I was surrounded by Silicon Valley high-tech people and innovators,\" he said. \"Realizing that doctors can't get better unless they can measure their perform-ance, I worked with some very smart col-leagues to create the first database for con-genital heart disease. \"If you can't measure your outcomes, you can't get better,\" he continued. \"And it's not just for doctors, either; moms and dads need this data to determine how good a surgeon is. We all want to think that we're the best, but now there is a platform that measures outcomes and reports the results on the Internet.\" As technology has advanced, Dr. Burke has not only continued to pioneer revolu-tionary surgical procedures, but has also embraced innovations that improve patient outcomes. \"The better you can picture an operation in your head, the more likely you are to succeed, and virtual reality and 3D model-ing are two unique tools that you can use to see operations before you perform them in the operating room,\" he explained. \"It's far better to have 10 steps of an operation enumerated on a chalkboard or demon-strated on 3D constructive tools for your team to use for planning than to make it up as you go along. It is safer, faster and more effective.\" He added that he is especially excited with advances in genetic therapy . \"The most thrilling thing that I've seen recently was the pig heart implanted in an adult with end-stage heart failure,\" he said. \"The heart was treated with genetic therapy to reduce the rate of rejection. \"We need small hearts for small babies, and most innovations that work in adults are too big,\" he continued. \"But if we are able to replace hearts with genetically modified hearts, it might buy our sickest babies extra months or even years.\" Even with all of the scientific advance- ments available, Dr. Burke knows that it is often the personal touch that makes the difference. \"The cardiac team at Nicklaus Children's Hospital has a passion for technology , but they also really care about the patients,\" he said. \"It's is an honor to be trusted with families' babies who have heart defects, and we've got a great team here that covers every aspect of cardiac care for these chil-dren; they are the best at what they do.\" Surgeon, Inventor, Innovator: Nicklaus Children's Hospital's Redmond Burke Dr. Redmond Burke Cardiology 28 February 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsPalm Beach Gardens Medical Center is now able to offer patients a new techno- logical advancement allowing doctors to see high quality images at low radiation dose levels for those suffering from heart disease. The Philips Azurion 7 M20 system with Clarity IQ provides high quality imaging, achieving a clearer visibility at low X-ray dose levels for any patient. Dr. Neerav Shah, chief of cardiology at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, per-formed the first case. \"This new technology will enable physicians to capture higher quality images at lower radiation doses, directly resulting in safe and quality care for our cardiac and vascular patients,\" said Dr. Shah. \"Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center continues to be at the forefront when it comes to cardiac care and this new tech-nology will allow patients to get the quality treatment they need at one of the top heart hospitals in South Florida.\" The Philips Azurion 7 M20 system allows physicians to conduct minimally invasive procedures treating a wide range of cardiac and vascular issues, including: \u0081 Coronary Artery Disease \u0081 Structural Heart Disease \"We are proud to be able to offer this new imaging system to our patients, and expand our cardiac services at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center\", said Teresa Urquhart, chief executive officer at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. \"Our community has a choice when it comes where they get treated for cardiol-ogy , and our hospital continues to show why we are among the very best when it comes to heart care.\" These catheter-based procedures are designed to reduce some of the risks and recovery time inherent in traditional sur-gical approaches. Among the many ben-efits of catheter-based interventions include: \u0081 Shorter hospital stays \u0081 Reduced recovery time without the pain of a large incision \u0081 Less visible surgical scarring.Philanthropist and businessman Leonard Abramson, recently made a donation of $10 million to establish an endowed chair of cardiac surgery at Jupiter Medical Center. Abramson made the gift in honor of his beloved late wife of 65 years, Madlyn. To recognize Abramson's generous gift, the new main entrance to Jupiter Medical Center has been named the Madlyn K. Abramson Plaza which features a water fountain in her honor. This was not Abramson's first gift to the Jupiter Medical Center Foundation, \"and I don't expect it to be my last,\" said the JMC Foundation board mem-ber of more than two decades. \"I'm very impressed with their leadership, and I'd like to help the hospital grow.\" In April of 2020, the medical center launched the Timothy and Jayne Donahue Cardiac Surgery Program. Dr. Arthur Katz, Medical Director of Cardiac Surgery and the current Madlyn K. Abramson Endowed Chair of Cardiac Surgery , has performed more than 225 open heart surgeries at Jupiter Medical Center. The additional philanthropic investment made by Abramson is enabling Jupiter Medical Center to continue expanding the breadth of innovative cardiovascular services to treat such conditions as valvular heart abnormalities, atrial fibrillation and aneurysms of the aorta. for aortic MitraClip mitral valves, the for AFib and minimally invasive cardiac surgery . \"Since the launch of our cardiac program and the addition of a minimally invasive car- diac surgeon, Jupiter Medical Center's capabilities have expanded to successfully treat nearly all cardiac conditions\" said Dr. Amit Rastogi, President and CEO, Jupiter Medical Center. Dr. Katz emphasized \"I am thrilled that we can now provide our patients the full gamut of cardiovascular services offered by our nation's top academic medical centers.\" Katz adds \"we are honored to welcome NYU trained Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgeon, Dr. William Kokotos, to Jupiter Medical Center's cardiac surgery program.\" \"Len's gift to cardiac surgery is creating a lasting legacy that will allow cardiac patients the care they need close to home,\" said Mike Morsberger, Chief Philanthropy Officer and President of Jupiter Medical Center Foundation. strokes and peripheral vascular throm-boses) to providing advanced heart ther-apies to those who develop heart failure, while also providing mechanical circula-tory support with extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation (ECMO) for acute cardio-respiratory failure in infant, child and adult patients throughout the entire region. Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital and Memorial Regional Hospital are each designated Gold Level Centers of Excellence, receiving the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Award for Excellence in Life Support. ECMO is often our last line of treatment for the sickest of our COVID-19 patients. At the same time, Memorial Cardiac and Vascular Institute has achieved many accomplishments. \u0081 Our Adult Cardiac Surgery program continues to be a regional leader in vol-umes and high-quality outcomes. \u0081 Memorial achieved the highest car- diac surgery volumes in the tri-county area during the third quarter of 2020 and has again earned a three-star rating, the highest category of quality , from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons for patient care and outcomes in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mitral valve replacement and repair (MVRR) for the period ending June2021. \u0081 Our Adult Heart Transplant program has completed its 75th heart transplant and is on track in 2021 to have the high-est volume since inception. \u0081 Our Heart Failure program has recruited a fourth specialty cardiologist to extend its reach in caring for advanced heart failure patients and was recently recognized for excellence with American College of Cardiology Heart Failure Accreditation. Our structural heart team, a multidis- ciplinary team comprised of interven-tional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, clinical cardiologists, imaging cardiolo-gists, heart failure cardiologists and anesthesiologists, continues to grow and provide catheter-based therapies as they become available to treat structural heart problems such as valvular heart disease. Every case is reviewed by this group of specialists to chart the course of treat-ment for each patient. The number of procedures performed in 2021 will be our highest ever, and our outcomes rank in the top decile nation-ally . Our Cardiology program matricu-lated its first class of cardiology fellows in July 2021 and looks forward to estab-lishing its footprint on Graduate Medical Education and research. Our Vascular Surgery program has imple-mented a new technique of treating carotid artery disease in high-risk patients. Transcarotid Artery Revas - cularization (TCAR) is less invasive than conventional carotid endarterectomy and, hopefully , reduces the risk of stroke even further compared to conventional stenting and surgery . Finally , our Electrophysiology pro- gram continues to be at the forefront of advances in electrophysiology treat-ments. Our expert electrophysiologists using our new EP suite are employing cutting edge, innovative approaches to control cardiac arrhythmias. In addition to rising to the occasion and meeting the demands imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Memorial Cardiac and Vascular Institute has con-tinued to grow and be a leader in deliv-ering the comprehensive and quality care to cardiovascular patients. Memorial is committed to ensuring our community and those further afield have access to quality management and treat-ment of cardiovascular illnesses. Memorial Cardiac and Vascular Institute has become a destination center for best practice care and world-class outcomes. Dr. Michael Cortelli is Chief, Memorial Cardiac and Vascular Institute.

Profiles In Cardiology 32 February 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsProfiles In Cardiology MEMORIAL REGIONAL cardiologist, Dr. Juan-Carlos Brenes special- izes in preventing cardiovascular disease, and the diagno-sis and treatment of valvular heart disease. His specialized training in cardiac imaging allows him not only to diag-nose but also to provide second opinions in valve-disease cases. When not caring for patients, his focus is on teach-ing and participating in academic activities with other car-diac specialists. Dr. Brenes has a long history of participating in cardiol- ogy fellowship programs, initially with Cleveland Clinic Florida, and then as Program Director at Mount Sinai Medical Center for nearly a decade. \"It is truly exiting to continue participating in Graduate Medical Education at Memorial Healthcare System, with our own, recently launched, cardiology fellowship program. It is espe-cially rewarding to see the trainees go on to become outstanding cardiologists.\" A native of Costa Rica, Dr. Brenes came to the U.S. in 1999 to take part in presti- gious William J. Harrington Medical Training Program at the University of Miami School of Medicine. He did his Internal Medicine internship, residency , and general cardiology training at Jackson Memorial Hospital and then completed a fellowship in advanced echocardiography at Columbia University in New York. Todd Roth, MD Dr. Todd Roth believes Memorial's Cardiac and Vascular Institute is a 'diamond in the rough' and will ultimately be one of the largest centers of its kind in the country . \"There are very few that can deliver the scope of services and comprehensive level of care we do,\" said Dr. Roth, co-medical director of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease program. \"And fewer still that have the talent and resources to offer everything to both pediatric and adult patients.\" Board certified in adult congenital heart disease, as well as pediatric cardiology and pediatrics, Dr. Roth has been part of Memorial Healthcare System for more than seven years.

In that time, the chief of Memorial's Cardiac and Vascular Institute is most proud of the high-quality program he and his colleagues have built. \"We've evolved into a multi-disciplinary , comprehensive center that offers all the clinical options, including trans-plants, to both pediatric and adult patients. We have a diverse level of expertise that's usually only seen at universi-ty-affiliated medical centers.\" Dr. Cortelli says the establishment of a cardiovascular fellowship, which was accredited in 2020, is what's driving Memorial's program forward now. Becoming a bigger player in graduate medical education means more research and interest from physicians seeking those opportunities. \"It's critical that all of us on the teaching side stay up to date on the latest literature and research. We're training the next generation of cardiology leaders and that ups everyone's game,\" said Dr. Cortelli. Iani Patsias, MD, FACC It was while completing a fellowship in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology at the University of Washington Medical Center that Dr. Iani Patsias was first excited by the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI). \"Machines can process massive amounts of data, detect pat-terns, and assist with diagnosis and risk stratification within population health. We're on the early side of determining all the applications for AI, but it will certainly stay at the fore-front of how we learn more about cardiology .\" Dr. Patsias says machines can detect subtleties in EKGs that humans can't, and its algorithms can detect an individual's likelihood of developing advanced heart disease, to cite just one possibility . AI will also enhance the workflow process, fuel research, and lead to the development of new drugs and treatment alterna-tives. \"These machines will enhance what human physicians are able to accomplish, not replace them,\" said Dr. Patsias. MEMORIAL HOSPITAL WEST Demetrio Castillo, MD Dr. Demetrio Castillo is a cardiac electrophysiologist that balances the use of the latest technology to diagnose and treat arrythmias with a patient-centered approach to care. \"I feel a responsibility to educate patients about their conditions so they can make informed decisions and not just provide con-sent. The more they understand the better they'll be able to take care of themselves,\" said Dr. Castillo. A graduate of New York University's School of Medicine, Dr. Castillo was a resident at Harvard Medical School before receiving fellowship training in both cardiovascular disease and electrophysiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He was first attracted to cardiology because of the precise nature of the specialty and cites the objective improvements in the patient's quality of life as the most satisfying aspect of the integrated, multi-disciplinary approach Memorial utilizes. Alian Aguila, MD Dr. Alian Aguila initially chose cardiology because he enjoyed science and physiology , but he soon found another aspect of the specialty he appreciated just as much. \"Establishing relationships with patients is very important, since you often follow their care over many years,\" said Dr. Aguila, who was recently named medical director for cardiol-ogy at Memorial Hospital West. \"Cardiology also interacts with other specialties, so we need to be aware of and help manage the overall patient experience.\" Dr. Aguila has been part of Memorial Healthcare System for more than seven years, initially at Memorial Regional Hospital after time spent in private practice. He is active in its Graduate Medical Education cardiology fellowship and, along with Dr. Ralph Levy , has established a cardio-oncology subspecialty clinic at Memorial Hospital West. It's the ongoing study of how cancer treatments affect the heart that has resulted in the doctor's connection to the Moffitt Malignant Hematology & Cellular Therapy program, a Memorial partner, and its survivorship program in Pembroke Pines.

Profiles In Cardiology JOE DIMAGGIO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Thomas Forbes, MD Dr. Thomas Forbes, a pediatric cardiologist and the chief of pediatric cardiology at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, has a master plan for making Memorial Healthcare System an epicenter for data that aids in the development of cardiac equipment and devices. \"In collaboration with the nonprofit CCISC (Congenital Cardiovascular Interventional Study Consortium), we'd build modular registries that would cover nearly all of the procedures performed here,\" said Dr. Forbes, who was pre-viously at Detroit Medical Center in Michigan. \"Our goal in working with the FDA and Japanese regulatory organiza-tions is to get pediatric devices more quickly approved, so manufacturers would be able to go through the registries we've set up to access clinical trial data. Registries that, for the first time, would enable them to utilize retrospective data for a more efficient and cost-effective process.\" Dr. Forbes says fetal, pediatric, and adult cardiology would all benefit from the global initiative. Peter Guyon, MD A pediatric interventional cardiologist, Dr. Peter Guyon decided early on during rotations at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine that caring for children would be his focus. \"I appreciate the resiliency of kids and how direct and honest they are about their feelings,\" said Dr. Guyon. Dr. Guyon says it's important for him to be flexible in his approach to patients, since diagnosis and treatment explanations for the congenital issues he most often sees dif-fer depending on the age of the individual. Parents can also add another challenging dynamic. The study of cardiology caught Dr. Guyon's interest from the beginning, with its mixture of physiology , physics, and engineering. Following medical school in Philadelphia, Dr. Guyon headed west to the University of California San Diego, where he completed an internship, residency , and fel-lowship training. The doctor arrived in South Florida late in 2021 and is part of the expansion of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital's cardiology team. Jared Klein, MD, MPH Dr. Jared Klein, a specialist in pediatric imaging cardiology , didn't have to look beyond his own home to find a medical role model. \"I remember my dad (Dr. Allan Klein) reading echocardiograms on VHS tapes when I was a kid. I was exposed to hospitals early on and went to national and inter-national medical conferences.\" Unlike his father, the younger Dr. Klein chose to work with pediatric patients, focusing on both echo and MRI. \"The experience I gained in MRI (a fellowship at Nemours Children's Health in Wilmington, Delaware) really helps arrive at a quicker diagnosis,\" said Dr. Klein, who also did fellowship training in pediatric cardiology at Cleveland Clinic Hospital. \"I enjoy that everything you need to know is right in front of you.\" A newcomer to South Florida that is part of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital's growing cardiology team, Dr. Klein says 'Joe D.' provides one of the most collegial and unique hos-pital environments he's ever worked in.

Millions of people rely on NSAIDs to control symptoms of chronic pain and inflammation, however, NSAIDs come with some risk. Studies have shown they may cause toxicity to one's liver, kidneys, and upper GI-tract. PrRelf combines powerful flavonoids from Skull Cap and Green Tea to provide extraordinary anti-inflammatory sup-port, while added benefits of Boswellia and T urmeric supercharge the anti-inflammatory action. CBG and Delta-8 isolate round out the overall analgesic effects. Unlike NSAIDs that may cause undesirable side effects, PrRelf is a combination of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) ingredients, that have shown no toxic-ity over periods of long-term use. It is a COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor. PrRelf's convenient form makes it easy to consume, and the Appleberry fla-vor is derived from organic fruit extract. To some, this also comes as a surprise that part of the natural cannabis plant may be a viable medical solution to what is arguably the largest global healthcare crisis in most of our lifetimes. Yet to others this is seen as an opportunity to spread the word that the cannabis plant does have natural benefits that remain to be seen and accepted in tra-ditional modern medicine. In the United States, many barriers exist that prevent much-needed cannabis-relat-ed research to occur. Research studies begin with a question. It could be a \"why?\" as in \"why does this do what it does?\" It could be a \"how?\" as in \"How does this do what it does?\" When it comes to cannabis as a medical intervention, there are many \"why's\" and \"how's\". There are also many researchers, practitioners, educators, and especially patients who want to know the answers to the many questions surround-ing the mystery of the cannabis plant. In fact, even those who condemn all things cannabis would benefit from knowing as much scientific fact as possible. If there are dangers and side effects, we all want to know. If there are benefits, we for sure all want to know. Why is this particular study of such importance? It is important on so many levels. Let's begin with the obvious: it is a positive story about cannabis that has sparked the interest of the media. The majority of media stories shared about cannabis have a negative angle. And the fact that it is positive and timely to a con-dition that nobody has truly seemed to find a great solution for makes it an inter-esting story to share with the public. The positive outcome of this initial work estab-lishes and justifies continued work to advance the science in this area. Of course, the hope is that the laboratory studies have future clinical and translational impact. Yet there is a greater effect that this study potentially has that reaches far beyond a potential COVID solution. Imagine, just imagine, if a cannabinoid is found to be a medically acceptable intervention or viable preventative approach. In addition to the openly receptive and perhaps even enthu-siastically requested thirst for the success-ful cannabinoid, individuals from all facets of life may begin to wonder if components of the cannabis plant that some people have been claiming for years have medici-nal value may in fact be true. Perhaps more patients would inquire about cannabis for their ailing short and long-term health conditions. Researchers might find increased amount of funding available for meaningful studies with less red tape to navigate through. Practitioners would lis-ten to patients and adhere to their respon-sibility of knowing how cannabis works, for what conditions, in what dosages, etc... Educators in all walks of life from public health to business and marketing would be taught in school the most cur-rent information. In essence, what Malcom Gladwell eloquently refers to as \"The Tipping Point\" will have been reached. This is a single study and rarely does a single scientific study serve to create cul-tural change. It is not likely this study will either. However, this study dominated a news cycle and helped to bring to the attention of the general public a positive study about cannabis in an extremely timely manner for an extremely important topic. Today covid. Tomorrow cancer? As more quality research is not only conduct-ed but also disseminated, whatever effects cannabis has on the health of individuals will ultimately be known to all.

Their laboratory facilities are registered with the FDA, EPA, and have been audited by these agencies to ensure compliance with GLP and cGMP standards. In late December 2021, Americanna was granted regulatory approval from the Florida Department of Health to conduct medical marijuana compliance testing as the state's most recent Certified Marijuana Testing Laboratory (CMTL). This will allow them to analyze medical marijuana samples from Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers who are providing much needed medicine to patients throughout the state. The company is now the ninth facility licensed by the Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) to perform con-sumer safety and quality control testing in the state of Florida. Under state regu-lations, medical marijuana testing labs can acquire, possess, test, transport, and lawfully dispose of medical cannabis only if licensed to do so by the OMMU. \"At Americanna, we have set a high standard for ourselves,\" says Wyman Dickey , CEO of the company . \"It's great to see our dedicated team achieving, and in many cases, exceeding the goals we have set for them. Attaining our CMTL is another example of how our team sur-passes benchmarks and raises future expectations.\" As a result of the certification, Dickey notes they can further expand their qual-ity initiatives. \"Providing an assurance of safety to Florida medical marijuana patients is a serious endeavor,\" he adds. \"One we heartily understood and accepted when entering this industry . Our passion for the mission took root here in Florida, but it's only the beginning. We are continu-ing our work to improve in every facet and expand our reach every day .\" 30 Years of Testing Experience as a Minority Owned Business As a leader in analytical testing servic- es, Americanna Labs has set the standard for testing in the cannabis and hemp industry . The company is dedicated to providing the best, most reliable and accurate testing by bringing ADPEN Laboratories' 30 years of analytical test-ing experience in agrochemical, pharma-ceutical, nutritional and food safety to the cannabis lab. The minority and family-owned com- pany's commitment to the highest labo-ratory quality standards translates into consumer safety and good science. With over three decades of testing experience, many Fortune 500 companies trust its analytical knowledge and services. In 2018, this led brothers Steven Perez and David Perez to form Americanna Laboratories. \"As an FDA and EPA audited facility , we understand the most stringent quality standard requirements to which our clients must adhere,\" explains Steven Perez, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer. \"We save our clients time, money and effort by managing, coordi-nating and reporting multiple test results under one roof, while providing the highest level of assurance of safety for the end-user.\" Accomplishments Over the Years Americanna's experience with FDA regulations provides new manufacturers a trustworthy partner who can advise clients on the importance of method test-ing and setting specifications for product ingredients and characteristics. One of its proudest achievements is an ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation by PJLA, an international accreditation body . After earning that ISO certification, Americanna became one of just seven testing labs statewide added to the FDACS approved lab (List of Approved Designated Laboratories) for THC Testing. Florida is known for having one of the most stringent hemp regulatory programs in the country . Licensed hemp growers must have all hemp grown in Florida sampled for THC compliance (not to exceed 0.3%) within 30 days of harvest by one of the seven approved labs on the list. Last year, the company expanded its scope of ISO accreditation to include more products and offer a one-stop test-ing solution, which complies with FDA regulations. Tests such as identification, potency , dosage uniformity , homogeneity dissolution and shelf-life along with con-taminant testing for pesticides, microbial agents, residual solvents and heavy met-als can all be done in-house at its facility . Looking Ahead Recently , the company's method devel- opment for testing Delta 8 products has allowed for greater peak separation to be identified and provide greater service to its existing clients. \"Based on the needs of our clients, we had added more testing of dietary sup-plements which coincides well with our 30+ years of experience as an analytical lab,\" says Dickey . \"We also offer potency to full panel testing on hemp and cannabis products. This allows clients to first view the potency results prior to tests being run for heavy metals, residual solvents, mycotoxins, and pesticides. This can save a client time and money if a product does not meet their manufac-tured expectations. Certain clients devel-oping specific formulations and ratios of cannabinoids benefit from our high level of customer service.\" All of these items lead up to a firm footing for the start of 2022, says Dickey . While expansion is on the horizon, he says that the focus will always remain on consumer safety and bringing added value to its clients. \"The Americanna Lab team is poised to make this happen,\" he concludes.

With more than a decade of industry experience, they are known as a leading brand in the cannabis space and a pioneer in the industry . Ayr Wellness Opens 44th Florida Dispensary in Pinellas Park Ayr Wellness announced the opening of its newest dispensary in Pinellas Park Florida, its 44th in the state. \"We are thrilled with our progress to date in Florida, a market where we see tremendous upside and growth potential. With 44 stores now open, at least 21 additional stores expected in prime locations in 2022, and significant improve-ments to our cultivation and production operations driving increased quality and volume, Florida promises to be a significant driver to growth and share-holder value in quarters and years to come,\" said Jon Sandelman, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Ayr Wellness. The new dispensary will occupy over 2,700 square feet of prime retail space on one of the most heavily traveled routes in Pinellas County , population over 900,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The store will have six points of sale and feature Ayr's leading portfolio of premium offerings including Origyn Extracts, Secret Orchard Sun Gems and fruit-forward vapes, Big Pete's Cookies, and a selection of high-quality flower, including whole flower and pre-rolls. Curaleaf Opens Two New Florida Dispensaries in Tampa Bay and Largo Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. announced plans to open two new dispensaries in Florida by the end of January . The expansion will increase the company's retail footprint to 44 dispensaries statewide and 119 across the country . Curaleaf Tampa Bay Mabry , located at 13755 North Dale Mabry Highway , opened on Jan. 15 and Curaleaf Largo, located at 10289 Ulmerton Road, is expected to open soon after. In December, Curaleaf added four additional dis-pensaries in Stuart, Lady Lake, Wesley Chapel and Miami to continue to expand access to the company's quality products and services. Florida has evolved into one of the largest and fastest growing medical mar- kets in the country . Curaleaf has quickly expanded its retail presence and culti-vation footprint and introduced more innovative products, including Select Squeeze, Select Bites, Select Nano Bites, and its breakthrough vape hardware Cliq by Select, which features a proprietary gravity-fed pod and variable battery voltage settings, allowing patients to customize cannabis consumption experi-ences to their individual preferences.

Lauderdale Many industry buyers discover products by seeing them in other stores or browsing through distributor catalogs, but who dis-covers the products in these catalogs in the first place? Innovative buyers will tell you that the best place to find disruptive and unique products with the potential to become the next big thing is at trade shows. Brands like Redbull, Juul, and 5 Hour Energy were all discovered at these types of events before they went mainstream. The prob-lem then lies in finding the right show to attend. Most trade shows tend to be indus-try-specific events, and so they only show-case specific types of products. This has made it difficult for buyers to choose which events to attend, never being able to find an event that manages to encompass multiple industries and types of products under one roof, that is, until now. Alternative Products Expo emerged as an upgrade of the nation's largest CBD and Hemp event, USA CBD Expo, to incorpo-rate new audiences, new markets and new buyers in the most innovative industry event. The Alternative Products Expo -or ALT- PRO Expo- was created with the idea of bringing together an assortment of indus-tries (and the disruptive products & serv-ices within) under one roof. With this in mind, the organizers behind this show , ZJ Events, have consistently adjusted and evolved their scope to remain at the van-guard of industry trends. This evolution has meant reaching out to include thou-sands of business owners from all spec-trums of the alternative product market. The largest gathering of: Hemp-derived products Semi-synthetic extracts (Delta8/10) Functional Other Botanicals Nicotine Alternatives Nutraceuticals Other new , disruptive, innovative, trending, and high-demand products/ser-vices A prime opportunity for: Convenience stores Smoke shops Tobacco chains Health, Wellness & Sports Centers Big-box Retailers Industry Buyers like you \"...our team has been working tirelessly to create a new kind of event where we could incorporate the wide plethora of products, services, and brands that make up the alternative product's industry .\" - said Jason Monti, Director of Sales at ZJ Events. Join hundreds of exhibitors and thou- sands of attendees who will gather in Ft. Lauderdale this upcoming March 11th to the 13th at The Greater Fort Lauderdale / Broward County Convention Center to experience an industry event where alter-native products will take the spotlight. Participate in expert talks on the new Delta 8 craze, medicinal mushrooms extracts, and many other subjects relating to alter-native product developments (where it's going, trends, categories, etc).

LauderdaleAmericanna Laboratories Receives Certified Marijuana T esting Laboratory Approval Americanna Laboratories, LLC was granted regulatory approval from the Florida Department of Health to conduct cannabis compliance testing as the state's most recent Certified Marijuana Testing Laboratory (CMTL). With this approval, Americanna becomes only the ninth facility licensed by the Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) to perform consumer safety and quality control testing in the State of Florida. The lab already possesses over 30 years of expe-rience to coincide with USDA and EPA registrations. Co-Founders Steven Perez and David Perez first initiated expansion into analytical testing of cannabis in 2018 when Florida introduced their plans to begin both hemp and medical marijuana programs. \"We were not in a rush to be the first CMTL,\" stated Co-Founder Steven Perez. \"Every day we strive to give patients and consumers a greater sense of security know-ing the medicine they depend on has been tested for its safety and purity . This approval is another step in our progression to be the premiere testing laboratory in the cannabis industry . We have come a long way with gaining ISO 17025 accredita-tion, fine-tuning our methodologies, and developing satisfied clients across the nation. Now , we can analyze medical marijuana samples to help patients throughout the state.\" The approval marks the culmination of one noteworthy achievement with others to follow. \"2021 was a year of investment for us. We dedicated a significant amount of time and resources into the development of not only our methods but also our per-sonnel. The Americanna Lab team impresses us each day with their commitment to quality and accomplishing our mission of consumer safety . We are poised to expand our footprint in the cannabis market due to this commitment,\" said Wyman Dickey , CEO. after. We are one of the largest and most advocative practices in the state and believe that EDUCATION, PATIENT CARE, and CUSTOMER SERVICE are our daily mission. I am proud to be active in many aspects of the Medical Cannabis world and currently serve as a member of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee. I am also involved as a leader in Florida's Medical Cannabis Physicians Group. We are actively involved with the OMMU, and our Legislative leaders as we move forward with needed improvements to the pro-gram. How can people in Florida benefit from the company you represent? The benefits come from working with a Medical Cannabis practice that EDU-CATES you on the BEST use of cannabis. Once again, the hashtag is #RespectThePatient, #RespectThePlant. If your medical card visit doesn't contain education about ALL the cannabinoids, the ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM, and ALL the different routes of administration, then it's just about getting your dollars. Patients need to demand better of their cannabis practice. We are proud of what we do and how we do it. How did you get started within the cannabis industry? My 34 years as an Emergency Medicine provider in busy Ohio ERs taught me many things. One of the most obvious was what was destroying the lives of American citizens was NEVER cannabis! The disas-ter of excess alcohol use (acute and chron-ic), along with the increased abuse of opi-ates and benzodiazepines had resulted in countless lives impaired and lost through-out my career. Never once did I have to intubate a cannabis overdose, no one ever will. I also knew that I had never cared for a domestic couple who had \"beaten up their partner\" after smoking a joint together. Additionally , the CHRONIC effects of alco-hol and tobacco are seen in EVERY hospi-tal ER daily! SUBSTANCES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL! Thus, I started this part of my career in medicine as a social warrior, so to speak; the truth needed to be told. However, since I have now seen liter-ally thousands of medical cannabis patients, I speak to the fantastic MEDICAL BENEFITS of the cannabis plant. It only takes a few hours in my clinic to witness what a huge difference the use of cannabis, along with the EDUCATION on how best to use it, can make to patients. This wide base of patient care experience has made me an even more vocal proponent of cannabis as medicine. Are you personally a MJ card holder? Yes, of course. It's important to know that physicians in Florida can have their card as long as there is no evidence of impairment or risk to patients. I have many other doctors in my practice, as well as many nurses, paramedics and other healthcare professionals. They are often at risk of their positions of employment. EVERYONE should have licensure and job protections, and it's my pledge to stay on that soapbox until it happens here in Florida. It won't be easy , but it can happen if we keep the pressure on over the next few years. Medical cannabis needs to be treated exactly like every other medicine, with due respect to the patient that has taken the time and effort to get their card. Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/cannabis and how will that affect your business? Legal Adult-Use will come to Florida; when exactly is difficult to predict. The only thing that is certain is that it will be heavily taxed. I am often asked about the viability of my practice when \"pot goes legal.\" I respond with confidence that because of the EDUCATIONAL model of my clinic, we will thrive. There are many patients who have thought of using cannabis as medicine but because of the ILLEGALITY of it, would never take that step. Free of that fear, many will desire the KNOWLEDGE of how to use it best and will come for that expert advice. Keeping MEDICAL cannabis TAX FREE, the in-hospital and nursing home use of cannabis, JOB PROTECTIONS for cardholders and other concerns we fight for will maintain the importance of hold-ing a medical card. There may also be products available to only medical card-holders, not Adult Use purchasers. We will be busy , that I know! 42 February 2022 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News Florida TM Continued from back coverBack Cover Story: Cannabis Spotlight Subscribe to...

This means the amount of marijuana in a form for smok-ing a patient may purchase on any given day is calculated as the difference between the amount permitted by the patient's current order and the patient's total dispensation history over the past 35 days. The 35-day cycle is not based on the calendar month or certification-issued date. All patients will be given a 35-day tran- sitionary period from March 1, 2022 to April 4, 2022. During this time, only dis-pensations made on or after March 1, 2022, for marijuana in a form for smok-ing, will be used to calculate the amount available to be dispensed to the patient. Beginning April 5, 2022, all patients will start their own 35-day rolling limit, and MMTCs will not be permitted to dis-pense an amount in excess of a patient's 35-day rolling limit. As part of this Registry update, patients and caregivers will see a new \"Dispensable Amount\" value on their orders. The \"Dispensable Amount\" value is the total available amount of marijuana in a form for smoking that a qualified patient or caregiver may receive at any given time due to the patient's 35-day rolling limit. For more details about a patient's dis- pensation history and the date additional amounts will become available to the patient, you can access the new \"Dispensation History\" dashboard. This dashboard tracks all smoking dispensa-tions used to calculate the patient's \"Dispensable Amount.\" To view this new dashboard, expand your active Smoking Order in the Registry , and click the \"See Calculation\" link next to the \"Dispensable Amount.\" It is important to note that \"Date Expires\" means that the respective amount of marijuana in a form for smoking will become available the day following the date listed (i.e., the amount dispensed becomes available to the patient at midnight of the day follow-ing the date listed on \"Date Expires\"). The Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) has published an instructional guide on how to understand the Amount Available Calculation Page. This guide can also be found on the OMMU's website, here: https://knowthe-factsmmj.com/registry/#instructional-guides.

B Y DR. JEFF G. KONIN Recently van Breemen et al. from Oregon State University published a study titled \"Cannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Emerging Variants\" in the Journal of Natural Products. Published in a journal that likely even the most devoted of cannabis sup-porters do not read on a regular basis, this article swept the headlines of news agen-cies around the world. Why? Because the results show in a controlled in vitro envi-ronment that two cannabinoids (CBGA and CBDA) possess ligands with high affinity to the receptors where SARS-CoV-2 binds, serving as entry inhibitors and therefore preventing potential infection of the virus. Further clinical phased trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of similar interventions in humans before we jump to conclusions and make false claims regarding the meaning and inter-pretation of this study . However, in a world grasping for solutions to the cur-rent pandemic, a glimmer of promise is pleasantly welcomed. The glimmer comes in the form of timely and quality research.

Cannabis as a plant has ALWAYS been medicinal. We are simply living in an era of big pharma and big government control over our healthcare choices. The benefits of Medical Cannabis in Florida should be clear; to utilize it in a SAFE, LEGAL, and EDUCATED manner! The medical program, IF your doctor respects both the plant and the patient with the APPROPRIATE EDUCATION, allows this to happen. What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis Industry? The motivation behind being a part of the cannabis industry is easy; It's all about being a 2022 Physician and utilizing my 40 years of healthcare experience to the BEST benefit to modern society and my individual patients. I need to be one of those who lead the way toward the appropriate understanding of cannabis as a medicinal agent. Very few western conventionally trained are willing to carry the ball forward. For me, it's a daily passion. What field are you in within the cannabis space?
