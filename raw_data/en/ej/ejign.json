So, the current study aimed to assess the prevalence of CAM use among infertile patients. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted based on the preferred reported items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). The required data were obtained by searching some English databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and other records identi\u0000ed through The Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies published in English journals up to March 2023, examining the prevalence of CAM use among infertile patients. The retrieved articles were independently assessed by two reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved through discussion until consensus was reached. Results: Of 1192 documents reviewed, a total of 29 studies were included in this review. The results of the meta-analysis conducted on 32804 infertile patients showed that the prevalence rate of CAM use was between 26.3% (95% CI 21.7 to 31.3%) and 96.1% (95% CI 95.7 to 96.5%) in various countries. The pooled prevalence rate was calculated using random effects model. It was 54% (95% CI 46 to 61%) overall infertile women and men, 55% (95% CI 47 to 67%) and 29% (95% CI 17 to 41%) among infertile women and men separately. Conclusion: More than half of the infertile patients used CAM. Healthcare practitioners need to be aware of this practice to better provide care. Further studies are needed to examine the reasons for using CAM by infertile patients. 1. Introduction Infertility is a \"disease of the reproductive system\", which results in disability. It is a complex, multifactorial condition, which is according to the clinical de\u0000nition, \"failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse(1, 2). As well, infertility may be referred to as the inability in carrying a pregnancy up to the delivery of alive baby(3). Based on the WHO evaluation (2004), it was estimated that more than 186 million ever-married women in reproductive age in developing countries are maintaining a \"child wish\", translating infertility into one per four couples(4). Infertility can be due to the female factor, male factor or both; also it may be due to primary or secondary factors (3). Male factor infertility is solely responsible for about 20% of infertilities in couples, which also contributes into another 30% to 40% (5). The prevalence of infertility is different from one area to another (6). The data on its prevalence rate from four Middle East and North Africa countries were included as the total clinical infertility, both primary and secondary infertilities, estimated as 17.2% (7). In United Kingdom, the reported prevalence rate of infertility was 12.5% among women and 10.1% among men(8). The increased prevalence was also found to be associated with later cohabitation with a partner as well as higher socio-Page 3/20economic status, and for those who had a child, becoming parents at older ages (9). Moreover, biological, genetic, infectious, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors were observed to be associated with infertility in both male and female(10). Infertility is one of the crises that may lead to the reduced sense of health as well as some subsequent physical and mental complications (9, 11). There is an increasing number of couples seeking an appropriate treatment for infertility (12). In a study the prevalence rate of help seeking was reported as 57.3% among women and 53.2% among men (13). In association with the infertility treatment, there are several factors such as infertility factor; age; cause and duration of infertility; responses to treatments; lifestyle factors such as previous history of fertility, socioeconomic status, sociocultural beliefs, psychological status, being overweight, and being obese; and the couple's educational level that affect the treatment(14-16). Additionally, depending on the cause of infertility, some assisted reproductive techniques may be used. For some patients, ART was found to be associated with signi\u0000cant \u0000nancial, psychological, moral, and ethical challenges, which may lead to the discontinuation of treatment in them (17-20). The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by patients and physicians has been signi\u0000cantly increased over the past three decades (21). The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), which is a component of the National Institutes of Health, de\u0000ned CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered as parts of conventional medicine.\" Complementary medicine is used along with conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used instead of conventional treatment(22). Women who have failed in the treatment of infertility or who have experienced some side effects after treatment have a higher rate of use of CAM(23). Various studies have previously shown that CAM use is higher among women compared to men(23, 24). The more tendency to use of CAM for infertility has been reported in different countries and there is a large variety in different cultures on the use of CAM (25-27). The rate of CAM use to enhance fertility greatly varies. In this regard, the current international research suggests that between 29 and 96% of infertile women use CAM, besides conventional therapies (23, 25, 28-46). In addition, in some areas, this rate reaches above 60% (28, 37, 38, 40). In a study conducted in Iran, it was indicated that nearly 50 percent of infertile women use CAM(47). Although there were some studies on the use of CAM in infertile women (23, 25, 27-34, 36-46, 48), review studies on its use are still limited and the emphasis of these narrative review studies was only on the evaluation of the consequences of using CAM in the treatment of infertility (49-53). Accordingly, three of these studies were conducted by Bennington (2010), Weiss et.al. (2011), and Gutmann (2010) in the United States with an emphasis on infertility treatment with CAM (49, 50, 52). Moreover, a study by Rayner et.al. (2011) in Australia on CAM use in fertility enhancement and another one by Xia et.al. (2017) in japan were focused on Chinese Medicine use (53, 54). While none of these studies systematically have investigated the frequency of CAM use in this \u0000eld, also there is no meta-analysis in this area. Thus, there is a need to search the literature extensively, in order to have a reasonable estimate of CAM use in infertility worldwide. These data seem to be reliable on the prevalence of CAM use in infertility, and it is very important to help in prioritization of research programs, policy-making towards planning healthPage 4/20promotion programs, as well as recognizing the educational needs in infertile patients. Therefore, this systematic review and meta- analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of CAM use among infertile patients. 2. Materials And Methods 2.1. Data sources and search strategy This study was conducted in terms of the recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework(55, 56) (Supplementary \u0000le). The required data for this study were obtained from a systematic search of international electronic resources, including PubMed, Web of Science, and other records identi\u0000ed through The Google Scholar. Also miscellaneous searches were conducted in Google for grey literatures as unpublished manuscripts, conference proceedings, and dissertations. Medical subject headings with Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT), and the related keywords to \u0000nd titles and abstracts were searched as follows: \"Complementary Medicine OR Alternative Medicine OR Complementary Therapy OR Alternative Therapy OR traditional Medicine OR Acupuncture Therapy OR Cupping Therapy OR Homeopathy OR Yoga OR Aromatherapy OR Spiritual Therapies OR Herbal Medicine OR Mind-Body Therapies OR Naturopathy OR Musculoskeletal Manipulations OR Re\u0000ex therapy \" AND \" Use OR usage OR utilization OR application OR consumption\" AND \" infertility, sterility, fertility, pregnancy\" in the title, abstract or in keywords of articles (Table 1). The full search strategy is presented in supporting information in \u0000gure1. 2.2. Study Selection The selected studies were checked for replicate publications. Additionally, all these articles were screened by two independent (F.S & R.L.R) reviewers and according to the search results, the authors scanned the relevant results and full articles were then retrieved. Thereafter, the references of the articles selected for review and the other related systematic reviews were also checked manually to search other articles related to this study. Subsequently, we extracted the necessary data according to a pre-de\u0000ned checklist shown in supporting information in Table 2. The obtained data were independently assessed by two independent reviewers (F.S & R.L.R) and in case of any discrepancy, it was resolved through discussion until the consensus was reached. 2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion criteria were peer reviewed cross-sectional articles published in English up to March 2023, examining the prevalence of CAM use in infertile couples (women, men or both). Notably, we excluded the expert opinions, commentaries, case reports, editorials, clinical trials, review articles, and book chapters. 2.4. Data ExtractionPage 5/20During the extraction process, one of the investigators reviewed both the title of the articles and the abstract, in order to determine its suitability for inclusion. At this stage, the full text of the selected articles was also checked in terms of meeting the inclusion criteria. A data extraction form was made based on the related previous articles, which was then validated and approved by two experts who checked it as a pilot on three articles. Thereafter, two independent checklists were used to extract the needed information by the \u0000rst and second authors on the following variables: the title of the article, authors, year of publication, journal name, study setting, sample size, sampling method, the inclusion criteria, the exclusion criteria, the main results, and secondary \u0000ndings (I. prevalence of use; II. user pro\u0000le; III. satisfaction with the use or adverse effects; IV. referrals and information sources; V. Variety of use). Some studies were found to be eligible if data were reported on infertile couples, infertile women or infertile men (not being able to conceive for more than one year) and then presented on CAM. 2.5. Quality Assessment The quality assessment of the studies was conducted by the two independent reviewers (F.S & R.L.R) using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool proposed by Munn et al., in 2015 (57). Correspondingly, this tool included nine items for critical appraisal of the methodological quality of studies. The questions were answered with \"yes\", \"no\", \"unclear\", and \"not applicable\". For each criterion met, the study received a \"yes\" answer. The total number of \"yes\" answers was \u0000nally counted per study. The larger the number of \"yes\", the higher the quality of the study. Any disagreement between the reviewers regarding the methodological quality of the retrieved studies was resolved by consensus. 2.6. Data Synthesis and Analysis All the included studies reported the use of CAM among infertile patients. Overall estimations were calculated using random effects models and a test for heterogeneity was also applied using chi-square and the I2 statistics (I2=99.75%, p-value< 0.0001). When there was any heterogeneity in these studies, random effect was used (58). So, According to this test, the random effects meta-analysis model was chosen for the current study. We also attempted to perform our analysis based on some subgroups by reporting the mean age and type of CAM use. However, the results were heterogeneous, so we decided not to report them in the manuscript. Data analysis was performed using Stata software version 17. 3. Results 3.1. Overview of Selected Studies Out of 1192 documents reviewed, a total of 29 cross-sectional studies or surveys that measured the prevalence of CAM use in infertile couples were included in this review (Figure. 1). The quality assessment of articles showed that while \u0000ve studies (17%) obtained a score of 100%, the quality of 21 articles (72.5%) was above 50% and only three articles (10.5%) received a quality score less than 50%. Articles that were recently published were of higher quality. However, the main issues of studies included the absence of expression of appropriate way that participants were recruited in the study, the lack ofPage 6/20applying valid and reliable methods for identi\u0000cation of the study, using of inappropriate measurement tools, and low response rate. (Table2) Prevalence of use The selected studies were conducted in various countries, including developed countries such as the United States(44, 59), England(32), Australia(28, 45), Denmark(31), Ireland(43), Canada(46), Israel(42), and South Korea(37) as well as in some developing countries such as Turkey(23, 29, 33, 40, 41, 60, 61), Jordan(30, 62), Lebanon(48), Leone (27), Taiwan(34, 36), Uganda(38), Sudan(63), Nigeria(64) and Iran(25, 39, 47). In developed countries, the highest rate of CAM use in infertility was reported in Australia (over 70%) (28), and the lowest rates were in the United Kingdom (26.3%)(32) as well as the United States (29%) (44). In developing countries, the highest rate of the use of CAM in infertility were in Taiwan (96.17%) (36) and the lowest one was in the Turkey (26.6%)(61). (Table 2) The results of examining 32804 infertile couples showed that the prevalence rate of CAM use was between 26.3% (95% CI 21.7 to 31.3%) and 96.1% (95% CI 95.7 to 96.5%) in various countries. The overall prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine using in infertile patients was 54% (95% CI 46 to 61%). Due to the heterogeneity of variance, the model with random effects was used (I2=99.75%, chi2 =11224.21, p<0.001). (Figure 2). Subgroup Analyses The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in infertile couples in 10 articles was estimated to be 46% (95% CI 34 to 57%) using a random effects model (I2=98.16%, chi2 =489.03, p<0.001). (Figure 3) The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in infertile women in 23 articles was 55% (95% CI 47 to 67%) (I2=99.74%, chi2 =8429.35, p<0.001). Also, the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in infertile men in seven articles was 29% (95% CI 17 to 41%) (I2=97.26%, chi2 =219.35, p<0.001) (Figure 4-5). Additionally, it was attempted to perform the analysis based on the subgroups, including the mean age, gender of the participants, type of CAM use, country in which the study was conducted, and publication year of articles; however, the results were eternally non-heterogeneous, so we refused to report them in the manuscript. Other results The most common use of CAM in infertile women were herbal medicine and traditional drugs (25, 29, 30, 37, 44, 47, 60, 61, 64, 65), nutrition (65), multivitamins and mineral supplements (37, 65), spiritual healing (25, 30, 60), and acupuncture (44, 45). Accordingly, the \u0000ndings of some studies showed that thePage 7/20use of CAM was more common among women (23, 24, 30, 61). As well, only 20% of the studies reported that the patients disclosed the use of CAM to the physician (27, 42, 45, 59, 65). The rate of secondary \u0000ndings in these studies were reported as follows: reference to user pro\u0000les (100%), satisfaction with or adverse effects (45%), referral & information source (41%), and variety of use (76%) (Table 2). 4. Discussion The development and application of CAM are greatly affected by the cultures where they are used. This study aimed to review the prevalence of using CAM systematically among infertile patients. Correspondingly, the \u0000ndings showed that more than half of infertile patients (54%) used CAM. CAM has been reported to be generally used in both developed and developing countries. This is because of the bygone history associated with their use in these regions (66). Review studies performed on the prevalence of CAM use in infertile people are limited worldwide. Although some con\u0000ned studies have reviewed CAM use in infertility with the aim of examining the consequences of using various methods, none of them has addressed a systematic review of the frequency of use. The highest rate of CAM use in infertility was in Australia and the lowest one was in the United Kingdom(32) and the United States(44), out of developed countries. While, in developing countries, the highest rate of CAM use was reported in Taiwan(34) and the lowest on was in Turkey(61). Findings of a review performed by Rayner et al. (2011) were consistent with the results of the present study in which all eight studies included in the review reported the proportion of women or couples using CAM for fertility enhancement as considerably varying from 29% to 91% (67). While there were many differences in its usage in different countries, this difference was also seen in different states of each country and variability in prevalence also was obvious. For example, the prevalence rates of use in various studies were reported as follows: in the United States between 29 and 91.3%(44, 59), in Turkey between 26.6 and 83%(23, 29, 40, 41, 60, 61), in Australia between 66 and 70% (28, 45), in Jordan between 43 and 44.7% (30, 65), in Iran between 31 and 49.6%(25, 39, 47), and in Taiwan between 96.17 and 98%(34, 36). This may be due to the large territories of these countries and the differences in the climate and culture of their different states, indicating the widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine by infertile patients and the need for paying special attention to it. The results of various studies showed that women abundantly use CAM in their different periods of their reproductive age worldwide, which is similar to the results of our study. Thus, healthcare providers should responsibly advise their patients about the use of CAM. In the present study, consistent with a review study performed by Rayner J.A. et al., (2011), all the included studies provided a pro\u0000le of infertile patients for the evaluation of CAM usage prevalence. However, the goals of these two studies werePage 8/20different, and the focus of the study by Rayner et al. mostly was on the use of CAM for fertility enhancement(67). In the current study, the bene\u0000ts and harms of CAM in infertile people were not fully addressed. Although reasons for CAM use vary and include the beliefs on that these therapies offer safe alternatives to pharmaceuticals, they allow a wide range of choice and control over the childbearing experiences. Moreover, they are congruent with their holistic health beliefs (68). In addition, in a review by Rayner J. A. et al., only two studies were found to be related to the women's expectations of and satisfaction with the use of CAM for fertility quality enhancement(67). In a review conducted by Feng Xia et al. (2017) on the use of Chinese medicine for the treatment of female infertility, a few studies reported that there was little adverse reaction to CAM in previous randomized controlled trials (53). It is noteworthy to say that the use of various CAM methods is mostly affected by the cultural traditions of the health and climate of each region(69). So, CAM is generally intertwined with infertile patient's lives (40, 59, 67), but paying attention to its potential advantages and disadvantages is forgotten. In the present study, the sources of reference and information were mentioned in a small number of articles. In addition, in the study by Rayner et al. (2013), only three of eight studies reported the information sources used by their participants (67). In the present study, disclosure of the use of CAM to physicians was limited. In the Clark et al. (2013) and Kashani et al.'s (2013) studies, infertile patients did not report the use of CAM to their therapists (39, 59). According to a study by Ghamdi et al. (2010), only 40.7% of pregnant women disclosed their herbal use to their doctors (70). However, considering that the use of CAM by patients seeking an appropriate treatment for infertility is increasing in recent years, patients must be encouraged to communicate with their physicians regarding the use of CAM (50). The most commonly used CAM in infertile women were as follows: herbal medicine, nutrition, multivitamins and mineral supplements, spiritual healing, acupuncture, and traditional drugs. In another review, the most common CAM used for fertility quality enhancement were herbal medicines, which were also reported in all eight included articles, along with acupuncture and nutritional advice consisting of the use of supplements. More unusual types of interventions reported as CAM were the use of religious interventions and spiritual healing, the wearing of fertility accessories, and changes in the patients' attire and sexual practices (67). Accordingly, despite this, in a review performed by Weiss et al. (2011), acupuncture was found as the most commonly used CAM for fertility treatment in the USA (52). Although such treatments are used in different centuries, controlled trials performed on evaluating the e\u0000cacy of CAM in infertility treatment are limited. There are some data to support the use of both acupuncture and nutritional supplements, in order to increase female fertility (50). The most commonly used traditional medicine (TM) among African pregnant women for the treatment of pregnancy-related symptoms was herbal medicine. As well, lack of access to mainstream maternity care was found as the major determinant for using TM(71). Page 9/20The \u0000ndings of the current study showed that the use of CAM is more common among women. In a survey conducted on 400 infertile patients in the UK, CAM utilization in NHS and private clinic settings were more prevalent among women than men(23). The results of the study by Eardley (2012) also showed that women were the main users of CAM (72). Notably, infertile women are in a serious crisis in different societies, which leads them to apply various medical or non-medical treatments(20, 50). Considering that the use of CAM is globally prevalent among infertile women, it is necessary for healthcare providers to seek information pertaining to their use. To avoid any bias in systematic review, different measures were taken into account. The funnel plot is one method of identi\u0000cation and detection of publication bias(58). In descriptive studies, including those measuring prevalence, the researchers are not looking for signi\u0000cant effects, but on the contrary, the funnel plot was provided in this review (supplementary \u0000les). In addition, various international databases including index articles from all countries were used. It was attempted to avoid any language bias through searching different English international databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library belonging to different communities. Google Scholar as well as two Persian databases (Magiran and SID) were also reviewed for \u0000nding additional unpublished articles and dissertations. Grey literatures, including additional unpublished articles and theses and conference proceedings were also searched. Moreover, for controlling or minimizing materials that were not formally published, the authors also undertook a comprehensive search of scienti\u0000c reports published on the websites of newspapers and the related institutions. It should be noted that the Magiran database has the ability of searching the content of newspapers. In this regard, the reference lists of the relevant articles were also checked. In this study, the authors were \u0000uent in Persian and English and have the history of living in Iran and England and studying in both Iranian and English universities in the UK. All the articles reviewed in the present systematic review were in English, and no articles written in other languages were included in the review. 5. Conclusion The use of CAM is signi\u0000cantly growing in recent years and it has become an increasingly popular alternative option for health care. Moreover, it is likely to transform the current healthcare system eventually. The \u0000ndings of this study showed that more than half of the infertile patients use CAM. Healthcare practitioners also need to be aware of this practice for caring patients. Hence, an essential change is needed in the health-care system, particularly concerning lifestyle and the biomedical paradigm. The integration of CAM into conventional medicine can provide a new path for advancing the related medicine for the bene\u0000t of human health and their wellbeing. Women with infertility, which is a chronic illness, need to know certain strategies in CAM to follow the required programs for a healthy pregnancy. Additionally, it seems that the integration of CAM with medical procedures for infertility management canPage 10/20be more time- and cost-effective. Thus, there is a need for greater respect and cooperation between conventional and alternative practitioners as well as more communication between all maternity care practitioners and their patients on the use of CAM. There is a need to perform more studies using robust research methods to distinguish the pattern of CAM use as well as its effectiveness in relation to fertility treatments. Notably, further studies are needed to examine the reasons of the use of CAM. Limitation and Strength of the study: One of the limitations of this study was the lack of access to some databases and journals in other countries. As well, the full text of some articles was not available. Another limitation was about some useful websites, which did not have some advanced search features. Another limitation was related to the quality assessment of the articles, which did not mention the answers to some of the quality evaluation items in the text, and consequently raised the suspicion that the work might have been done, but not mentioned in the published article. Another limitation was the lack of a common tool used for measuring the frequency of CAM use in these studies. Moreover, the Begg's funnel plot of precision was slightly asymmetrical, which suggested a potential publication bias in the meta analysis. The strengths of the study were the high-quality score of most articles included in the review as well as the use of meta-analysis to perform quantitative synthesis of the obtained data.
