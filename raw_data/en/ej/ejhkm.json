We want to share with you our clinical experience helping patients naturally defend against COVID-19. Our patients already know to supplement with Zinc, Vit D3 in addition to the regular gemmotherapies & homeopathics. We have been searching for a reputable company to source two powerful antioxidants. We found it this year & started selling in the office. The feedback is tremendous so now we can share it with you. The first is Vitamin C in an oral liquid liposomal form. Now patients can dose up to 3,000mg without the stomach upset or diarrhea. The liposome formula makes it easily absorbable & bioavailable. The second is an oral liquid liposomal glutathione. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant made in our liver. However, with the pollution, work life, the kids & school stressors, we are all low, if not deficient. Some of you may know that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a capsule supplement readily available at natural pharmacies. NAC is a glutathione precursor. We prefer the liquid formula of liposomal glutathione because it is immediately bioavailable to start detoxing the minute we take it. Some of our patient feedback on the combination of these two liposomal antioxidants: 1. Cold & flu symptoms improve overnight 2. We use it in combination with other supplements to try to prevent COVID illness 3. Nighttime supplementation of several autistic patients resulted in improved cognitive function over the course of 3 months If you want to know more about these two products, email your question or give us a call. For active COVID patients, we can do phone consults to get you through. For long haul patients or patients still with residual symptoms, come in for a office consultation.
