With decades of proven performance, W. L. Gore & Associates' GORE\u00ae High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol in traditional space applications answer the call. They offer reliable high-speed data transmission with ultra-low skew to ensure the success of every mission. Cable Performance and Specifications While high-speed data cables are a vital component of electrical systems on spacecraft, they're not all made the same. They must deliver dependable performance over extended distances and meet strict industry requirements, as well as be able to handle harsh aerospace conditions. To ensure successful missions, Gore's cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol are constructed with our unique materials that provide durable protection against challenging environments, such as: - Extreme temperatures, with a range of -55\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C - Radiation exposure resistance of (MRad) 200+ - Outgassing GORE High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol in traditional space applications also transmit signals and data quickly - and without failure. With ultra-low skew up to 6 GHz, Gore's shielded parallel pairs reliably transfer up to 12 Gbps of data for the duration of the mission at link distances up to 30 feet (7 meters) per lane. No matter where a spacecraft is headed, everyone on-board and on the ground will be able to maintain consistent communication to carry out the mission. Meeting Rigorous Standards for Space Applications Gore's high-speed data cables are backed by decades of proven performance, with a failure-free success rate of 100% in hundreds of global spaceflight programs - even the 1969 moon landing. What's more, all of our products are tested and qualified to ensure their unwavering performance. For one, GORE High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol meet IEEE 802.3 10G-BASECX4 and ASTM-E595. Additionally, unique Twinax requirements: IEEE 10G-BASE-CX4 for XAUI RapidIO protocol - ASTM-E595 for outgassing Thanks to their compliance, GORE High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol are ideal for a wide range of traditional low-mass, high-density space applications, including the following: - Command and data handling (C&DH) - Communications systems - High-resolution cameras - Radar sensor equipment - Earth observation and scientific exploration instrumentation - Sensor, mass memory unit and telemetry subsystem interconnections How to Order GORE High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO Protocol To learn more about GORE High Speed Data Cables for XAUI RapidIO protocol, [contact](/products/aerospace-defense-contact) a Gore representative.
