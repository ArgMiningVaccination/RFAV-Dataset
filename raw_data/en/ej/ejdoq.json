It is a certification she is proud to add to her [credentials](https://www.onyxacu.com/about). But what exactly is cosmetic acupuncture? The title is somewhat misleading, because a cosmetic acupuncture \"facial\" will consist of several things that don't require needles at all! Here is a rough outline of what an acupuncture facial at Onyx will look like: 1. Facial Gua Sha Here, we use a jade roller or similar tool to apply a lifting serum (which we make in-house at Onyx) to your face, breaking up adhesions and tightness in your facial muscles, as well as stimulates lymphatic drainage. 2. Needle Insertion This both stimulates muscles that have become too flaccid and relaxes muscles that are too tight, stimulating local collagen bridge formation. 3. Celluma LED Light Application The [low level light therapy](https://www.celluma.com/pages/anti-aging-light-therapy) component of the acupuncture facial is targeted at both acne and aging concerns. Light energy has been found to both re-regulate AND up-regulate mitochondrial action, dramatically increasing rate of cellular healing. 4. Facial Cupping This technique stimulates more blood circulation in the skin and muscles of the face, alerting fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin. Don't worry - the small cups we use on the face will not leave bruising like you may have seen from traditional cupping marks on other parts of the body. Can It Really Replace Botox? We have found that these techniques together combine to offer an excellent holistic alternative to medications and procedures that many of you who are seeking cosmetic intervention specifically want to avoid. If you are interested in more information concerning recommended frequency of cosmetic treatments and package options that we offer, please email info@onyxacu.com. We are so excited to offer cosmetic acupuncture in addition to the list of other [services we offer](https://www.onyxacu.com/services) at Onyx. "}
