Many of us wish we could have more time to interact with our doctors in a relaxed setting. At the institute, we invite you to do just that. Several of our providers offer group visits in addition to their regular patient visits. A group visit provides an extended session with your provider. We bring together a group of five to 15 people who share similar health concerns. At the visit, discussion will focus on a particular treatment option or strategy relevant to your condition. Group visits usually run from 90 minutes to two hours. Patients tell us they love the informal dialogue and the chance to learn, not only from their provider, but also from others dealing with similar issues. Our providers appreciate the opportunity to share deeper insights about self-healing and other integrative therapies. We currently offer the following group visits: How to participate Tell your provider that you are interested in a group visit. When an appropriate session is available, one of our schedulers will follow up with an invitation to join the group. You may also request an appointment by calling us at 949-824-7000. Cost While a group visit is longer and more comprehensive than an individual appointment, it is not more expensive. Your health insurance carrier will be billed as usual, and any regular co-pays will apply.
