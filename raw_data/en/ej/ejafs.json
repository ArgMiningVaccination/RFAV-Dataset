THE HISTORY OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE Many individuals in Johnson City believe chiropractic care can do little more than relieve pain in the neck and back regions. However, chiropractic was developed to treat a much wider range of conditions than just back or neck pain. In fact, the first spinal realignment performed by D.D. Palmer, the founder of chiropractic, aimed to restore the hearing function of a man who had been deaf. After an adjustment that relieved the inflammation of neural pathways in the man's body, he could hear once again! After making miracles reality, D.D. Palmer sought to bring chiropractic's healing properties to the masses. WELLNESS CARE FOR LASTING RELIEF No one should suffer constantly from pain stemming from preexisting conditions or injuries that never seem to heal. Chiropractic care can help patients dealing with a myriad of health problems find lasting relief. Most healthy people do not realize that chiropractic care can even be beneficial for improving their immune system function and strengthening their vitality. Day-to-day life can be draining not just on the mind, but the immune system. By seeking wellness care at our clinic, minor adjustments can ensure your body stays running like a finely-tuned machine, ready to conquer every day's challenges. TRAINING OF A CHIROPRACTOR Patients regularly underestimate the amount of training and education chiropractors must undergo before fully allowed to practice. In fact, chiropractors have among the most rigorous coursework required in the medical field. The amount of schooling required is on par with that of physicians. Once chiropractic students make their way through the basic medical coursework in their undergraduate studies, they must be accepted and graduate from a 4-year chiropractic college. Throughout their four years at a highly-specialized chiropractic college, their knowledge is constantly being built and tested.
