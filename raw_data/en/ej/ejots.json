Functional medicine addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental factors that influence a person's health. Functional medicine is also known as [integrative medicine](/about/) because it integrates the full range of functional medicine with well-known conventional medical practices and technologies to treat your chronic conditions. Whether you have major health concerns, or consider yourself to be generally healthy, we can offer board-certified medical care to you and your family. You can also take advantage of additional medical and aesthetic benefits by joining our [membership model](/functional-medicine-membership/), with three options so you can find the best fit for your household. We have even recently started offering IHSAA [physicals for student-athletes](/blog/imla-now-offering-student-athlete-sports-physicals/) playing sports in the 2020-21 school year. Sick and Tired of Low Energy Are you just sick and tired of feeling sick and tired? Through a partnership between patient and physician, you can take an active role in promoting your own best health. [Dr. CJ Pabla, MD](/providers) will offer the most effective combination of treatments to help you overcome illnesses and stay healthy long-term. At your initial visit, we often spend over two hours together, asking questions about your health history and actively listening to your needs. Root of your Concerns Unlike traditional medicine, which usually only treats the symptoms, integrative medicine focuses on finding the root cause to create an [individualized health and wellness plan](/functional-medicine/) unique to each patient. We do this by digging into your health history and lifestyle, then determining how to improve your health problems. The focus is on the individual rather than the disease, making use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches to healthcare. Infusions for Exhaustion If you are specifically concerned about low energy or exhaustion, we offer [supplements](https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/cpabla) and [IV infusions](/iv-infusion/) to improve the common vitamin deficiencies from which many individuals suffer. Our infusions will boost your immune system and jump start the powerhouses of your body. An intravenous infusion also ensures that your body gets the full benefits of these important micronutrients, rather than only relying on poor absorption rates from typical supplements.
