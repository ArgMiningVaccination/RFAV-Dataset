At Atlantic Health System, we believe our patient-centered approach to care, collaborative spirit and respect for the environment is what makes us a great place to work. Our promise to our communities is that all who enter our system receive the highest quality care delivered at the right time, at the right place, and at the right cost. We are committed to creating a Trusted Network of Caring\u00ae. Our healing culture relies on an integrative approach that considers both the physical and emotional well-being of our patients. To help them feel more comfortable during a normally stressful time, we incorporate compassion and respect as a part of every treatment plan. As soon as a patient comes through our door, we are dedicated to providing them the help they need in a timely manner. We're also finding ways to prevent avoidable illness and injury, and help all people live healthy and happy lives. That same level of respect extends to those who work in our hospitals and throughout our organization. Through collaboration, support and open communication, we offer a nurturing environment where our team members have the tools they need to grow both personally and professionally. A shared sense of empowerment helps everyone feel inspired knowing they are working together to bring world-class care to the people of our communities. Our care for the environment also defines who we are as an organization and preserving our national resources is an increasing concern. To that end, we pursue recycling and energy saving policies, as well as paperless means of communication, such as our free, monthly hospital e-newsletters. Our buildings contain materials with recycled fibers and use energy-efficient ventilation systems, and our environmental services departments use Green Seal-certified cleaning products whenever possible. Ask any of our 17,000 team members what makes it a great place to work and you'll get 17,000 different answers. That's because Atlantic Health System is one of the largest non-profit health care systems in New Jersey focused on access, affordability and inclusion. Our award winning medical centers include Morristown Medical Center, Overlook Medical Center, Hackettstown Medical Center, Newton Medical Center, Chilton Medical Center and Goryeb Children's Hospital - all of which are accredited by The Joint Commission and are members of AllSpire Health Partners, and, we have more than 400 physicians as part of Atlantic Medical Group.
