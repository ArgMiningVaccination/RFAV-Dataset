Low level lasers have been shown to speed tissue healing and tissue strength as well and is very complimentary to what we already do in our corrective chiropractic office. Benefits of Cold Laser Therapy Cold laser therapy increases serotonin levels which allow the body to heal itself. Cold laser therapy is non-thermal and noninvasive. A combination of cold laser and electric stimulation, cold laser therapy is one of the most effective healing therapies in the medical community today. Autoimmune Disease Burns Carpal Tunnel Disc Herniations Fibromyalgia Migraines Pain, Chronic or Acute Repetitive Stress Injuries Scar Tissue Sinusitis Sports Injuries Sprain Strain Tendonitis TMJ Whiplash Wound Healing And more... How does it work? The photon energy produced by the laser penetrates your skin into your injured tissues and stimulates the mitochondria of your cells to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is our bodies basic energy molecule used for almost all cellular functions - including tissue regeneration and protein synthesis. The overall effects are decreased pain and inflammation, and increased range of motion and movement. The procedure is fast, painless, and in the 25 years they have been in use, there haven't been any reported side effects. When combined with specific chiropractic adjustments the pain relief and healing effect are improved. Ask Dr. Shaw if low level laser could help you! We encourage you to go to [www.erchonia.com](http://www.erchonia.com/) to find out more about this exciting new technology available to help you recover from acute or chronic pain levels. Erchonia's lasers made history by becoming the first to receive FDA market clearance for the treatment of chronic pain, proven through two double blind IRB studies. The Erchonia Lasers are the most advanced lasers on the market, with their sleek revolutionary design, patented line generated beam, and the ability to program independent frequencies in all of their family of lasers. What is low-level laser? Unlike high power lasers that use heat and destroy tissue, low energy lasers affect the cellular energy of the underlying tissue. Hot lasers have a thermal effect and have an output of 1MW or above.Cold (or) Low Level Lasers do not have a thermal effect on tissue, lasers that stimulate biological function have an output below 10mw- milliwatts (ten- one thousands of a watts) What is 3LT - Low Level Laser Therapy? Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT) refers to the modality of applying a \"low\" energy or \"low level\" laser to tissue that stimulates cellular processes and thereby enhancing biochemical reactions. For example, studies show that LLLT increases ATP production in the mitochondria of the cell. Since more energy is now available, the cell may utilize this fuel to function or operate more efficiently. How does it work? Many theories exist as to the mechanism of action for Low Level Laser Therapy(3LT) but simply put, photonic energy is absorbed by the photo acceptor sites on the cell membrane which trigger a secondary messenger to initiate a cascade of intracellular signals that initiate, inhibit or accelerate biological processes such as wound healing, inflammation, or pain management. Are there any side effects? There are over 1500 published studies and not one of them mentions any negative side effects of semi-conductor diode lasers at the 5mW range like the Erchonia 3LT Lasers. Low Level Lasers are safe, non-toxic and non-invasive, there has not been a recorded side effect in over 1700 publications. There are some necessary common sense precautions that need to be considered, such as avoiding pointing the laser beam directly into the eye and maintaining it there, which could prove to be damaging to the eye. What makes one laser different from another? A laser can differ in its wavelength, power source or whether it is a continuous or pulsed wave form. The first lasers were used to cut, cauterize or ablate tissue and were classified as \"hot' lasers. \"Cold\", \"Low Energy\" or \"Low Level\" lasers are used to enhance metabolic activity at the cellular level through non-thermal reactions. What is wavelength? And do the different wavelengths matter? Light is measured in wavelengths and is expressed in units of nanometers (nm). Different wavelengths have different energy levels and can have various effects on tissue. For example, the Erchonia 3LT Laser is 635 nanometers, which is found within the \"red\" spectrum of visible light (400-800 nm) and has anabolic tissue effects, whereas, radiation that has a wavelength shorter than 320 nm (ultraviolet (UV), gamma rays, x-rays) has ionizing effects on cells and can be harmful even in small doses. How long are the treatments? Treatments can vary in time from seconds to minutes depending on the condition. Research studies show that there may be a dose dependent response, so it may be more effective to treat at lower doses at multiple intervals then to treat a single time with a high dose. What kind of care plans can be expected for laser therapy? A treatment plan may vary, depending on the condition. For instance, an acute soft tissue injury or open wound may require multiple short treatments initially then the interval between treatments will lengthen as the condition improves. *Information on this Web site is only intended as general summary information that is made available to the public.
