By Lauren Gelman Updated on October 5, 2022 Medically reviewed by Antwon Chavis, M.D. Africa Studio/Shutterstock Do cold and cough medicines actually work? Evidence says no. Over-the-counter cold and cough medicines do little to nothing to fight off germs and relieve symptoms like congestion, runny noses, or coughs. Numerous studies have shown that babies and toddlers given cold and cough medicines don't have fewer symptoms or feel better any quicker than children who don't receive any. \"Most babies and kids with colds will start feeling better in less than five days, whether or not they take medicine,\" says Dennis Kuo, M.D., a pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. What's more, cough and cold medicine can have negative side effects for children younger than 4 years old, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). 9 Natural Toddler Cough Remedies Read on to learn more about why over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are dangerous for children, with tips for helping them feel better safely. What are Over-the-Counter Cough Medicines? Over-the-counter cold and cough medicines generally fall into one of the following four categories: Decongestants: These are supposed to relieve nasal congestion, but they can cause side effects like increased heart rate, jitteriness, vomiting, and shaking. Antihistamines: Antihistamines are supposed to dry up runny noses, though they really treat symptoms caused by allergies, not cold viruses, says Ari Brown, M.D., pediatrician and author of Baby 411 and Toddler 411. \"And though they are sedating, recent research shows that babies and kids with colds don't sleep any better after receiving an antihistamine,\" she says. Side effects include hyperactivity, drowsiness, dry mouth, and, in rare cases, hallucinations. Cough suppressants: Supposed to reduce the need to cough, these suppressants can cause side effects like excessive sleepiness or jitteriness, dizziness, and vomiting. Cough expectorants: This type of medicine loosens mucus so it's coughed up more easily. Though rarer than with other types of cold and cough medicines, side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches. Many manufacturers have voluntarily recalled infant versions of cough and cold medications. And although versions for kids 2 and older are still available, never give meds intended for older kids to your baby or toddler. Why Are Cough and Cold Medicines Unsafe? Research shows these medicines don't work, and they may also have significant side effects\u2014even if administered correctly. \"Each child metabolizes medicine differently, so even if you give your kid the correct amount for their weight, it can still cause some dangerous side effects,\" says Dr. Shu. These include nausea and vomiting, insomnia, eating more or less than usual or, more rarely, hallucinations and even seizures. 8 Types of Coughs in Children, Toddlers, and Babies What's more, because these drugs may contain overlapping ingredients (combos of decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants, and expectorants, for example) your child can accidentally overdose from taking more than one medication at a time\u2014like a cough syrup and cough and cold drops\u2014even if you follow the correct dosing instructions for each one. Are cough and cold medicines safe for older children? The FDA is still evaluating how they affect those under 11, so the answer is unclear. Though older kids may experience fewer side effects, some experts feel it's still not worth the risk, given the lack of evidence that they actually help improve symptoms. Your best bet: Waiting it out and trying natural remedies like saline drops, plenty of fluids\u2014including feeding chicken noodle soup\u2014and a humidifier at night. If you want to try medicine, pay careful attention to the drug label to avoid side effects or potential overdose. Safe Cough Remedies for Kids \"Understandably, parents will try anything to help their child feel better and sleep through the night,\" says Dr. Brown. \"I too have spent my share of nights with a sick kid sleeping on my shoulder.\" But with no proven benefit and definite established risk, ditch the meds and try these natural and effective remedies instead. Toddler Cough: Causes, Treatment, and When to Worry Soothe Congestion With Saline Drops Why It Works: Saline nasal drops help move the mucus out of the nose. Until your child can blow her own nose (anywhere from age 2 to 6), you'll also need a bulb syringe to remove the gunk. What To Do: Rest your child's head in your lap so it's tilted slightly back and then, using an eye dropper, squirt a drop or two of saline solution into each nostril. Squeeze the bulb to get the air out. Put the tip into your child's nostril. As you stop squeezing, the mucus should flow in. Doing this up to four times a day\u2014and especially before bed\u2014may cut back on your kid's congestion and help them sleep more soundly. If your baby is breastfeeding or bottle feeding, do this right before her feedings. \"Babies breathe through their noses while eating, so this will help them feed easier and longer,\" Dr. Kuo says. Fuel Up With Fluids Why It Works: If your child is drinking enough, it will loosen the mucus in their nose and throat, which will help them breathe. Plus, feverish kids lose fluids and may become dehydrated more easily, so it's very important to keep the liquids coming. What To Do: Infants under 6 months of age should only receive hydration from breast milk or formula. \"Offer clear fluids such as Pedialyte (or breast milk if you're breastfeeding) every hour or so to babies under 2,\" says Kuo. \"For older kids, use a sippy cup with diluted fruit juice, Gatorade, or flat soda, since these fluids are absorbed better than plain water.\" Can you overdo it? Probably not. Most kids will reflexively refuse the drink if they've had too much already, says Kuo. How to Decode Your Baby's Cough Make Bedtime Better With a Humidifier Why It Works: A cool-mist humidifier in the nursery or your child's room helps moisten nasal passages, which may soothe a sore throat and ease those haunting nighttime coughs. What To Do: Remember to change the water and clean the filter every other day to avoid germ build-up. And steer clear of hot-water humidifiers, which can pose a burn risk to young kids, should they accidentally topple over. Treat the Fever Why It Works: You've probably heard that fevers aren't necessarily harmful\u2014they're usually just a sign that your child's fighting off the cold. But if the fever's making your baby cranky, restless, or achy, medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) can bring the temperature down within an hour. What To Do: Don't give meds to babies under 3 months until you call the pediatrician. They'll likely want you to bring Baby in. You can give acetaminophen to babies 3 months and over, or ibuprofen to babies over 6 months. Dosage recommendations can be provided by your pediatrician and are based on your baby's weight. 7 Causes of Chronic Cough in Children When to Call the Doctor Generally speaking, there's no need to call the doctor right away unless you notice your child's running a high fever for his age: Your baby is younger than 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees F or higher. Your baby is 3 to 6 months and has a rectal temperature of 101 degrees F or higher. Your child is older than 6 months and has a rectal temperature of 103 degrees F or higher. You should also alert the pediatrician if you notice any of the following conditions: Your baby is dehydrated and hasn't had a wet diaper in six hours, experiences dry mouth, or cries with few or no tears. Cold symptoms don't start to improve after five days. (This could indicate it's something else, like bronchitis, a sinus infection, or even pneumonia). Your kid seems very fussy and tired, even with no fever. Your child's breathing is rapid or labored. Your child refuses to drink, a sign they may have trouble breathing. Was this page helpful?
