These precautions are based on the method of transmission (e.g., contact, droplet, airborne). Alcohol -based hand rub: A liquid, gel or foam formulation of alcohol (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol) which is used to reduce the number of microorganisms on hands in clinical situations when the hands are not visibly soiled. A lcohol -based hand rub s contain emollients to reduce skin irritation and are less time - consuming to use than washing with soap and water. Antibiotic -resistant o rganism: A microorganism that has developed resistance to the action of several antimicrobial agents and that is of special clinical or epidemiological significance. Antiseptic: An agent that can kill microorganisms and is applied to living tissue and skin . Audit: A systematic and independent examination to determine whether quality activities and related results comply with planned arrangements, are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives.1 Biomedical waste: Contaminated, infectious waste from a health care setting that requires treatment prior to disposal in landfill sites or sanitary sewer systems. Biomedical waste includes human anatomical waste; h uman and animal cultures or specimens (excluding urine and faeces); human liquid blood and blood products; items contaminated with blood or blood products that would release liquid or semi - liquid blood if compressed; body fluids visibly contaminated with b lood; body fluids removed in the course of surgery, treatment or for diagnosis (excluding urine and faeces); sharps; and broken glass which has come into contact with blood or body fluid.2,3 Broad- spectrum virucide: An environmental (low -level) disinfectant demonstrated to irreversibly inactivate, at a minimum, one representative hard -to-kill non -enveloped virus and which would be expected to inactivate most enveloped and non -enveloped viruses.4 Canadia n Association of Environmental Management (CAEM) : A national, non -profit organization representing environmental management professionals within the health care sector and other industry professionals responsible for environmental cleaning. Cleaning: The p hysical removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil) and organic material (e.g., blood, secretions, excretions, microorganisms). Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms. It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. Client/p atient/ resident: Any person receiving care within a health care setting. Cohorting: The sharing of a room or ward by two or more clients/patients/residents who are either colonized or infected with the same microorganism; or the sharing of a room or ward by colonized or infected clients/patients/residents who have been assessed and found to be at low risk of dissemination, with roommates who are considered to be at low risk for acquisition. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 2 C omplex continuing care: Complex continuing care provides continuing, medically complex and specialized services to both young and old, sometimes over extended periods of time. Such care also includes support to families who have pal liative or respite care needs. Construction clean: Cleaning performed at the end of a workday by construction workers that removes gross soil and dirt, construction materials and workplace hazards. Cleaning may include sweeping and vacuuming, but usually does not address horizontal surfaces or areas adjac ent to the job site. Contact Precautions: Precautions that are used in addition to Routine Practices to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents via contact with an infectious person. Contact time: The time that a disinfectant must be in contact with a surface or device to ensure that appropriate disinfection has occurred. For most disinfectants, the surface should remain wet for the required contact time. Contamination: The presence of an infectious agent on hands or on a surface such as clothes, gowns, gloves, bedding, toys, surgical instruments, patient care equipment, dressings or other inanimate objects. Continuum of c are: Across all health care sectors, including settings where emergency (including pre - hospital) care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation hospitals, long -term care homes, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, offices of other health professionals, p ublic health and home health care. Cytotoxic waste: Waste cytotoxic drugs, including leftover or unused cytotoxic drugs and tubing, tissues, needles, gloves and any other items which have come into contact with a cytotoxic drug. 2 Detergent: A synt hetic cleansing agent that can emulsify oil and suspend soil. A detergent contains surfactants that do not precipitate in hard water and may also contain protease enzymes (see Enzymatic Cleaner ) and whitening agents. Discharge /transfer c leaning: The thorough cleaning of a client/patient/resident room or bed space following discharge, death or transfer of the client/patient/resident, in order to remove contaminating microorganisms that might be acquired by subsequent occupants and/or staff. In some instances, discharge/ transfer cleaning might be used when some types of Additional Precautions have been discontinued. Disin fectant: A product that is used on surfaces or medical equipment/devices which results in disinfection of the equipment/device. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate objects. Some products combine a cleaner with a disinfectant. Disinfection: The inac tivation of disease -producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy bacterial spores. Medical equipment/devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection can take place. See also, Disinfectant . Drug Identification Number (DIN): In Canada, disinfectants are regulated as drugs under the Food and Drugs Act and regulations. Disinfectant manufacturers must obtain a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada prior to marketing, which ensures that labelling and supporting data have been provided and that it has been established by the Therapeutic Products Directorate that the product is effective and safe for its intended use. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 3 E nvironment of the c lient/p atient/ resident: The immediate space around a client/patient/resident that may be touched by the client/patient/resident and may also be touched by the health care provider when providing care. The client/patient/resident environment includes equipment, medical devices, furniture (e.g., bed, chair, bedside table), telephone, privacy curtains, personal belongings (e.g., clothes, books) and the bathroom that the client/patient/resident uses. In a multi -bed room, the client/patient/resident environment is the area inside the individual's curtain. In an ambulatory setting, the client/patient/ resident environment is the area that may come into contact with the client/patient/resident within their cubicle. In a nursery/neonatal setting, the patient environment is the isolette or bassinet and equipment outside the isolette/bassinet that is used for the infant. See also, Health care environment . Enzymatic cleaner: A pre -cleaning agent that contains protease enzymes that break down proteins such as blood, body fluids, secretions and excreti ons from surfaces and equipment. Most enzymatic cleaners also contain a detergent. Enzymatic cleaners are used to loosen and dissolve organic substances prior to cleaning. Fomites: Objects in the inanimate environment that may become contaminated with micr oorganisms and serve as vehicles of transmission. 3 Fungicide: An environmental (low -level) disinfectant capable of inactivating fungi (including yeast) and fungal spores on environmental surfaces and inanimate items.4 Hand hygiene: A general term referring to any action of hand cleaning. Hand hygiene relates to the removal of visible soil and removal or killing of transient microorganisms from the hands. Hand hygiene may be accomplished using soap and running water or an alcohol -based hand rub. Hand hygiene includes surgical hand antisepsis. Hand washing: The physical removal of mic roorganisms from the hands using soap (plain or antimicrobial) and running water. Hawthorne effect: A short -term improvement caused by observing staff performance. Health c are-associated infection: A term relating to an infection that is acquired during th e delivery of health care (also known as nosocomial infection). Health care environment: People and items which make up the care environment (e.g., objects, medical equipment, staff, clients/patients/residents) of a hospital, clinic or ambulatory setting, outside the immediate environment of the client/patient/resident. See also, Environment of the client/patient/resident . Health care facility: A set of physical infrastructure elements supporting the delivery of health -related services. A health care facility does not include a client/patient/resident's home or physician/dental/ other health offices where health care may be provided. Health care provider: Any person delivering care to a client/patient/resident. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: emergency service workers, physicians, dentists, nurses, respiratory therapists and other health professionals, personal support workers, clinical instructors, stude nts and home health care providers . In some non -acute settings, volunteers might provide care and would be included as health care providers. See also, Staff. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 4 H ealth care setting: Any location where health care is provided, including settings where emergency care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation hospitals, long -term care homes, mental health facilities, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, offices of other health professionals and home health care. High -touch surfaces: High -touch surfaces are those that have frequent contact with hands. Examples include doorknobs, call bells, bedrails, light switches, wall areas around the toilet and edges of privacy curtains. Hoarding: A temporary fence or wall enclosing a construction site. Hospital c lean: The measure of cleanliness routinely maintained in client/patient/resident care areas of the health care setting.5 Hospital Clean is \" Hotel clean \" with the addition of disinfection, increased frequency of cleaning, auditing and other infection control measures in client/patient/resident care areas. Hospital disinfectant: A low -level disinfectant that has a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada indicating its approval for use in Canadian health care settings. Hospital disinfectant s were referred to as \" hospital -grade disinfectan ts\" in previous editions of this document. Hotel clean: A measure of cleanliness based on visual appearance that includes dust and dirt removal, waste disposal and cleaning of windows and surfaces. Hotel clean is the basic level of cleaning that takes place in all areas of a health care setting. Improved hydrogen peroxide: A formulation of hydrogen peroxide that contains surfactants, wetting agents and chelating agents. Improved hydrogen peroxide was referred to as \"hydrogen peroxide enhanced action formula \" in the previous editions of this document. The resulting synergy makes it a powerful oxidizer that can rapidly achieve broad -spectrum disinfection for environmental surfaces and noncritical devices. In high concentrations ( 2%-7%) it has a sporicidal claim. Infection: The entry and multiplication of an infectious agent in the tissues of the host. Asymptomatic or subclinical infection is an infectious process running a course similar to that of clinical disease but below the threshold of clinical sym ptoms. Symptomatic or clinical infection is one resulting in clinical signs and symptoms (disease). Infection prevention and c ontrol: Evidence -based practices and procedures that, when applied consistently in health care settings, can prevent or reduce the risk of infection in clients/patients/residents, heal th care providers and visitors. Infection prevention and c ontrol professional(s): Trained individual(s) responsible for a health care setting's infection prevention and control activities. Infectious agent: A microorganism, i.e., a bacterium, fungus, parasite, virus or prion, which is capable of invading body tissues, multiplying and causing infection. IPAC Regional Support Teams : Public Health Ontario has situated t eams of infection prevention and control specialists serve five regions covering the entire province of Ontario. These teams support health care stakeholders across all health care settings in their efforts to improve infection prevention and control practices. This is achieved via promoting a common approach to infection prevention and control through opportunities for networking and support in the use of evidence -based tools and resources. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 5 L ong-term care: A broad range of personal care, support and health services provided to people who have limitations that prevent them from full participation in the activities of daily living. The people who use long- term care services are usually the elderly, people with disabilities and people who have a chronic or prolonged illness. Low -level d isinfectant: A chemical agent that achieves low -level disinfection when applied to environmental surfaces , inanimate items , or noncritical medical devices .4 Low -level disinfection: Level of disinfection required when processing non -invasive medical equipment (i.e., no ncritical equipment) and some environmental surfaces. Low -touch surfaces: Surfaces that have minimal contact with hands. Examples include walls, ceilings, mirrors and window sills.

PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 8 Preamble Health care -associated infections are infections that occur within any setting where health care is delivered. Health care -associated infections affect 4% to 10% of patients and result in significant harm to patients/residents/clients.9-12 Maintaining a safe, clean and hygienic environment and minimizing microbial contamination of surfaces, items and equipment within the health care environment is increasingly recognized as an essential approach to reducing the risk of health care -associated infections for all patients/residents/clients, visitors and staff within health care settings.13,14 Reducing the risk of transmission of infection from the health care environment requires the cooperation of all staff in the health care setting. It also requires an appropriately staffed, trained, educated and supervised environmental services program. 14-17 The cornerstone of efforts to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from the environment requires the cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces and items in the health care setting on a regular basis. 18 The best practices set out in this document provide criteria for cleanliness in health care settings that may be a dopted by environmental service managers for their use or for the use of contracted services. This document is intended t o provide best practice for environmental cleaning for all health care settings (see below). While the client/patient/resident population, acuity of illness, intensity of care and the nature of medical and surgical procedures vary in different practice set tings, the fundamental principles and requirement for routine cleaning and disinfection do not. About This Document This document is a thorough revision of the Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee's (PIDAC) previous best practices document on environmental cleaning and disinfection published in 2012 . It deals with the cleaning and disinfection of the physical environment in health care as they relate to the prevention and control of infections. It also deals with the cleaning and disinfecting of noncritical equipment (i.e., equipment that only comes into contact with intact skin). This document does not address disinfection and/or sterilization of critical or semicritical devices, or the use and disposal of chemicals or medications (e.g., chemot herapy). For information about high -level disinfection and sterilization of medical equipment, see PIDAC's Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings .19 For information about handling and using chemotherapy chemicals and equipment, see Cancer Care Ontario's Safe Handling of Cytotoxics .20 For information about cleaning practices in dental settings, see also the Royal College of Dent al S urgeons of Ontario's Infection Prevention and Control in the Dental Office .21 This document is intended for tho se who have a role in the management of cleaning or environmental services for the health care setting. This includes administrators, supervisors of environmental service departments, infection prevention and control professionals, and supervisors of construction and maintenance projects in health care facilities; public health; and those responsible for overseeing environmental cleaning in the clinical office setting (e.g., community health centres, clinics, independent health facilities, and out -of-hospit al premises, and dental offices). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 9 I n revising this document, which is widely used at Ontario health care facilities, PIDAC's goal was to update the document based on advances in the field while maintaining a practical and evidence -based approach. Since the original publication of the document, the evidence linking the health care environment to the transmission of infectious pathogens continues to increase and these new data are discussed in the document (see Chapter 1 ). There a re also new research findings evaluating the impact of a variety of audit and feedback methodologies (see Chapter 9 ) and new disinfection strategies, including the use of no -touch disinfection methods and the use of antimicrobi al surfaces (see Chapter 8). As the 2018 edition contains substantial revisions in many sections and topics, new information will not be highlighted individually. Each recommendation, however, is labelled as new, modified, or r eviewed and not changed. In developing this document, PIDAC reviewed all queries directed to PIDAC and PHO regarding environmental cleaning registered since the previous version of this document was published. Broad stakeholder consultation was sought, wor kshops were held at the Canadian Association of Environmental Management 2014 conference to identify key issues in environmental cleaning and to seek input on the strengths and weaknesses of the document, and the draft document was presented at subsequent meetings of both the Canadian Association of Environmental Management and the Ontario Healthcare Housekeepers' Association. Members of both associations joined with PIDAC and were present at all stages of guideline development. Subsequently, the document was posted for 30 -day public review and revisions made based on the feedback received. Feedback from stakeholders resulted in changes and additions to the document. For Recommendations in This Document: Shall indicates mandatory requirements based on legislated requirements or national standards (e.g., Canadian Standards Association\u2014 CSA). Must indicates best practice, i.e., the minimum standard based on current recommendations in the medical literature. Should indicates a recommendation or that which is advised but not mandatory. May indicates an advisory or optional statement. Evidence for Recommendations In developing this revised best practices guideline, PIDAC reviewed the method for ranking recommendations. Since the original document was developed, many health care organizations and guideline developers have switched to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for guideline development. 22,23 In the guideline development process, PIDAC piloted the use of GRADE for the recommendations on new technology, and specifically with respect to antimicrobial surfaces and no -touch disinfection. Systematic reviews we re conducted on these topics using the GRADE methodology to rate the strength of the evidence. These systematic reviews are intended for publication in peer- reviewed journals and support the recommendations made PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 10 in this document related to antimicrobial su rfaces and no -touch disinfection.24 PIDAC did not use the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of the evidence or the strength of the recommendation for the document as a whole. However, on reviewing the GRADE system,22,25-29 PIDAC has adopted one key concept from GRADE which PIDAC believes is an improvement on its approach to producing best practices guidelines: the quality of the evidence of efficacy for an intervention is not the sole consideration when making recommendations; risks , adverse effects, and stakeholder perspectives must also be considered. Although cost is also an important consideration, it was beyond the scope of this document t o formally evaluate the cost of each recommended intervention. Ultimately, strong recommendations should be made when the evidence of benefit clearly outweighs the risks of the recommendation; a conditional recommendation is made when there is less certain ty that benefits outweigh risks and costs. 23 Incorporating this concept, PIDAC has modified its approach to ranking recommendations (see Table 1: Assessment of the Quality of Evidence Supporting a Recommendation and Table 2: Determination of the Strength of a Recommendation ). Specifically, PIDAC s eparates the assessment of the quality of evidence supporting a recommendation from the strength of the recommendation. While the quality of the evidence ( Table 1) will continue to be based primarily on the study designs of the evidence evaluating the efficacy of the intervention, the strength of the recommendation ( Table 2) will take into account PIDAC's assessment of the quality of the evidence and the potential risks associated with the intervention, and will make recommendations as follows: Category A R ecomm endations for an intervention are those where PIDAC determined that th e b enefit of the intervention clearly outweighs the risks. PIDAC intends that category A recommendations are best practices that must be followed in all applicable health care settings.Note that for interventions with no or trivial associated risks (e.g., always move from cleaner to dirtier areas when cleaning; perform hand hygiene prior to contact with the client/ patient/resident 's environment), weak supportive evidence can result in a category A recommendation as benefits will clearly outweigh risks. Category B Recommendations for an intervention are those which benefits most likely outweigh the risk in most settings . PIDAC intends that c ategory B recommendations are bes t p ractices that should be followed in most applicable health care settings. Categories A and B recommendations may also be made against an intervention if the risks of the intervention clearly or most likely outweigh the benefits. Table 1: Assessment of the Quality of Evidence Supporting a Recommendation Grade Definition I Evidence from at least one properly randomized, controlled trial. II Evidence from at least one well-designed clinical trial without randomization, from cohort or case -controlled analytic studies, preferably from more than one centre, from multiple time series, or from dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments. III Evidence from opinions of respected authorities on the basis of clinical experience, descriptive s tudies, or reports of expert committees. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 11 T able 2: Determination of the Strength of a Recommendation Category Definition A Best practices that must be followed in all health care settings . The benefits of these practices outweigh the risks. B Best practices that should be followed in most health care settings . The benefits of these practices likely outweigh the risks in most, but not all, settings and situations NOTE: When a recommendation is based on a regulation, no grading will apply. How and When to Use This Document The cleaning practices set out in this document must be practised in all settings where care is provided, across the continuum of health care, with the exception of cleaning of the client's home in home health care. This includes settings where emergency (including pre -hospital) care is provided (e.g. , ambulances, patient transfer vehi cles), hospitals, complex continuing care facilities, rehabilitation facilities, long -term care homes, mental health facilities, outpatient clinics, community health centres, public health clinics, physician offices, dental offices and offices of other health professionals. For guidance on environmental cleaning in clinical office practice: See Chapter 7 of PIDAC's Infection Prevention and Control for Clinica l Office Practice .30 Assumptions and Best Practices in Infection Prevention and Control The best practices in this document are based on the assumption that health care settings in Ontario already have basic infection prevention and control systems and programs in place, such as those outlined in the following docume nt: See PIDAC's Best Practices for Infection Prevention and Control Programs in Ontario in All Healt h Care Settings .31 These settings should work with organizations that have infection pre vention and control expertise, such as academic health science centres, IPAC Regional Support Teams with Public Health Ontario , public health units that have professional staff certified in infection prevention and control and local infection prevention and control associations (e.g., IPAC -Canada chapter s), to develop evidence- based programs. In addition to the general assumption ( above ) about basic infection prevention and control, these best practices are based on the following additional assumptions and principles: 1.Best practices to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases are routinely implemented in all health care settings, including PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautio ns in All Health Care Settings .7 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 12 2.A dequate resources are d evoted to infection prevention and control in all health care settings. See PIDAC's Best Practices for Infection Prevention and Control Programs in Ontario .31 3.Programs are in place in all health care settings that promote good hand hygiene practices and ensure adherence to standards for hand hygiene. See: a)PIDAC's Best Practices for Hand Hygi ene in All Health Care Settings32 b)Ontario's hand hygiene improvement program, Just Clean Your Hands33 4.Programs are in place in all health care settings that ensure effective disinfection and sterilization of used medical equipment according to PIDAC's Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings .19 5.Regular education (including orientation and continuing education) and support is provided in all health care settings to help staff consistently implement appropriate infection preventionand control practices. Effective education programs emphasize: The risks associated with infectious diseases, including acute respiratory infection and gastroenteritis. Hand hygiene, including the use of alcohol -based hand rubs and hand washing. Principles and components of Routine Practices as well as additional transmission -based precautions (Additional Precautions). Assessment of the risk of infection transmission and the appropriate use of person al p rotective equipment, including safe application, removal and disposal. Appropriate cleaning and/ or disinfection of health care equipment, supplies and surfaces o r it ems in the health care environment. Individual staff responsibility for keeping patients, themselves and co -workers safe. Collaboration between professionals involved in infection prevention and control andoccupational health and safety. NOTE: Education programs should be flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of the range of health care providers and other staff who work in the health care setting. The local public health unit and IPAC Regional Support Teams may be a resource and can provide assistance in developing and providing education programs for community settings. 6.Collaboration between professionals involved in occupational health and safety and infection prevention and control is promoted in all health care settings, to implement and maintainappropriate infection prevention and control standards that protect worke rs. 7.There are effective working relationships between the health care setting and local publichealth. Clear lines of communication are maintained and public health is contacted fo r i nformation and advice as required and the obligations (under the Health Protection and Promotion Act , R.S.O 1990, c.H.7 )34 to report reportable and communicable diseases is fulfilled. Public health provides regular aggregate reports of outbreaks of reportable diseases in facilitiesand/ or in the community to all health care settings. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 13 8.A ccess to ongoing infection prevention and control advice and guidance to support staff and resolve differences are available to the health care setting. 9.There are established procedures for receiving and responding appropriately to all international, national, regional and local health advisories in all health care settings. Health advisories arecommunicated promptly to all affected staff (e.g., those responsible for reprocessing medic al e quipment/devices) and regular updates are provided. Current advisories are available from local public health units , the Ministry of Health and Long- Term Care, Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada websites and local regional IPAC networks. 10.Where applicable, there is a process for evaluating personal protective equipment in the healthcare setting, to ensure it meets quality standards. 11.There is regular assessment of the effectiveness of the infection prevention and control programand its impact on practices in the health care setting. The information is used to further refinethe program. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS SHALL BE MET: Health care facilities are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act , R.S.O. 1990, c.O.1 and its Regulations. Employers, supervisors and workers have rights, duties and obligations under the Occupati onal Health and Safety Act . Specific requirements under the Occupational Health and Safety Act and its regulations are available at: www.e -laws .gov.on.ca/index.html The Occupational Health and Safety Act places duties on many different categories of individuals associated with workplaces, such as employers, constructors, supervisors, owners, suppliers, licensees, officers of a corporation and workers. A guide to the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act is available at: www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/ohsa/index.php . The Occupational Health and Safety Act section 25(2)(h), the \" general duty clause\" , requires an employer to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker. Specific requirements for certain health care and residential facilities may be found in the Health Care and Residential Facilities regulation . Under that regulation there are a number of requirements, including: Requirements for an empl oyer to establish written measures and procedures for the health and safety of workers, in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or healthand safety representative, if any. Such measures and procedures may include, but are not limited to , the following: PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 14 safe work practices safe working conditions proper hygiene practices and the use of hygiene facilities the control of infections immunization and inoculation against infectious diseases The requirement that at least once a year the measures and procedures for the health and safety of workers shall be reviewed and revised in the light of current knowledge and practice. A requirement that the employer, in consultation with the joint health and safetycommittee or health and safety repr esentative, if any, shall develop, establish and provide training and educational programs in health and safety measures and procedures fo r wo rkers that are relevant to the workers' work. A worker who is required by his or her employer or by the r egulation for Health Care and Residential Facilities to wear or use any protective clothing, equipment or device shall be instructed and trained in its care, use and limitations before wearing or using it for the first time and at regular intervals thereafter and the worker shall participate in such instruction and training. The employer is reminded of the need to be able to demonstrate training, and is therefore encouraged to document the workers trained , the dates training was conducted, and the information and materials covered during training. Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act , a worker must work in compliance with the Act and its regulations, and use or wear any equipment, protective devices or clothingrequired by the employer. The Needle Safety Regulation (O.Reg 474/07) has requirements related to the use of hollow- bore nee dles that are safety -engineered needles.

PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 15 Section One : Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control in All Health Care Settings PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 16 1.Principles of Cleaning and Disinfecting Environmental Surfaces in a Health Care Environment Health care settings are complex environments where the provision of care to large numbers of clients/patients/residents results in the contamination of surfaces an d equipment with harmful microorganisms. Contaminated surfaces and equipment contribute to the transmission of microorganisms and to the burden of health care -associated infection. Routine and effective cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, items and equipment is an essential activity that protects clients/patients/residents, staff and visitors from infection. Because of the increased risks and consequences of infection transmission in this setting, the approach and intensity of cleaning required differs from that of non -health care settings. In the first section of this best practice document, we present the evidence supporting the role of environmental cleaning in preventing infection and describe the principles of safe and effective environmental cleaning in the health care setting. 1.1 Evidence for Cleaning Since these guidelines were previously published, the evidence that the environment plays a role in the transmission of microorganisms in the health care setting has increased.16,35-39 There has also been an expansion of the evidence demonstrating that effective cleaning and disinfection reduces this risk.15-18,39-41 From a theoretical perspective, all of the following steps are required for environmental contamination to result in infection ( Figure 1 ). Effective environmental cleaning will interrupt direct client/patient/ resident to surface to client/patient/resident transmission of microorganisms, and minimiz e (along with effective hand hygiene) surface to health care provider to client/patient/resident transmission ( Figure 1). The health care environment i s frequently contaminated with microorganisms, including clinically important bacteria, viruses and fungi.42-45 Contamination of most frequently touched surfaces and items within the client/pa tient/resident and/or health care environment has been documented.42,43,46-50 Additionally, viable microorganisms can persist on surfaces and items for prolonged periods of time (e.g., months), 47-54 particularly for organisms such as C. difficile , vancomycin -resistant enterococci (VRE) or methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).45,46 Contamination of health care providers' hands or gloves occurs frequently follo wing contact with environmental surfaces in patient rooms.51,55-63 Health care providers that come in contact with surfaces in the room of a patient colonized with MRSA or VRE have a 42 % to 52 % risk of subsequent hand or glove contamination with the same organism; this risk is similar to the risk seen following direct contact with the patient. 56,58,62 After contact with a VRE contaminated surface, health care providers transmit VRE to the next clean surface or skin site they come in contact with approximately 10 % of the time.59 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 17 Figu re 1: How Environmental Contamination Result s in Infection clients /patients /residents with infection or colonization surfaces and equipment hands or gloves of health care providers susceptible clients / patients / residents 1 2 3b 3a 3b surfaces and equipment clients/patients/residents acquire infection or colonization 4 Transmission of infection directly via contact with the environment. Transmission of infection indirectly via the hands of health care providers, or via surfaces contaminated by the hands of health care providers. Environmental cleaning interrupts contamination and transmission of microorganisms 3a 3b 1.The en vironment becomes contaminated with microorganisms. 2.The microorganisms survive for a sufficient duration to allow transmission. 3.Clients/patients/residents* a)Acquire the microorganism through direct contact with the environment. OR b)Hands or gloves of health care providers or equipment becomes contaminated throughdirect contact with the environment and then transmit the micr oorganism to anothe r c lient/patient/resident due to lapses in hand hygiene and/or disinfection of shared equipment. 4.Acquisition of a microorganism that results in infection. *Note: health care providers can also acquire infection through contact with a contaminated environment. These data demonstrate the ease with which health care providers' hands, gloves and equipment become contaminated with organisms from the environment, suggesting that transfer of microorganisms from surface to provider/equipment is a common occurrence. There is not as much data directly demonstrating transfer from health care providers' hands (following contamination from an environmental source) to a subsequent client/patient/resident but transfer from health care providers' hand s to clients/patients/residents is considered the primary mechanism for the transfer of microorganisms in health care. 64 In addition to the data documenting each step in the transmission pathway ( Figure 1), there is indirect but convincing evidence linking the environment to the acquisition of antibiotic -resistant organisms and health care -associated infections in patients admitted to rooms pr eviously occupied by a patient with a PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 18 k nown antibiotic -resistant organism. Specifically, patients admitted to a room that was previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with a variety of clinically important organisms (i.e., C. difficile , MRSA, Enterobacteriaceae ) are twice as likely to acquire that specific microorganism as to patients admitted to other rooms at the same time.37 This provides additional evidence that environmental contamination can result in the transmission of microorganisms to patients. Additionally, there are multiple studies demonstrating the control of antibiotic -resistant organism outbreaks following the adoption of enhanced cleaning and disinfection approaches.65-70 While many of these studies describe multiple intervention strategies, and it is therefore difficult to confirm that outbreak control was a direct result of enhanced environmental cleaning, there are several studies where outbreaks could not be controlled until enhanced environmental cleaning was implemented.68-70 Whereas there are significant limitations to these studies, their results are consistent with other evidence supporting the role of envir onmental contamination in microorganism transmission and outbreak propagation. Finally, reports of reductions in antibiotic -resistant organism transmission or health care -associated infection incidence have been associated with efforts to enhance routine c leaning 71-75 or through the adoption of novel cleaning technologies.76,77 See 8. New and Evolving Technologies for Environmental Cleaning for a discussion of antimicrobial surfaces and no-touch disinfection methods, and see 9. Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality Control for a discussion on the use of audit and feedback to improve environmental cleaning. Gaps in our understanding of antibiotic -resistant organism transmission persist, and the etiology of health care -associate d infection is complex and multifactorial. Programs to reduce health care - associated infection incidence will likely be most effective when combined with other evidence -based interventions for health care -associated infection prevention (e.g., hand hygiene ).78 Taken together, however, there is evidence supporting the role of a contaminated environment in the transmission of antibiotic -resistant organisms and the incidence of health care -associated infections and this evidence has increased since the original publication of this guideline. Thus, routine environmental cleaning and disinfection remains an essential and required practice to reduce infection risk. 1.2 Health Care Design and Product Selection It is essential that all surfaces, items and equipment installed or used within a health care environment are cleanable. This must be a central consideration when health care facilities are designed, redesigned, or renovated and when new equipment is obtained. Surfaces or equipment that is difficult or impossible to clean and disinfect should not be purchased, installed or used in the health care setting. Environmental services, infection prevention and control, and occupational health and safety should be consulted as key stakeholders at the planning stage of cons truction and renovation and prior to the purchase of new equipment to ensure that this principle is followed. If you can't clean it, don't buy it. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 19 1.2.1 SELECTION OF SURFACES, FINISHES, FURNISH INGS AND EQUIPMENT F OR AREAS WHERE CLIENT/PATIENT/RESID ENT CARE IS DELIVERED Health care settings should have policies that include the criteria to be used when choosing surfaces, finishes, furnishings and equipment for client/patient/resident care areas. These policies should ensure that all surfaces, finishes, furnishings, and equipment meet infection prevention and control requirements for cleaning and disinfection. The policies should establish a decision making process for the selection and approval of furnishings and equipment that includes infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and environmental services.79 These policies should be applied universally regardless of whether the furnishings or equipment are purchased, loaned, borrowed or donated. Infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety and environmental services must be involved in decision- making regarding choices of equipment, furniture and finishes in health care settings.79 All health care settings must have a process in place to ensure that all selected surfaces, finishes, furnishings and equipment are: 79,80 cleanable compatible with the hospital disinfectant used by the health care setting* *I deally, surfaces and equipment should be compatible with all or most commonly used cleaning agents and disinfectants. This minimizes the need for health care settings to stock multiple products and increases flexibility in selecting surfaces and equipment. Manufacture s should list all compatible cleaning and disinfectant products. When there are doubts about product compatibility, the manufacturer of the item should be consulted. Additionally, all health care settings must have a process in place to ensure that damaged finishes, furnishings, or equipment are: 79 identified repaired, replaced or removed from use within clinical areas See CSA Group 's Z8000- 11 (R2016) Canadian Health Care Facilities .80 See CSA Group 's Z8002- 14 Operation and Maintenance of Health Care Facilities .79 If equipment, furnishings, finishings, or surfaces are damaged and cannot be effect ively cleaned, they must be repaired, replaced or removed from use within clinical areas. 1.2.1.1 Surfaces in Health Care Settings When selecting surfaces for use in clinical areas within health care settings, surfaces with the following characteristics are recommended, as these characteristics minimize the risk of microbial contamination:80 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 20 cle anable80-82 S urfaces, finishes, furnishings and equipment shall be cleanable.80,81 For example, surfaces o r e quipment with crevasses that cannot be reached, or surfaces or equipment that cannot withstand cleaning and disinfection with any hospital cleaning products are not appropriate fo r t he health care setting. Furnishings, surfaces, finishes, and equipment shall be able to withstand repeated cleaning and be compatible with hospital detergents, cleaners and disinfectants.80,83,84 eas y to maintain and repair80,81 F inishes and furnishings should be durable and easy to maintain and repair. Fabrics that are torn allow entry of microorganisms, cannot be properly cleaned, and must be repaired or discarded. Items that are scratched or chipped allow accumulation of microorganisms and are more difficult to clean and disinfect.85 re sistant to microbial growth80,81,86 M aterials differ in their ability to prevent or promote microbial growth.87 Materials that hold moisture should be avoided as they support microbial growth.80,81,86,88 Wood is an example of an organic material that contains moisture, and should be avoided in care areas, particularly care areas for immunocompromised patients .86,89 Metals and hard plastics are less likely to support microbial growth than most other materials. Materials with intrinsic antimicrobial properties also exist, and are discussed in 8.2.1 Antimicrobial Surfaces . nonporous80-82 M icroorganisms survive more easily on porous surfaces. Microorganisms have been shown to survive on porous fabrics such as cotton, cotton terry, nylon and polyester and on porousplastics such as polyurethane and polypropylene. 48,49,90 s eamless80-82 S eams may harbour microorganisms and are difficult to clean. 1.2.1.2 Finishes in Health Care Settings (Walls, Flooring) When selecting finishes for use in clinical areas within health care settings, surfaces with the following characteristics are recommended, as these characteristics minimize the risk of microbial contamination: 80,81 cleanable easy to maintain and repair resistant to microbial growth nonporous (smooth) seamless Additional characteristics for finishes that are important to consider, although not directly affecting infection risk, include (but are not limited to) the following:80,81 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 21 go od sound absorption/acoustics nonflammable (Class I fire rating) durable sustainable low levels of volatile organic compounds to reduce off -gassing low smoke toxicity initial and life cycle cost -effectiveness slip-resistant easy to install, remove and replace resilient and impact resistant nontoxic and non -allergenic 1.2.1.3 Cloth and Soft Furnishings in Health Care Settings Cloth furnishings harbor higher concentrations of fungi than nonporous furnishings.91-94 Additionally, bacteria cannot be effectively removed from the surfaces of upholstered furniture.80,95 An alternative to cloth surfaces must be used in care areas.80,81 Upholstered furniture and furnishings and other cloth items that cannot be cleaned shall not be used in care areas ,80 and the y should not be used in nursing stations that support clinical activity. Upholstered furniture that is used in care areas shall be covered with fabrics that are fluid -resistant, nonporous, and can withstand cleaning with hospital disinfectants.81,83 These recommendations do not apply to the home health care environment, or to those long- term care homes where furnishings are supplied by the resident. Stuffing and foam cannot be effectively disinfected if breaks in fabric or leaks of body fluids or spills have occurred. If cloth furnishings or items are used within any health care environment, the following is required until these furnishing or items can be replaced: A plan and schedule for the replacement cloth furnishings with non -cloth furnishings and items should be in place, prioritizing removal from areas where immunocomp romised patients are cared for.92 A regular cleaning regimen should be in place. Any item visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids must be i mmediately removed from the clinical setting and cleaned and disinfected. Items should be assessed for damage on a regular basis, and worn, stained or torn items shouldbe replaced as soon as possible. These items should not be redirected to nonclinical ar ea s b efore being cleaned, disinfected and repaired. When cloth surfaces such as curtains, pillows, mattresses or soft furnishings are used in clinical areas, cloth surfaces with the following characteristics are preferred, as these characteristics minimize the risk of microbial contamination : 96 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 22 se amless (wh ere possible) or have double -stitched seams easy to access (e.g., removable covers) for cleaning have foam cores that are resistant to mould durable and able to tolerate repeated cleaning with detergents and disinfectants, without damage quick drying easy to maintain, repair or replace covered with fluid -resistant fabric Cloth privacy curtains are commonly used in health care settings , and they rapidly become contaminated with microorganisms.48,61,97-104 Use of privacy curtains with antimicrobial properties has not been proven to reduce infection risk and does not eliminate the risk of contamination with microorganisms.105 Although it is recognized that changing cloth privacy curtains frequently is challenging, it does not make sense to clean and disinfect all room surfaces at patient/resident discharge while leaving contaminated cloth privacy curtains in place . Solutions that address the need to change cloth privacy curtains and the challenge of doing so on a routine basis include the use of alternatives to cloth privacy curtains such as w ipeable privacy screens, or single -use or tear -away curtains. 81,106- 108 In some settings (e.g., where the bed cannot be seen from the hallway) privacy curtains may not be required at all and should be removed. If cloth privacy curtains (including those with antimicrobial properties) are used, health care settings must ensure the following : Cloth privacy curtains shall be washable at a temperature that ensures disinfection.80 C loth privacy curtains must be removed, cleaned and disinfected immediately if they become cont aminated with blood or body fluids, or are visibly soiled.109 C loth pr ivacy curtains used for patients/residents requiring Additional Precautions must be removed, cleaned and disinfected following disc harge or transfer of the p atient/ resident and before a new patient/resident is admitted to that room or bed space.109 C loth privacy curtains used for all patients/residents should be changed following discharge or transfer of the patient/resident and before a new patient/resident is admitted to that room or bed space. For patients/residents with extended stay s, health care facilities should consider changing privacy curtains regularly (e.g., monthly).109 1.2.1.4 Carpeting Carpeting has been associated with an increased risk of health care -associated infection rates in immunocompromised populations.92,110,111 Carpeted floors become more contaminated with C. difficile as compared to noncarpeted floors.112 Carpeting shall not be used in areas that house immunocompromised patients at risk of invasive fungal infections (e.g., transplantation units, high risk oncology units). 80,111,113- 121 In addition, carpeting must not be used in care areas where: The patient population is at increased risk of infection following exposure to dust or particulatesharbouring microorganisms (e.g., transplant units, burn units, intensive care units, operating and procedure rooms). 80,92 S pills of water, body fluids or other liquids occur (e.g., intensive care units, laboratory areas, procedure rooms, areas around sinks, bathrooms).80 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 23 S pills of alcohol- based hand rub may occur, creating a fire hazard (e.g., corridors outside patient rooms in acute care.)64,122 Th e risk of C. difficile exists, e.g., in patient rooms in acute care.80,112 T he use of carpeting in other areas should be minimized. If carpeting is used in other care areas, it shall be cleanable with hospital cleaners and disinfectants, and shall be easily removed (e.g. , carpet tiles), discarded and replaced.80 In addition, for facilities that continue to have carpeting in place within care areas, the following is recommended: Carpeting located in high risk areas (see above) should be removed in a safe manner as soon as possible; clients/patients/residents should not be present during the removal process.86 A plan to gradually remove (and not replace) carpeting located in low risk care areas should be developed. Older carpets should be prioritized for removal.123 W et carpets should be dried as soon as possible. The risk of mould increases if carpets remain wet for 48 hours or longer.124- 126 Carpeting that remains wet after 48 hours shall be removed and should not b e replaced.86 C arpets must be cleaned on a regular basis by trained environmental service workers using specialized cleaning equipment and procedures ,92 as the specific type of material used in the carpet will influence the efficacy of disinfectants.83 1.2.2 NEW EQUIPMENT/PRODUCT PURCHASES The administration of the health care setting is responsible for ensuring and verifying that any item used in the provision of care to clients/patients/residents is capable of being cleaned and disinfected according to current standards and guidelines. This includes purchased, borrowed, or donated equipme nt, and equipment used for research purposes if such equipment will be used within the care environment. Equipment that is used to clean and disinfect must also meet these standards. This document deals only with equipment that requires low -level disinfect ion. For high -leve l d isinfection, see PIDAC's Best practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Healt h Care Facilities .19 1.2.2.1 Selection of Noncritical Medical Equipment Equipment and devices that either touches only intact skin (but not mucous membranes) or do not directly touch the client/patient/resident are classified as noncritical. 127 For all noncritical medical equipment purchased, loaned, donated or otherwise used within a health care setting the following is required: Do not purchase medical equipment that cannot be cleaned and disinfected according to therecommended standards. 19 A ll noncritical medical equipment that will be purchased or obtained for use within the health care setting must include written item -specific manufacturer's cleaning and disinfection instructions. I f d isassembly or reassembly is re quired, detailed instructions with pictures must be included. Staff training must be provided on these processes before the medical equipment is placed intocirculation 19 (e.g., patient lifts, specialized chairs and beds). Items th at are provided by outside agencies and returned to the agency for cleaning and disinfection are subject to the same standards as in -house equipment.128 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 24 S ee PIDA C's Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings19 for more informat ion regarding the purchase of new medical equipment. Equipment used for cleaning also requires regular, routine cleaning and disinfection and all of the above requirements apply to cleaning equipment as well. Additionally: Products used for cleaning and disinfection must be approved by infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and environmental services.19 A ll cleaning equipment must be compatible with the cleaning and disinfecting agents used in the health care setting and manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning must be followed. When purchasing cleaning agents or cleaning equipment, consideration must be given to occupational health requirements, patient safety, infection prevention and control andenvironmental safety concerns. 19 1.2.2.2 Plastic Coverings Plastic covers may be recommended to protect difficult to clean items or equipment within the health care environment from contamination. It is essential that plastic covers are selected, used and maintained appropriately. Outbreaks of health care -associated infections, such as VRE and Acinetobacter species, have been linked to improper use or maintenance of plastic covers on beds.88,128,129 If plastic covers are used within a health care setting, including mattress and pillow covers, the following practices should be adhered to: Plastic covers should be cleaned on a regular basis, between patients and when visibly soiled. Plastic covers should be inspected for damage on a regular basis and a clear process must be in place to ensure reporting of, removal and replacement of damaged plastic coverings. 129 M attress and pillow covers, as well as other plastic covers, should be repaired or replaced if they are torn or cracked, visibly stained, or if there is evidence of liquid penetration.92,129, 130 Repairs should be completed appropriately and should then allow effective cleaning and disinfection;the practice of placing tape over tears is not sufficient. Plastic coverings (e.g., mattress covers, keyboard covers) should be cleaned with hospital disinfe ctants that are compatible with th e c overing.131 1.2.2.3 Electronic Equipment Electronic equipment is no different than other equipment with respect to cleaning and disinfection. Electronic equipment becomes contaminated with microo rganisms and can transmit organisms between patients, depending on how and where the equipment is used, cleaned and disinfected. 67,132-139 There are some unique challenges with electronic equipment used within health care settings, however. Electronic equipment may be owned by the health care facility or by health ca re providers or staff; electronic equipment often has buttons, holes for plugs, and other complex surface elements that make cleaning difficult (or impossible); incorrect cleaning of electronic equipment may damage the equipment and/or void the warranty. Additionally, many types of electronic equipment were not designed for use in health care and there may not be appropriate manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and disinfection (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 25 W hen health care facilities purc hase electronic equipment, as with all equipment purchases, the specific electronic items selected should be cleanable, and should be compatible with the health care setting's cleaning and disinfection products. Additionally, electronic equipment should be, whenever possible, designed for use in the health care setting and should come with manufacturer's instructions on cleaning and disinfection. Environmental services, infection prevention and control, and occupational health and safety should be consulted as key stakeholders prior to the purchase of new electronic equipment that will be used in care areas. Some health care facilities have policies allowing \"bringing your own device programs\" in which health care providers are able to access confidential client/patient/resident information on their personal electronic devices. These facilities should ensure that guidance on appropriate disinfection practices for these devices are included within these policies, and should emphasize the user's responsibility for ensuring that disinfection is performed. Recommendation: 1.Health care settings shall only purchase, install, or use surfaces, finishes, furnishings a nd e quipment that can be effectively cleaned and disinfected.

[A III] [modified 2018 ] 1.3 Cleaning Agents , Disinfectants , and Cleaning Equipment Cleaning is the removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil, organic material such as blood, secretions, excretions and microorganisms) from a surface or object. Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms, reducing the organism load on a surfac e. It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. The key to cleaning is the use of friction to remove microorganisms and debris. Thorough cleaning is required for any equipment/device to be disinfected as organic material may inactivate a disinfectant. This may be accomplished through a two -step process involving the use of a cleaner followed by a disinfectant, or through a one -step process using a combined cleaner/disinfectant product. Disinfection is a process used on inanimate objects and surfaces to kill microorganisms. Disinfection will kill most disease -causing microorganisms but may not kill all bacterial spores. The key to cleaning is the use of friction to remove microorganisms and debris. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 27 1.3.1 DETERGENTS AND CLEAN ING AGENTS Dete rgents remove organic material and suspend grease or oil. Equipment and surfaces in the health care settin g must be cleaned with approved cleaners and hospital disinfectants. Most environmental surfaces will be adequately cleaned with soap and water or a o ne-step cleaner/disinfectant, depending on the nature of the surface and the type and degree of contamination.92 A variety of products can be used to achieve effective cleaning. The process and products used for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and medical equipment must be compatible with the surfaces/equipment.19 It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using cleaning agents. Cleaning products used in the health care setting: Must be approved by infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and environmental services. Must have a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada if it contains a disinfectant. Must be used according to the manufacturers' recommendations (e.g. , for dilution, temperature, water hardness, contact time, etc.). Must be used according to the product's safety data sheet. 1.3.2 DISINFECTANTS Disinfec tants for use on noncritical medical devices and hard nonporous environmental surfaces and inanimate objects in hospitals are regulated by Health Canada and are commonly referred to as hard surface disinfectants. 4 A hospital disinfectant is a kind of hard surface disinfectant that carries efficacy claims against the bacteria Pseudomon as aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus .140 In addition, hard surface disinfectants may carry label claims as bactericides, fungicides, virucides, mycobactericide s, or sporicides.140 Disinfectants are only to be used to disinfect and must not be used as general cleaning agents, unless combined with a cleaning agent as a one -step cleaner/disinfectant. 141 Skin ant iseptics must never be used as environmental disinfectants (e.g., alcohol- based -hand rub, chlorhexidine gluconate). This document deals with disinfectants used on noncritical equipment and hard surfaces . For information about high -level disinfectants used on reusable semicritical and critical medical devices, see PIDAC's Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All He alth Care Facilities .19 1.3.2.1 Choosing a Disinfectant Ideally, facilities should select a single hospital disinfectant that meets all or most of the facilities cleaning and disinfection requirements. Although the complexity of the health care environment may require the use of more than one disinfectant product, every effort should be made to limit the total number of different products in use. This will simplify the cleaning process, minimize the training requirements for environmental service workers, and reduce the potential for errors. The disinfectant must have a DIN from Health Canada (sodium hypochlorit e and alcohol -based disinfectants are exceptions, and may be used within the health care setting in the appropriate concentration). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 28 M anufacturers should assist facilities by listing all hospital disinfectants that are compatible with their items or equipment. Facilities should not purchase items and equipment that cannot be disinfected with the hospital disinfectants selected. In exceptional cases where essential equipment is required and where the manufacturer's instructions do not list the facilities' hos pital disinfectant as an acceptable product, facilities should conduct their own risk assessment that considers: the risk of equipment damage o r malfunction from disinfection the cost of replacing damaged equipment and the warranties Using multiple disinfectants in a facility increases the risk of error and inadequate disinfection . Therefore, facilities may choose to use a disinfectant that is not listed by the manufacturer, or to purchase alternative items or equipment that is compatible with the facilitie s' hospital disinfectant. Hospitals should work with the ir suppliers to ensure the latter is aware of the facility's approved hospital disinfectants and disinfection process. The following factors influence the choice of disinfectant:92,142 The efficacy and spectrum of activity of the disinfectan t - is it effective in inactivating all of the microorganisms most likely to cause healthcare -associated infections within the setting where i t w ill be used . Ease of use . The disinfectant should have a sufficiently short contact time and should keep surfac es w et l ong enough to ensure that the contact time is met (at the usual ambient temperature of the healthcare setting . The disinfectant should be simple to prepare and use at the required concentration . The ability of the disinfectant to act as a cleaner and disinfectant (e.g. , one-step cleaner disinfectant .) Compatible with the items and surfaces requiring disinfection . Safe for use for both staff and patients : Hospital disinfectants including quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, improved hydrogen peroxide, or sodium hypochlorite have been reported to cause respiratory and skin irritation and allergic reactions and are one of the leading allergens affecting health care providers. Furthermore, staff will be more likely to use products that are nontoxic, non- irritating and have an acceptable odour.143- 152 Flammability and safe storage shou ld be considered . Cost and the impact on the environment should also be considered. Consider products that are biodegradable and safe for the environment. Many disinfectants (e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds) may be hazardous both durin g m anufacture and when they are discharged into the waste stream, as they are not readily biodegradable.152 S ee Hospital Disinfectants for Disinfection of Environmental Surfaces for a list of common hospital disinfectants for disinfection of environmental surfaces . See Appendix 1 for the advantages and disadvantages of some common hospital disinfecting agents . PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 29 H ospital Disinfectants for Disinfection of Environmental Surfaces Hospital disinfectants commonly used in all health care settings include:92,153- 155 A lcohol (ethyl or isopropyl) I mproved hydrogen peroxide I Q uaternary ammonium compounds S odium hypochlorite (bleach) 1.3.2.2 Using Disinfectants When using a disinfectant: It is most important that an item or surface be free from visible soil and other items that migh t i nterfere with the action of the disinfectant, such as adhesive products, before a disinfectant is applied, or the disinfectant will not work.156 Most disinfectants lose their effectiveness rapidly in the presence of organic matter.154, 157 A hospital disinfectant is appropriate for noncritical equipment (i.e., equipment that only touches intact skin).140 Examples include intravenous pumps and poles, hydraulic lifts, blood pressure cuffs, apnoea monitors and sensor pads, electrocardiogram machine/cables and crutches. Refer to Appendix 2 for a list of items that require cleaning followed by disinfection (o r application of a cleaner/disinfector). It is important that the disinfectant be used according to the manufacturer's instructions for dilution and con tact time.16,85,158,159 Where dispensing systems are used, health care facilities should verify regularly that the systems are functioning properly (e.g., use of manufacturers ' test strips, calibratio n of dispensers) .160 R efer to Appendix 1 for disinfectants commonly used in health care settings with their recommended concentrations and contact times. Minimize the contamination levels of the disinfectant solution and equipment u sed fo r c leaning.161 This can be achieved by ensuring proper dilution of the disinfectant,162 frequently changing the disinfectant solution and wiping cloths, not dipping a soiled cloth into thedisinfectant solution (i.e., no \"double -dipping\") , 163 and regular cleaning and disinfection of cleaning equipment.164 (See Figure 2) Personal protective equipment must be worn appropriate to the product(s) used. There should be system s in place to ensure the efficacy of the disinfectant over time (e.g., frequent testing of product , review of expiry date ).161 *H igh-level disinfectants for use on semicritical devices are discussed in PIDAC's Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization of Medical Equipment/Devices in All Health Care Settings .19 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 30 Figu re 2: Culture Plates Showing Contamination of Surface by Contaminated Disinfectant Solution161, 164 Two contact agar plates were taken from a patient's overbed table before (left) and after (right) cleaning. The environmental surface had a higher level of bacterial growth after cleaning a s a result of using contaminated quaternary ammonium disinfectant. The pail holding the disinfectant solution had been used repeatedly for months without being emptied and dried between uses. (Source: Boyce JM. Modern technologies for improving cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in hospitals. Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2016;5:10. Figure 1, Contact agar plate cultures showing bacterial colonies recovered from a patient's overbed table before (left) and after (right) the surface was cleaned by a housekeeper using contaminated quaternary ammonium disinfectant.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.) 1.3.2.3 Disinfectant Wipes Adequate disinfection of equipment requires that sufficient quantity of an effective hospital disinfect ant be applied to all surfaces for the app ropriate contact time. This may be achieved using either a cloth and sufficient quantities of a disinfectant , or a large, pre -prepared (ready -to-use) wipes saturated with an appropriate disinfectant product . Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and neither approach is effective unless performed correctly.165- 170 There is limited data comparing these two methods.165, 171- 176 Concerns with ready -to-use wipes include a lack of data on efficacy,172, 175,177- 179 the limited contact times, and the potential for wipes to dry out prior to use (if incorrectly stored) or rapidly during use.169 Facilities may select either a cloth with disinfectant or large, pre -prepared wipes for use by environmental services to clean surfaces and equipment. Mobile equipment that moves from patient/client/resident to patient/clie nt/resident (e.g., stethoscopes, vital signs monitors) must be cleaned by the user between patient/client/resident. In this circumstance, smaller pre -prepared disinfectant wipes (i.e., NOT small antiseptic wipes used for skin preparation) may be used by health care providers for cleaning and disinfection. These wipes should be stored near the point - of-care in a sealed container and should not be used if dry. These small disinfectant wipes should NOT be confused with the larger pre -prepared wipes described above and should NOT be used to clean or disinfect surfaces or large or complex pieces of equipment. When selecting and using disinfectant wipes: Infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and environmental servicesshould be involved in the selection of ready -to-use wipes. The wipes selected should be approved by Health Canada and have a DIN number . The detergent and disinfectant properties of the wipes, efficacy data, and the manufacturer's instruct ions for use should be reviewed. The active ingredient must be an appropriate hospital disinfectant. Wipes must be kept wet (by keeping the lid closed ) and discarded if they become dry. Follow manufacturers' recommendation for storing wipes and reprocessing containers. Containers that are not properly cleaned and disinfected may become a reservoir fo r m icroorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,169 Serratia marcescens ,180 Achromobacter species180, 181 which may develop tolerance to the disinfectant being used.169 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 31 F ollow the manufacturers' recommendations when using wipes, and ensure that the correct contact time required to achieve adequate disinfection is used. Care must be taken to avoid introducing contamination to the container when preparing the disinfectant solution .182 W ipes must have a safety data sheet and be used according to the safety data sheet (e.g., wear gloves when handling, if recommended). Small disinfectant wipes must only be used for: Items in the care environment that will not tolerate soaking. Small, mobile items that must be disinfected between clients/patients/residents at th e p oint-of-care (e.g., stethoscopes, vital signs monitors). 1.3.3 MICROFIBRE AND ULTRA MICROFIBRE CLEANING PRODUCTS Microfibre cleaning products are woven with very fine split fibres of hydrophilic polyamide and hydrophobic polyester in various combinations that differ across manufacturers.183,184 These cleaning products can hold more water than conventional cleaning cloths (up to 6 times their weight).184 Ultramicrofibre cleaning products comprise even thinner fibres,185 and are designed to be used with low volumes of water without detergent or disinfectant.185 The positively charged fibres attract dirt and bacteria by statics and capillary action.16,184,186 As a result, microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products are supposed to retain the particles picked up firmly during the cleaning process.16,184,186 The fine size and split shape of the fibres also allow the cleaning products to pick up dirt and bacteria from very small or invisible irregularities of surface that conventional cleaning cloths or mops cannot reach.183-185,187 The use of microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products can reduce the amount of water and cleaning disin fecting chemicals used and disposed in cleaning environmental surfaces and in reprocessing these cleaning products, resulting in lower cost and reduced exposure to disinfectant chemicals, and less time spent in preparing and replenishing the cleaning solut ion. 184, 188 Due to their lighter weight, these cleaning products are more ergonomic to handle with a lower risk for musculoskeletal injuries. 184, 188 Microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products come in different densities, fibre combinations, and weaving patterns, giving rise to different texture, absorbency, durability, and performance. 189 Although microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products have been reported to clean and remove bacteria (including C. difficile spores) better than other common cleaning tool s (e.g., cotton cloths, J -cloths, paper towel) when used wet on surfaces without disinfectants, 185,186,190- 193 their performance varies with the brands,194 the presence of soil,183, 194 the number of times they have been washed, 194,195 the kind of microorganisms on the surface,194 and the surface type;194 and they do not always decontaminate environmental surfaces better than cloths of other materials.189,195,196 In addition, their potential in spreading microorganisms from surface to surface during the cleaning process varies.189,194,197 Environmental se rvice workers should, therefore, be using a new cloth or mop head when moving from a patient environment to another patient environment, and when crossing between patient and health care environments.190,197 Depending on the level of soiling, it may be necessary to change cloths between different areas within a patient environment.190 In addition, although microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products claim to deliver superior cleaning with water only, the use of disinfectants can be helpful to destroy any bacteria spread by these products during cleaning. However, many microfibre and ultramicrofibre cleaning products bind with quaternary ammonium compoun ds and lower the concentration of the disinfectant delivered to a surface. 198,199 Environmental service PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 32 w orkers must follow manufacturers' instructions in selecting compatible cl eaning and disinfecting agents. Although the cleaning efficacy of microfibre cleaning products used dry does not surpass that of other commonly used cleaning materials,189 dusting with microfibre products may be better due to its electrostatic properties .184 The fibres in most of these cleaning products can also be destroyed by chlorine -based disinfectants (e.g., blea ch).185, 199,200 Health care settings that use these cleaning products should consult with the manufacturers' instructions on using and regenerating these c leaning products which may be contaminated by C. difficile spores during the cleaning process.16,194,200 Cleaning and disinfection protocols must be established to reprocess these cleaning products, as their ability to absorb water and hold on to microorganisms may also provide a niche for microbial growth.189, 195 Besides, fabric softeners or cleaning together with organic fibres (e.g. , cotton) that produce lint will clog the fibres and reduce efficacy.199 Microfibre cloths are also damaged by high temperature.193 Health care settings should ensure that training is provided to those who use and reprocess these products,193 and manufacturers' recommendations on the laundry conditions (e.g., optimal temperature, launder detergents) must be followed. 190 Recommendation s: 18.Cleaning and disinfecting products: a.Must be approved by environmental services, infection prevention and control a nd o ccupational health and safety.

[L egislation] [new 2018] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 34 2.Principles of Infection Prevention and Control for Environmental Service Workers Environmental service workers work in a health care environment where there are risks of infectious diseases transmission through exposure to clients/patients/residents, conta minated items and surfaces, and via exposure to blood and body fluids. These risks can be minimized by the correct and consistent use of good infection prevention and control practices, most importantly the use of Routine Practices (see below) at all times when in the care environment. Health care facilities must ensure that all environmental service workers receive education and training with respect to infection prevention and control best practices, including the correct use of personal protective equipm ent. 31 2.1 Routine Practices Envir onmental service workers may be exposed to blood or body fluids and microorganisms that contaminate the health care environment. The principle of Routine Practices is that all clients/patients/residents may carry harmful microorganisms regardless of their isolation status or diagnosis. Routine Practices are essential practices that must be followed by all staff working in clinical areas and are intended to prevent the transmission of organisms and to protect both staff and clients/patients/residents. Enviro nmental service workers must adhere to Routine Practices when working in the care environment. Routine Practices include: hand hygiene use of personal protective equipment when indicated safe management of sharps cleaning and disinfection of equipment that moves from client/patient/resident to client/patient/resident environmental cleaning See PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for All Health Care Settings 7 for more information regarding Routine Practices. 2.1.1 HAND HYGIENE Hand hygiene is the most effective measure to prevent the spread of health care- associated infections.201- 211 Hand hygiene must be practi sed: Before initial patient/patient environment contact (e.g., before coming into th e c lient/patient/resident room or bed space). After potential body fluid exposure (e.g., after cleaning bathroom, handling soiled linen, equipment or waste). After patient/patient environment contact (e.g., a fter cleaning client/patient/resident room; after cleaning equipment such as stretchers; after changing mop heads). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 35 I t is necessary to clean hands after removing gloves as gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination.32,64,212- 214 The use of gloves does not replace the need for hand hygiene. Alcohol -based hand rubs are recommended when hands are not visibly soiled as the y rapidly kill microorganisms , and because it takes less time to perform hand hygiene with alcohol -based hand rubs than with soap and water. 32,64,214- 216 Alcohol -based hand rubs are also easier on the hands and cause less skin breakdown than soap and water. Environmental service workers must perform hand hygiene before entering and on leaving the client/patient/resident environment ; alcohol- based hand rubs are the preferred method for hand hygiene after activities that do not result in visible soiling of the hands, such as dusting, mopping and vacuuming. When hands are visibly soiled, hand hygiene with soap and water is required. Dedicated hand washing sink s are required for hand washing with soap and water, to avoid splash back of microorganisms from contaminated sinks onto clean hands during rinsing. Hand washing sinks shall not be used for other purposes, such as disposal of fluids or cleaning of equipmen t. 80 The use of gloves does not replace the need for hand hygiene. For more information regarding hand hygiene: See the Public Health Ontario's Just Clean Your Hands hand hygiene improvement program for hospitals and long- term care homes.33 S ee PIDAC's Best Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings .32 Recommendation: 24.Environmental service workers must follow best practices fo r hand hygiene. [ A II] [reviewed and not changed 2018 ] 2.1.2 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Personal protective equipment for health care providers and other staff refers to a variety of barriers used alone or in combination to pr otect mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing from contact with infectious agents and from chemical agents. Environmental service workers should wear personal protective equipment: for protection from microorganisms for protection from chemicals used in cleaning for prevention of transmission of microorganisms from one patient environment to another Health care settings must ensure that: Personal protective equipment is sufficient and accessible for all environmental service workers for Routine Practic es, Additional Precautions 7,217, 218 and for personal protection from chemicals used in cleaning.217 W HMIS training regarding appropriate handling of biohazardous material is provided. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 36 I ndividualized training is provided in the correct use, application and removal of person al p rotective equipment.219, 220 E nvironmental service workers who are required to wear N95 respirators for Airborne Precautions are fit -tested in accor dance with a respiratory protection program that is compliant with the Ministry of Labour and Canadian Standards Association requirements.221 P ersonal protective equipment is used as part of Routine Practices to prevent contact with blood, body fluids, sec retions, excretions, non -intact skin or mucous membranes. Personal protective equipment must be used in the following circumstances: Glove must be worn when there is a risk of hand contact with blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions or items contaminated with these. Gowns must be worn if contamination of uniform or clothing is anticipated (e.g., cleaning bed of incontinent client/ patient/resident). Mask and eye protection or face shield must be worn where appropriate to protect the mucousmembranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during activities involving close contact (i.e., within two metres) with clients/patients/residents likely to generate splashes or sprays of secretions(e.g., coughing, sneezing). For more information about personal protective equ ipment, see PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for All Health Care Settings .7 2.1.2.1 Glove Use in Environmental Services Unnecessary or prolonged wearing of gloves is not recommended. Prolonged exposure to gloves increases the risk of irritant contact dermatitis from sweat and moisture within the glove and the risk of tears.222, 223 Gloves must be removed immediately after the activity for which they were used and, if disposable, discarded.7,32,218 Continuing to wear the same pair of gloves while moving from one patient environment to another , or between the patient and the health care environment , facilitates the spread of microorganisms.7,224, 225 Environmental service workers must not walk from patient environment to patient environment and between patient and health care environment wearing the same pair of gloves.32,58 Disposable gloves should never be washed and re -used.7,226,227 Gloves are never a substitute for hand hygiene but should be used, when indicated, as an additional measure to reduce the risk of hand contamination with microorganisms and chemicals. Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before putting on gloves and immediately after gloves are remov ed. 7,32,64,216, 218, 228 It is important to assess and select the most appropriate glove to be worn for the activity about to be performed. Selection of gloves should be based on a risk analysis of the type of setting, the task that is to be performed, likelihood of exposure to body substances, length of use and amount of stress on the glove.218 The glove requirements identified in the safety data sheet must be followed when using a chemical agent. In general: Disposable gloves may be used for routine daily cleaning and disinfecting procedures inclient/patient/ resident care areas and public washrooms. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 37 D urable, polymer gloves compatible with the safety data sheet for the product(s) used are recommended for wet work of long duration when durability is required, for discharge/transfe r c leaning and for contact with certain chemical powders and solutions. Household utility gloves are only acceptable for cleaning in noncare areas, with the exception of public washrooms. Puncture -resistant gloves are recommended if the task has a high risk for percutaneous injury (e.g., sorting linen, handling waste). See PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings7 for more information about the use of gloves. Gloves must be removed and hand hygiene performed upon leaving each client/patient/resident room or bed space. Recommendation s: 25.Gloves must be removed and hand hygiene performed on moving from one patient environment to another, or between the patient and t he health care environment . [A III] [modified 2018 ] 26.Gloves must not be worn when walking from room to room, from bed space to bed space, or in other areas of the health care facility. [ A III] [modified 2018 ] 2.1.2.2 Personal Protecti ve Equipment in Environmental Services A gown, respiratory protection and eye protection are not required for routine cleaning activities. However, personal protective equipment requirements identified on safety data sheets shall be followed when using che mical agents (e.g., wearing eye protection when mixing chemical agents or when there is a risk of splashing, wearing protective clothing or apron when the chemical may cause skin burns or irritation).8,217 Additionally, personal protective equipment is required when cleaning in the patient/resident en vironment for patients on Additional Precautions. For staff working in laundry facilities, barrier gowns or fluid- resistant aprons and sleeves shall be worn with a face shield when there may be a risk of splashing.7,218, 229 See PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings7 for more information about the use of gowns, masks and eye protection. 2.1.2.3 Removal of Personal Protective Equipment Personal protective equipment, when worn, must be removed in a manner that will not contaminate the wearer and must be removed and discarded immediately after the task has been completed. Hand hygiene must be per formed after removal of personal protective equipment. See PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings7 for more information about correct removal of personal protective e quipment. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 38 2.2 Additional Precautions Additional Precautions (i.e., Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions and Airborne Precautions) are precautions that are necessary in addition to Routine Practices when caring for clients/patients/ residents with certa in microorganisms or clinical presentations. The specific type of Additional Precautions required is based on the method of transmission of the suspected infectious agent (e.g., Airborne Precautions for suspected tuberculosis, D roplet and C ontact Precautions for influenza). 7 Clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions may be cohorted or placed in single rooms with appropriate signage affixed to the entrance to the room that indicates the personal protective equipment required when carrying out activities inside the room. All staff must comply with these precautions when entering the room. See PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings 7 for more information about Additio nal Precautions and the use of personal protective equipment. Recommendations: 27.Environmental service workers must adhere to Routine Practices and Additional Precautions . [A III] [modified 2018 ] 28.Personal protective equipment: a.Shall be sufficient and accessible for all environmental service workers . [Legislation] [modified 2018 ] b.Shall be worn as required by Routine Practices, Additional Precautions , and by safety data sheets when handling chemicals .

[ A III] [reviewed and not changed 2018 ] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 39 3.Cleaning Best Practi ces for Client/Patient/Resident Care Areas Good environmental cleaning practices are essential for reducing the risk of transmitting infectious diseases and minimizing the risk of patient or occupational injury.18,230- 234 These will contribute to a culture of safety by providing an atmosphere of cleanliness and order. A clean environment is also a basic expectation of clients/patients/residents, 235 their families, and staff, and is essential to providing a patient - and family -focused care environment and a positive work environment.236 Environmental cleaning in the health care setting should be performed on a routine basis to provide for a safe and sanitary environment. Processes should be in place to ensure that regular and effective cleaning is occurring consistently (see 9. Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality C ontrol ). Recommendation: 29.Environmental cleaning in the health care setting must be performed on a routine a nd c onsistent basis to provide for a safe and sanitary environment. [A III] [modified 2018] 3.1 General Principles To ensure that regular, effective cleaning is implemented and performed consistently and correctly: Health care facilities must ensure that an appropriately organized and resourced environment al s ervice department is in place. Health care facilities must have up -to-date policies and procedures for environmental cleaning that are: Designed to minimize the spread of infection within the health care setting. Attainable and understandable to frontline environmental service workers. Reviewed regularly and updated as advances and developments in environmental cleaning techniques and technology occur. The primary focus of the environmental service department must be the safety ofclients/patients/residents, staff and visitors. 3.1.1 ORGANIZATION AND REQUIRED RESOURCES FOR EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING Environmental services should be organized and resourced appropriately for the type of health care setting.79 The health care setting must ensure that environmental services has the human resources, education and equipment required to perform effective cleaning.237 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 40 A ll health care settings must have an environmental service program with: A single individual assigned overall responsibility for the care of the physical facility. A sufficient number of supervisors trained and knowledgeable in cleaning standards and practices to suppor t all frontline environmental service workers. A primary focus on cleaning patient care areas, rather than administrative or public areas. Written policies and procedures for cleaning and disinfection of client/patient/resident areas and equipment that include: Defined lines of accountability. Defined responsibility for specific areas and items. Procedures for routine (e.g. , daily ) and discharge/ transfer cleaning and disinfection. Procedures for cleaning in construction/renovation areas. Procedures for specific environmentally -hardy microorganisms such as VRE and C. difficile. Procedures for outbreak management. Cleaning and disinfection standards and frequency. Initial and continuing education for all environmental service workers. Monitoring of environ mental cleanliness with: Results reported back to become part of the employee's performance review.31 Aggregate results reviewed by environmental service leadership as well as the appropriateinfection prevention and control and/or quality and safety committees. Ongoing review of all polic ies and cleaning procedures. All health care settings must devote sufficient resources to environmental services to ensure that: Environmental service workers can adhere to the health care settings policy on cleaning anddisinfection frequency. There is su fficient staffing and resources to allow thorough and timely cleaning and disinfection. There is sufficient staffing and resources to allow for provision of additional environment al c leaning capacity during outbreaks that does not compromise routine cleaning of any clinical areas or client/patient/resident rooms.31,237 T hese recommendations and cleaning practices apply to all health care settings regardless of whether cleaning is conducted by in -house staff, or contracted out. They are designed to be used as a standard against which in -house services can be benchmarked, as the basis for specifications if cleaning services are contracted out, and as the framework for auditing of cleaning services by cleaning supervisors and managers. Recommendations: 30.Sufficient resources must be devoted to environmental services to ensure effective cleaning at all times, including surge capacity for high -demand periods, e.g., outbreaks; high occupancy ; o r high turnover. [ A III] [modified 2018 ] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 41 3 1.Health care settings should design their environmental service organizational structure to ensure accountability at all levels and should have: a.A single individual with assigned responsibility for the cleaning of the physical facility. [B III] [modified 2018] b.Supervisors with responsibility for ensuring adherence to occupational health a nd i nfection prevention and control policies and protocols , including the correct use of personal protective equipment , maintaining a safe work environment , and ensuring adherence to cleaning schedules and protocols. [B III] [new 2018] 32.Audit and feedback results must be presented to the environmental service leadership of the health care facility and to the appropriate infection control and/or quality and safety committee (or equivalent). [A III] [new 2018] 33.Health care facilities must have written procedures for cleaning and disinfection of care areas and equipment that include : defined responsibility for specific items and areas routine and discharge/transfer cleaning cleaning in construction/renovation areas cleaning and disinfecting areas under Additional Prec autions outbreak management, and cleaning standards and frequency .

[ A III ] [modified 2018 ] 35.Health care facilities must provide initial and continuing education for environmentalservice workers. [A III ] [modified 2018 ] 3.1.1.1 Contracted Services Some health care facilities are using contracted out environmental services. If environmental services are contracted out, it is essential to ensure that infection control and occupational health -related priorities are clearly outlined in the contract.238- 241 Contract staff must work collaboratively with clinical staff, infection prevention and control, and occupational health and safety to ensure the safety of clients/patients/residents, staff and visitors; contractual barriers that prevent this from happening should be removed.242 If environmental services are contracted out, the following should be included in the legal agreement with the service provider/contracting agency:242 The service provider's responsibility for employee health and mandatory training should bespecified. 141 Th e occupational health and safety polices of the service provider must be consistent with the occupational health and safety policies of the health care facility as it relates to infectionprevention and control, immunization (including annual influenza immunization), access to staff health policies and measures related to Additional Precautions, response to and sharing o f PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 42 in formation related to work place ex posure incidents, and outbreak investigation and management (as required under the Communicable Disease Surveillance Protocols )243 It should be recognized that ever -changing activity levels and cleaning protocols w ill p otentially impact the cost of service. Contracts should support (without penalty or financial barrier) a proactive and cooperative environment to consistently implement appropriate cleaning measures. There should be clear expectations regarding cleaning frequency, adherence to cleaning standards, and the need for routine audit, feedback, and ongoing education to ensure consistent and effective cleaning occurs. Recommendation: 36.If environmental services are contracted out, the occupational health and safety policies of the contracting services must be consistent with the facility's occupational health and safety policies . [A III] [reviewed and not changed 2018] 3.1.1.2 Staffing Levels Adequately staffed environmental service departments are one of the most important factors that govern the success of environmental cleaning in a health care setting. 69,74,234,237,242, 244 Staffing levels must be appropriate to each department of the health care facility, with the ability to increase staffing in the event of outbreaks.242 Environmental service departments of Canadian acute care facilities are frequently under -resourced, potentially increasing the risk of health care -associated infections, antibiotic -resistant organism transmission, and outbreaks.245- 248 General staffing levels and human resource requirements may be estimated b y determining the average time required for environmental service workers to adequately perform daily and terminal cleaning of client/patient/resident rooms. A variety of approaches have been taken to estimate average cleaning times that include basing estimates on past experience, conducting time/motion studies, adding up the time required for a series of individual tasks, 249 or using industry standards250 or workload software. When estimating required staffing levels, it is essential to consider whether environmental service staff will have roles and responsibilities in addition to cleaning (e.g., patient transport, meal delivery, etc.) . Currently, the best method for determining average cleaning times, and therefore appropriate staffing levels, is unknown. There are few benchmarks available to use as guidance. 249, 251 One survey of environmental service managers at 50 Canadian acute care hospitals identified that cleaning times varied significantly based on cleaning type (i.e., daily clean, discharge/terminal clean), room type (i.e., private, semi- private, ward), and the need for isolation. 249 While this survey provides some preliminary data on room cleaning times at Canadian acute care hospitals, it is essential to recognize that there are numerous factors that must be considered when determining the appropriate staffing level for a specific health care setting or facility (see Factors to Consider When Determining Environmental Service Staffing Level ). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 43 F actors to Consider When Determining Environmental Service Staffing Level f acility type A cute care facilities, long term care facilities and specialized facilities will all have specific environmental cleaning needs and requirements. F acilities with specialized areas (e.g., operating and procedure rooms, dialysis units, burn units, intensive care units) will require increased environmental cleaning resources. bui lding factors A ge, design and size of facility (larger and older buildings are harder to clean). C limate and season. E xposure of facility to outside dust and soil, e.g., construction site. T ype of floors and walls. P resence of carpet and upholstered furnitur e. o ccupancy factors O ccupancy rate and volume of cases. P atient/resident mix and type of care in the area (e.g., acute care, long -term care, clinic) vs. no care in the area (e.g., public area). F requency of cleaning required in an area (e.g., once daily vs. after each case). S quare metres to be cleaned in patient care areas. S quare metres to be cleaned in nonpatient care areas. A dmissions, discharges, transfers by unit or area\u2014 more rapid turnover requires a shorte r turnaround time for rooms and equipment and more frequent discharge or transfer cleaning. i nfection control precautions P roportion of patients requiring Additional Precautions (due to time required to don or do ff personal protective equipment and additional cleaning requirements for some organisms). F requency of outbreaks. V RE and C. difficile rates as extra cleaning is required for both of these microorganisms. e quipment factors T ype of cleaning tools/equipment available (e.g., automated floor cleaner vs. mop and bucket). M ethodology required for cleaning (i.e., equipment, chemicals, materials and physical ergonomics). P lacement of custodial closets. t raining factors A mount and level of training given to new staff will influence supervisory staffing levels. S taff training and experience (inexperienced and under trained staff will work slower than well trained, experienced staff). le gislative requirements A mount of regulatory responsibility a supervisor may have.

W hether the role of the environmental service worker is limited to cleaning or expanded to include other roles or tasks (e.g., patient transportation, food delivery ). r ole of environmental service staff T asks assigned to environmental service workers. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 44 I t is also important to note that increased cleaning time alone is not necessarily associated with the thoroughness of cleaning.252 Written procedures and checklists, as well as routine audit and feedback, are essential to standardize cleaning and disinfection times and to ensure that no surfaces and items are missed during cleaning (See 9. Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality Control).158, 253- 258 Supervisory staffing levels must be appropriate to the number of staff involved in cleaning (e.g., one supervisor to 15 -20 workers in patient care areas of an acute care facility259). Supervisory staff has responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act229 to ensure staff training and compliance when using personal protective equipment. Supervisors are also responsible for training and auditing staff on cleaning procedures. Adequat e supervisory staffing levels will help ensure that these requirements are being met and, as increasingly complex auditing procedures are adopted, additional staffing may be required to ensure that audits are conducted and responded to appropriately (see 9. Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality Control ).260 When environmental service staffing levels are being reviewed, decisions to reduce staffing levels should never be made based on comparison with peer health care facilities with lower staffing levels independent of a complete assessment of these facilities rates of health care -associated infection, particularly those health care -associated infections known to be associated with environmental transmission (e.g. , C. difficile infection, vancomycin -resistant enterococci) ; and facility level factors that affect the resources needed fo r adequate environmental cleaning and disinfection (see Factors to Consider When Determining Environmental Service Staffing Level ). Conversely, facilities with high rates of environmentally associated health care -associated infections should review their environmental service program, and consider adopting strategies to increase the effectiven ess of environmental cleaning, including increasing staffing levels where low staffing levels may be contributing to inadequate cleaning and disinfection. 15,16,69,74,85,159,254, 256 Individual facilities w ill, therefore , need to consider all of these factors when determining staffing levels required for environmental services. Each health care setting is encouraged to perform their own time management studies to determine appropriate staffing levels for cle aning and supervisory staff, taking into consideration the factors discussed above. In some health care facilities, environmental service workers may be assigned other tasks. This needs to be taken into account when determining staffing level, as these tas ks takes away time available for cleaning duties and increase the risk of dropping environmental service tasks. 254, 261 For more information about calculating cleaning times and staffing levels, see the ISSA booklet, 612 Cleaning Times .250 R ecommendations: 37.Environmental service staffing levels must reflect the physical nature and the acuity of the facility as well as other factors that will impact en vironmental service workload.

[A III] [new 2018] 3.1.2 HEALTH CARE CLEANING PRACTICES 3.1.2.1 Approach to Cleaning for Clinical and Nonclinical Areas within the Health Care Setting In health care facilities, the approach to cleaning will vary depending upon the area to be cleaned. For nonclinical areas such as lobbies and administrative offices, a \"hotel clean\" is required. Clinical areas require a more thorough form of cleaning. A ll clinical areas require a \"health care clean\" in addition to a \"hotel clean\" (which is also still required ). Clinical areas include but are not limited to areas where clients/patients/residents receive care but also include patient waiting areas, areas for storage of medical equipment and supplies, medication preparation areas, and other areas involved in the provision of health care. A risk assessment should be performed by environmental services and infection prevention and control at all facilities to designate those areas requiring a \"health care clean\". This risk assessment could be integrated with an assessment of the required frequency of cleaning, as discussed in Section 3.2.4 below and as illustrated in Appendix 21 . Hotel clean is an approach to cleaning that requires removal of dirt and dust, waste disposal, and the cleaning of windows and surfaces. A hotel clean should result in a visually clean environment. The hotel component of a health care facility includes all areas not involved in client/patient/resident care. This includes public areas such as lobbies; offices; corridors; elevators and stairwells; and service areas. Areas designated as part of the hotel component are cleaned with a hotel clean regimen. Health care clean is an approach to cleaning that aims to reduce or eliminate microbial contamination within the environment . 5 A health care clean should result in the elimination of, or a significant reduction in, mic robial contamination of all surfaces and items within the environment, in addition to providing a visually clean environment. This requires, in addition to the performance of a hotel clean, an increased frequency and thoroughness of cleaning, as well as th e use of disinfectants. The health care component of a health care facility includes all areas involved in client/patient/resident care including all client/patient/resident wards or units and including nursing stations; procedure rooms; clinic and examina tion rooms; diagnostic and treatment areas; and washrooms*. Areas designated as part of the health care component are cleaned with a health care clean. *W ashrooms are considered part of the health care component even if located outside of care areas. See Components of Hotel Clean and Components of Health Care Clean for the components of a hotel and health care clean. The health care component of the health care setting should be the priority for environmental cleaning. Areas that require a health care clean should have different cleaning protocols and additional environmenta l service human resources that are sufficient to allow the more intensive and frequent cleaning (and monitoring of cleaning) required for these areas. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 46 A dditional cleaning practices are practices that go beyond those routinely required as part of a health care clean. Additional cleaning practices may be required for clients/patients/residents known or suspected to be colonized or infected with a specific organism (or clients/patients/residents with a specific clinical syndrome). Additional cleaning practices are often directed towards clients/residents/patient colonized or infected with organisms that can persist for a prolonged time within the care environment, and may be relatively resistant to standard disinfectants. Additional practices may differ between specific organisms. Refer to 11.1 Cleaning Rooms/Cubicles/Bed Space on Contact Precautions for special cleaning for specific microorganisms. Health care settings should ensure that the cleaning requirements for patients requiring Additional cleaning practices are clearly communicated to environmental services. Additional cleaning practices may also be required for microorganisms that pose an extreme risk to clients/ patients/residents, staff and visitors such as Ebola Virus Disease. Protocols for cleaning and disinfecting areas potentially contaminated with Ebola Virus Disease are described in the Public Health Ontario document Guidance for Patients with Suspect or Confirmed Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) in Acute Care Settings , and are beyond the scope of this guidance document.262- 264 In addition to the above, enhanced cleaning and disinfection is often requ ired during outbreaks of organisms when environmental contamination and subsequent transmission is known to be related to the type of organism suspected of causing the outbreak (e.g., norovirus, C. difficile ). Although causality has not been definitively e stablished, numerous reports describe enhanced environmental cleaning as a critical component of outbreak control measures for a variety of microorganisms. 69,74,234,265 Policies and procedures regarding staffing in environmental services should allow for surge capacity (i.e., additional staff, supervision, supplies, equipment) during outbreaks as determined by the outbreak manage ment committee. The outbreak management committee should include, among other departments, representation from environmental services who will lead the coordination of the environmental service department's activities. Additional cleaning in an outbreak ge nerally depends on the microorganism causing the outbreak. Refer to 11.1 Cleaning Rooms/Cubicles/Bed Space on Contact Precautions for special cleaning for specific microorganisms. Components of H otel Clean Floors and baseboards are free of stains, visible dust, spills and streaks.

Note: Frequency of health care clean is determined according to the Risk Stratification Matrix in Appendix 21: Risk Stratification Matrix to Determine Frequency of Cleaning 3.1.2.2 CLEANING AND DISINFECTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES All health care settings should have clearly defined cleaning policies and procedures that are reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Policies and procedures should ensure that: Cleaning is a continuous event in the health care set ting. Cleaning procedures incorporate the principles of infection prevention and control (see Section Two ). Cleaning standards, frequency and accountability for cleaning are clearly defined (i.e., whocleans, what do they clean and when do they clean it).

While this contamination is concentrated in the vicinity of the client/patient/resident and the areas used by the client/patient/resi dent (e.g., bed and bathroom for hospitalized patients), further spread of microorganisms occurs when the hands or gloves of staff become contaminated, either via direct contact with the client/patient/resident or through contact with the contaminated envi ronment. 45,58,59,61-63,275 Staff can then transfer these microorganisms to other items and surfaces within the client/patient/resident environment, and if appropriate hand hygiene is not performed, may carry these microorganisms to other clients/patients/residents, to other client/patient/resident's environments or to other areas of the health care environment (e.g., nursing station) (see Figure 1). Given the potential for surfaces and items to become contaminated with microorganisms, all areas, surfaces, and items within care areas of the health care setting require cleaning on a routine basis. 3.2.1 HIGH- AND LOW-TOUCH SURFACES Although any surface may become contaminated, the risk and extent of contamination is greater for surfaces and items that are handled frequently by the hands or gloves of staff or client/patient/residents as co mpared to surfaces that are less frequently handled or touched. 55,276,277 Thus, surfaces within the health care setting and in particular within the patient's environment can be classified as high - and low - touch surfaces, as follows: High -touch surfaces are those that have frequent contact with hands.276,278 Examples include (but are not limited to) doorknobs, elevator buttons, telephones, call bells, bedrails, light switches, toilet flushes, monitori ng equipment , IV infusion pump, end -of-bed table and the edges of the privacy curtains. The specific surfaces that should be considered high -touch will vary between health care settings.278- 282 Low -touch surfaces are those that have minimal contact with hands. Examples include (but are not limited to) floors, walls, ceilings, mirrors and window sills. Figure 3a and Figure 3b illustrate examples of items and sites that are high -touch and which may exhibit environmental contamination in health care settings. High- touch surfaces in care areas require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than minimal contact surfaces.244,276,280,283 Cleaning and disinfection should be performed at least daily and more frequently if the risk of environmental contamination is higher (e.g., intensive care units). Low -touch surfaces require cleaning on a regular basis, when soiling or spills occur, and when a client/patient/resident is discharged from the health care setting. 92 For many low -touch surfaces, cleaning may occur less frequently than once per day (e.g., every other day, weekly) as long as such surfaces are cleaned sooner if visibly soiled (e.g., client/patient/resident's mattress, in -room blood pressure cuff do not require daily cleaning but can be cleaned between clients/patients/residents and when soiled). PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 49 3.2.2 VULNERABILITY OF THE CLIENT/PATIENT/RESID ENT POPULATION Different populations of clients/patients/residents have differing susceptibility to infection. In some populations, such as bone marrow transplant or burn patients, susceptibility to infection is very high and lower levels of environmental contamination are more likely to result in clinically significant infection than in o ther, lower risk populations. Areas where vulnerable patients at risk for acquiring illness due to environmental microorganisms are cared for should receive more frequent environmental cleaning. In general, such areas include wards or units housing highly immunocompromised patients, and areas where patients frequently undergo invasive procedures, or both. Examples of such areas include: transplantation wards neonatal intensive care units burn units chemotherapy units dialysis units procedure and operating r ooms Other care areas and patient populations are considered \"less susceptible\". Routine regular cleaning and disinfection is still essential for these areas and populations but at a lower frequency than what is required for high -risk populations. 3.2.3 PROBABILITY OF CONTAMI NATION OF ITEMS AND SURFACES IN THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT The probability that a surface, piece of equipment or care area will be contaminated is also related to the types of activities occurring within the care area. Areas can be div ided into those that are (likely to be) heavily, moderately or lightly contaminated, as follows: Heavy -contamination area. Areas should be considered heavily contaminated if surfaces or equipment are regularly exposed to significant amounts of blood or other body fluids (e.g., birthing suite, autopsy suite, cardiac catheterization laboratory, burn unit, hemodialysis unit, emergency department, bathrooms of patients with diarrhea or incontinent). Moderate- contamination area. Areas should be considered modera tely contaminated if surfaces or equipment are regularly contaminated with blood or body fluids (e.g., patient/resident rooms, bathrooms of continent patients) and the blood or body fluids are contained or rapidly removed (e.g., wet sheets). All client/res ident/patient rooms and all bathrooms should be considered moderately contaminated. Light -contamination area. Areas can be considered lightly contaminated or not contaminated if surfaces are not exposed to blood or body fluids or items that have come in co ntact with blood or body fluids (e.g., lounges, libraries, offices). Note: Regardless of the anticipated level of contamination for a given area or the frequency of routine cleaning and disinfection, if blood or body fluid spills or contamination occurs (e .g., vomitus in elevator, blood spill), the area must be cleaned and disinfected immediately (see 12. Cleaning Spills of Blood and Body Substances .) PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 50 3.2.4 DETERMINING REQUIRED FREQUENCY OF CLEANING Surfaces and items at higher risk of transmitting microorganisms within the care setting should be cleaned and disinfected more frequently. When determining the appropriate frequency of cleaning and disinfection, the following principles apply: High- touch surfaces and items require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than low -touch surfaces and items. Surfaces and items in proximity to vulnerable client/patient/resident populations require morefrequent cleaning and disinfection than surfaces and items in proximity to less vulnerable client/patients/resident populations. Heavily contaminated surfaces, items and equipment require more frequent cleaning thanmoderately contaminated surfaces, items an d equipment, which in turn require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than lightly contaminated or noncontaminated surfaces,items and equipment. Using these criteria, each area or department in a health care setting can be evaluated and assigned a risk score for cleaning purposes, as illustrated in Appendix 21 . The score obtained will relate to a specific level of routine cleaning frequency. As the activity or vulnerability of clients/patients/residents in an area changes, the risk score will change as well, impacting on the cleaning frequency. Recommendation: 41.Cleaning schedules must be developed based on an assessment of the risk of contaminate d s urfaces resulting in infection in patients/residents/clients and staff [ A II] [modified 2018] 3.3 Equipment This document addresses the cleaning and disinfection of noncritical equipment and devices that only come into contact with intact client/patient/resident's skin or the environment. For guidance on the appropriate cleaning and reprocessing of semi- critical and critical equipment, see PIDAC'S Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings19 for cleaning all other types of equipment. Noncritical medical equipment that is within the client/patient/resident's environment and used between clients/patients/residents (e.g., imaging equipment, electronic monitoring equipment, commode chairs) requires cleaning and disinfection after each use.277, 279, 284- 290 Selection of new equipment must include considerations related to effective cleaning and disinfection (See 1.2.1 Selection of Surfaces, Finishes, Furnishings and Equipment for Areas Where Client/Patient/Resident Care is Delivered ). A system should be in place to clearly identify equipment which has been cleaned and disinfected. Refer to Appendix 8 for a sample cleaning chart for noncritical medical equipment and other items. The health care setting should have written policies and procedures for the appropriate cleaning and disinfection of equipment that clearly define the frequency and level of cleaning and assign responsibility for cleaning.

Environmental service workers shall be included in facility policies of staff immunization,219 and must be offered appropriate immunizations b ased on the Ontario Hospital Association/Ontario Medical Association's Communicable Diseases Surveillance Protocols and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations for health care providers.219,229,306- 309 Currently, immunizations appropriate for environmental service workers and other staff working in health care settings include: PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 57 an nual influenza vaccine310 h epatitis B vaccine (due to risk of sharp s injury)315 ac ellular pertussis vaccine.316 C ontracts with supplying agencies should include the above immunizations for contracted staff. 5.2 Personal Protective Equipment See 2.1.2 Personal Protective Equipment for more information. 5.3 Staff Exposures There shall be written policies and procedures for the evaluation of staf f (employees or contract workers), including environmental service workers, who may be exposed to blood or body fluids and other infectious hazards.295 Examples of these policies and procedures include: A sharps injury prevention program.31,218,219 A program or mechanism for timely post -exposure follow -up and prophylaxis. 31,295,296,315 A respiratory protection program if staff will be entering airborne infection isolation rooms and a mechanism for following up with personnel who have been exposed to tuberculosis.218, 221 A policy to ensure reporting of exposures and occupationally acquired infections to both infection prevention and control and occupational health and safety.295 F or more information about programs for managing staff exposures, refer to PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings .7 5.4 Work Restrictions All health care settings must establish a clear expectation that staff members do not come into work when acutely ill with a probable infection (e.g., fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, conjunct ivitis, severe cough) and support this expectation with appropriate attendance management policies.31,218,304, 305 Staff members carrying on activities in a health care setting who develop a communicable disease may be subject to work restrictions. 243 5.5 Other Considerations 5.5.1 CHEMICAL SAFETY Environmental service workers have potential exposures to chemicals and, in some circumstances, may develop symptoms related to these exposures. 297,298,317- 319 Exposures occur most commonly via inhalation (respiratory) or direct skin contact .145 Chemicals can function as irritants [ e.g., products containing sodium PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 58 h ypochlorite (bleach), ammonia (can be found in glass cleaners) , improved hydrogen peroxide , quaternary ammonium compounds, ethanolamine (can be found in floor care products, glass and bathroom cleaners), glycol ethers (can be found in general purpose cleaners and floor care product ), phenols] or sensit izers [(e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds, ethanolamine (can be found in floor care products, glass and bathroom cleaners )] and can result in respiratory symptoms or dermatitis.144, 145,222 Cleaning agents acting as irritants may exacerbate symptoms of underlying asthma.320 Over time, without adequate controls, a sensitizer may cause asthma or chronic bronchitis.151,317,321 Respiratory symptoms increase in direct proportion to increased exposure time and higher concentrations of certain chemicals, such as bleach and ammonia.317 Certain tasks, such as cleaning of toilet bowls, mirrors, sinks, and counter, as well as floor finishing tasks, regularly expose individuals to high concentrations of volatile organic compounds.145 Irritants in health care settings associated with skin symptoms (irritant contact dermatitis) include water, soaps and detergents, most frequently in those who have underlying atopic dermatitis (allergy, eczema). Symptoms (dryness, cracking, eczema) are usually worsened during winter months. A smaller number of people will develop allergic contact dermatitis where a particular allergen can cause an inflammatory response, usually hours to days later, which clinically may appear similar to irritant contact dermatitis. It is important th at any health care provider who has a significant allergic, asthmatic, or dermatitis history, or who develops symptoms that may be related to work exposures, be assessed by occupational health and safety. 322 Exposure to workplace chemicals may be reduced through the use of engineering controls (e.g., good ventilation, improved design of containers and delivery systems 320), administrative controls (e.g., development and maintenance of polic ies for the safe use of disinfectants, education and training), and the use of personal protective equipment (e.g., proper glove choice when handling chemicals, use of facial protection to prevent inhalation of vapours and splashes of chemicals to the eyes ). Caution should be taken when cleaning and disinfection is performed in small and/or poorly ventilated spaces to reduce the risk of irritation to exposed skin and respiratory tract, and to ensure that exposure limits are not exceeded. Facilities should p eriodically conduct an occupational hazards assessment with respect to cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and equipment. The assessment should evaluate risks, and ensure that the safest cleaning agents, equipment and processes are selected; that appropr iate training and access to personal protective equipment are in place; and that staff are aware of protocols to be followed in the event of accidents, exposures or injuries. 318 The use of automated dispensing systems or ready -to-use products is preferred over manual dilution and mixing, as automated systems reduce direct personal contact with concentrated products and reduce inhalation of volatile organic compounds from concentrated products. Automated systems also ensure that correct dilution ratios are obtained and eliminate the need for decanting. Applications o f cleaning chemicals by aerosol or trigger sprays may cause eye injuries or induce or compound respiratory problems or illness and must not be used. 141, 144,222,317, 323- 331 Do not apply cleaning chemicals by aerosol or trigger sprays. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 59 C hemicals must be stored and handled appropriately.229 Health care settings shall have in place written policies and procedur es in accordance with the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) . All cleaning staff shall receive WHMIS training8,294 and know the location of the safety data sheet for each of the cleaning and disinfecting agents they use. Safety data sheet documentation shall be available as required by Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS). R.R.O. 199 0, Reg. 860. . Where appropriate, eyewash stations shall be available and accessible.80,220 More information on WHMIS is available from Health Canada . 5.5.2 ERGONOMIC CONSIDERAT IONS Environmental service workers are at risk of injury due to ergonomic hazards. Repetitive movements, awkward work postures, heavy lifting, and application of high force s (e.g., when scrubbing) can lead to injury and are exacerbated by poorly designed or inappropriately sized cleaning equipment, lack of training in appropriate cleaning techniques, prolonged tasks and/or insufficient rest periods. 299,332-336 Selection of cleaning equipment must follow ergonomic principles.337- 339 Products that are lighter in weight, easily emptied and having proper handle length help reduce the risk of injury. Additionally, a variety of handle lengths should be available to ensure that differently sized cleaning sta ff have access to appropriate ergonomically designed equipment. 222 For more information about ergonomic design related to environmental cleaning, visit the Public Services Health & Safety Association website. Recommendations: 50.Environmental service workers must be offered appropriate immunizations. [A II] [reviewed and not changed 2018 ] 51.There shall be policies and procedures in place that include a sharps injury preventio n pr ogram , post -exposure prophylaxis and follow -up, and a respiratory protection program for staff who may be required to enter an airborne infection isolation room accommodating a patient with tuberculosis.

Cleaning in construction areas and in response to floods is also addressed. 6.1 Soiled (Dirty) and Clean Utility/Supply Rooms It is an essential environmental cleaning principle that clean and soiled (i.e. , dirty, used) supplies and equipment should be clearly separated.80 Each client/patient/resident care area should be equipped with a room dedicated as a soiled utility room that may be used to clean soiled patient/resident equipment that is not sent for central reprocessing (e.g., IV poles, commode chairs).340 A separate room shall be dedicated to the storage of clean supplies and equipment.80 A soiled utility room is used for temporary storage of supplies and equipment that will be removed for cleanin g, reprocessing or destruction, 80 for the disposal of small amounts of liquid human waste,341 and for rinsing and gross cleaning of medical instruments.81 Soiled utility rooms should: Be physically separate from other areas, including c lean supply/ storage areas.80,81 S hould have a hands -free door, as long as this is not a risk to clients/patients/re sidents. Have a work counter and flushing-rim clinical sink (i.e., hopper) with a hot and cold mixing faucet.81 Sprayers attached to the hop per shall NOT be used.80 H ave a dedicated hand washing sink with both hot and cold running water.80,81,219 A separate utility sink is also required if the soiled utility room will be used for rinsing or remov al o f gross soiling of medical instruments or equipment.341 H ave adequate space to permit the use of equipment required for the disposal of waste.80 H ave personal protective equipment available to protect staff during cleaning and disinfecting procedures.80,341 B e adequately sized within the unit and located near the point -of-care.80,81,341 I f a soiled utility room is used only for temporary holding of soiled materials, the work counter and clinical sink is not required; however, facilities for cleaning bedpans must be provided elsewhere.81 Soiled utility rooms/workrooms should not be use d to store unused equipment.80 A clean utility/supply room for storing sterile supplies and equipment should: Be separate from and have no direct connection with soiled workrooms or soiled holding areas.80,81 Be able to keep supplies free from dust and moisture, and stored off the floor.80 Be adjacent to usage areas and easily available to staff.80 B e equipped with a work counter and dedicated hand washing sink if used for preparing patient care items.81,341 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 61 6.2 Care and Storage of Supplies and Equipment for Environmental Cleaning 6.2.1 C LEANING EQUIPMENT Cleaning equipment itself requires careful and regular cleaning and disinfection to avoid inadvertent cross -transmission of microorganisms during subsequent use. Tool s and equipment used for cleaning and disinfection must be cleaned and dried between uses (e.g., mops, buckets, rags). Cleaning tools and equipment used in a room or bed spac e on Additional Precautions must be cleaned and disinfected after use before being used in another room or bed space . Mop heads should be laundered daily. All washed mop heads must be dried thoroughlybefore storage. Cleaning equipment shall be well maintained, clean and in good repair. 6.2.2 STORAGE OF CLEANING SUPPLIES All chemical cleaning agents and disinfectants should be appropriately labelled and stored in a manner that eliminates exposure, inhalation, skin contact or personal injury. Chemicals shall be clearly labelled in accordance with Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS). R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 860 , and a safety data sheet shall be readily available for each item in case of accidents.8,80 Equipment used to clean toilets (e.g., toilet brushes, toilet swabs) should not be carried from room -to- room. If feasible, the toilet brush may remain in the patient's bathroom for the duration o f the patient's stay; if not, consideration should be given to using disposable toilet swabs. Toilet cleaning and disinfecting equipment should be discarded when the patient/resident leaves or sooner if required. In multi -bed rooms, a system should be deve loped for replacement of toilet brushes on a regular basis or as required. When choosing a tool for cleaning toilets, consideration should be given to equipment that will minimize splashing. 6.2.2.1 Housekeeping Closet It is essential that equipment and su pplies for environmental cleaning be appropriately and safely used, transported, maintained, and cleaned. To facilitate this, facilities shall have a sufficient number of rooms that are dedicated to the storage of cleaning equipment and supplies required f or daily cleaning (housekeeping closets) and are located conveniently throughout the facility.80,340,341 These rooms are used for the storage , preparation and disposal of cleaning supplies and equipment,80,341 and are distinct from the clean utility/supply rooms described in 6.1 Soiled (Dirty) and Clean Utility/Supply Rooms . Facilities may also have centralized housekeeping rooms for storing bulky cleaning equipment and large volume of supplies for distribution to local areas.80,341 At a minimum, there shall be at least one housekeeping closet in all major care areas.80,340 In addition, housekeeping closets: Must be dedicated for use as a cleaning supply ro om where cleaning solution i s prepared, and dirty cleaning solution is disposed ; and must not be used for other purposes.80,341 S hall be maintained in accordance with good hygiene practices.219 S hall have a dedicated hand washing sink with hot and cold running wate r.80 S hall have access to an eyewash station .80,220 S hall have appropriate personal protective equipment available, including safety eyewear.217, 219 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 62 S hall have a hot and cold water supply and a floor sink.80,340 S hall be well ventilated80 and illuminated. Shall be designed to be at negative pressure in relation to surrounding areas.342 S hall be easily accessible in relation to the area it serves.80,81,340 S hall be secure with access restricted to clinical and support staff.80,340 S hall be appropriately sized to the amount of materials, equipment, machinery and chemicals stored in the room/closet80,81,340 and allow for proper ergonomic movement within the room/closet. Shall not contain personal belonging, food or beverages .219 S hall have chemical storage that ensures chemicals are not damaged and may be safely accessed. Should be free from clutter to facilitate cleaning.343 S hould be ergonomically designed so that, whenever possible, buckets can be emptied withou t lift ing them.80 6.2.2.2 Cleaning Carts Cleaning carts: Should have a separation between clean and soiled items. Should never contain personal clothing or grooming supplies, food or beverages.219 S hould be thoroughly cleaned at the end of the day. Shall be equipped with a locked compartment for storage of hazardous substances and each cart shall be locked at all times when not attended, and stored, when not in use, within a locked housekeeping closet.80,270,340 6.3 Cleaning Food Preparation Areas This best practices document does not address environmental cleaning required for facility kitche ns, cafeterias, commercial food premises or any area where food is prepared or stored (e.g., unit kitchens). Facilities should have policies and procedures that address the cleaning of food preparation areas that follow the requirements of the Health Protection and Promotion Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.H.7 and Food Premises. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 562 . 6.4 Cleaning in Areas of Active Construction Construction activities generate dust and contaminants that may pose a risk to clients/patients/ residents, staff o r visitors in all health care settings. Infection prevention and control must assess construction and maintenance projects during planning, work, and after completion to verify that infection prevention and control recommendations are followed throughout t he process. 31,86 Where required, work must be performed under appropriately controlled conditions. Infection prevention and control and occupational health and safety have the authority to halt projects if there is a safety risk. 31 Cleaning is of particular importance both during construction and after c ompletion of the construction project. What is considered to be clean may be interpreted differently by contractors and hospital/ health care staff: PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 63 \" Construction clean\" is the level of cleaning performed by construction workers to remove gross soil, dust and dirt, construction materials and workplace hazard s within the construction zone (Components of Construction Clean ).5 This should be done as frequen tly as is necessary to avoid accumulation of dust and dispersion of dust to other areas of the facility, and at least daily. \"Hotel clean\" (Components of Hotel Clean in Areas of Active Construction ) and \"hea lth care clean\" (Components of Health Care Clean in Areas of Active Construction ) begin where th e construction site ends, i.e., outside the hoarding (see Glossary ), and are generally done by the staff of the health care setting (see 3.1.2 Health Care Cleaning Practices for more information about hotel clean and health care clean). It is important that there is good liaison between the contractor, environmental services, infection prevention and control, and occupational health and safety.

Until confirmed as a clean water source, all staff should assume that the water is contaminated. Immediate contamination may occur if the source of water harbours pathogenic bacteria (e.g., sewer or toilet overflow). Regardless of the water source, the area will need to be cordoned off until cleaning and disinfection are completed. Persistent moisture following floods can lead to mould growth on plaster, drywall, carpeting and furnishings . 124 Drywall that remains wet after 48 hours shall be removed and replaced.86 Wet carpets, if present, must be dried completely within 48 hours as the risk of mould growth increases substantially after that point.86 If moisture persists beyond 48 hours, carpeting in a car e area must be removed and should not be replaced with carpeting (see 1.2.1.4 Carpeting ).86 If the flooding involves a food preparation area, all food products that have come into contact with water must be discarded and the public health unit notified. Public health units must also be notified if vaccine refrigerators are involved in a flood or if flooding leads to a prolonged power outage that compromises food or vaccine refrigeration. Food service areas cannot re -open until the flood is controlled, the area has been cleaned, disinfected, and approval for food preparation has been obtained from public health units .

Environmental microorganisms are the most frequently implicated, including Bacillus cereus and enviro nmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus , Zygomycetes) and recently reported fungal outbreaks have resulted in severe infection and death in immune -compromised patients.346- 349 An outbreak of C. difficile was also linked to inappropriate cleaning of mop heads.350 Such outbreaks have been caused by errors in the washing process, contamination during post -cleaning transportation and inappropriate storage conditions.347 In addition to outbreaks affecting patients, exposure of staff to harmful microorganisms can occur if soiled linens are not handled appropriately. In most staff exposures, failure to use appropriate personal protective equipment and/or inappropriate sorting of linens resulting in aerosolization contributed to the transmission of microorganisms.351- 353 Policies and procedures should address the collection, transport, handling, washing and drying of soiled linen, including protection of staff.304 Published laundry regulations must be followed if the facility does its own laundry. See the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 . including Health Care and Residential Facilities , O. Reg. 67/93 for legal requirements relating to laundry. See General , O. Reg. 79/10 for legal requirements related to laundry services in long -term care homes. See CSA Group's Z314.10.2 -15 Laundering, maintenance, and preparation of multiple -use gowns, drapes, and wrappers for health care settings and laundries . 7.1.1 LAUNDRY A REA Laundry facilities (including health care settings that do their own laundry) must have policies that will ensure that: 3,92 The laundry area is in a dedicated space.304 S taff members do not consume food or beverages in laundry areas.219 F loors and walls are made of durable materials that can withstand the rigors of the laundry area (i.e., water/steam resistant).304 T he soiled linen area shall be separate from other areas and be at negative pressure relat ive to surrounding areas.92,304,342 H and hygiene facilities shall be located in all laundry work areas.3,80,92,304 L aundry equipment is used and maintained according to manufacturers' instructions.92,304, 322 T here is an established procedure to determine when laundry should be sorted in the laundry facility (i.e., before or after washing).92 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 69 7.1.2 SOILED LINEN All linen that is soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions should be handled using the s ame precautions, regardless of source or health care setting:3,92,218,304,354 Remove gross soil (e.g., faeces) with a gloved hand and dispose into toilet or hopper. Excrement shall not be removed by spraying with water.3,80 Bag or otherwise contain soiled laundry at the point -of-care.3,92 Do not sort or pre -rinse soiled laundry in care areas.3,92,347 Bag personal laundry/ items (e.g., in long -term care) sep arately at the point of collection, or have it laundered by family members.

Water -soluble bags and double -bagging are not necessary and are not recommended .3,356,357 L aundry carts or hampers used to collect or transport soiled linen need not be covered unless otherwise required by regulation.3,92,304 C ontainers (including carts, bags, and plastic bins) for collecting, storing, or transporting soiled linen shall be waterproof, leak -proof, nonporous, and in good repair, and shall be decontaminated after use.304 In addition, carts shall be cleaned and disinfected before being used to transport clean or sterile linen.304 L inen bags shall be tied securely and not be over -filled.3 Reusable linen bags shall be laundered before re -use.304 L aundry chutes should not be used. 304 If their use is unavoidable, ensure that they are properly designed, maintained, cleaned, disinfected ,304 and used in a manner that minimizes dispersion of aerosols from contaminated laundry:92,218 Ensure that laundry bags are secur ely bagged and tightly closed before placing the filled bag into the chute.3,92 Do not place loose items in the chute.92 Laundry chutes should be maintained under negative pressure and discharge into the soiledlinen collection area. 92 Laundry chutes should be cleaned on a regular basis.3,304 R outine practices for handling and laundering are sufficient, regardless of the source of the linen. Speci al handling of linen for clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions is not routinely required.92,218,358 C hange personal protective equipment when it becomes wet or soiled; remove personal protective equipment upon leaving the soiled sorting area.304 D o not hold laundry bag close to the body to avoid potential risk of injuries due to sharps. 7.1.3 WASHING AND DRYING L AUNDRY Patient/resident laundry should be done as a separate cycle from environmental cleaning items such as cloths and mop heads. Cloth linen bags should washed after each use3,304 and can be washed in the same cycle as the linen contained in them.3 Laundered items should be taken out of the washer as soon as feasible to reduce the risk of contaminating the washer and formation of biofilm.92,347 There should be posted instructions on washing and drying patient/resident laundry.3,92 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 70 T he effectiveness of the laundering process in rendering the laundered items hygienically clean * depends on the following factors and their interactions:304 time and temperature mechanical action chemicals used water quality, including pH level, hardness rinsing requirements volume of the load nature and extent of soiling in the items to be laundered model of washers and dryers Health care facilities shall take into consideration the recommendations of the manufacturers of the washer and dryer, materials to be laundered, and the detergent used when settin g their laundry formula.304, 359 Using a disinfectant (such as bleach) may not offer additional advantage when soiling is at low levels.347 However, a disinfectant can be used to enhance the overall disinfection of the laundry process when there is heavy soiling of the items to be laundered, or when resettling of microorganisms in the wash or rinse water onto the laundered items is a concern.347 *H ygienically clean is defined by the American National standards Institute (ANSI)/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) as being \"free of pathogens in sufficient numbers to cause human illness\" .360 7.1.4 CLEAN LINEN Clean laundry should be sorted, packaged, transported and stored in a manner that prevents inadvertent handling, contamination by dust or debris, and contact with soiled linens or other soiled or contaminat ed items during sorting, packaging, transport and storage. 3,218, 304,347 Each client/patient/resident floor should have a designated area (e.g., dedicated closet, clean supply room) for sorting and storing clean linen. If a closed cart system is used, storage of clean linen carts in an alcove is permitted if it is out of the path of normal traffic and under staff control. 80,81 7.1.5 LAUNDRY STAFF PROTEC TION Protectio n of staff in laundry areas includes:3 Training for all health care providers and laundry staff in the procedures for handling of soiledlinen that includes infection prevention and control and WHMIS training.

[B III] [modified 2018] 7.2 Management of Biomedical Waste and Disposal of Sharps In order to allow for proper treatment and disposal of waste and to optimize waste diversion, waste shall be segregated at the point of generation into the following categories and should not be mixed:296 biomedical pharmaceutical chemical radioactive general, and recyclable Biomedical waste is contaminated, infectious waste from a health care setting that requires treatment prior to disposal in landfill sites, sanitary sewer systems, or incineration. It is estimated that about 60 % of the waste generated by a health care facility is general (nonhazardous) waste, about one -third of the waste is recyclable (including compost), and biomedical was te constitutes only about 7 % of all waste.361 Biomedical waste includes:2 Human anatomical waste. Human and animal cultures or specimens (excluding urine and faeces). Human liquid blood and blood products Items contaminated with blood or blood products that would release liquid or semi -liquid blood if compressed. Body fluids visibly contaminated with blood. Body fluids removed in the course of surgery, treatment or for diagnosis (excluding urineand faeces). Sharps that have come into contact with blood or body fluids. Broken glass which has come into contact with blood or body fluid. Cytotoxic waste. Live or attenuated vaccines. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 72 W ritten policies and procedures for the management of waste from health care settings should be developed based on provincial and municipal legislations2,8 and relevant standards,296 and should address issues such as the collection, storage, transport, handling and disposal of waste. Responsibility for waste management shall be clearly defined,296 with a commitment to sustainability by reducing the amount of waste generated through waste segregation and diversion (reusing and recycling).296, 361, 362 This will reduce the amount of waste categorized as biomedical and subsequently going for incineration or land d isposal. 7.2.1 COLLECTION OF BIOMED ICAL WASTE Waste shall be collected in containers that can withstand the weight of the waste within without tearing, cracking or breaking. In addition, they should be appropriate for the nature of the waste being collecte d (e.g., leak -proof for wet wastes), and be of appropriate size to allow for safe transport within the facility.296 To prevent spillage and to protect the safety of waste handlers, waste containers should not be overfilled.296 Legislation dictates that biomedical waste be handled and disposed of in a manner that avoids transmission of potential infections:2,3,92,219,229, 363 Biomedical waste (excluding sharps waste) destined for incineration shall be placed in leak proof single use biomedical waste containers , which may be rigid plastic containers or cardboard containers that are sealed and lined with a leak proof plastic bag that can be securely tied.2 Re- usable containers are not appropriate for biomedical waste destined for incineration.2 Bio medical waste destined to landfill sites may be placed into leak proof single -use or reusable biomedical waste containers. Reusable containers shall be puncture resistant , cleanable, and disinfected after use.2 S harps waste (including cytotoxic sharps waste) may be put in single -use or re -usable containers that are resistant to puncture and leakage.2 Single -use containers should have a lid that cannot be removed after the container is sealed; re -usable containers should have a lid that is locked when the container is full.2 Bio medical waste should be segregated according to the categories listed in Table 4: Disposal Streams for Biomedical and General Waste .2,3,296 Placing regular waste that does not require special handling into containers designated for biomedical waste will result in increased costs and may incur penalties from collection agencies.

Provincial regulations for specific storage requirements shall be followed.2,219 Health care facilities shall have a contingency plan for dealing with the storage of refrigerated waste in the event of:296 excess waste production the on -site cold storage unit or treatment equipment becoming inoperative other disruption of disposal services 7.3.2 TRANSPORT OF WASTE All waste should be transported within the health care setting incorporating the following procedures: There are clearly defined transport routes for waste. Manual handling of waste is minimized.296 W aste transport routes avoid crossing through clean zones, public areas o r c lient/patient/resident care units.296 A dedicated elevator is assigned for the transport of waste. If a dedicated elevator is not available, waste should not be transported at the same time as clients/patients/residents, foodserving carts or clean/sterile instruments/supplies/linen. Waste is transported in leak -proof carts which are cleaned on a regular basis. 296 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 76 A ll external transportation of infectious waste must comply with Transport Canada's Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992 (S.C. 1992, c. 34) and Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulation (SOR/2001 -286) ,267 and the Environmental Protection Act , R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 19 , Part V.2 Waste must be transported by a certified waste hauler who provides a certificate of approval.2 In general, where the primary biomedical waste container is a sharps container or a rigid container with a nonremovable lid, additional packaging or containment of the waste is not necessary for off- site transportation. Where the primary container is a plastic bag, the bag shall be placed into a rigid, leak -proof outer container for transportation off- site.374 For details on the classification, packaging, documentation and training requirements for shipping infectious substances, see Transport Canada's Transportation of Dangerous Goods Bulletin: Shipping Infectious Substances . 7.3.3 PROTECTION OF STAFF HANDLING WASTE A dedicated hand wash ing sink must be available to waste handlers.80,296 It is strongly recommended that non -immunized waste handlers be offered immunization against hepatitis B3,296 and tetanus.296 Health care facilities shall provide, and waste handlers shall wear, personal protective equipment appropriate for the risk of the tasks when handling waste. 3,217,296 Environmental service workers who clean reusable waste containers, carts, final storage areas, or biomedical waste treatment equipment also shall wear personal protective equipment appropriate for the tasks. Depending on the task and type of waste, examples of protective equipment may include: Gloves to protect from exposure (e.g., nitrile for exposure to blood, body fluids, chemicals ; and puncture -resistant gloves for exposure to sharps ).375 C overalls or aprons.375 F acial protection, e.g., face shield.375 P rotective footwear to protect against sharps.296, 375 R ecommendations: 71.There shall be written policies and procedures for the collection, handling, storage, transport and disposal of biomedical waste, including sharps, based on provincial and municipal regulations and legislation.

In this chapter, the use of antimicrobial surfaces within the health care setting and the use of \"no -touch\" disinfection systems are discussed. 8.2 New and Evolving Technologies 8.2.1 ANTIMICROBIAL SURFAC ES Contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious microorganisms is common in health care settings.14,376 Microorganisms have also been shown to persist on surfaces even after routine cleaning and to re -accumulate rapidly following cleaning.14,16 Replacing materials traditionally used in the health care setting (e.g., plastic, stainless steel) with materials with antimicrobial properties or treating surfaces with coatings that have persistent antimicrobial activity is a potential solution to this problem.377,378 Candidate antimicrobial surfaces and coatings supported by data from nonclinical settings include copper, 379- 385 silver,386- 388 stainless steel coated with titanium dioxide,389 glass coated with xerogel,390 and surfaces sprayed with surfacine391 or organosilane.392, 393 With the exception of copper, there is very limited evidence that any of these approaches persistently reduce microbial contamination in clinical settings and no evidence that they reduce the incidence of health care -associated infection. There is now evidence from multiple studies demonstrating that copper surfaces used in acute and long-term care settings reduce overall bacterial burden (e.g., total colony forming units per item or area). 379, 381- 385,394, 395 In a systematic review conducted by P HO,24 these studies demonstrated a modest but consistent (~ 1 log 10) reduction in bacterial load on copper surf aces as compared to standard surfaces.381- 385 Additionally, one study using copper oxide impregnated linens demonstrated a 24% reduction in health care -associated infection in a chronic care ward,385 and another study demonstrated a 44% reduction in health care -associated infection in the acute care setting among patients admitted to a room containing six copper items as compare to patients admitted to a room with noncopper items. 380 Although these studies show promise, both were at high risk of bias.24 There is, therefore, insufficient evidence to recommend for or against t he use of copper surfaces or copper impregnated linens in the health care setting, and facilities should weigh the cost, functionality, the limitation of copper (See Table 6) against its known antimicrobial properties, and low quality evidence suggesting it may impact infection rates when considering the use of copper surfaces or linens. See CSA Group's EXP06 -2015 Evaluating Emerging Materials and Technologies for Infectio n Prevention and Control for more information on assessing antimicrobial surface s.396 There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the installation of copper surfaces. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 79 8.2.2 NO-TOUCH DISINFECTION S YSTEMS Environmental surfaces in the health care setting are frequently contaminated with clinically relevant pathogens and these pathogens often persist despite routine cleaning and disinfection.397 No-touch disinfection systems are systems that use chemical disinfectants or physical agents to d isinfect surfaces and which do not require that the active agent is directly applied to and removed from the surface manually. The most studied no -touch disinfection systems include the use of hydrogen peroxide mist or vapour76,85,398- 415 or the use of ultraviolet light77,254,406,416- 421 to disinfect surfaces. A variety of other no - touch technologies have also been described (e.g., high -intensity, narrow -spect rum steam vapour433, 434). In all cases, these technologies were designed as a supplement to, and not as a replacement for, routine cleaning and disinfection by environmental service workers.16,397, 435 These technologies, the evidence for their use, are considered individually below. 8.2.2.1 Disinfection Using Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour or Mist Systems that produce hydrogen peroxide for surface disinfection include: (a) hydrogen peroxide vapour at 30% to 35% generated by heat, and (b) aerosolized hydrogen peroxide at 5% to 6% generated by pressure or ultrasonic nebulization.435 Hydrogen peroxide systems are effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and spores, particularly those of C. difficile .376, 397 Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to water and oxygen. The vapour or mist is typically delivered by a computer -controlled distribution system that ensures even distribution throughout the room wh ile monitoring gas concentration, temperature and relative humidity. Once decontamination is complete, an aeration unit in the room converts the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The complete decontamination process takes an average of three to five hours. Hydrogen peroxide vapour systems have several limitations, including health and safety risk to patients and staff present when the system is operating, 16 erosion of some plastic and polymer surfaces after repeated exposure,16 and reduced efficacy where organic materials are not removed prior to using the system.16 In addition, different materials (e.g., linen, soft furnishings) may also affect the efficacy of these systems.436 To achieve optimal disinfection effect, these systems also need to be positioned properly,16 and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system must be shut off during while these systems are operating.397 The time required to complete a cycle of disinfection using some hydrogen peroxide vapour systems may take more than four times longer than the time required for manual environmental cleaning. 437 (See Table 5 for a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen peroxide vapour systems.) There is evidence from multiple studies that hydrogen peroxide vapour reduces the level of bacterial contamination on surfaces following routine cleaning and disinfection. 76,85,398, 399,401,402,404, 406- 415 It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of this effect, as sampling methodology and microbio logical outcomes measured varied widely between studies. However, the majority of studies demonstrate that routine cleaning and disinfection, followed by hydrogen peroxide vapour disinfection, reduces levels of bacterial contamination when compared to routine cleaning and disinfection alone. Additionally, there are a number of studies evaluating the impact of hydrogen peroxide vapour on health care -associated infections and/or antibiotic -resistant organism transmission, most commonly in the context of outbreak PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 80 m anagement.76,400,402- 405,409- 411 In the five studies evaluating hydrogen peroxide vapour in the outbreak setting, three used hydrogen peroxide vapour as a one -time treatment of an entire ward,405, 409, 410 two additional studies did the same thing but then continued using hydrogen peroxide vapour for discharge cleaning of rooms occupied by patients with antibiotic -resistant organisms on an ongoing basis.402, 411 All studies showed a reduction in their specific antibiotic -resistant organism; however interpretation of these studies is difficult as the reduced antibiotic -resistant organism infection rate could be attributed to regression to the mean (i.e., rates were unusually high before the use of hydrogen peroxide vapour systems started, so it was likely that rates would have fallen even without using hydrogen peroxide vapour), or to the use of co -interventi ons in most of these studies. Four studies evaluated hydrogen peroxide vapour in the non -outbreak setting using before -after study designs.76,400,403, 404 In these studies, hydrogen peroxide vapour was use d for discharge cleaning for patients with one or more antibiotic - resistant organisms (or C. difficile ). All studies demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic -resistant organism transmission rate either overall (3 studies) or in patients admitted to a room pr eviously occupied by a patient colonized with the antibiotic -resistant organism of interest. In one study comparing the microbicidal efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour with ultraviolet light disinfection, hydrogen peroxide vapour was found to be signific antly more effective in reducing bacterial contamination on surfaces in patient rooms, and was significantly more effective against spores.406 In a study by French et al,415 isolation rooms contaminated with MRSA were decontaminated more effectively with hydrogen peroxide vapour than with rout ine cleaning measures. The vapour was particularly effective for decontaminating complex furniture and equipment that was difficult to clean manually. Similar to the studies of antimicrobial surfaces, studies of hydrogen peroxide vapour disinfection show the potential for this technology to prevent antibiotic -resistant organism transmission, but all were at high risk of bias. There is, therefore, not sufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of hydrogen peroxide vapour in the health ca re setting as a supplement to routine cleaning. Facilities should weight the cost and limitations of hydrogen peroxide vapour (see Table 5 ) against its established ability to reduce bacterial contamination on surfaces as well as some low quality evidence that it may be effective in terminating outbreaks, limiting antibiotic -resistant organism transmission, and preventing C. difficile infection. Hydrogen peroxide vapour may be most useful for facilities with a high incidence of and/or frequent outbreaks secondary to antibiotic -resistant organisms or C. difficile . However, such fac ilities should ensure that they have sufficient, trained environmental service workers, have assessed the feasibility of using this technology in their practice setting, and have implemented appropriate infection control measures before deploying these tec hnologies. 8.2.2.2 Disinfection Using Ultraviolet Light Ultraviolet light at wavelengths of 200 to 320 nm can kill microorganisms by destroying bonds in genetic materials. 16 The wavelength of ultraviolet- C light lies between 200 to 270 nm,436 and has been used in the health care setting to destroy airborne organisms or inactivate microorganisms on surfaces.154 Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by ultraviolet light than are bacterial spores. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 81 T he germicidal effectiveness of ultraviolet light is influenced by:154, 438 amount and type of organic matter present wavelength of ultraviolet light air mixing and air velocity temperature and relative humidity exposure time type of microorganisms present ultraviolet light intensity, which is affected by distance , angle of incidence , and cleanliness o f l amp tubes If ultraviolet light is used in a health care setting, warning signs should be posted in the affected area to alert staff, clients/patients/residents and visitors of the hazard. A schedule for replacing ultraviolet lamps should be developed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Ultraviolet light intensity should be regularly monitored.439 (See Table 5 for a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of ultraviolet light disinfection systems.) Pre-cleaning of visibly soiled surfaces is necessary before ultraviolet light disinfection, as ultraviolet light is absorbed by organic materials and its ability to penetrate is low.421 There is evidence from multiple studies that ultraviolet light disinfection reduces the level of bacterial contamination on surfaces following routine cleaning and disinfection. 254, 406, 417- 421,440,441 As with the studies of hydrogen peroxide vapour, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of this effect due to variations in how the intervention was implemented (type of ultraviolet device, number of devices, amount of ultraviolet light, room size and shape), sampling methodology and microbiological outcomes. However, the majority of studies demonstrate that routine cleaning and disinfection, followed by ultraviolet disinfection, reduces levels of bacterial contamination when compared to routine cleaning and disinfection alone. There are also seven studies that evaluated the impact of ultraviolet light on antibiotic -resistant organisms or health care -associated infection outcomes. 77,416,441- 445 All are uncontrolled before -after studies. A strength of these studies is that they were not conducted during outbreaks. Six of the seven studies reported a reduction in antibiotic -resistant organism or health care -associated infection incidence, ranging from 20% to 57%.77,416,441,442,444, 445 These studies show the potential for this technology to prevent antibiotic -resistant organism transmission under non -outbreak conditions, but all were at high risk of bias related to their study design. There is, therefore, not sufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ultraviolet light disinfection in health care setting as a supplement to routine cleani ng. Facilities should weight the cost and limitations of ultraviolet light disinfection systems (see Table 6 ) against its established ability to reduc e bacterial contamination on surfaces and some evidence that it may be effective in limiting antibiotic -resistant organism transmission or preventing health care -associated infections. Ultraviolet light may be most useful for facilities with moderate to high incidence of antibiotic -resistant organisms or C. difficile infection that already have an appropriately resourced environmental service department. See CSA Group's EXP06 -2015 Evaluating Emerging Materials and Technologies for Infectio n Prevention and Control for more information on assessing no -touch disinfection systems.396 There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of hydrogen peroxide vapour or ultraviolet disinfection technologies for room or ward disinfection following manual cleaning and disinfection.

Examples include fogging with formaldehyde,92 ethylene mist;427 steam disinfection; and high -intensity narrow spectrum light.422- 424 There are few studies evaluating these technologies but no studies use antibiotic -resistant organisms or health care -associated infections as outcomes. For some of these technologies, there are significant concerns about toxicity and safety (e.g., ozone,448 fogging with formaldehyde3 or ethylene oxide3). While interest remains in developing new technologies for disinfection within the health care environment, the use o f any of these technologies for environmental disinfection is not recommended until evidence confirming their effectiveness and safety in clinical environments is available.

[A III] [reviewed and not changed 2018 ] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 84 9.Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality Control 9.1 Overview of Approaches used to Monitor Cleaning and Cleanliness The responsibility for ensuring that cleaning of the environment in a health care facility is performed according to best practices and facility policy belongs to all staff involved in environmental cleaning, from the front -line environmental service workers, to supervisors, managers and directors. Facility administration is also responsible for ensuring that a safe and sanitary health care environment is maintained.16 To ensure that this goal is met, a quality control program that includes regular assessments of cleaning and cleanliness is required. 158, 253- 257,293, 449,450 In addition, health care facilities should develop and maintain appropriate environmental cleaning policies and procedures, as well as hire and maintain sufficient numbers of trained and educated environmental service workers. 15-17,158,159,253, 254, 291 Measures of cleaning and cleanliness can facilitate the following: training environmental service workers (see 4. Education ) standardizing cleaning procedures ensuring that cleaning is performed consistently assessing the adequacy of resource dedicated for environmental cleaning (see 3.1.1 Organization and Required Resources for Effective Environmental Cleaning ) improving the efficacy of cleaning There are currently a wide variety of approaches that can be used to monitor cleanliness in the health care environment. Each approach addresses different aspects of cleaning and each has strengths and weaknesses. To obtain the maximum benefit from any of the approaches described in this chapter, tool s used to monitor cleanliness must be standardized, applied on a regular basis, and implemented cooperatively as a partnership between the environmental service department and infection prevention and control. 35,256 Results should be used for education and training and to provide both positive and constructive feedback to front -line environmental service workers.141,451 Additionally, aggregate results should be presented r egularly to environmental service leadership, infection prevention and control, and the facilities administrative leadership.141 An overview of approaches to monitoring cleaning and cleanliness is provided in Table 7 and Table 8 . In general, facilities should incorporate several of these methods as they have different advantages and disadvantages. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 85 9.2 Assessing Cleaning and Cleanliness using Observational Methods Table 7: Observational Methods Used to Monitor Cleaning and Cleanliness in Health Care Facilities Method Description Advantages Disadvantages Visual assessment 376, 452Trained observer (e.g., environmental service supervisor) assesses cleanliness of an area following cleaning Easy to implement376 Useful to assess whether a \"hotel clean \" has been obtained Allows feedback to individual environment al service staffResults do not correla te with levels of microb ial contamination376 Does not assure that a \"health care clean\" has been achieved452 Results may vary across different observers376 Performance observation 230, 376Environmental service supervisor observes environmental service workers perform cleaning Easy to implement376 Useful to assess that facility procedures fo r cleaning are performed correctly376 Allows feedback to environmental service staffTime consuming Labour intensive230 Performance while observed may not be th e same as performance when not observed376 Satisfaction surveys 453 Patients/residents/clients complete surveys and provide feedback on the facilities' cleanliness Useful to ensure needs of client/ patient/resident are metResults may not correla te with levels of microb ial contamination453 9.2.1 VISUAL ASSESSMENT OF CLEANLINESS In the past, visual assessment has been the primary approach to measure cleanliness and it remains an important approach to ensure that an adequate \" hotel clean \" is achieved.141,454- 456 Ensuring that the physical environment is uncluttered and appears clean is valued by patients/residents/clients and staff and is an important goal. However, although visibly clean surfaces are free of obvious visual soil they may remain contaminated with microorganisms, organic materials or chemical residues. 6,454,457-459 When conducting visual assessments, a standardized approach and checklist is important to ensure consistency. Results can be reported as the proportion of items or surfaces inspected that were \"clean\", out of the total number of items/surfaces assessed. If the same group of items or surfaces are tested repeatedly, the results of visual assessments can be used as a quality indicator for environmental cleaning, as long as the limitations of this approach are understood. 9.2.2 PERFORMANCE OBSERVAT ION Performance observation involves trained observers, often environmental service supervisors, watching environmental service workers perform routine cleaning tasks. Performance observation is important to PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 86 en sure that environmental service workers are approp riately educated and trained, and are able to follow the correct cleaning procedure. It promotes staff engagement, and is an opportunity for direct feedback from supervisors and for front -line staff to ask questions or clarify procedures and protocols. Disadvantages of performance observation are that it is labour intensive, it may be difficult to standardize or measure, and the observed environmental service worker may perform differently when observed than they do during routine unobserved cleaning. Perfo rmance observation is an important tool for quality assurance in environmental services. To maximize the benefit of performance observation, the observer should be trained, observation should be conducted on a regular basis to ensure consistency of perform ance over time,230 and feedback or required re -training should be provided to the observed environmental servic e worker in a constructive and timely manner.15,460 9.2.3 CLIENT/ PATIENT/RESIDENT SATISFACTION SURVEYS The results of satisfaction surveys provide information on how patients/residents/clients perceive the cleanliness of the environment of the health care facility. As with visual assessment, these perceptions may not correlate with the level of microbial or chemical contamination, and may not provide an adequate measure of the efficacy of environmental cleaning.453 However, as providing the best possible care for patients/residents/clients is the primary goal of health care, it is important to respond to problems identified on these surveys, particul arly if the same problem is noted on multiple surveys. Satisfaction surveys are not sufficient to ensure that an effective \" health care clean \" has been obtained.461 If surveys are used, it is important to ask questions that are clear, understandable and relevant to patients /residents/clients. The response to questions should be measured in a standardized manner (e.g., use of \"yes\" or \"no\" questions is preferred to free text answers in most cases). The survey should be delivered in a standardized manner (e.g., survey all pati ents/residents/clients from the same unit during the same two -week period each year) and there should be a benchmark for comparison -most often based on the results of previous surveys. 9.3 Post Cleaning Testing of Surfaces Currently there are several approaches that can be used to assess the efficacy of cleaning through testing of surfaces after cleaning is completed. Different approaches assess different aspects of cleaning including cleaning thoroughness (i.e., environmental marking), removal of organic materials (i.e., adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence) or removal of microorganisms (i.e., environmental culturing). An overview of these approaches is provided in Table 8 . Table 8: Assessment of Cleaning Through Testing of Surfaces Following Cleaning Method Description Advantages Disadvantages Environmental marking 462 Prior to cleaning, environmental surfaces are marked with an invisible tracing agent that can only be seen using a revealing agent. Allows direct assessmen t of cleaning thoroughness (i.e., proportion o f surfaces actually cleaned) Allows assessment o f which high - and low -Does not directly measure microbial contamination Does not measure quality or intensity of cleaning (i.e., a single wipe w ill PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 87 Method Description Advantages Disadvantages After cleaning, a trained observer can check to determine if the tracing agent was removed from the surfaces during cleaning.

Following cleaning, a trained observer can assess the marked surfaces using a detecting agent (e.g., PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 88 u ltraviolet light, enzymatic detector) that allows visualization of the tracing agent to determine whether they were cleaned. When environmental marking programs are initially implemented, it is immediately recognized that many high -touch surfaces within the p atient environment are missed during cleaning.55,254,255,469- 471 Identification of surfaces omitted during cleaning provides an important learning and feedback opportunity. Importantly, feedback of the results of environmental marking audit to environmental service staff, supervisors and managers typically leads to rapid improvement472- 475 and may reduce infection rates .71,255,451 Additionally, in many cases specific reasons that surfaces were missed can be identified through discussion with environmental services \u2014for ex ample in some cases environmental service workers were not aware that they were responsible for cleaning a specific surface or item, were not aware that a specific surface or item required cleaning, or were afraid of damaging the surface or item.475, 476 Clarification of the cleaning requirements for missed items therefore can lead to prompt improvements that would not occur without environmental marking. If environmental marking is performed, it should be done in a standardized manner. The specific surfaces or items to be mar ked should be determined, assessments should be made on a regular basis by a trained observer, 477 environmental service staff should be unaware which rooms or areas are being marked, and regular positive and constructive feedback should be provided. Development of a quality indicator can be done as follows: Identify 15 specific surfaces or items to be marked each time cleaning is assessed. After cleaning is completed, determine the number of surfaces where the marker was removed(\"cleaned\") and the number of surfaces where the marker is still present (\"missed\").

If used in a negative or punitive manner, or implemented secretively, this could lead to misleading results as there are several ways that environmental service staff could manipu late the results \u2014for example the marking is not completely invisible and/or ultraviolet lights are easy to obtain and environmental service workers could achieve high scores not by improving the thoroughness of routine cleaning, but by deliberate cleaning of the marked surfaces only. At the same time as it is important to make environmental service programs aware of the audit program in advance, it is also important that environmental service workers are not aware of when individual rooms will be marked to minimize the risk that they focus inappropriately on removal of the marks only in these circumstances. Finally, although it is not possible to mark all relevant surfaces, it may be useful to add or remove specific marked targets over time to ensure that st aff are truly cleaning all room surfaces every time. Example 2: Calculating Overall Cleaning Rates for Specific Items or Surfaces Using the data in Figure 4: T he overall cleaning rate for toilet seat in the last 10 months is calculated as follow: N umber of audits with \"clean\" result = 4 Num ber of audits conducted = 10 O verall cleaning rate = T he overall cleaning rate for bedrail in the last 10 months is calculated as follow: N umber of audits with \"clean\" result = 9 Num ber of audits conducted = 10 O verall cleaning rate = 40% 100% 10 9 = \u00d7 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 90 S ee Public Health Ontario's Sample Audit Tool for Routine Cleaning of P atient Rooms 9.3.2 ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHA TE BIOLUMINESCENCE Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a substance present in all living cells and some organic materials, including food, body fluids.465 The presence of ATP on a surface indicates that organic material remains on the surface \u2014thus while the absence of ATP suggests that there is little microbial contamination of a surface, the presence of ATP could represent either microbial (viable and dead) contamination or other organic material. 15,465,478 ATP bioluminescence is a system for swabbing surfaces to measure the level of ATP present, which is a surrogate for microbial contamination. ATP testing can, therefore, provide rapid feedback on the level of organic contamination of surfaces as a measure of cleaning thoroughness and intensity. 479 Similar to environmental marking, ATP bioluminescence can be used systematically and regularly for training and education, to provide immediate feedback to environmental service workers, or as a quality indicator for cleaning. 478, 480- 483 Also, similar to environmental marking, an audit and feedback program based on ATP bioluminescence should be developed in a collaborative manner with environmental services. There are limitations to ATP bioluminescence, however. Some products and surfaces can interfere with the test results by quenching the A steel485, roughness of surface texture485); or the ATP readings (microfibre,468 laundry acid,463 In some studies, ATP levels do not correlate closely to measures of microbial contamination193, 198,459,486 and there are few studies demonstrating a reduction in infection rates with implementation of ATP bioluminescence monitoring. 256 Furthermore, appropriate benchmarks for \"safe\" post -cleaning ATP levels from different surfaces or environments are not fully established16,481, 487, 488 although some have recommended or proposed benchmarks ranging from 100 to 500 relative light units, depending on the clinical setting. 16,457,478,479 In addition, performa nce of different ATP bioluminescence systems var ies in their reliability and accuracy. When selecting a system for auditing environmental cleanliness, health care facilities should consider the following aspects: 489 Sensitivity \u2014the system is able to detect the smallest amount of contamination. Linearity \u2014the amount of contamination is proportional to the level of relative light units reported by the system. Repeatability \u2014the system gives the same result when the same surface is tested multiple times by the same person. Accuracy \u2014the system is able to detect all available ATP on a surface. Precision \u2014the results are consistent and as close to the true value as possible. Shelf life \u2014th e test kit is stable at room temperature for a practical period of time. 9.3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CULTUR E Routine environmental cultures of environmental surfaces in health care facilities may be performed by swabbing or using contact agar plates.460 Culturing is the only direct measurement of levels of microbial contamination after cleaning. Culturing by swabbing is commonly used to indicate the presence of specific PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 91 b acteria on a surface. On the other hand, contact agar plates are often used to quantify the level of bacterial contamination on an area of a large, flat surface.460 However, such cultures are costly, the turnaround time for results is slow, and they may not be a cost -effective form of monitoring.376 Additionally, there is no accepted standard of how such cultures should be performed or interpreted.488,490 Some methods attempt to quantitate total bacterial burden in terms of colony -forming units per area478,491 while others use qualitative or quantitative methods to identify the presence of, or levels of, a specific pathogen [e.g., methicillin- resistant general, environmental cultures should not be used as a routinely performed quality assessment method for environmental cleaning due to their cost and delay in obtaining results, although they may be important for establishing the relationship between other interventions (e.g., ATP bioluminescence, environmental marking) and environmental culture results in the research setting. However, environmental cultures may be useful for investigating transmission events or outbreaks.141, 492 9.4 Monitoring Cleaning and Cleanliness in the Health Care Setting \u2014Putting It All Together There are now an increas ing number of tools that can be used to assess cleaning and cleanliness in the health care setting, as discussed above. These approaches will only be useful when adopted in a standardized manner and with the cooperation of the environmental service department and environmental service workers.141 As different tools measure different aspects of environmental cleaning, it is appropriate and recommended to use several of these tool s.471,478, 486,493-495 Health care facilities should use most or all of the observational tool s (i.e., visual assessment of cleanliness, performance observation and feedback, satisfactio n surveys) combined with at least one measure of surface cleaning (e.g., environmental marking or ATP bioluminescence) on a routine basis. Although this approach may not be feasible in outpatient settings and office practices, the same quality control principles apply. For clinical office settings that are part of a larger health care organization, observational methods to assess cleaning and cleanliness should be strongly considered for use, and the periodic use of a measure of surfaces cleaning may also be beneficial, particularly in areas that are higher risk due to their patient population or because of the types of interventions and procedures that are performed. Free-standing clinical office practices should use observational methods to assess the efficacy of cleaning (see 9.2 Assessing Cleaning and Cleanliness using Observational Methods ). Recommendations: 76.There must be a process in place to measure the quality of cleaning in the health care setting. [A III ] [modified 2018 ] 77.Health care facilities should use at least one measure that directly assesses cleaning (i.e.,environmental marking, ATP bioluminescence), in addition to observational assessments (e.g., performance observation, visual assessment ). [B III ] [modified 2018 ] 78.Results of cleaning audits should be used for the purposes of training and to provide positiveand constructive feedback to frontline environmental service workers . [B III ] [modified 2018 ] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 92 7 9.Aggregate results must be presented to relevant stakeholders, e.g., environmental servic e l eadership, infection prevention and control, and administration. [ A III] [new 2018] PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 93 Section Two: Clea ning and Disinfection Practices for All Health Care Settings PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 94 10.Health Care Cleaning and Disinfection Practices This chapter, and the remaining chapters in Se ction Two, provide s detailed practical guidance on cleaning and disinfection in the health care setting. This chapter focuses on the cleaning of client/patient/ resident rooms (including rooms used for patients in isolation), health care surfaces, and noncritical equipment. Subsequent chapters address cleaning and disinfection of rooms used for patients on Additional Precautions ( Cleaning and Disinfection When Patients/Residents Are on Additional Precautions ), and cleaning of blood or chemical spills ( 12. Cleaning Spills of Blood and Body Substances ). The goal of cleaning is to provide a safe, functional and aesthetic environment for the client/patient/resident. The key objectives of cleaning efforts are to keep surfaces visibly clean and uncluttered, 256 to prevent infection transmission by removing or inactivating microorganisms from surfaces and items within the care environment, and to clean up spills promptly. Cleaning procedures must be applied regularly, consistently and correctly to prevent the accumulation of soil, dust and debris that can harbour and support the growt h of microorganisms and to avoid transmitting microorganisms from one item or surface to another.15,156,245, 455,496 Effective cleaning strategies must, therefore, incorporate the principles of infection prevention and control into the development and determination of cleaning methodology and cleaning frequency. 10.1 General Cleaning Practices As described in 3.1.2.1 Approach to Cleaning for Care and Noncare Areas Within the Health Care Setting , health care settings are comprised of noncare areas requiring a hotel clean and care areas where a health care clean is required. This section focuses on the appropriate approach to health care cleaning for client/patient/resident rooms and other care areas. It is a fundamental principle that microorganisms can only be successfully removed and/or inactivated if dirt and debris are completely removed. To achieve the removal o f dirt and debris, the application of friction (i.e., elbow grease) is critical. Surfaces must be cleaned of visible soil before being disinfected, as organic material may inactivate a disinfectant. General practices to be followed in all health care setti ngs for all cleaning are listed in Appendix 1 . More specific sample protocols for cleaning and disinfection for different environments or indications are provided in Section Four . 10.2 Cleaning Methods 10.2.1 PATIENT/RESIDENT ENVIRONMENT CLEANING 10.2.1.1 Daily Routine Cleaning of Patient/Resident Room or Bed Space The health care clean of patient/resident rooms should follow a standard, methodical format that includes each of the following elements: PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 95 a ssessment Determine if the health status of the patient/resident may pose a challenge to safe cleaning (e.g. , patient agitated or acutely deteriorating); notify the clinical team and defer cleaning if c oncerns are identified. Determine if the patient/resident is/was o n Additional Precautions and whether addition al p ersonal protective equipment and/or special cleaning/disinfection procedures are required. Walk through the room to determine what needs to be replaced (e.g., toilet paper, papertowel, soap, alcohol -based hand rub, gloves, sharps container) and whether any special materials or equipment are required for cleaning \u2014this may be done before or during the cleaning process . preparation Gather all supplies and equipment required for room cleaning before starting . Routine Pract ices and Additional Precautions Perform hand hygiene before entering the room or bed space (for multi- bed rooms) .* Put on additional personal protective equipment if required to avoid exposure to blood o r b ody fluids or if indicated by Additional Precautions signage . Remove gloves and other personal protective equipment and then perfo rm ha nd hygiene upon room exit .* cleaning and disinfection As much as is possible, work from clean to dirty (to avoid moving dirt and microorganisms from dirty areas to cleaner areas) and from high to low (to avoid having dirt o r m icroorganisms drip down and re -contaminate areas already cleaned) . waste disposal Collect and remove waste from the room. resupply room Replace required clean supplies; avoid overstocking. *Ha nd hygiene is required every time the room or bed space is re -entered and every time upon leaving the room or bed space. If gloves or other personal protective equipment are worn, they must also be removed every time you leave the room or bed space, and new personal protective equipment must be put on when re -entering the room or bed space. See Appendix 4 for a sample procedure for routine daily cleaning of a patient/resident room and Appendix 5 for cleaning of the patient/resident bathroom. In -room bathrooms should be cleaned last, after completing room cleaning, based on the principle of cleaning from clean to dirty. 10.2.1.2 Discharge/Transfer Patient/Resident Room Cleaning When a patient/resident is discharged, transferred or dies, the room or bed space must be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly before the next patient/resident occupies the space to prevent the transfer of microorganisms to the new client/patient/resident. Cleaning and disinfection upon discharge includes several steps not required during routine daily cleaning (see 10.2.1.1 Daily Routine Cleaning of Patient/Resident Room or Bed Space ) and requires the close cooperation of clinical staff and cleaners. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 96 I n general, clinical staff are responsible for: Removing or discarding medical supplies. Removing or discarding medical equipment, including oxygen therapy equipment. Emptying items containing blood or body fluids and removing items or equipment potentially contaminated with blood or body fluids (e.g., discarding IV bags and tubing and urinary catheter collect ion bag, emptying bedpans/commodes/urinals/washbasins, emptying suction bottles). Disposal of personal articles left by the patient/resident including toiletries (e.g., soap, creams, razors, toothbrushes, comb, books, magazines, toys). These items can tran smit microorganisms to other clients/patients/residents and must be taken with the client/resident/patient ondischarge/transfer or discarded. Once these tasks are completed, cleaners can then conduct a discharge/transfer clean of the room, following the s teps outlined in Appendix 6 . 10.2.1.3 Scheduled Patient/Resident Room Cleaning In addition to the daily and discharge/transfer cleanings of patient/resident rooms, there are other cleaning tasks that should be scheduled to occur on a regular basis within the patient/resident room, including: high dusting (see below) in room clean baseboard and corners removal and laundering privacy curtains clean window curtains/ coverings dust window blinds All of these activities should be scheduled on a regular basis. In all cases, cleaning should be performed immediately if contamination or gross soil is identified and sufficiently frequently to maintain a clean, dirt and dust free environment. The appropriate frequency for changing privacy curtains (or other solutions that minimize the need for laundering privacy curtains) is discussed in 1.2.1.3 Cloth and Soft Furnishi ngs in Health Care Settings . For the other tasks listed, facilities should determine the minimum frequency required to maintain a clean, dirt and dust free environment. As a minimum, high dusting and baseboard cleaning should occur weekly; window blinds should be dusted monthly; and window curtains and coverings should be cleaned at least annually. These are minimum frequencies and more frequent cleaning may be required to maintain appropriate levels of cleanliness. Refer to Appendix 8 for more information . High dusting involves dusting all horizontal surfaces and fixtures above shoulder h eight, including vents. When performing high dusting: Dust when the patient/resident is out of the room to minimize exposure to spores. Minimize dissemination of dust by using HEPA -filtered vacuums and/or damp mop/dusters. Proceed in an organized direction, to avoid missing any areas (e.g., clockwise). Note and report stained or misplaced ceiling tiles, fixtures or walls, so that they can be replacedor repaired. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 97 10.2.2 BATHROOM CLEANING Bathrooms within the patient/resident room should be cleaned last, after completing room cleaning, following the principle of cleaning from clean to dirty. Shower walls should be thoroughly scrubbed at least weekly. Shower curtains should be changed at least monthly and as required. Bathrooms for patients in a private roo m should be cleaned daily, at the time of routine daily room cleaning. For shared bathrooms in semi- private or ward rooms, daily cleaning of the bathroom is a minimum and consideration should be given to twice daily cleaning, particularly for ward rooms ho using more than two patients/residents. Additional, immediate cleaning is required when there are spills or gross contamination of room surfaces is identified. See Appendix 5 for a sample procedure for cleaning patient/resident bathrooms. Emergency room/urgent care centre bathrooms are located in high traffic areas and are used frequently by ill patients who may contaminate the environment with microorganisms including enteric viruses such as norovirus, and C. difficile . 497- 500 Emergency room bathrooms: Should be cleaned a nd disinfected every four hours. For bathrooms with infrequent usage, cleaning may take place less frequently. Must be disi nfected with a sporicidal agent .154, 498, 501 M ust be frequently inspected, and re -cleaned whenever necessary (e.g., during high usage times, outbreaks, or when visibly soiled). Must be cleaned more freq uently based on identified need . Bathrooms may be located outside of care areas (e.g., public washroom). However, because bathrooms are at high risk of microbial contamination, they still require a health care clean. Bathrooms require a health care clean regimen. 10.2.3 FLOOR CLEANING Floors in health care settings may be comprised of a number of materials, depending on the location of the flooring and the client/patient/resident populatio n in the vicinity. It is important to review the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning a particular type of flooring before developing cleaning protocols. See 1.2.1 Selection of Surfaces, Finishes, Furnishings an d Equipment for Areas Where Client/Patient/Resident Care is Delivered for information about floor finishes and carpeting in health care. 10.2.3.1 Floor Care Floor cleaning consists of dry dust mopping to remove dust and debris, followed by wet mopping with a de tergent to clean. Floors are low- touch surfaces that rarely come in contact with the hands of patients/ residents or health care providers; under normal circumstances, the use of a disinfectant is not required. 152, 502- 505 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 98 D ry mopping is done to collect dust and debris from the floor to prepare it for wet mopping. Dry mopping may be done with microfibre mops or pads to reduce dispersal of dust and debris. A fresh mop pad should be used for each room. Wet mopping can be done using a bucket and loop mop, or with a microfibre mop . For sample procedures for mopping, s ee; Appendix 9: Sample Procedure for Mopping Floors Using Dry Dust Mop Appendix 10: Sample Procedure for Mopping Floors Using Wet Loop Mop and Bucket Appendix 11: Sample Procedure for Mopping Floors Using a Microfibre Mop 10.2.3.2 Carpet Care Carpeting should not be used within the care areas of health care facilities. For facilities that have not yet removed all carpeting from care areas, there should be a plan for permanent removal of carpeting. In the meantime, a rigorous program of carpet care is required and that should include: daily vacuuming with a HEPA -filtered vacuum cleaner scheduled extraction/shampooing rapid response for dealing with spills of blood, body fluids or other liquid See 1.2.1.4 Carpeting for general information about carpeting in health care settings. 10.2.4 EQUIPMENT AND SPECIA LIZED ITEM CLEANING 10.2.4.1 Noncritical Medical Equipment Noncritical medical equipment in health care settings should be cleaned with a detergent or a low -level one-step cleaner/disinfectant, depending on the type of equipment. The manufacturer's recommended contac t time for the product being used must be closely followed.16,85,158,159 Refer to Appendix 8 for more information . 10.2.4.2 Electronic Equipment Electronic equipment in the health care setting includes infusion pumps, ventilators, patient -controlled analgesia pumps, telemetry receivers and transmitters, infusion fluid warmers, infant sensors, monitoring equipment, and keyboards. Increasingly, electronic equipment used in health care settings also includes mobile phones, tablets, laptops and a variety of items that may be purchased by the facility or may be owned by staff. Inappropriate use of liquids on electronic medical equipment may result in fires and other damage, equipment malfunctions and health care provider burns. Equipment malfunctions could result in life -threatening events to patients such as over -infusion of medications and loss of life -supporting interventions. 506 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 99 W hen selecting electronic equipment, it is important that it be compatible with the cleaning and disinfecting agents used in the health care setting and that manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning are followed (See 1.2.2.3 Electronic Equipment for details). To avoid hazards: Obtain the manufacturer's labelling which may include instructions for cleaning and disinfection; information may be available on the manufacturer's website. Review labelling for any cautions, precautions, or warnings about wetting, immersing, or soakingthe equipment. Review the manufacturer's cleaning and maintenance instructions and ensure all staff who w ill b e cleaning the item are trained. Protect equipment from contamination whenever possible: Position equipment to avoid contact with anticipated spatter. Avoid laying contaminated items on unprotected equipment surfaces. Use barriers on equipment surfaces that you expect to touch with contaminated hands orwhen contact with spatter cannot be avoided (e.g., keyboard skins). If equipment is contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material, follow theequipment manufacturer's directions for cleaning to remove as much soil as possible; it may be necessary to remove the equipment from service for thorough cleaning and disinfection. Electronic equipment that cannot be adequately cleaned, disinfected or covered should not enter the immediate care environment. Plastic coverings may be an effective means to protect keyboards and other devices from contamination, but must be cleaned and maintained appropriately (see 1.2.2.2 Plastic Coverings ). In addition, no -touc h disinfection systems may offer a means for disinfecting electronic devices but efficacy of this approach has not yet been widely validated .507- 510 Electronic equipment should be cleaned on a regular basis, depending upon its use and the risk for patient -to-patient transmission of microorganisms, as follows: Electronic equipment that goes from client/resident/patient to client/resident/patient withinthe care environment must be cleaned and disinfected between patients (e.g., tablet used by ICU patients for communication). Electronic equipment used within the client/patient/resident's environment by staff (e.g., work station on wheels) should be cleaned and disinfected by the user before entry into the client/ patient/resident's environment and after removal from the client/patient/resident's environment. Electronic equipment that is handled by staff in the care areas outside of the client/patient/resident environment (e.g., keyboard at the nursing station) should be cleaned and disinfected on a routine basis (e.g., daily, twice daily). Electronic equipment used within the client/patient/resident's environment that is difficult toclean and disinfect should be covered with a clean plastic covering before entry into th e c lient/patient/resident 's environment and the cover should be cleaned and disinfected, or discarded, upon removal from the client/patient/resident 's environment. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 100 If you cannot clean or cover an electronic item, do not bring it into the care environment. These recommendations apply not only to products purchased by the health care facility (e.g., ICU monitors, workstations on wheels), but to electronic equipment owned by health care providers (e. g., mobile phones, laptop computers) if these devices will be handled by clients/patients/residents or used by the health care provider when in the immediate care environment. 10.2.4.3 Ice Machines Bacteria have been isolated from ice, ice -storage chests a nd ice -making machines.366,511- 515 Microorganisms in ice can contaminate clinical specimens and medical solutions that require ice for transport or holding. 366 Ice may become contaminated if the water source for the ice is contaminated and from contaminated hands touching the ice.511, 512 To minimize contamination, ice machines that di spense ice directly into a container are recommended.366 Ice machines requiring scoops are not recommended and should be replaced. If older machines have not yet been replaced: Provide a scoop for disp ensing the ice.366 D o not store the ice scoop loose in the ice machine. Provide a holder for the ice scoop. Ice scoop should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day and more often if necessary. Ice machines and ice chests should be cleaned at least quarterly, including cleaning, de -scaling and disinfection. Clean ice machines following the manufacturer's instructions. See Appendix 12 for more information . 10.2.4.4 Playrooms/Toys Toys can be a reservoir for microorganisms that can be present in saliva, respiratory secretions, faeces or other body substances. 516- 520 Outbreaks associated with toys have been described.44,521,522 Transmission of influenza and other respir atory pathogens may occur in pediatric waiting rooms and contamination of toys with insufficient cleaning and disinfection may contribute to this problem.523 Playrooms or play areas that are used by more than one child should have an area for segregation of used toys (e.g., a bin into which children/parents/staff can place used toys). Clean toys should be stored in a manner that prevents contamination (e.g., dust and water splatter) and shou ld be clearly marked as clean. Toy storage boxes/cupboards should be emptied and cleaned weekly or when visibly soiled. 524 Toys must :524 be smooth, nonporous and able to withstand rigorous mechanical cleaning not retain water (e.g., bath toys) have parts that can be cleaned not be cleaned with phenolics PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 101 Al l toys should be cleaned and disinfected between users. Rinsing after disinfection may be required for some disinfectants. If a toy cannot be cleaned (e.g., plush toys), it should be dedicated to an individual patient and be sent home or discarded when the patient is discharged. Toys, books, magazines and puzzles should be dedicated to children on Additional Precautions and discarded afterwards or sent home with the child if the article cannot be cleaned. Responsibility for cleaning toys should be assigned and written procedures regarding frequency and methods of cleaning are required. Toys should be removed from general waiting rooms if an adequate process cannot be established to ensure their daily inspection, cleaning and disi nfection. Staff assigned to clean toys must be trained in effective cleaning procedures. The procedure for cleaning toys must include: 524 Inspection for damage, cracked or broken parts. Cleaning according to the manufacturer's instructions or local practices (e.g., in hot, soapy water). Options for disinfection: A commercial dishwasher/cart washer cycle (must reach 82 \u00b0C). Approved, h ospital disinfectant , following the manufacturer's recommendations regarding dilution and contact times. 70% alcohol solution for 10 minutes. 500 ppm sodium hypochlorite (1:100 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite) Thorough rinsing following disinfection. Air-drying prior to storage. During outbreaks it may be prudent to remove, and not replace, the toys until the outbreak is over. See Appendix 13 for more information . 10.2.4.5 Adult Activity Rooms When activity rooms are used by adults: Encourage hand hygiene before and after activity. Clean items on a scheduled basis. Regularly asses s items that cannot be easily cleaned and discard if soiled. 10.2.4.6 Cloth Furnishings Cloth furnishings are discouraged in patient care areas. Refer to the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning upholstered furnishings. There should be a plan in pla ce to replace cloth furnishings with cleanable furnishings. Replace cloth furnishings that are torn or damaged. If cloth furnishings are present, these should be vacuumed regularly and steam cleaned as necessary when stained or visibly soiled. 3 10.2.4.7 Hydrotherapy Equipment Whirlpools, spas , bathtubs and physiotherapy pools have been associated with the acquisition of infection.525-531 Skin and wound infections may result from direct contact of intact skin or wounds to contaminated water. Inhalation of microorganisms in aerosolized water has resulted in respiratory infections (e.g., whirlpools). 92 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 102 C leaning of hydrotherapy equipment must at a minimum follow the manufacturer's instructions with regard to frequency, and must use a hospital disinfectant. Cleaning and disinfection should be scheduled and the schedule strictly adhered to regardless of whether tub liners are used.92 When replacing or purchasing hydrotherapy equipment, health care facilities should consider designs with improved cleanability and that are meant for use in the health care setting.532 10.2.4.8 Transport Equipment Equipment used to transport patients with limited mobility (e.g., stretchers, wheelchairs, walkers) that is used for more than one client/patient/resident should be disinfected with a hospital disinfectant immediately after use, before use for another client/patient/resident, and when visibly soiled, 533- 540 paying particular attention to high -touch areas (e.g., rails, push handles, chair arms).541 Transport equipment such as wheelchairs that may have padded areas should be carefully inspected for damage prior to cleaning. Damaged parts that cannot be adequately cleaned should be removed and replaced. In addition, all transport equipment should be c leaned according to a written schedule. Responsibility for cleaning transport equipment must be clearly designated (e.g., transport staff, environmental service workers). Transport equipment that is clean should be stored in an appropriate clean area and/o r covered to prevent recontamination between uses. Equipment used to transport a single resident within a facility (e.g., personal walkers, wheelchairs) must be immediately cleaned when soiled or visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids, as well as routinely following a written schedule. Ambulances (vehicles that transport patients on stretchers) should be cleaned, disinfected and restocked after each patient transport; a thorough cleaning should also be completed when required for heavy contamination and on a regular, scheduled basis. 542 See Appendix 14 for more information . 10.2.4.9 Hand Washing Sinks If used improperly or not regularly cleaned and disinfected, hand hygiene sinks can become contaminated. Contaminated hand hygiene sinks, and other sinks within the health care environment, have been associated with outbreaks, including outbreaks of antibiotic resistant organisms . Outbreaks occurred due to poor sink design,368,543- 548 use of a hand hygiene sink for purposes other than hand hygiene,366-369,549 or suboptimal sink cleaning practices.368 If sinks drains become contaminated, decontamination of the sink can be difficult, likely due to the presence of biofilm.368,369,550- 554 Some facilities have reported success in terminating their outbreaks by disinfecting the sinks with acetic acid,546 chlorine -based disinfectants,545,554,555 heat,556 or some self- decontaminating drain systems.557- 559 In many cases, facilities have reported that their outbreaks were not controlled until the implicated sinks (and parts) were replaced.369,543,544,550, 552,553, 559- 562 Given these concerns it is important that hand hygiene sinks, and other sinks located within the health care environment, are cleaned and disinfected regularly. When cleaning sinks, it is important to clean from the least contaminated to the most contaminated area with taps cle aned prior to the rest of the PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 103 s ink.563 The water outlet should not be touched during cleaning.365 After cleaning a sink, the cloths used should not be used to clean another sink .563 Consideration may also be given to using three different cloths to clean the tap, the sink and the area around the tap and sink.365 It is also critically important that hand hygiene sinks not be used for disposing body fluids and other waste (e.g., IV solutions).80,366, 369,544,545,551, 552,556,561,563 Prolonged contamination of sink drains with microorganism can result from this practice. 10.2.5 SURGICAL/STERILE SET TINGS 10.2.5.1 Operating Rooms Environmental cleaning in surgical settings minimizes patients' and health care providers' exposure to microorganisms. The Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada (ORNAC) has published standards for environmental cleaning in surgical settings that include:564 The ultimate responsibility for ensuring a clean surgical environment rests with the perioperative Registered Nurse. Environmental cleaning must be performed by trained staff according to the protocol of the health care s etting. A regular cleaning schedule must be established, posted and documented. Responsibility for cleaning anesthetic machines and carts should be clearly defined. The sample protocols for routine cleaning in Appendix 15 and Appendix 16 are based on ORNAC standards. Additional cleaning should be performed on a scheduled basis. See The ORNAC Standards , Guidelines, and Position Statements for Perioperative Registered Nurs es, 13th edition for more information on environmental cleaning/sanitation in operating room suites.564 10.2.5.2 Medical Device Reprocessing Departments Sterile processing areas in medical device reprocessing departments and other areas that store sterile supplies require a health care clean and a schedule that ensures that counters, shelves and floors are cleaned at least daily. Appendix 17 is based on the CSA Group's standard Z314.0- 13 Medical Device Reprocessing\u2014 General Requirements .322 10.2.6 LABORATORIES Clinical laboratories in Ontario should follow the Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian Biosafety Standard (CBS) (2015) recommendations regarding environmental cleanliness in the laboratory. See Appendix 18 for more information . PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 104 10.2.7 HEMODIALYSIS CENTRES The patient's hemodialysis station is comprised of individual care areas like bed spaces, the bed or dialysis chair, table and dialysis machine with its components. Any item taken into a hemodialysis station could become contaminated with blood and other body fluids and serve as a vehicle of transmission to other patients either directly or by contamination via the hands of staff.565,566 Outbreaks and transmission of bloodborne pathogens including hepatitis C and hepatitis B secondary to re -use of items and medical equipment that moved from one dialysis station to another has been documented.565, 567-572 Each hemodialysis station should be treated as an individual entity and hand hygiene must be performed on entry to the station and at exit from the station, before doing other tasks in the unit. Each hemodialysis station should be treated as an individual entity and hand hygiene must be performed on entry to the station and at exit from the station, before doing other tasks in the unit. Disposable items taken to a patient's hemodialysis station, including those placed on top of dialysis machines, should disposed of; 573 and reusable items should be cleaned and disinfected before being returned to a common clean area or used for other patients.565,573 Items that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected should not be taken into a hemodialysis station. Unused medications or supplies taken to the patient's station should not be returned to a common clean area or used on other patients.573 The external surfaces of the hemodialysis machine and its components are the most likely sources for contamination with bloodborne viruses and pathogenic bacteria. This includes not only frequently touched surfaces such as the control panel, but also attached waste containers, blood tubing and items placed on top of machines (e.g., patient chart).574 Contamination can occur even where blood or soiling is not visible.575 To thoroughly clean and disinfect environmental surfaces at a hemodialysis station and to reduce the risk of cross -contamination, cleaning should take place when the station is not occupied by a patient and dialysis centr es should allow sufficient time between patient shifts to allow thorough cleaning. Facilities may also consider regularly setting aside a period of time for a more thorough cleaning and disinfection environmental surfaces when there are no patients in the unit (e.g. , weekly if the dialysis unit is closed 1 day per week) .573 This approach does not replace the need for sufficient time between all dialysis shifts for thorough cleaning between patients. Items that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected should not be taken into a hemodialysis sta tion. Blood contaminated waste generated by the hemodialysis facility should be handled as biomedical waste (see 7. Laundry and Waste Management ). All disposable items should be placed in bags thick enough to prevent leakage. See Appendix 19 for more information . 10.2.8 NURSERIES AND NEONAT AL INTENSIVE CARE UN ITS Routine daily cleaning in nurseries and neonatal intensive care units should be performed following the same procedures as for adult patient rooms. The isolette/incubator/bassinet and equipment in the PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 105 i mmediate vicinity associated with the infant are considered to be the patient's environment. Products used for cleaning and disinfecting in nurseries and neonatal intensive care unit s must not be toxic to infants (e.g., phenolics must not be used3). Milk preparation areas may become contaminated and must be cleaned by environmental services daily and cleaned by milk preparation staff between mothers. Refrigerators and freezers should have a regular cleaning schedule and not be used for preparing or storing other items such as food, specimens or medications. See Appendix 20 for more information . 10.3 Cleaning Frequencies and Levels of Cleaning and Disinfection The frequency of cleaning and the level of cleaning are dependent upon the risk classification of the area to be cleaned. See 3.2 Frequency of Routine Cleaning for information about risk stratification. Refer to Appendix 21 for recommendations regarding cleaning frequency. Recommendations: 80.At a minimum, emergency room/urgent care patients' and public bathrooms: a. Should be cleaned every four hours . [B III] [modified II] [modified 2018 based on need. [A III] [modified 2018 ] 81.Electronic equipment used in care areas must be cleaned and disinfected with the same frequency as non- electronic equipment.

Ensure that hands are clean before contact with face. For rooms on Airborne Precautions: put on a fit -tested and seal -checked N95 respirator * if indicated and follow any other Additional Precautions (e.g., Contact /Droplet) indicated. The d oor must be kept closed to maintain negative pressure even if the client/patient/resident is not in the room.7,576 Rem ove respirator (and other personal protective equipment ) afte r exi ting the room. *O nly immune staff may enter a room where Airborne Precautions are in place for measles o r v aricella (chickenpox); an N95 respirator is not required. For most indications for Additional Precautions, routine cleaning practices as described in 10. Health Care Cleaning and Disinfection Practices and routine discharge cleaning practices as described in 10.2.1.2 Discharge/Transfer Patient/Resident Room Cleaning are adequate for the cleaning of rooms, and no special handling o r precautions are required for linen . (See also Appendix 4 and Appendix 6.) However, additional cleaning practices are required for rooms or bed spaces that house patients/residents with VRE,16,293,577,578 Cleaning Rooms/Cubicles/Bed Space on Contact Precautions .) At facilities that do not routinely change privacy curtains for all discharges and transfers, privacy curtains must be changed when cleaning rooms of all patients that were o n Additional Precautions .103, 105,108,109,534 Before entering a room in Additional Precautions, the required cleaning equipment and supplies should be gathered before putting on personal protective equipment. Do not bring cleaning carts into the room. After performing hand hygiene and putting on the required personal protective equipment, the room can be entered. Personal protective equipment should be removed, discarded in the designated receptacles, and hand hygiene repeated, at the time of room exit. Personal protective equipment should never be worn outside the client/patient/resident room or bed space. 7 All cleaning tool s and equipment (e.g., cloths, mop heads/pads) used to clean a room or bed space on Contact Precautions or Droplet Precautions must be cleaned and disinfected after use before being used in another room or bed space to avoid cross -contamination . PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 107 B ecause supplies stored within the room under Additional Precautions may need to be discarded when the patient/resident is discharged or transferred, these rooms should be stocked with the minimum required supplies. There should not be more than one day's supplies available within the room. When cleaning rooms o n Additional Precautions, it is also important to have protocols, and to clean the portable isolation carts and/or built -in holders used to sto re the personal protective equipment. Cleaning of Additional Precautions rooms requires extra time583 due to the requirements for personal protective equipment and/or additional cleaning procedures that are required in some instances. Sufficient time must be allocated for cleaning and disinfection of the rooms for patients/residents o n Additio nal Precautions , particularly for patients with C. difficile .85,159,583 Additional time must be allowed for cleaning rooms of patients/residents o n Additional Precautions. For additional information on the control of antibiotic -resistant organisms and C. difficile infection please see: PIDAC's Annex A: Screening, Testing and Surveillance for Antibiotic- Resistant Organisms (AROs) in All Health Care Settings for methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin - resistant enterococci (VRE).534 P IDAC's Annex C: Testing, Surveillance and Management of Clostridium difficile in All Health Care Settings for C. difficile .533 11.1 Cleaning Rooms/Cubicles/Bed Space on Contact Precautions There must be a process to ensure that there has been adequate cleaning and disinfection of rooms or bed space and shared equipment following client/patient/resident discharge or transfer.258,534,584- 586 This may be accomplished through the use of a task checklist to ensure that all areas and surfaces are cleaned and disinfected, and that post -cleaning inspection of the room or bed space has taken place (see Appendix 4, Appendix 6, and Appendix 22 for sample cleaning protocols and checklists .) For rooms or bed space housing patients with vomiting or diarrhea, vomit and faeces must be cleaned promptly, including items in the immediate vicinity, followed by disinfection with a virucid e against norovirus , or sporicidal disinfectant for C. difficile .587 11.1.1 VANCOMYCIN -RESISTANT ENTEROCOCC I VRE can persist for prolonged periods of time in the health care environment and routine cleaning and disinfection often fails to remove VRE from surfaces265, 534, 588,589. In addition to careful, meticulous room cleaning and disinfection as described for patients on Contact Precautions above, facilities may consider increasing the frequency of cleaning VRE room (e.g., twice a day) during VRE outbreaks or at facilities with ongoing, uncontrolled VRE transmissi on.66,265, 577, 578 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 108 11.1.2 METHICILLIN -RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS MRSA is not as persistent on dry surfaces as VRE or C. difficile .590 No special approach is required to clean and disinfect rooms that housed patients colonized or infected with MRSA beyond what is recommended for the rooms of all patients in contact precautions. 11.1.3 CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICIL E Specialized cleaning and disinfection practices are required for C. difficile . C. difficile is a spore -forming bacterium. The vegetative (nonspore) form of the bacteria is readily killed wi th hospital disinfectants, but the spores are resistant to many disinfectants, and can persist in the environment for months.60,591 The spores can be spread by contact and transform back to an infectious vegetative form once ingested. 189, 190,592 Control of environmental C. difficile requires both thorough cleaning (to remove spores) and the use of a sporicidal disinfectant (to inactivate spore s).593, 594 The following chemical agents have shown activity against C. difficile spores when used at the concentration and for the contact time recommended by the manufacturer : sodium hypochlorite (1000 -5000 parts per million)73,75,595, 596 im proved hydrogen peroxide (4.5%)597 pe racetic acid (0.26%)598 S ee also, Public Health Ontario's online chlorine dilution calculator for dilution of household bleach to achieve desired chlorine level. For adequate control of C. difficile , a sporicidal agent should be used: For twice daily cleaning of bathrooms of patients/residents with C. difficile infection. For disinfection after the room has been cleaned for each C. difficile infection patient discharged or transferred to another room. This includes the situation when a patient/resident is first identified as having C. difficile infection and is transferred to an isolation room. In this case the initial room must be cleaned using this protocol. Prior to discontinuing Contact Precautions for patients/residents with resolved C. difficile infection .73 E nvironmental contamination with C. difficile is most concentrated in patients'/residents' rooms,599- 601 making these areas the focus of stringent cleaning methods. Specific recommendations inclu de:602 Twice daily cleaning and disinfection of patient/resident room using a hospital disinfectant o r sporicidal agent.73,593,603- 605 Twice daily cleaning and disinfection of patient/resident bathroom using a sporicidal agent. If there are multiple cases of C. difficile infections on a unit/ward or attributable to a unit/ward: When each patient/resident is discharged or transferred, consider disinfecting their bed/bedspace with a sporicide, regardless of the patient/resident's C. difficile infection status. 72,579 D isinfect all high- touch surfaces on the unit with a sporicide.75,158,257 D isinfect all equipment on the unit with a sporicide. See Appendix 4 and Appendix 6 for more information. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 109 11.1.4 NOROVIRUS Noroviruses are non- enveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and are highly contagious .606-608 Environmental contamination plays a significant role in disease transmission. Norovirus can persist on surfaces for at least 12 days609,610 and is resistant to some disinfectants.611,612 Disinfectants used for patients with norovirus, or during norovirus outbreaks, shoul d have an appropriate virucidal claim. Most quaternary ammonium compounds do not have significant activity against norovirus.587 In some jurisdic tions, sodium hypochlorite at 1 000 to 5 000 ppm is recommended, although other broad- spectrum virucides also have activity against n orovirus .581,608,613- 615 Norovirus is inactivated by heat at 70\u00b0C.616 Vacuum cleaning carpets and buffing floors during an outbreak have the potential to re -circulate norovirus and are not recommended.609,613 Carpet and soft furnishings (if present) should be removed and not replaced. If this is not feasible, they should be steam cleaned following regular cleaning, provide d they are heat tolerant and at least 60oC is achieved by the unit.587 (See also 1.2.1.3 Cloth and Soft Furnishings in Healt h Care Settings and 1.2.1.4 Carpeting .) Health care settings may also consider increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting the bathrooms and toilets on affected units. 587 11.1.5 CARBAPENEMASE -PRODUCING ENTER OBACTERIACEAE CPE are primarily transmitted by direct and indirect contact in health care settings .534 Despite the fact that the health care environment can often be contaminated by these bacteria from colonized or infected patients/residents , careful application of routine cleaning practices should be sufficient to remove this pathogen .130,275, 617 Although CPE can be effectively removed from most surfaces and equipment in CPE rooms using routine environmental cleaning practices, sinks and showe r drains may act as a reservoir for CPE and persistent colonization of sinks can result in CPE transmission to subsequent room occupants. Sinks (including the drain pipes) have been documented as source of several CPE and ESBL outbreaks.367- 369,555, 561, 562 As these bacteria form biofilms in moist environments such as the sink drainage system, their eradication has been challenging 368,585 and may require replacement of the implicated sinks367 and/or the horizontal drainage system. 562 See also 10.2.4.9 Hand Washing Sinks . Facilities may want to consider enhanced sink and shower cleaning on a regular basis, (e.g., twice weekly), and at the time of discharge/transfer cleaning for CPE rooms (see Appendix 7) and may consider testing sink drains for CPE at the time of patient discharge/transfer. If sinks remain colonized despite repeated attempts at cleaning, replacement of sinks and/or the related horizontal drainage system may be required . 367, 562 11.2 Cleaning Rooms on Airborne Precautions The discharge/transfer cleaning practices specified in Appendix 6 may be used for rooms on Airborne Precautions. The following additional measures must be taken: After patient/resident transfer or discharge, the door must be kept closed and the Airborne Precautions sign must remain on the door until sufficient time has elapsed to allow removal o f airb orne microorganisms (dependent on air changes per hour). For more information, see PIDAC's Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for All Health Care Settings .7 PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 110 I t is preferable to wait for sufficient air changes to clear the air before cleaning the room. If the room is urgently needed before the air has been sufficiently cleared of tubercle bacilli, an N95 respirator must be worn during cleaning. Remove N95 respirator only after leaving room and door has been closed.

PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 157 Appendix 21: Risk Stratification Matrix to Determine Frequency of Cleaning For each client/patient/resident area or department: Step 1: Categorize the factors that will impact on environmental cleaning: Proba bility of Contamination with Pathogens Heavy Contamination (score = 3) An area is designated as being heavily contaminated if surfaces and/or equipment are routinely exposed to copious amounts of fresh blood or other body fluids (e.g., birthing suite, auto psy suite, cardiac catheterization laboratory, hemodialysis station, Emergency room, client/patient/resident bathroom if visibly soiled). Moderate Contamination (score = 2) An area is designated as being moderately contaminated if surfaces and/or equipment does not routinely (but may) become contaminated with blood or other body fluids and the contaminated substances are contained or removed (e.g. , wet sheets). All client/patient/resident rooms and bathrooms should be considered to be, at a minimum, moderat ely contaminated. Light Contamination (score = 1) An area is designated as being lightly contaminated if surfaces are not exposed to blood, other body fluids or items that have come into contact with blood or body fluids (e.g., lounges, libraries, offices) . Vulnerability of Population to Environmental Infection More Susceptible (score = 1) Susceptible clients/patients/residents are those who are most susceptible to infection due to their medical condition or lack of immunity. These include those who are immunocompromised (oncology, transplant and chemotherapy units), neonates (level 2 and 3 nurseries) and those who have severe burns (i.e., requiring care in a burn unit). Less Susceptible (score = 0) For the purpose of risk stratification for cleaning, all other individuals and areas are classified as less susceptible. PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 158 Potential for Exposure High -touch surfaces (score = 3) High- touch surfaces are those that have frequent contact with hands. Examples include doorknobs, telephone, call bells, bedrails, light switches, wall areas around the toilet and edges of privacy curtains. Low- touch surfaces (score = 1) Low-touch surfaces are those that have minimal contact with hands. Examples include walls, ceilin gs, mirrors and window sills. Step 2: Determine the Total Risk Stratification Score: For each functional area or department, the frequency of cleaning is based on the factors listed in the boxes above. A score is given if the factors are present, and the frequency of cleaning is based on the total score as derived in the following matrix: Table 12: Risk Stratification Scores for High- Touch Surfaces (Score for Potential for Exposure = 3) Probability of contamination with pathogens Mor e susceptible population (score = 1) Less susceptible population (score = 0) Heavy (score = 3) 7 (3+3+1) 6 (3+3+0) Moderate (score = 2) 6 (3+2+1) 5 (3+2+0) Light (score = 1) 5 (3+1+1) 4 (3+1+0) Table 13: Risk Stratification Scores for Low -Touch Surfaces (Score for Potential for Exposure = 1) Probability of contamination with pathogens More susceptible population (score = 1) Less susceptible population (score = 0) Heavy (score = 3) 5 (1+3+1) 4 (1+3+0) Moderate (score = 2) 4 (1+2+1) 3 (1+2+0) Light (score = 1) 3 (1+1+1) 2 (1+1+0) STEP 3: Determine the cleaning frequency based on the risk stratification matrix: Cleaning frequencies for each functional area or department are derived from the total score that results from the risk stratification matrix above: PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 159 T able 14: Cleaning Frequencies

PIDAC: Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control | April 2018 182 A 29. 1.2 RESULTS AND COMMENTS Table 17: Results of Studies on Antimicrobial Surfaces with Health Care- Associated Infections as Outcomes Author Comment on Design Results Overall C omments Salgado 380Not blinded Some cross- over of objects occurred with copper objects entering noncopper rooms and vice versa 7.14% (21/294) had HAI/MRSA/VRE in intervention group vs. 12.81% (41/320) in the control group (p=0.02) Relative risk reduction = 44%a Absolute risk reduction = 5.7% Reduction was seen for both HAI and MRSA/VRE but in subgroup analysis significant only for HAI . The plausibility is questionable for the degree of benefit given the multifactorial nature of HAI causation, the limited number of copper coated surfaces, and some cross-over of copper and noncopper items. Not sure if the patients in the intervention and the control groups are equal, e.g., who were on antibiotic treatment The study may not be powered to detect HAI alone, hence the composite outcome HAI/ARO was used . Note that the outcome of ARO colonization was not significant. Lazary 385Significant differen ces in intervention and control groups at baseline biased against null hypothesis 20.8 HAI per 1000 pt -days (intervention) vs. 27.4 HAI per 1000 pt -days (control) p=0.046 Relative risk reduction = 24% Absolute risk reduction = 6.6% Patients during the int ervention phase were less likely to have urinary catheters (22% vs. 31%), less likely to have pressure sores (17% vs. 26%), and less likely to be on steroids (19% vs. 30%) a.Such a large effect is not plausible; unexplained confounders may be present, as multiple factors contribute to transmission of HAI and ARO, and modification of several environmental surfaces alone is not expected to have caused such a large effect. Also, a smaller impact on ARO colonization than on HAI is not usually seen. In addition, one of the infections (pneumonia) is endogenous and should not be affected by environmental surfaces.
