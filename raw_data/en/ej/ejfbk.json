Our bodies require nutrient dense food to operate at its optimal making poor diet a main cause of weakening our immune system and often feeding the bacteria that is harmful to our bodies; sugar, caffeine, processed foods and alcohol. Lack of sleep and exercise causes your immune system to weaken over time. Getting proper rest to support the body in recharging itself and getting out of fight or flight mode will have a significant impact on your immune system, while exercise helps to get your endorphins going and release stagnation in the body to improve our overall health. Lastly, as I've experienced and learned throughout my life from endless rounds of antibiotics they can leave a lasting impression on your immune system, weakening its function to fight off future bacteria and infections.
