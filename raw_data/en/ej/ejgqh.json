You may experience your \"energy body\" and feelings of euphoria, or simply a feeling of deep relaxation. Benefits of acupuncture *Activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest response) * Reduces stress and anxiety * Promotes quality sleep * Balances the respiratory, digestive, endocrine, glandular and nervous systems * Increases vital energy flow throughout cells, skin, organs, bones * Restores \"inner harmony\" to mind/body system About Reiki Reiki is an energy healing practice from Japan. If we break down the word, \"rei\" means universal and \"ki\" means energy so reiki is universal energy. A reiki session can be described as an energetic massage. A reiki session with Yoli promotes deep relaxation through the rechanneling of energy from the Universe. Her sessions are infused with breathing exercises and guided meditation to give the mind a point of concentration so you can be fully present during your session to receive the benefits and really enjoy the session. Reiki is gentle enough to receive everyday. Yoli encourages her flowers to listen to their bodies and decide how often they would like to receive reiki. Every reiki session is a unique experience for everyone. No two sessions are alike because we are all different flowers in the same garden of life. (Note: Reiki can be performed with or without physical touch.) You will come away feeling grounded, centered, clear, and relaxed--ready for a night of deep sleep. What to bring: Yoga mat (blanket and pillow if you'd like) (we have some if you need) Recommended: water bottle, journal and pen for self-reflection afterward. Wear comfortable, loose clothing for floor sitting/lying. About the facilitators About Yoli Yoli's first teachers are her living ancestors: her parents, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez and Esther Mu\u00f1oz. Her mother taught her the basic laws of the universe: you attract what you are or you receive what you give, through the proverb, \"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything\" and introduced her to our true essence through the wisdom, \"Silence is golden\". Her father taught her that what we experience in our past is not our reality or our future. In 2018, Yoli met her shaman, Marleni Vilca Bravo Paul for her own healing, began learning the medicines of PachaMama, and was initiated into the traditions of the Andeas Mountains of Pero in 2020. She continued her studies and in 2021, Yoli received her 1st and 2nd Degree Reiki Certifications with Zen Sister Healing, and her 200 Hour Yoga Teacher Training from Shri Yogi Hari's Ashram in Miramar, Florida. Most recently in 2022, she received Yoga Nidra Training with Chitra Sukhu and Archangelic Light Energy Training with Susan Melchoine. We are all our own healers, and Yoli's mission is to accompany you to your own path of Self healing.
