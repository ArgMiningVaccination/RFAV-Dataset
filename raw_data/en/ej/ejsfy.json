[Provincial Laboratory Services and COVID-19 testing](/en/information/health-pei/provincial-laboratory-services-and-covid-19-testing-platforms). For answers to general questions about COVID-19, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19. Laboratory Services performs specialized tests to help diagnose, monitor, and treat diseases and other health conditions. Your doctor may request to have a specimen (bodily fluid or tissue sample) sent to the laboratory for testing. The type of test your doctor requests will determine what samples are required, how and when they are collected, and how they will be tested once they arrive at the lab. Fluid samples such as saliva, blood, and urine are typically collected at the doctor's office during your medical exam and forwarded to the lab for analysis. Some body tissue must be removed surgically and may require a referral to the hospital. What if I am asked to collect my own sample? Depending on the type of sample needed for testing, you may be required to collect your own bodily fluids over a period of time. It is important that you follow the collection instructions properly to ensure your test offers accurate results. Carefully follow the instructions for the following sample collections: [Collect a 24-hour urine sample](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/how_to_collect_a_24_hour_urine_specimen.pdf)[PDF | 63 | [Collect a semen sample](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/how_to_collect_a_semen_sample.pdf)[PDF | 31 KB] Where do I take my samples after I finish collecting them? Drop-off instructions will be clarified in the sample collection instructions. You may be invited to drop them off at your doctor's office or clinic, or you may be asked to deliver them directly to a laboratory in your community. Will I have to fast before my blood test? It will depend on the type of blood test ordered. Your doctor or health care provider will tell you if there are any specific instructions you need to follow before you have your blood test. For some blood tests, you can eat and drink as normal before the test. In other cases, you will be instructed not to eat or drink before your test. This is called a fasting blood test. Can I drink water if I am fasting for a laboratory test? Yes. Can I take my medication if I am fasting for a laboratory test? You can take your medications with sips of water unless otherwise instructed by your health care provider. When fasting, you cannot chew gum or smoke. Why wasn't my sample tested? The most common reasons a sample cannot be tested are the wrong container was used or the container was not labelled properly. Occasionally, a sample cannot be tested because it was damaged during collection or during transport to the laboratory. Your health care provider receives a report explaining the reason your sample could not be tested. Do I have to fast for my laboratory test if I am diabetic? Yes, unless otherwise instructed by your health care provider. If I have to go to the hospital for blood/specimen collection or drop-off, what will I need to bring with me? You will need to bring your requisition (completed by your doctor) and a valid [PEI Health Card](/en/information/health-pei/pei-health-card) with you. It is recommended that you wear loose clothing that will allow your sleeve to be rolled up past the elbow. How will I get my test results? Laboratory Services will send the test results to the ordering physician, and if requested, to another doctor or specialist involved in your care. Contact your doctor's office to obtain results. Do not contact the lab for test results. How long before my doctor gets the results? This will depend on what tests are ordered. Most routine tests are reported to your doctor within 24 hours. Microbiology and special testing (tests sent out to other labs in other provinces) may take several days or weeks. Can I get a copy of my lab results? The laboratory routinely only releases results directly to the ordering doctor. You are encouraged to obtain your test results through consultation with your doctor. How long will I have to wait to have my blood collected? Wait times will depend on the location you go to and how busy they are that day (with both drop-in and scheduled collections by appointment). Many of our patients require fasting blood work and arrive early in the morning. If you are not required to fast, you may prefer to come later in the day when wait times are less. Why do I see patients who arrived after me being taken in for blood collection before me? It may be because they are returning for a \"timed test\" which requires them to have their blood collected at a specific time. They may also be sent to have their blood collected \"STAT\" which means that there is a need to process their sample quickly due to the possible need for immediate/urgent treatment. Why is my baby's blood tested? All babies born on Prince Edward Island have a blood test before they are discharged from hospital. Early screening may detect a health issue before your baby presents symptoms. More information is offered in the [Newborn Blood Collection brochure](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/newborn_blood_collection_brochure.pdf) [PDF | 1,718 KB]. What is a sweat test? Your child may be referred to the provincial laboratory at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital to collect sweat from their skin.
