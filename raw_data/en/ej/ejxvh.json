The network's goal is to bring treatments and curative options to people suffering from this potentially life-shortening red blood cell disorder. The American Society of Hematology (ASH), which created the network, is the world's largest professional society of clinicians and researchers focused on blood diseases. Under the leadership of Patrick Leavey, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics at UTSW, a collaborative North Texas clinical trial unit was developed and invited to be a partici - pating site. The North Texas unit includes Chil - dren's Medical Center Dallas, William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, Parkland Health & Hospital System, Medical City Dallas, and Cook Children's Health Care System in Fort Worth. UT Southwestern's inclusion in the national network underscores its commitment as an academic medical center to bring the latest treat - ments to underserved populations. Sickle cell disease impacts Black Americans the hardest, with the genetic disease occurring in 1 out of every 365 African American births.

PULSAR, or personalized ultrafractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy - detailed in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics - achieved better tumor control by giving -PD-L1 therapy during or after radiation and by spacing frac - tions 10 days apart rather than daily. In the PULSAR paradigm, patients receive only a few large dose \"pulses,\" delivered with sophisticated, image-guided precision, at least a week, perhaps even months, apart. These \"split treatments\" are a radical break from the daily, long-course, conventional radiation treatments lasting six to nine weeks. They are less toxic and give oncologists time to fine-tune treatment after the new machines' imaging shows the tumor's changed shape, size, position, and its reaction to radiation. Radiation oncology therapists help set up a patient on the treatment table of the Ethos adaptive radiotherapy machine prior to treatment.Pioneering PULSAR-integrated radiotherapy with immunotherapy PULSAR on page 2By Deborah Wormser A first-in-kind kidney cancer drug developed from laboratory and translational studies conducted at UT S outhwestern recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, providing a new treatment for patients with familial kidney cancer. Merck's belzutifan grew out of the discovery at UT S outhwestern of the protein hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF- 2), which was found to fuel the growth of kidney and other cancers. HIF-2 was discovered by Steven McKnight, Ph.D., Professor of Biochemistry. \"This is an exciting milestone for patients with inherited forms of kidney cancer who are in need of more effective therapies,\" said David Russell, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Molecular Genetics, who collaborated in the early stages of the research. The drug, once called PT2977, was developed based on a UTSW discovery. Further drug development efforts were conducted by the spinoff company Peloton Therapeutics, which was launched on the UT Southwestern campus and eventually acquired by Merck. Drs. McKnight and Russell first identified HIF-2 in the 1990s. For many years, HIF-2 was consid - ered undruggable until two more UTSW scientists - Richard Bruick, Ph.D., former Professor of Biochemistry, and Kevin Gardner, Ph.D., former Professor of Biophysics, did the structural and biochem - ical work showing that the HIF-2 mole - cule contains a pocket that is potentially druggable. The two scientists then identi - fied multiple compounds that fit into this pocket and inhibited the activity of HIF-2 . Please see BELZUTIFAN on page 4 The drug belzutifan was developed based on the discovery more than two decades ago at UT Southwestern of a protein that was found to drive the growth of kidney and other cancers.

If they are one to four days, it doesn't help. Yet many of the clinical trials that are being done right now with radiotherapy and immuno - therapy are using radiation schedules a day apart or every other day apart - perhaps the exact wrong timing.\" By allowing more time to assess changes for meaningful adaptation of an individual patient's course, the PULSAR paradigm fulfills the promise of personalized cancer care. Instead of marching through a course of stand-alone, daily radiotherapy without interruption, PULSAR can be spaced out to more thoughtfully integrate with surgery and drug therapy. \"Using artificial intelligence, the team can replan cancer treatment in 30 minutes instead of the typical five to seven days,\" said Dr. Timmerman, Interim Chair and Medical Director of Radiation Oncology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"The equipment and expertise under one roof should break new ground in fighting cancer.\" Collaborating on the PULSAR project are faculty from the Depart - ments of Radiation Oncology, Immu - nology, Pathology, and Neurological Surgery and members of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute and Simmons Cancer Center. PULSAR is being pioneered in a 71,000-square- foot expansion of Radiation Oncology services with seven new machines that image tumors and treat them with radiation. (See related story on page 3.) Artificial intelligence experts from Radiation Oncology and the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics devel - oped machine-learning algorithms, while radiation oncologists use the machines' combined radiation and imaging abilities to make treatments as precise as possible, hitting the tumors and sparing healthy tissue. Plans are underway to share exper - tise and data with other academic institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Dr. Timmerman holds the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research.Pulsar Continued from page 1 More online : Read the full story in the newsroom at utsouthwestern. edu/newsroom .Findings UTSW researchers discovered that PULSAR radiation could bolster systemic immunotherapy benefit, even in situations where immuno - therapy alone was not effective. In preclinical testing, they investigated one of the most common classes of immunotherapy, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, along with PULSAR radiation. This combination acted like a vaccination against tumors implanted in mice. Splitting two pulses of radiation by 10 days was much more effective in combination with the checkpoint drug than the typical daily radiation schedule, researchers found. Next, the team will test this therapy strategy in patients through multiple open and pending clinical trials. A radiation oncology MRI technologist helps set up a patient on the Elekta Unity MR-Linac prior to treatment. PULSAR, a new radiotherapy for cancer, is customizable to the type and size of the cancer and also adapts dosage to how the tumor responds to treatment.Page 3 OctOber 2021 From Staff Reports UT Southwestern Medical Center recently completed its 71,000-square- foot expansion of Radiation Oncology services, heralding a new avenue of treat - ment to patients called adaptive therapy. \"For years, UT Southwestern has been a recognized leader in the field of radiation oncology, advancing research in stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and personalized patient care through the use of artificial intelligence, said Hak Choy, M.D., former Chair of Radiation Oncology. \"With the opening of our expanded building, we're preparing to enter an exciting phase in the field of radiation oncology - adaptive therapy - which is not just the next iteration in care but a paradigm shift.\" Adaptive therapy combines real- time, high-resolution imaging and modern radiation techniques to deliver ultra-precise treatment that can quickly be adapted to changes in patients' anatomy and tumor size. \"This distinctive facility with its unique technology opens the oppor - tunity for our medical doctors to provide truly personalized adaptive radiation therapy to our patients,\" said Arnold Pompos, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology and Director of Strategic Expansion Plans. Radiation Oncology is a key component of UT Southwestern's Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center - one of 51 designated comprehensive cancer centers in the U.S. by the National Cancer Institute, a member of the elite 30-member National Comprehensive Cancer Network, with its cancer program nationally ranked among the top 25 by U.S. News & World Report . UTSW's Radiation Oncology facility, with total combined space of more than 130,000 square feet, features a collection of the most sophisticated treatment machines. Coupled with image-guided therapy, the equipment is versatile and capable of treating an array of cancer malignancies under one roof. The additional \"smart\" treatment technologies provide a personalized patient experience through artificial intelligence-assisted radiation therapy adaptable to changes in the patient's anatomy, tumor size, and position, along with the ability to monitor treat - ment progress due to biological and functional changes. \"The adaptive machines not only provide precise image-guidance to tumors, they can realign and reshape radiation beams to the borders of the tumor as it changes, meaning we'll be able to better target tumors and avoid healthy tissue,\" said Robert Timmerman, M.D., Professor and Interim Chair of Radiation Oncology. UT Southwestern has plans to take the technology further by combining it with a \"big data\" approach enhanced by artificial intelligence to create even more effective and highly personal - ized treatments called PULSAR, now being investigated through multiple clinical trials at UT Southwestern. (See related story on page 1.) Adaptive therapy today is focused on conforming radiation to changing anatomy to make treatment more precise, said Steve Jiang, Ph.D., Professor and Vice Chair of Radiation Oncology. \"In the near future, we'll have more intelligent adaption based on biomarkers,\" said Dr. Jiang. \"We'll be able to prescribe different levels of radiation to patients based on their unique response to treatment and what models and past data for similar conditions suggest are optimum.\" Dr. Jiang holds the Barbara Crittenden Professorship in Can- cer Research.

T he finding, published in Neuron , broadens understanding of the circadian clock's molecular mechanisms and could eventually lead to new treatments for managing challenges such as jet lag and sleep disorders. \"To reset the circadian clock, you ultimately need to reset its molecular gears,\" said study leader Joseph S. Takahashi, Ph.D., Professor and Chair of Neuroscience and a Howard Hughes Medical Insti - tute Investigator. \"This study suggests that Npas4 might be one of the most important components for resetting the clock to light.\" For decades, researchers have known that a brain region called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls circadian rhythms, the various cycles of activity that typically run on a 24-hour basis. These rhythms are entrained by light, Dr. Takahashi explained; cells in the SCN respond to signals relayed by the retina, the eye's light- sensitive tissue. However, the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not well understood. To learn more about how the SCN sets circadian rhythms, the researchers used a tech - nique called single nucleus sequencing to examine gene activity in cells in mice after the animals were exposed to light. Dr. Takahashi and his colleagues found that three different subpopu - lations of SCN neurons respond to light stimula - tion. A common thread tying these subtypes together was increased activity in genes that respond to Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4 (NPAS4), the protein made by the Npas4 gene. When the research team exposed mice engi- neered to lack Npas4 to light, it dampened the response of hundreds of circadian clock genes. In addition, the animal's circadian period lengthened about an extra hour, to nearly 25 hours instead of the normal 24. Together, Dr. Takahashi said, these results suggest that Npas4 is a master regulator of many light-induced genes, a key piece in the puzzle of how the circadian system works. The more researchers learn about the molec - ular underpinnings of the circadian clock, Dr. Takahashi added, the more they may be able to manipulate it to improve health and well-being - for example, to ease jet lag or help shift workers stay awake to match their work cycles. It could also lead to new treatments for disorders marked by abnormal sleep/wake cycles. This work was a collaboration with the labo - ratory of Genevieve Konopka, Ph.D., Associate Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the UTSW Neurogenomics Core.

Alecia Nero, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, said the push to bring clinical trials to new heights is severely needed. Currently, there are just four drugs used to treat sickle cell disease; three have only been available since 2017. \"Sickle cell disease, being a relatively rare disease, struggles with keeping significant trials open because it takes so long to get patients. By creating these networks, you can then enroll the patients to get the answer that you're after,\" Dr. Nero said. Dr. Nero, who treats pediatric sickle cell patients at Children's Medical Center, is Director of the Transition Sickle Cell Program that helps patients successfully transfer from pediatric to adult care. Young adult patients are at increased risk of death during this crit - ical period, making transition of care a high priority. She is also the adult sickle cell program Medical Director and cares for patients at Clements University Hospital and Parkland. Dr. Leavey, a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, said he hopes the network will bring significant advances against the disease by opening up new collaborations with pharmaceutical compa - nies. Dr. Nero said there are 30 to 40 new drugs that pharmaceutical companies would like to bring to clinical trials for sickle cell disease. Her highest hopes are for new treatments involving gene therapies. A description of the program was part of UT Southwestern's application to the Wash - ington D.C.-based ASH to become a founding member of the network. \"This was very competitive. It speaks to our institution and the leadership and ASH seeing all the things we can do at UT S outhwestern,\" Dr. Nero said. Dr. Leavey said UT Southwestern's leader - ship in sickle cell clinical research and its data resources also helped, along with an advisory board that includes community members. Other founding members of the Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trials Network include The Johns Hopkins University School of Medi - cine, the University of Chicago, and Weill Cornell Medicine.

Copyright (c) 2021 by ASH Research Collaborative\"The history of belzutifan's development demonstrates the value of cross- disciplinary collaborations at academic medical centers and how that can trans - late to new treatments for diseases,\" said Dr. Russell, former Vice Provost and Dean of Research. \"It also underscores the value of investing in basic science discoveries at the core of advancements in medi - cine.\" In 2011, several researchers spun off Peloton Therapeutics, and by 2019, when Merck acquired the company, at least three HIF-2 agents were under investigation. James Brugarolas, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Kidney Cancer Program at UT Southwest - ern's Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, showed that the drug was effective against kidney cancer. With funding from a prestigious National Cancer Institute SPORE award, his team reported in Nature in 2016 that the drug could inhibit HIF-2 in human kidney tumors trans - planted into mice and stop the cancer's growth. This and other studies led to the first clinical trial of PT2385, a precursor to PT2977, which became belzutifan. The trial, which was led by the UTSW Kidney Cancer Program, showed that the drug was well-tolerated and effective. \"The approval of belzutifan represents a new paradigm in the treatment of kidney cancer,\" said Dr. Brugarolas, also Professor of Internal Medicine. \"By exclusively targeting HIF-2 , which is essential for kidney cancers but dispens - able for normal processes, belzutifan specifically disables cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Belzutifan is the best-tolerated kidney cancer drug today and one suitable for patients with familial kidney cancer. It is a testament to the prowess of designer drugs and carefully chosen targets of which it is a prime example.\" Disclosures: UT Southwestern and some of its researchers will receive finan - cial compensation, through prior agreements with Peloton, based on belzutifan's FDA approval. Dr. Brugarolas holds the Sherry Wigley Crow Cancer Research Endowed Chair in Honor of Robert Lewis Kirby, M.D. Dr. McKnight holds the Distinguished Chair in Basic Biomedical Research.TIMELINE: The path to developing a HIF-2 inhibitor 1997 UT Southwestern biochemist Steven McKnight, Ph.D., and molecular geneticist David Russell, Ph.D., report the discovery of the HIF-2 gene, which they call EPAS1 . The team shows that HIF-2 binds to another protein, HIF-1 . The HIF-2 partner functions like a pair of tweezers to grab DNA. HIF-2 binds DNA at specific places to initiate the production of other proteins such as VEGF, which support kidney cancer growth. 2003 Richard Bruick, Ph.D., and Kevin Gardner, Ph.D., uncover aspects of the atomic blueprint of HIF-2 . They show how HIF-2 docks with HIF-1 to assemble into a functional HIF-2 complex. They identify a cavity within the HIF-2 protein, hypothesizing that it may offer a foothold for a drug. Working with UT Southwestern's High-Throughput Screening labo - ratory, the researchers develop a test to identify chemicals among 200,000 drug-like molecules that bind to the HIF-2 cavity, preventing HIF-2 from binding to HIF-1 . By interfering with HIF-2 binding to HIF-1 , these compounds block HIF-2 action. The most promising chemicals undergo a refinement process by UTSW medicinal chemists. 2010 Peloton Therapeutics is founded by UTSW researchers, via the UTSW Office of Technology Development, to develop the HIF-2 -blocking chemicals into drugs. Peloton scientists create libraries of related compounds, ultimately identi - fying PT2385 and PT2977 to test in humans. A related drug, PT2399, is identified for laboratory work. 2016 James Brugarolas, M.D., Ph.D., validates HIF-2 as a target in kidney cancer. In experiments involving mice transplanted with human kidney tumors, researchers s how that PT2399 blocks HIF-2 while not affecting related proteins, is active against 50% of human kidney tumors, and has more activity and is better tolerated than sunitinib (the most commonly used drug for renal cancer treatment at the time). 2018 Kevin Courtney, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, reports the results of a phase one clinical trial testing PT2385 in humans. The trial represents the first-in-human study of a first-in-class inhibitor of HIF-2 . The trial demonstrates that PT2385 is safe, well-tolerated, and active against kidney cancer in humans. More than 50% of patients see their cancer regress or stabilize. 2019 U.S. drug manufacturer Merck acquires Peloton Therapeutics for $1.05 billion, with an additional $1.15 billion contingent on sales and regulatory milestones. 2020 Through studies of tumor biopsy samples from patients who participated in the phase one clinical trial, Drs. Courtney, Brugarolas, and Ivan Pedrosa, M.D., Ph.D., report the identification of drug resistance mutations in patients, estab - lishing HIF-2 as the first-known core dependency of kidney cancer.Belzutifan Continued from page 1 James Brugarolas, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the UTSW Kidney Cancer ProgramPage 5 OctOber 2021 By Christen Brownlee Specialized cells that conduct electricity to keep the heart beating have a previously unrec - ognized ability to regenerate in the days after birth, a new study in mice by UT Southwestern researchers suggests. The finding, published online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could eventually lead to treatments for heart rhythm disorders that avoid the need for inva - sive pacemakers or drugs by instead encouraging the heart to heal itself. \"Patients with arrhythmias don't have a lot of great options,\" said study leader Nikhil V. Munshi, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiologist and Asso - ciate Professor of Internal Medicine, Molecular Biology, and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development. \"Our findings suggest that someday we may be able to elicit regeneration from the heart itself to treat these conditions.\" Dr. Munshi studies the cardiac conduction system, an interconnected system of special - ized heart muscle cells that generate electrical impulses and transmit these impulses to make the heart beat. Although studies have shown that nonconducting heart muscle cells have some regenerative capacity for a limited time after birth - with many discoveries in this field led by UTSW scientists - conducting cells called nodal cells were largely thought to lose this ability during the fetal period. Previous research had suggested that neonatal nodal cells lose stem cell-like qualities before birth, giving them negligible regenerative proper - ties. However, Dr. Munshi explained, their regen - erative abilities had never been directly tested because there was no way to eliminate only nodal cells in animal models to spur regeneration. To solve this problem, Dr. Munshi and his colleagues used genetic engi - neering to develop mice whose atrioventricular (AV) node cells - located near the intersection of the heart's four chambers - did not respond well when they were fed the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. In adult mice of this strain that were given tamoxifen, tissue samples and electrocardiograms revealed progressive heart damage stemming from the loss of AV node cells in the following weeks and months. However, when neonatal mice were dosed, heart function appeared to be completely normal in one-third of the animals a month later. Taking a closer look, the researchers performed electrocardiograms on newborn mouse models of AV node failure every couple of days after tamoxifen treatment. These tests revealed an initial injury to the heart that gradually healed itself in many of the animals. Although tissue examination showed that this healing didn't result in a completely normal heart in adulthood, it was sufficient for the mice to have regular heart rhythms. Intriguingly, further investigation showed that nonmuscle heart cells were the predomi - nant cell type that proliferated after the nodal cells died. These cells appeared to modulate production of proteins that help heart cells make electrical connections. The reasons why these proteins increased and why only about one-third of the animals showed regeneration remain unclear, Dr. Munshi said. He and his colleagues plan to continue studying the molecular mechanisms behind this phenom - enon to gain more knowledge that could eventu - ally lead to a drug that can stimulate the regen - eration pathway on demand to regrow damaged nodes in arrhythmia patients.Cells that keep the heart beating can regenerate, study reveals More online : Read the full story in the newsroom at utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom .

These changes give that cancer a selective advantage, but at the same time they can become an Achilles' heel - something that, if the alteration was blocked, would kill the cancer or stop its growth,\" said Dr. Kraus, also Director of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehen - sive Cancer Center. The research team, including lead author Sridevi Challa, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Kraus' lab, found that ovarian cancers massively amplify the enzyme NMNAT-2, which makes NAD+. NAD+ is the substrate for a family of enzymes called PARPs, which chemically modify proteins with ADP-ribose from NAD+. In this study, the team found that one PARP family member, PARP-16, uses NAD+ to modify ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machines of the cell. In collaboration with UTSW clinicians, led by Jayanthi Lea, M.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a member of the Simmons Cancer Center, Dr. Kraus and his team screened ovarian cancer patient samples using a synthetic mono(ADP-ribose) detection reagent to identify those with low or high levels of mono(ADP- ribose). The study identified mono(ADP-ribose) and NMNAT-2 as potential biomarkers for ovarian cancers, enabling clinicians to determine which cancer patients may respond well to treatment. Ovarian cancer patients might also benefit from an inhibitor for PARP-16, which blocks ribosome mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Dr. Kraus, an expert in PARPs, said medical science has had great success in developing FDA- approved PARP-1 inhibitors, and an inhibitor for PARP-16 is likely. \"No PARP-16 inhibitors are currently in clin - ical trials, but labs in academia and the phar - maceutical industry are developing specific and potent inhibitors of PARP-16. Such a drug could be an effective therapeutic for treating ovarian cancers,\" he said. \"Dr. Kraus' research is not just a great advance in basic science. It has real promise for clinician investigators and cancer care practitioners because it shows a biomarker and a pathway a future drug could target. The fact that technology developed in his laboratory helped make these findings shows how our faculty builds on their findings to break new ground,\" said Carlos L. Arteaga, M.D., Director of the Simmons Cancer Center Dr. Arteaga holds The Lisa K. Simmons Distin - guished Chair in Comprehensive Oncology.

W. Lee Kraus, Ph.D. Ovarian cancer patient samples show high levels of protein aggregates in magenta (left), which coincides with low levels of mono(ADP-ribose) (MAR), compared with low levels of protein aggregates (right) and high levels of MAR. The study found that high levels of MAR and low levels of protein aggregates enhance ovarian cancer cell survival. Page 6 OctOber 2021 By Carol Marie Cropper Karolina Stepien, who studies how the brain's neurotransmitters are released from one neuron to send a signal to another, has been named winner of the 2021 Ida M. Green Award. This honor is given each year by Southwestern Medical Foundation to a female student in UT S outhwest - ern's Graduate School of Biomed - ical Sciences based on her scientific accomplishments and commitment to the UTSW community. Ms. Stepien said she was extremely happy to receive the award, which is one of the most prestigious for UTSW graduate students. \"I like that there is an award that specifically recognizes a scientist who is a woman. In general, women have had fewer chances than men in the sciences,\" she said. Her basic research into how powerful neurotransmitter chemi - cals housed within vesicles, or tiny bubbles, inside nerve cells are released outside the cells could one day help scientists understand the mechanisms involved in and devise treatments for neurodegenerative, emotional, and movement disorders such as Alzheim - er's disease, depression, and epilepsy. Ms. Stepien, a Fulbright Scholar from Poland, is working toward her doctorate in molecular biophysics as a graduate student researcher in the lab of Jose Rizo-Rey, Ph.D., a Professor of Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Phar - macology. She initially came to UTSW in 2014 as an exchange student in the BioLAB program, which provides Polish master's and doctoral students in the biological sciences a one-year paid internship to study at UT S outh- western or other American institutions. At the time, Ms. Stepien was focused on biotechnology, the subject she received her undergraduate degree in from the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. But she became fasci -nated with Dr. Rizo-Rey's biophysics research into neuronal function and was impressed by UTSW's supportive and collaborative atmosphere. After returning to Poland and completing her master's in 2016, she came back to UT Southwestern to pursue doctoral studies in molecular biophysics. \"This is the process that underlies everything that we do - our emotions, feelings - basically who we are as humans,\" she said, explaining her attraction to research about how nerve cells in the brain communicate. \"Karolina Stepien has a brilliant intellect and enormous curiosity that drives her to tackle multiple projects in parallel,\" Dr. Rizo-Rey said. \"She has a combination of talent and effort that I have seen in very few students over my 32 years at UT Southwestern.\" \"We are honored and delighted to celebrate Ms. Karolina Stepien as the 2021 winner of the Ida Green Award,\" said Kathleen M. Gibson, President and CEO of Southwestern Medical Foundation. \"Ms. Stepien has served the UT Southwestern community and the Graduate School with distinc - tion across a broad spectrum, both in leadership and in service. Her scien - tific contributions have advanced the understanding of the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and embody the innovative spirit and rich legacy of Ida Green.\" The Ida M. Green Award was established by Southwestern Medical Foundation in honor of Mrs. Green, who died in 1986. Her husband, Cecil Green, who died in 2003, worked at General Electric and later co-founded Texas Instruments. Mrs. Green provided unrestricted gifts to many community organizations, including a major bequest to Southwestern Medical Foundation. The award includes a $2,000 prize. In 2019, Ms. Stepien's work led to publication in Nature Communica -tions of a study that explained the competition between two neuronal proteins - Munc18-1 and SNAP - to bind to a protein in the membrane of the neuron called syntaxin-1. Depending on which protein wins this competition, membrane fusion and then release of the neurotransmit - ters outside the cell is either helped or inhibited, Ms. Stepien said. This was her first study as lead author. In 2021, she was the first author of a PNAS study that focused on reca - pitulating the process of neurotrans - mitter release in the test tube with purified proteins. She also has been an author on six additional papers in high-impact journals. During her time at UTSW, Ms. Stepien served as President of Quest for Careers, an organization that helps Ph.D. students learn about career options, and she volunteered as chair in the science area for United to Serve, which organizes an annual health fair in Dallas. Working with a friend who is also a Fulbright Scholar and a UTSW graduate student, Martyna Kosno, Ms. Stepien founded a local chapter of the Fulbright Scholar organization for those in the Dallas area. In addition, she chairs the Molecular Biophysics Program's social committee, arranging monthly get-togethers. Dr. Rizo-Rey holds the Virginia Lazenby O'Hara Chair in Biochemistry. Karolina Stepien, winner of the 2021 Ida M. Green Award, studies how brain neurotransmitters work in hopes of uncovering new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.Grad student studying neurotransmitters receives Ida M. Green Award From Staff Reports Two UT Southwestern faculty - one an internationally recognized cerebrovascular surgeon and the second a leader in the field of ocular immunology - have been appointed Pro- fessors Emeritus. Former Chair of Neurological Surgery Hunt Batjer, M.D., retired at the end of 2020 after a nearly 40-year career. In his new role as Professor Emeritus, he looks forward to mentoring faculty, residents, and students and assisting with recruit - ment and program development. Dr. Batjer's UT Southwestern journey began in 1973 as a medical student. He completed his medical degree, general surgery internship, and neurological surgery residency at UTSW, followed by a neurology fellowship at the University College London and a cerebrovascular disorders fellowship at the University of Western Ontario. He served on the UTSW faculty for 13 years before leaving to become Chair of Neurological Surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In 2012, he returned to UT South - western as the third Chair of Neurological Surgery. Dr. Batjer's academic pursuits and research in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and brain injuries have resulted in nine books and 467 peer-reviewed publications and book chapters. He also has presented 53 endowed lectureships and served as a visiting professor in 63 medical institutions worldwide. In addition, as co-Chair of the NFL Head, Neck, and Spine Committee for eight years, he helped develop the league's concussion protocol. Among his many accolades, Dr. Batjer is the 2020 recipient of the Harvey Cushing Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Now Trea - surer of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), he previously served as Chair of the ACGME's Residency Review Committee for Neurological Surgery and as Director and Chair of the American Board of Neurological Surgery. \"I am fortunate to have trained at UTSW under great neurosurgeons,\" Dr. Batjer said. \"I benefited immensely from that training and look forward to being able to give back to the organi - zation that gave me so much.\"The second appointee, Jerry Niederkorn, Ph.D., is recognized as a leader in infectious diseases of the eye. A faculty member since 1977 who retired in August, Dr. Niederkorn was Professor of Ophthalmology and Microbiology. He also served as Chair of the Immunology Grad - uate Program. Dr. Niederkorn's efforts have earned multiple international awards, including the Alcon Research Institute Award, an award given to a handful of international scientists each year. He also was selected for the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology's Proctor Medal Award in 2019, a prestigious honor for scientists conducting vision and ophthalmic research. For more than 35 years, Dr. Niederkorn has maintained continuous National Institutes of Health funding and has served as Principal Investigator on three research grants that were simultaneously funded for 28 years. His produc - tivity as a scientist is reflected in the publication of 273 articles in peer-reviewed journals and 50 book chapters and articles. Cornea transplantation was especially intriguing to him. \"It is the most successful transplant surgery that is done, but why?\" he asked. Answering that question has been the focus of much of his research. In 2015, he identified why secondary corneal transplants are rejected at triple the rate of first-time corneal transplants, which have a success rate of 90%. He uncovered an immune process that led to the rejection. As much as he has enjoyed research, he has also found working with students to be espe - cially rewarding. Dr. Niederkorn has mentored 20 graduate students who earned their Ph.D.s in his laboratory and has served on the dissertation committees for 60 Ph.D. students at UT South - western. He continues to serve in multiple capac - ities for the University, including assisting with medical student interviews and as a member of the Steering Committee for the Immunology Graduate Program.

A 1968 graduate of Louisiana State Univer - sity School of Medicine in New Orleans, Dr. Cunningham came to UT Southwestern in 1972 as a postdoctoral fellow and joined the faculty in 1973. He was an attending physi - cian at Parkland Memorial Hospital before becoming Chief of Obstetrics in 1981. He served as UTSW Chair of Obstetrics and Gyne - cology from 1983 to 2004 and as Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Parkland from 1982 to 2006. A world-recognized authority on the hema - tological and hypertensive disorders of preg - nancy, he was the chief author/editor of the Williams Obstetrics textbook f rom the 1 8th through the 25th editions. \"Working over the years with a host of talented and dedicated people, we have continued to serve the indigent women in the Dallas area for Ob/Gyn care through Parkland Hospital. Our program has trained hundreds of Ob/Gyn residents and fellows who are now community practitioners - many in Dallas - and providing expert care for women in gyne - cology, obstetrics, gynecological oncology, family planning, and pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery,\" he said. \"Our Department was so pleased to learn that Dr. Cunningham was selected to receive this prestigious honor,\" said Steven Bloom, M.D, Associate Dean for Clinical Sciences and former Chair of Obstetrics and Gyne - cology. \"Through his bedside teaching, his authorship of major textbooks and scientific papers, and his mentorship, Dr. Cunningham has made so many of us - both at UT S outh - western and beyond - better physicians.\" Gary Cunningham, M.D.NEWS MAKERPage 7 OctOber 2021 By Jan Jarvis Samir Parikh, M.D., had one eye on the rich history of UT Southwestern and the other on its promising future when he accepted the position of Chief of the Division of Nephrology in the Depart - ment of Internal Medicine. \"This institution has a reputation for being dedi- cated to research, serving the needs of the patient popu - lation, and being a unique environment for biomedical education,\" he said. \"Very few places look far into the future, but I think this is one of those places. That is exciting and something I wanted to be a part of.\" \"Dr. Parikh is an outstanding physician-scientist who reflects the ideals of the clinical scholar exempli - fied by the late Donald Seldin, M.D.,\" said Thomas Wang, M.D., Chair of Internal Medicine. Dr. Seldin led the Department of Internal Medi - cine from 1952 until 1988 and is viewed as the intellectual father of UT Southwestern. \"We have an outstanding and historic Nephrology Division, and I am excited to see it continue to advance under Dr. Parikh's leadership,\" Dr. Wang said.Dr. Parikh, also Professor of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, brings an enthusiasm for research, teaching, and clinical care to his new role and has focused on kidney disease throughout his career. \"Kidney disease is extremely common, but it's also complex and silent,\" he said. \"Other than transplan - tation, there's really no magic bullet for our patients.\" To date, Dr. Parikh's research has emphasized mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury and sepsis. His work has sought to understand how patients with kidney disease survive major stressors such as surgery or severe infection. Dr. Parikh was recruited to UT Southwestern from Harvard Medical School, where he was Prof essor of Medicine and Associate Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a degree in chemistry and later received the Founder's Medal for highest academic standing from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Dr. Parikh, who completed residency and fellowship training in nephrology at Beth Israel Deaconess and Harvard, has mentored more than 10 trainees who have attained the job title of Assistant Professor or higher. The pandemic was among the factors in his decision to join UTSW. Like many people, he chose to focus more on his long-term goals because of COVID-19 and its worldwide impact. \"I started asking myself, 'How can I find a way to make more of an impact?'\" Dr. Parikh said. He found his answer at UT Southwestern. \"We have truly distinguished faculty in Nephrology, and our fellows are among the best in the nation. It is a privilege to join this dedicated group as we try to improve the health of North Texas kidney patients,\" he said. \"We have people here thinking about what comes next and how medicine will look in five, 10, 20 years.\" Dr. Parikh holds the Robert Tucker Hayes Distinguished Chair in Nephrology, in Honor of Dr. Floyd C. Rector, Jr., and the Ruth W. and Milton P. Levy, Sr. Chair in Molecular Nephrology. Dr. Wang holds the Donald W. Seldin Distin - guished Chair in Internal Medicine. Samir Parikh, M.D. Parikh joins UT Southwestern as Chief of Nephrology Division Levine receives award for NASA research Benjamin Levine, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and Director of the Insti - tute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine (IEEM), has been awarded the 2021 Jeffrey P. Sutton Scientific Achievement Award for his work with NASA studying spaceflight's effect on the human body. The IEEM is a partnership between UT Southwestern and Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas. The annual award from the Space Medi - cine Association recognizes an individual or team for research with significant scholarship, innovation, and impact for space medicine. The award was presented by Jeffrey Sutton, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"As a clinical cardiologist and expert in space physiology, Ben has been a valuable resource to NASA in evaluating and managing cardiovas - cular problems in astronauts,\" Dr. Sutton said, noting Dr. Levine also has mentored countless students and served in substantial scientific lead - ership roles. \"However, it is in space biomedical research where Dr. Levine has truly excelled, making him most deserving of this award.\" Over three decades ago, Dr. Levine applied to be a NASA astronaut. Being disqualified - he's colorblind - was a good thing. It gave Dr. Levine the opportunity to ask key questions as a researcher. As a young physician-scientist, Dr. Levine placed the first invasive central venous pres - sure catheters in astronauts, demonstrating that central venous pressure decreases rather than increases in space, as had been previ - ously thought. He also defined the concept of cardiac atrophy as it applies to bedrest and spaceflight - and identified specific interven - tions to prevent it. Dr. Levine's ambitious series of experiments in the Shuttle era found that sympathetic nerve activity is increased in space - findings that pointed the scientific community toward the mechanisms of reduced stroke volume. In addition, his team discovered that adequate exercise aboard the International Space Station could prevent cardiac atrophy and orthostatic intolerance, Dr. Sutton noted. \"Some of the most exciting and rewarding work I have done in my career has been to address the critical research questions regarding the cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight,\" Dr. Levine said. \"This research effort has also led to one of my areas of clinical expertise, which is taking care of patients with 'gravity diseases' - that is, those who can't stand up on Earth, or faint. The ability to merge my research focus with an important clinical application is one of the true joys of academic medicine, and I am grateful to NASA and my colleagues in space medicine for this opportunity and recognition.\" Dr. Levine holds the Distinguished Profes - sorship in Exercise Sciences.

Often, he had to use fake body parts and wounds he had fashioned from plastic to familiarize soldiers with what they might face. Today, Mr. Atkinson, a Senior Operations Specialist in UT South - western's Simulation Center, uses sophisticated 3D printers to create simulated body parts and training tools for the hundreds of physicians, medical students, and other health care professionals who train here. UT Southwestern is one of the few medical schools in the U.S. with such an expansive 3D model development operation, allowing creation of special - ized plastic body parts and tissue - simulated bones, ears, hands, and more - using six 3D printing machines. In Afghanistan, explained Mr. Atkinson, a former Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class, the goal was to make medics intimately familiar with war injuries so that they could perform effectively while treating amputated limbs and bullet wounds as gunfire exploded around them. While most UT Southwestern grad - uates and physicians will never face such conditions, honing their exper - tise on sophisticated manikins and stitching wounds in silicone suture molds benefits both them and the people they treat, said Daniel Scott, M.D., Assistant Dean, Simulation and Student Integration, Graduate Medical Education, and Professor of Surgery. \"Training people in the Simulation Center translates into better patient care without having to practice in the clinical environment,\" Dr. Scott said. In fact, an early study examining this issue, published in 2000 in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons with Dr. Scott as first author, determined that such training improved laparoscopic surgery skills of surgery residents during actual operations. Mr. Atkinson, along with fellow 3D expert and Senior Clinical Simulation Educator Rahm Heymann, now are working on an advanced suture pad for training in laparoscopic surgery. The pad will enable learners to practice suturing while using the less-invasive equipment of laparoscopic surgery, which relies on tiny cameras and surgical tools to operate through small incisions. The pad is a 5-inch strip of flesh-colored silicone with two rows of dots to provide practice targets for learners to place laparoscopic sutures. Dr. Scott, past President of the Association for Surgical Education, is working with the 3D team to develop the pad for possible use in the Asso - ciation's Advanced Training in Lapa - roscopic Suturing (ATLAS) program. The goal, Dr. Scott said, is to create a training device that will be more durable and lifelike than the suture pads trainees now use. The 3D team already makes the suture pads available for medical students to practice conventional suturing. Holding a pad with its simu - lated wounds ready for stitching, Mr. Atkinson points out the four separate layers - two simulated skin layers atop a sticky \"fat\" layer, with a \"muscle\" layer at the base. UT Southwestern used to purchase similar pads from vendors, but they were less durable, less realistic, and had only three layers, he said. Plus, they cost more than it costs the 3D team to make them, Mr. Atkinson added. The 3D team also created an \"ear\" to train students on how to suture that tricky body part, said Krystle Campbell, Director of Simulation Center Operations. \"It's challenging to suture on a patient's ear,\" she said. While difficult to treat, ear lacera - tions occasionally show up in the Emer - gency Department as patients come in from traffic accidents and other mishaps, thus it is important that UTSW trainees have an opportunity to practice this delicate skill on a simulated ear prior to suturing on real patients. Joseph Martinez, M.D., a Professor of Emergency Medicine who helped lead the development of the ear model, said he values the Simulation Center's 3D capabilities - in particular the Center's ability to create training models for procedures that might occur rarely but where proficiency is very important. \"The 3D models created at the Sim Center provide precise models for the specific skills being taught,\" he said, which is something outside vendors cannot always do. Mr. Atkinson said UT S outhwest - ern's 3D machines can make higher- quality models at lower cost and also repair some of the sophisticated, life - like manikins used for training in the Simulation Center. The boxlike metal machines - ranging in size from less than 2 feet tall to one almost 4 feet long, large enough to build a human torso - line the walls of the Simulation Center's Innova - tion Lab. Containers of different plas - tics and color pigments cover a table. Melted plastic is fed into the printers, then pushed out into a preprogrammed shape, much like a baker would push decorative icing onto a cake. The Center is pursuing marketing some of its creations, said Ms. Campbell. \"We have unusual models that you don't see on the market,\" she said. The ATLAS mold is one possibility, she said. A second is a novel simula - tion being developed with Jeffrey Kenkel, M.D., Chair of Plastic Surgery, that is designed to solve a clinical problem facing those in the field. \"We had a concept that required design, materials consideration, and implementation with the experts at the Simulation Center,\" said Dr. Kenkel. \"Our group is top-notch, from administration and implementation of a plan to design and production.\" Dr. Scott recalls the days when he was training to become a surgeon and needed a way to practice suturing. He jury-rigged a device by twisting two rubber exam gloves and pinning them inside a wooden box. \"I sutured two gloves together,\" he said As a clinician and a researcher, he has helped transform such training for today's students. \"We're much further along than where we started a mere 20 years ago,\" he said of simulation training in general. And when it comes to 3D work, \"not too many are doing what we're doing in creating our own models.\" \"It all translates to better patient care,\" he said of the end result.
