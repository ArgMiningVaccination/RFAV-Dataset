With her team, which included a nutritionist, psychotherapist, exercise physiologist, chiropractor, acupuncturist and other physicians, she was determined to get to the root cause of disease for each patient and for herself. Not only did she have the joy of witnessing hundreds of success stories thanks to a holistic approach, she experienced firsthand the power of healing as she lost 50 pounds and beat hypothyroidism, eczema, sebhorrheic dermatitis, acne, fatigue, alopecia, joint pain, weight and digestive issues, all while balancing a growing family and work!
