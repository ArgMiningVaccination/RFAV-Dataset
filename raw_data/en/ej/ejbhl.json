But those who do will find aromatherapy at least part of the answer to them. Ideally it will be used in combination with a complete herbal program. Menopause symptoms include hot flashes, bone fragility, confusion, depression, and a dry, less elastic vagina with a thinner lining -- all thought to be caused by the erratic activity or insufficiency of hormones. Several essential oils that contain hormonelike substances related to estrogen are helpful during menopause. These include clary sage, anise, fennel, cypress, angelica, coriander, sage, and to a lesser degree, basil. Such essential oils, along with peppermint and lemon, will help relieve hot flashes. Since essential oils go right through the skin, applying them to fatty areas of the body where hormones are manufactured and stored will create the most direct effect. Of course, any massage is itself very therapeutic. A bath is also a wonderful way to receive the benefits of these oils. Advertisement Geranium, neroli, and lavender are balance hormones and also help modify menopausal symptoms. They are traditionally used in European face creams to reduce aging and wrinkles. As a rejuvenation cream, these oils not only perk up a dry complexion, they make a good cream to counter vaginal dryness. Add some vitamin E oil, which improves the strength and flexibility of the vaginal lining while quickly healing abrasions that can occur during intercourse when the lining is too dry. In addition to aromatherapy, try dietary and herbal treatments to alleviate some of menopause's unpleasant symptoms.
