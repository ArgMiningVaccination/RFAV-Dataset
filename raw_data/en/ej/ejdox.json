Health providers ' knowledge and attitudes about vaccines are important determinants of their own vaccine uptake, their intention to recommend vaccines to patients and the vaccine uptake of their patients. The purpose of this article is to compare how midwives and physicians address vaccination with parents during pregnancy and in postpartum visits. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with midwives and physicians practicing in the province of Quebec, Canada. Results of our analysis have shown that physicians adopt an \"education-information \" stance when discussing vaccination with parents in the attempt to \"convince \" parents to vaccinate. In contrast, midwives adopted a neutral stance and gave information on the pros and cons of vaccination to parents while leaving the final decision...

Although adherence to childhood vaccination scheduled by age 24 months in the United States is high, pediatricians continue to be challenged by vaccine hesitancy. In my pediatric practice, I have presented historical facts regarding pre- and postvaccination morbidity and mortality reports to parents in my prenatal sessions. These presentations persuaded many, if not most, vaccine-hesitant parents to accept vaccination for their children. Having used this method successfully in my 50 years of pediatric practice, I recommend that pediatricians try to make a serious effort to present this information to parents to convince them that vaccines can safely prevent serious and deadly infections in their children and community. Pediatrics 2007 Despite the dangers of vaccine-preventable infections and efforts by health care professionals to promote immunization, parents' resistance to routine childhood immunizations continues to grow. This phenomenon can give rise to frustration among health care providers, as well as create barriers in providing medical care to children in need. In response, we developed a CD-ROM-based tutorial that (1) explains the nature and origins of parents' concerns, (2) addresses clinical implications of resistance to immunization, (3) explores ethical and professional obligations that physicians have toward children and their parents, and (4) discusses how physicians can effectively address parents' concerns. Our goals were to evaluate the tutorial's effectiveness in improving physicians' (1) general knowledge about parents' resistance to childhood immunizations, (2) knowledge of adverse effects of immunization, and (3) attitudes toward parents' resistance to childhood ...
