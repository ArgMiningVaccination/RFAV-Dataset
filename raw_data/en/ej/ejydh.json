Minimum \u00a340 per year Sustainability The magazine is produced to a high environmental standard, using sustainably sourced and uncoated paper, and vegetable-based inks. Natur Cymru is a charitable initiative. All the magazine's content is donated by volunteers, who write all our articles, as well as supporting the inclusion of stunning artwork and photographs. We are dependent on the incredible generosity of the magazine's supporters in this regard. The magazine meets a need for a journal of record about the wildlife and natural resources of Wales, whilst also uniquely filling a publishing gap between a news magazine and an academic journal. In this way it fulfils an especially important role of enabling non-specialists as well as specialists to engage with this important agenda, and in an enjoyable way. It also helps interested parties to engage with each other, and the diverse work being done in Wales. In this way it seeks to raise our collective level of knowledge and understanding of our natural environment. Welsh Language in Natur Cymru Within the resources available [, Natur Cymru also seeks to support the Welsh language ](https://natureconservation.wales/natur-cymru/welsh-language-position-statement-natur-cymru/)within the natural environment community by sourcing articles written in Welsh. It also supports Welsh learners by making a proportion of content available side-by-side in both languages. "}
