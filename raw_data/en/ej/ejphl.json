I had the pleasure of learning from you 3 years ago at an earlier Summit and have used the bladder meridian sweep ever since! I knew that I needed to stay up and listen to this interview and I'm so glad that I did! Our 13-year-old yellow lab was panting and pacing in the night (he gets confused) and I used the V technique and he flopped his head back on his bed and fell asleep!\" \"Our rickety old boxer Trey is still with us and in the best shape of her life thanks to this veterinary team. Dr. Todd is as talented as she is compassionate, and simply the only veterinary chiropractor that I trust.\" \"We are still enjoying the company of our fifteen year old dog, Casey, because of the spinal adjustment, cold laser and acupuncture treatments administered by Dr. Todd. \" \"Tanner the dog, now 11, has seen them for the past 5 years, and Dr. Todd and team have navigated him through life-concerning health problems. They are always compassionate, very professional, very knowledgeable. \" BRINGING HOLISTIC VETERINARY HEALING AND EDUCATION TO YOU We are a mobile equine and canine alternative therapy practice. We specialize in acupuncture, chiropractic and cold laser therapies. Acupuncture for Dogs, Cats & Horses Acupuncture works with the body's natural energy source and when that energy becomes disrupted, sickness and pain can occur. Treatments help relieve pain, stimulate healing at the cellular level, as well as increase well-being and longevity. Acupuncture is often used to treat dogs, cats, horses and other animals with inflammation, chronic and or acute back, joint pain and even treat serious spinal cord conditions. Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation (VOM) Similar to Chiropractics, Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation (VOM) is a healing technique that identifies areas of the animal's nervous system that is not aligned or responding as expected and re-establishing neural communication to induce healing. The orthopedic manipulation is done using an Activator instrument, an noninvasive tool used on the body, to treat acute, non-acute and progressive pain which may include neck and back pain to lameness, hip dysplasia and other injuries in dogs, cats and horses. Cold Laser Therapy Cold laser therapy is a noninvasive procedure that uses light to stimulate cell regeneration and increase blood circulation. Cold laser therapy does not produce heat and treats the surface of the skin in contrast to hot laser treatments that have a greater risk of causing harm due to the intensity and heat of the laser beams. Cold Laser Therapy paired with Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation (VOM) and Acupuncture are the heart of Dr. Todd's practice. Combined these treatments improve health and achieve optimum performance while providing compassionate and gentle care. "}
