Required Inspection Procedures The procedures set forth in this Chapter are procedures that must be followed by the inspector when conducting an inspection. If you, the inspector, are unsure of a required procedure, contact your Supervisory Animal Care Sp ecialist (SACS) . For more detailed general inspection procedures, refer to Chapter 3. General Requirements When conducting an inspection, the inspector must follow the general requirements listed below: Do not enter facilities with locked gates and/or \"No Trespassing\" signs unless you obtain prior approval from the facility If you arrive at the facility and determine that it is not appropriate to conduct an inspection, refer to Deciding Not to Conduct an Inspection If you do not find anyone at the facility, follow the Attempted Inspection proc edure to complete an Attempted Inspection Prior to notifying the facility of your presence, inspectors may observe and record findings without being accompanied by a facility representative at facilities that are open to the public . Identify yourself to the licensee immediately after the observat ion. Before documenting findings on an Inspection Report, the inspector must discuss the findings with a facility representative. You must be accompanied by the licensee, registrant, or the facility's designated representative (who must be at least 18 years of age) Conduct a complete exit interview --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-4 2.2. Safety Inspector Safety If you feel you are in imminent danger, promptly leave the area. The licensee/registrant/applicant is responsible for ensuring the safety of the inspector during the inspection. If you feel at all unsafe, ask the licensee/ registrant/applicant to correct the situation . If the licensee/registrant/applicant does anything you feel is unsafe, state that you will leave the facility immediately unless the situation is corrected. [2.4] Biosafety In all situations, follow the facility's visitor biosafety procedures, and/or put on recommended protective clothing, gear, and/or boots. Inspectors must : Wear disposable shoe covers during dog kennel inspections Wear disposable shoe covers during avian inspections in areas that are not open to the public Wear disposable gloves if it is necessary to touch an animal at all facilities Change gloves between animals or between enclosures For more specific biosafety procedures, see Biosafety Measures in Chapter 3 and the AC Safety & Health Manual . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-5 2.3. Inspection Steps Basic steps to follow in conducti ng a R outine I nspection of a facility include, but are not limited to: Review previous Inspection Reports with special attention to Veterinary Care and Direct Noncompliant Items (NCIs) and animal inventories Review Customer content in eFile , including but not limited to, status of license, address, comment section and RBIS Inspect the animals, premises, building(s), enclosures, equipment, and transportation vehicles/equipment for all pertinent requirements of the Regulations and Standards Ensure that all primary enclosures can safely contain the animals Review the facility's program of veterinary care, husbandry practices, required records , Contingency Plan, and, when appropriate, the \"Exercise Plan for Dogs\", and the plan for environmental enhancement for nonhuman primates (Optional APHIS Form 7050 may be used) and/or birds When possible, observe the animal handling techniques of facility personnel [2.131] Consider problems that may occur at other times of the year NOTICE Inspection steps are covered in detail i n General Inspection Procedures in Chapter 3. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-6 2.4. Inspection Findings Document inspection findings in the narrative section of the Inspection Report. Do not type any personal identifiable information (PII) or confidential or proprietary business information in the narrative of any Inspection Report, including addresses and phone numbers. No Noncompliant Items (NCIs) Identified If all items are in compliance, eFile will put t he following statement on the Inspection Report: \"No noncompliant items identified during this inspection.\" For inspections in response to an incident or complaint, further review may be needed to determine compliance . If you are uncertain whether a noncompliance was involved, do not write an Inspection Report. Discuss the findings with your SACS to determine what action is needed. For Site Approval Inspections , eFile will put the following statement on the Inspection Report: \"No noncompliant items identified during this inspection. This site is now approved for regulated activity.\" New NCIs Cited If an NCI(s) is cited in the Inspection Report narrative, the citation should include the following four parts: 1. The section number and most specific subsection letter/number of each noncompliance 2. A clear, detailed description of the noncompliance including, when approp riate, the number of animals affected 3. An explanation of why the item is a noncompliance and/or the impact it is having on the animals 4. A correction deadline and a \"general\" description of what the licensee/ registrant should do to correct the problem and assure that it does not continue/recur . This description should not be worded in such a way that it could be interpreted that AC is mandating how an NCI is going to be corrected . A correction deadline should be appropriate to the severity of the NCI, and unless animal welfare will be put in jeopardy, be realistic as to what the facility can accomplish. Use \"Direct\" or \"Critical\" NCI designation, if appropriate. NOTICE If a noncompliant item falls into more than one section or subsection, cite the noncompliance only in the most applicable section or subsection for each species affected. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-7 Repeat NCI NCIs cited in the same section and subsection on the last inspection (rou tine, focused or Relicense) or cited at least 3 times within the past three years (including the current citation) will be automatically designated as a \"Repeat\" in eFile. For Attempted Inspections, Section 2.126(b) or 2.38(b) cited on the last inspection or the third citation in two years will be automatically designated as a \"Repeat\" in eFile. It is the inspector's responsibility to make sure that the \"Repeat\" designation is correct. Remember: Do not include correction dates for Repeat NCIs. Recurring/Chronic NCI A recurring or chronic noncompliant item is the same or a similar noncompliance that is not found on consecutive inspections, i.e., it is cited on one inspection, corrected by the next inspection, then re -occurs on the third and/or a subsequent inspection. The recurring noncompliance can be: A noncompliance of the same s ection and subsection of the Regulations or Standards The sa me noncompliance with the same section and subsection of the Regulations or Standards but identified for a different species The same or a similar noncompliance as cited earlier Some factors to consider when deciding if the NCI is recurring or chronic include, but are not limited to: Have you discussed the development of an active program or system of maintenance with the licensee/registrant? Have you discussed the NCI with a person of higher authority at the facility? Have you noticed a pattern? How far back was the last time the NCI was cited? How many inspections have been conducted between the recurrences? What is the severity of the NCI? Use your professional judgment in deciding what action to take, such as: Citing the NCI as a new noncompliant item Citing the NC I as a Repeat NCI NOTICE On Prelicense Inspections or New Site Approval Inspection, an NCI should not be designated as a \"Repeat\". --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-8 Discussing the NCI with your SACS \"Critical\" NCI Identified Critical NCIs are the following : Direct NCIs (see description below) NCIs that had a serious or severe adverse effect on the health and well -being of the animal . Examples include, but are not limited to: o Lack of an attending veterinarian with documented adverse effects on the health or well-being of an animal that require immediate veterinary care o Studies involving more than momentary pain and distress to an animal that are conducted at research facilities without an approved protocol and without an appropriate response from the Institu tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) o Failure of an IACUC to meet and/or conduct facility and program reviews for a period of time equal to or greater than 1 year resulting in documented, adverse effects on the health or well -being of an animal o Actions or inactions of unqualified personnel resulting in documented, adverse effects on the health or well -being of an animal o Handling violation that resulted in death or serious injury to an animal o Escape of an animal resulting in adverse effects on the hea lth or well - being of the animal (NOTE: this includes those situations when an animal is not recovered) Inspection refusals and situations where APHIS has been unable to inspect the facility for a significant amount of time due to chronic unavailability fo r inspections Records intentionally falsified to mislead APHIS or another government agency NCI resulting in an injury requiring immediate medical attention or death to a human Handling an animal in a manner that results in an animal attack or physical contact between an animal and a member of the public, depending on the circumstances, such as where the incident adversely affected the health or well- being of the animal, or the circumstances or practices that caused the incident posed a high risk to the ani mal and/or the human and could have led to serious injury or death to the animal and/ or the human Interference with, harassment, abuse, or threatening to harass or abuse an APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties Obtained an animal from any person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, unsuspended license and knew both 1) that --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-9 the person the animal was obtained from does not hold a license, and 2) that the person was required to hold a license Knowingl y obtaining random source dogs or cats from a prohibited source, or obtaining animals by use of false pretenses, misrepresentation, or deception Engaging in regulated activity with a suspended or revoked license \"Direct\" NCI Identified A \"Direct\" noncompli ance is a Critical noncompliance that is currently (at the time of the inspection) having a serious or severe adverse effect on the health and well -being of the animal. The severity of a n NCI at the time of a prior adverse incident has no impact on whether an NCI should be marked as a Critical or a Direct . The determining factor for a Direct is whether it has a current serious or severe adverse impact at the time of the inspection. See Appendix C - NCI/Direct/Critical Noncompliance Examples. Correction Date Guidelines When assigning a correction date, note the following: If the \"Direct\" NCI was corrected at the time of the inspection, a correction date is not necessary For an egregious Direct noncompliance, the correction date should be very short, e.g., 1 day, and the reinspection should o ccur within a short period of time after the correction date to verify the correction and ensure animal welfare The correction deadline for a \"Direct\" noncompliance should never exceed 14 days A comp lete or f ocused reinspection of a facility with a \"Direct\" NCI must be completed within 14 days of the i nspection date . You must conduct a reinspection at the facility even if the \"Direct\" NCI was corrected during the inspection. Direct NCI on a New Site Approval Inspection If a Direct NCI is identified on a New Site Approval inspection: Designate the NCI as a \"Direct\", and Assign an appropriate correction date, and NOTICE On Prelicense Inspections, NCIs should not be designated as \"Direct.\" --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-10 Inform the licensee that an inspection will be conducted on or after the correction da te to see if the Direct NCI was corrected \"Veterinary Care Direct\" NCI Identified Not every veterinary care NCI affecting an animal is a Direct. A vet erinary care noncompliance is a \"Direct \" if: The noncompliance is currently (at the time of the inspection) having a serious or severe adverse effect on the health and well -being of the animal, and The licensee/registrant has not sought veterinary care for the animal prior to the inspection When citing a veterinary care \"Direct\" NCI: Include the ID of the animal if applicable and a description of the animal (species, breed, color, sex, age, etc.) in the NCI narrative Take a photo of the entire animal and a photo(s) and/or video of the area cited in the NCI A correction date, if given, should be very short, e.g., 1 day If the animal(s) has been taken to the veterinarian and care has been provided, including humane euthanasia when directed by the veterinarian, prior to your completion of the inspection, note in the narrative that the animal(s) was evaluated an d treated by a veterinarian Do not interfere with the licensee obtaining immediate veterinary care for an animal if needed. For a vet erinary care Direct corrected at the time of the inspection, n ote that the Direct was corrected on the original Inspection Report. Handwritten or \"Word\" Inspection Reports If you are unable to complete the Inspection Report in eFile , then complete the Word Template on your laptop or handwrite a report. In the event that your laptop is unavailable, carry several hard copies of the template. If you completed a handwritten or Word Inspection Report: Enter the Inspection Report into eFile as soon as possible but no later than 5 business days after the inspection On the eFile Inspection Report: o Do not put a statement that this is e lectronic or transcribed version of the original Inspection Report If the eFile Inspection Report is exactly the same as the handwritten or Word Inspection Report, a copy does not have to be sent to the licensee/registrant --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-11 If the eFile Inspection Report and the original handwritten or Word Inspection Report are different, for example, all the dates are not the same, a copy must be sent to the licensee/registrant For more details on Handwritten Inspection Reports, see Section 3.3.18. Airp ort Inspections The inspector is not required to de liver airline Inspection Report with no NCIs at airports at the time of the inspection. The no NCI Inspection Report may be sent by regular mail or emailed to the appropriate airline corporate office (Inspector must obtain an email address from the airline facility representative) . See Chapter 4 - Airport Inspections for details . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-12 2.5. Inspection Photographs Photographs/Videos Documenting Noncompliances Photographs or videos must be taken to document photographable noncompliant item(s) in all of the following situations and only in these situations unless instructed otherwise by your SAC S: Direct, Criticals, or Repeats NCIs (if photographable) NCIs cited at a facility with an ongoing Investigative and Enforcement Services (IES) investigation and/or case pending with the Office of the General Counsel NCIs where there is a disagreement between you and the licensee/registrant and the licensee/registrant has indicated he/she will, or is likely to , appeal the citation All NCIs cited at commercial airline carrier inspections Veterinary Care NCIs involving animals: o Photograph(s) or video(s) every animal covered by the citation o Photograph(s) or video(s) the entire animal for identification purposes and photo(s) of the issue cited in the NCI o Photograph labels must clearly identify the animal NCIs cited on the Third Prelicense Inspec tion for an applicant who was not previously licensed and is applying for a new (3 year) license since the NCI(s) may be appealed For a licensee who is currently licensed and is now applying for a 3- year license: o Any Repeat, Critical, or Direct NCIs docume nted on the First and/or Second Prelicense Inspection o Any NCIs cited on the Third Prelicense Inspection since the NCI(s) may be appealed For veterinary care citations, take photograph(s) or video(s) of every animal covered by the citation, including matted dogs. For facility citations, such as pens with broken wire, take a few representative photographs to prove that there was an NCI but not a photograph of every cage or area. Photocopy, scan, or photograph records that: Document a Repeat, Direct, Critical, or transportation noncompliant item May be fraudulent If copies of research facility records, protocols, or IACUC minutes are going to be photographed and removed from the facility, the facility will be afforded the --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-13 opportunity to review/redact the reco rds for proprietary business information . The inspector should allow the facility 24 to 48 hours for this purpose. Label and upload all pho tograph(s) or video(s) that are to be retained into eFile as soon as possible, but no later than 2 weeks after the i nspection. Delete any inspection photos that you are not uploading into eFile in connection with an NCI. Do not store or save unused photos. SACS may have inspectors take additional photographs, in addition to the required photos listed above. Showing Photos during Exit Interview The inspector should show the photographs taken during the inspection to the licensee/registrant on the inspector's lapt op at the time of the exit interview . This is to be used as a tool to clarify an NCI(s) for the licensee/registrant and to create an open dialog around correction. Licensee/Registrant Requesting Photographs A licensee/registrant may request a copy of the photographs taken during the inspection process . If the licensee/registrant requests a copy of any photograph(s), the inspector should email the requested photographs that were uploaded into eFile to the licensee/registrant, after they have been uploaded . If the number of photos requested cannot be reasonably emailed due to the size or quantity of the photographs, a flash drive containing the remaining photographs should be supplied by the inspector. For licensees/registrants without email access, a reas onable number of photographs can be printed by the inspector (no more than three pages of photos ). If more photographs were taken than can be reasonably printed by the inspector, a flash drive containing the remaining photographs should be supplied by the inspector . If other reasonable accommodations are needed, the individual accommod ation is to be approved by the i nspector's SACS prior to distribution of the photographs. Only photographs that have been uploaded to eFile shou ld be supplied by the inspect or to the licensee/registrant. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-14 2.6. Inspection Inventory The animal inventory is an important component of the inspection. This is the formal record of how many animals of each species Animal Care personnel observed/inspected during inspection. It is important that this is accurate, and care must be taken both during the inspection and when entering this information into eFile . Before the Inspection Review and print or download a copy of the last inspection inventory prior to going to the facility Familiarize yourself with the natural history and specific needs of any animals that you are likely to encounter on that inspection (if you aren't already) During the Inspection Countable Species Wheneve r possible, inspectors must count the number s of animals for each species . Make sure to keep accurate notes throughout the inspection. For species that are countable, make sure you compare your numbers to the facility's record of animals on hand. If ther e are any discrepancies make sure to ask the facility representative about those differences . It could be that one or more animals are currently away from the facility, but this may also indicate an error in their record -keeping or in the inspector's coun t. Compare the current record of animals on hand to the prior inventory . If there are additions or animals that are missing, make sure to carefully check the facility's acquisition/disposition records to make sure those animals are accounted for . Difficult to Count Species Some animals are difficult to count during inspection . This can occur when: Animals are kept in large groups ( e.g., herding animals) NOTICE Because the inventory is a record of what Animal Care inspe ctors observed, the inventory included with the report may be different than the total number of animals maintained by the facility . For example, differences can occur when conducting a Focused I nspection on a few individual animals or specific taxa only , or if there are animals away from the facility during the inspection ( e.g., those away on traveling exhibition or animals at an off -site veterinary clinic for care). --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-15 Species that are prone to piling on top of one another ( e.g., harem housing for guinea pigs) Nocturnal animals in dimly lit enclosures Many birds kept in a large aviary In these cases, inspectors should attempt to count animals during the inspection and keep notes as normally required . Following the physical inspection: Evaluate the facility's method of record keeping and compare your numbers to the facility's number s of animals on hand Some discrepancy between these two numbers is likely due to the difficulty in counting The inspector's numbers and the facility's numbers should be within 10% of each other If there is greater than a 10% difference , the inspector should ask the facility follow -up questions, then: o If the inspector is satisfied with the facility's explanation, the facility's animal numbers should be recorded on the inventory o If the facility and inspector cannot come to agreement on the inventory numbers, the inspector should contact his/her SACS for instructions on how to resolve the disagreement Species/Circumstances where Accurate Counts are Impossible Occasionally animals are not able to be accurately counted during the inspection. For example, this can occur when: There are nocturnal animals in nest boxes or hide areas Breeding or nesting birds in a nest box There are burrowing animals that are all underground during inspection There are large numbers of the same species in expansive habitats ( e.g., fallow deer at some drive through parks) In these circumstances, the animals can and should be included on the inventory provided that they were included in the inspection. As long as the enclosure, diet, food storage/prep areas, veterinary care records , etc., were inspected, those animals should be included on the inventory . Under these circumstances, the inspector should closely evaluate the facility's required records, including re cords of acquisition, disposition, and animals on hand. If the facility records are accurate and contain all of the required information, the numbers of animals on hand provided by the facility should be used for inventory purposes . If the facility does not have the required records, or the records they have are missing required information, this should be documented as a noncompliance on --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-16 the Inspection Report. When this occurs, you should estimate the animal numbers present and use that number on the inventory; it should be made clear on the Inspection Report that the numbers were estimated. Occasionally none of the individual animals may be visible during the inspection. If that occurs on multiple consecutive inspections, consider ways that you can increase your chances of visualizing animals during the inspection . That may involve inspecting at a different time of year ( e.g., hibernating animals) or coming back to that enclosure later in the day ( e.g., for nocturnal animals) . Your SACS may have additional suggestions relevant to a particular facility. Inventory on Focused Inspections When conducting a Focused Inspection, only list those species and animal counts that you inspected on the inventory . Either enter a new inventory for the Focused I nspection or copy the previous inventory and delete the species not inspected . Do not copy the previous animal inventory and leave species that weren't inspected. For inspections that are focused on records only, your inventory should report no animals. After the Inspection The inspector is required: To enter the animal inventory into eFile To discuss and agree upon animal numbers with the licensee/registrant during the exit interview To provide the animal inventory list as p art of the Inspection R eport The inventory must be entered into eFile and finalized. This should be completed as soon as possible and must be completed no later 5 days following the conclusion of the inspection. SACS may grant an extension to this deadline if there are extenuating circ umstances preventing timely finalization of the inventory . Difficulty Locating a Species in eFile If you are having trouble locating a species in eFile , here are a few tips: Check your spelling . Spelling matters here . Check the spelling and if that doesn't work, try varying any hyphens or apostrophes in the name Try searching alternate common names . For example, many licensees still use the outdated name \"Coatimundi\" when referencing the South American will not return records . Search partial names Search the scientific name (genus and/or species) If you still can't find a particular species in eFile , reach out to your SACS for --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-17 assistance . If together you still can't find it, reach out to the Animal Welfare Operations ( AWO) Inventory Support Team . If it turns out that the species is currently missing from eFile, this team will need to request the addition. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-18 2.7. Exit Interview An exit interview is required for all inspections (complete or focused) , unless your personal safety is at risk, or harassment, verbal abuse, or other factors are interfering with the inspection process. Conduct an in -person exit interview with the draft Inspection Report in hand if the licensee/registrant requests the opportunity to review the NCI narrative(s) prior to finalization of the Inspection Report. Take as much time as necessary during the exit interview to: Discuss animal welfare and the AWA Regulations and Standards with the licensee/registrant Summarize everything that occurred during the inspection, and provide the licensee or registrant an opportunity to present additional information that may influence the determination of compliance Discuss each noncompliant item in detail with the licensee/registrant or facility representative . If the lic ensee or registrant provides information or documentation that influences an NCI on the current version of the Inspection Report, modify the report to accurately reflect the compliance of the facility before it is issued. Show the licensee or registrant any photos/videos taken during the inspection to communicate exactly what the noncompliance is (See Licensee/Registrant Requesting Photographs ) Inquire about what the licensee/registrant might consider doing to correct the problem and discuss options with him/her (if asked ) Discuss the animal inventory and animal counts with the licensee . Ensure all species and numbers are correct prior to finalizing the inventory report and provide a copy of the finalized inventory report to the licensee with the Inspection Report. Unless an exit interview could not be completed (for example, it is unsafe or there may not be an exit interview for a carrier inspection at an airport), a statement must be added to the Inspection Reports through eFile stating, \"This inspection and exit interview were conducted with ____.\" Do not use actual names of facility representative or personnel, only titles . NOTICE If the Inspection Report is to be delivered by email or certified mail, you must still conduct a detailed and thorough exit interview. Any item that you will be citing on the Inspection Report must be discussed during the exit interview. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-19 2.8. Delivery of the Inspection Report You must hand deliver Inspection Reports with Direct NCIs unless you obtain SACS approval to do otherwise. Hand delivery is preferred fo r all inspections except for Attempted Inspections . However, Inspection Reports may be delivered via email or certified mail, if necessary . Inspection Reports with no NCIs may be sent by regular first-class mail or email; it is not necessary to send by certified mail. First Attempted Inspection Reports may be sent by regular first -class mail or email. Second Repeat Attempted Inspection Reports must be sent by email or by both certified mail and regular mail. For all delivery methods, the Inspection Report must be delivered or sent to the facility as soon as possible but no later than 5 business days after the inspection. Obtain SACS approval if you cannot meet this deadline. If sent by email , the inspector must convert the Inspection Report to a PDF, so it cannot be altered and must request an email reply verifying receipt of the Inspection Report by the facility . If an email reply is not received within 5 business days from the day it was sent, the inspector must deliver the report by another method so that receipt can be verified. When sending an Inspection Report by certified mail , enter the certified mail information into eFile . Be sure to include the CID # on the Green Card and scan the Certified Mail receipt into Part 3 of the IR in eFile Signature on the Inspection Report The inspector and the licensee/registrant are not required to sign the IR. Any licensee/registrant with a disagreement about the inspection findings may follow the inspection appeals process . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-20 2.9.

Deciding Not to Conduct an Inspection In some circumstances when you arrive at the facility, you may determine that it is not appropriate to conduct an inspection. If you are unsure whether you should conduct an inspection, or if this is a recurring issue at this facility, contact your SACS. If you do not conduct an inspection, document this visit on your Time and Attendance Report. Do not cite it as an Attempted Inspection. Examples of situations where you should not conduct an inspection include, but are not limited to: Contagious disease in the animal facility such as parvovirus (you may want to contact the a ttending veterinarian for more information) Illness of the licensee with no other responsible person available Personal events such as weddings, funerals, doctor/veterinarian appointments, or family emergencies Religious holidays --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-23 2.12. Attempted Inspection An Attempted Inspection occurs when an authorized person is not available to accompany the inspector, and no inspection is conducted. If an authorized person is not present at the facility, follow the Attempted Inspection guidance in Chapter 4. If you are not able to contact the licensee/registrant or conduct an inspection, leave the facility , and cite s ection 2.126(b) for licensees, carriers and intermediate handlers and s ection 2.38(b) for registered research facilities . In the citation narrative, write a brief description of what you did to contact the licensee/registrant, e.g., called all the contact numbers provided, knocked at the door, waited 30 minutes, etc. Send the Inspection Report for the first citation of an Attempted Inspection by regular mail only or email. Send Inspection Reports citing Repeat Attempted Inspections to the licensee or registrant by both regular and certified mail, or email and certified mail.

Refusal of Inspection If a licensee or registrant refuses to allow an inspection, ensure that you have clearly identified yourself as a USDA Animal Care inspector, and that the licensee/regist rant is aware of the serious nature of this noncompliance of AWA Regulations . If you are sure that you are safe, ask this question once , \"Are you refusing to allow the inspection?\" If the licensee/registrant still refuses to allow an inspection, leave the premises , and complete an Inspection Report designating this as a Routine Inspection. Cite s ection 2.126(a) for license es or registered transporters, section 2.38(b) for registered research facilities. Document the specific circumstances of the refusal in the Inspection Report narrative: be specific as to date, time, and the identification of the person who refused to allow the inspection. Include any pertinent statements made by the licensee or registrant. If two or more APHIS officials are present for the inspection and one is denied entry, document this as a refusal of inspection. Do not conduct an inspection. Send the Inspection Report for a refusal to the licensee or registrant by both regular and certified mail. Communicate any \"refusal to allow inspection\" with your SACS to develop a plan for a follow -up inspection. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Required Inspection Procedures 2-26 2.15. Interference If you are being harassed, abused (including verbally abused), or interfered with in the course of carrying out an inspection, inform the licensee or registrant that the inspection can only continue if the harassment, abuse, or interference stops . If the activity or behavior continues, you must discontinue the inspection process and leave the premises and cite it. Write a Routine Inspection Report citing all NCIs identified until the inspection was stopped and section 2.4 for licensees, s ection 2.25(c) for registered transporters, or s ection 2.30(d) for registered research facilities . This NCI should be designated as a Critical. In t he narrative, be specific as to date, time , identification of the person(s) involved and details of the harassment and/or verbal abuse, and/or interference. An exit interview should not be conducted. This should be noted on the Inspection Report. Send the partial Inspection Report to the licensee or registrant in such a way that it can be tracked, such as certified mail, UPS or FedEx. For any \"interference with the ins pection,\" communicate with your SACS to develop a plan for follow -up inspections.

Conducting the Inspection Each inspector must develop a consistent method of conducting inspections to ensure that his/her inspections are thorough, accurate, and in accord with this Inspection Guide and the AWA and the Regulations and Standards. General Information The basic steps for conducti ng an inspection are outlined below. However, the exact sequence for conducting the inspection is at the discretion of the individual inspector. You should inspect a facility at different times of the year , if possible, rather than inspecting the same mon th or season every year Upon arrival at the facility, be alert for unsafe conditions Prior to conducting the actual inspection: o Contact the licensee/registrant or authorized representative o Introduce yourself in a professional manner o State the purpose for t he visit o Show your USDA badge and ID o Provide a business card, if appropriate If the facility, e.g., zoo, theme park or wild animal park, has an admission gate or ticket window: o Go to the admission gate/ticket window o Identify yourself in a professional manner o State the purpose of your visit o Show your USDA badge and ID At most facilities, you will not be required to pay admission . However, if an admission fee is requested, you can ask to speak to someone in management . If yo u need to pay admission, contact your SACS for approval, then charge the admission fee on your Purchase MasterCard (preferable), or pay the fee yourself and you will be reimbursed. NOTICE Do not allow anyone to photograph or photocopy your government ID . If a facility wishes to verify your identity as a USDA inspector, they may call the Animal Care office in Fort Collins. If you are denied access to a facility or not able to conduct an inspection because a facility requires a photocopy of your government ID , this should be considered a refusal of inspection and cited on an Inspection Report. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-5 If you do not find anyone at the facility, follow procedures for an Attempted Inspection (see Attempted Inspection in Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 ) For Traveling Exhibitor Inspections, see Traveling Exhibitor Inspection in Chapter 4 Inspection on Native American Land If you conduct an inspection or conduct a search for unlicensed activity on Native American lands, contact the tribal leader prior to conducting the inspection/search to explain the purpose of your visit. If the tribal leader refuses to allow you to conduct the inspection/search , leave the land, and contact your SACS or your Assistant Director. Biosafety Measures Biosafety measures when conducting an inspection include, but are not limited to, the items listed in Table 3 -1. Follow the facility's biosafety procedures . If the facility has no procedures or procedures that are less protective than the recommended biosafety measures, put on the recommended protective clothing, gear, and/or boots. Table 3-1. Biosafety Measures When Conducting an Inspection If you are inspecting: Then wear: Dogs or cats Disposable shoe covers (required) Disposable gloves (required if touching any animal , change gloves between each animal or cage) Ear plugs (optional but highly recommended for dog kennels) Coveralls (optional) NOTICE Under certain circumstances, you may want to observe the exhib ition, facility, or facility personnel prior to announcing your presence. If you need to pay the entrance fee, contact your SACS or SOTW for approval, then charge the admission fee to your Purchase MasterCard (preferable) or pay the fee yourself and you w ill be reimbursed. The observation should be done from areas accessible to the general public. Immediately after observing the exhibition/facility /personnel, you must announce yourself to the licensee/registrant or facility representative and arrange to complete the inspection and address any findings that you observed prior to announcing yourself. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-6 Elephants (TB TB suspect) Respirator (level N95 or better) Macaques Respirator (level N95 or better) is required if within 5 feet or less Disposable shoe covers Coveralls, preferably disposable Full face shield and eye protection, such as safety glasses or goggles Disposable gloves Other nonhuman primates Respirator (level N95 or better when nonhuman primates and other animals are suspected to be infected with TB indoors, or within 5 feet or less outdoors ) Birds General Recommendations for a ll facilities: Always conduct an inspection outside of an avian enclosure if possible Wash car frequently Park as far away from the entrance that is safe and reasonable Limit exposure with personally owned birds before and after inspections that day Wear gloves if you will need to be touching or holding objects from the facility Wear additional PPE (such as, respirator (N -95 or higher), coveralls or disposable gowns, disposable caps, or protective eyewear) if you are more vulnerable to infections or the aviary is significantly dirty Minimalize equipment brought into the facility if not necessary Refrain from inspecting in areas where active cleaning & sanitizing is going on Conduct the inspection starting from the most vulnerable birds first. This is commonly the nursery first, next the feed storage/kitchen, then the general aviary, and lastly the quarantine and hospital area. Open to the public avian facilities: Follow the facility's biosecurity protocols --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-7 Biosecurity precautions may increase based on outbreak risk in the area Not open to the public avian facilities: Follow the facility's biosecurity protocols Wear a new disposable shoe covers or sanitized boots Wash hands with soap or hand- sanitizer before and after entering the facility Wipe down al l hard surfaces of equipment brought into the facility with a sanitizing agent (such as camera, pens, outside of notebook) before and after entering the facility Have not visited an avian facility on that day beforehand Biosecurity precautions may increase based on outbreak risk in the area Special Note: Immediately notify your SACS if you see or the facility reports a sudden and significant illness or death loss in their aviary. Animal Inspection - Specific Guidance General Information Basic steps or procedures when conducting an inspection of the animals include, but are not limited to: Approach all animals quietly and cautiously Ask if there are any other animals that you have not seen, such as those in quarantine, isolation, holding areas, off -site, or on loan or lease Be alert for escape routes for yourself in case of a dangerous situation Before approaching an animal, ask the facility representative: o About the temperament of the animal o If the animal is approachable o Where is the safest place to be located Let the person accompanying you open and close gates and doors to prevent escapes Always have the person accompanying you go through the gate or door first as a safety measure --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-8 Make sure all animals are safely secured Observe handling techniques of personnel during prelicense inspections and during inspections of licensed and registered facilities, and note that: o For licensed/registered facilities, the inspector should evaluate the handling experience and qualifications of the personnel o For applicants: - Inspector should evaluate the handling seen during the prelicense inspection - The inspector should consult with his/her SACS and the appropriate Field Specialist if there are concerns about the applicant's handling techniques and experience Observe the animals for their health and well -being: o Avoid handling the animals unnecessarily o Do not engage in diagnostic procedures o If a dangerous animal needs close evaluation, ask the facility to make arrangements for the animal to be examined by a veterinarian o If you need to closely examine a non -dangerous animal and it can be done safely, have the owner or handler restrain the animal o Wear disposable gloves if you must handle any animals Stay behin d or next to the facility representative Review husbandry practices Review supervisor and employee experience and training and ensure the facility has a sufficient number of employees [3.12; 3.32; 3.57; 3.85; 3.108; 3.132] nary care practices and records as appropriate [2.40] Review public contact procedures [2.131]: NOTICE You and the facility representative should work together to ensur e your safety around animals during an inspection. If you feel unsafe, ask the facility representative or designated authorized representative to correct the situation . If you feel you are in danger, safely leave the area. NOTICE Newborn and infant non -domestic cats 4 weeks (28 days) of age or younger should be housed in the controlled environment of a heated, clean and sheltered enclosure (such as a nursery), or in a clean, sheltered enclosure with the mother and any healthy siblings. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-9 o Newborn and infant nondomestic cats four weeks (28 days) of age or younger (neonate or neonatal) have special handling and husba ndry needs . Among other things, the AWA Regulations require licensees to ensure that they are handled safely and protected from harm . Because of their limited immunity, their health is at risk if they are exposed to other animals or offered for public co ntact . For more information, please read Tech Note, Handling and Husbandry for Neonatal Nondomestic Cats . o For regulatory purposes, AC generally considers big cats to become juveniles when they reach roughly 12 weeks of age . Inspectors should not use this age as an absolute \"cutoff date,\" but rather should use it as a guideline when evaluating exhibits that allow public contact with big cats that are at or older than 12 weeks of age . At approximately 12 weeks of age dangerous animals , such as tigers, lions, bears, and wolves (See Appendix B - Dangerous , Potentially Dangerous, and Special License Animals) become too big, too fast and too strong to be used for public contact. Review the Attending Veterinarian approved plans such as the Exercise Plan for dogs [3.8], and t he environmental enhancement plan for NHPs [3.81] (See Appendix A for the optional APHIS Form 7050 and the EEP Checklist) Inspector Behavior Guidelines around Animals Inspectors may be asked to do on- site inspections of circuses, zoos, animal sanctuaries, or other facilities that may house a variety of nondomestic animals . Inspectors should understand and follow appropriate behavior guidelines when evaluating nondomestic animals such as primates, nondomestic cats, elephants, marine mammals, or other exotic or wild animals . This section discusses appropriate inspector behavior when inspecting nondomestic animals. An inspector should never enter the enclosures of dangerous or potentially dangerous animals unless the inspector personally verifies the animals are securely locked out of the enclosure. Rules of behavior when inspecting nondomestic animals are: INTERACTION: Do not reach out to, or try to pet or feed the animals, no matter how friendly they may seem PROXIMITY: Do not stand within reach of them o Big cats and non -human primates may reach out over 3 feet through narrow spaces AGITATED BEHAVIOR: If the animal appears agitated because of your presence, make your observations quickly or from a greater distance LIMITING STRESS: Some animals become stressed or agitated around strangers . Standing in front of an enclosure and looking, staring, or pointing at an animal while discussing issues with the licensee may cause stress or agitation . It is best to discuss any issues that may pertain to that animal or --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-10 its enclosure at a reasonable distance from the enclosure YOUR REACTIONS: Try not to react if some animals vocalize or hit the fence or enclosure where you are standing . Many animals are looking for a reaction . Make your observations and quickly move on 3.2.4.2.1 Nonhuman Primates Primates are social animals and have complex social behaviors . Staring directly at primates is considered a threat to them, and may cause them to be agitated, especially if they are in their behind -the-scenes night quarters . While most zoo primates are accustomed to people staring at them, the public is not allowed behind the scenes and staring may be more threatening to them in their off-exhibit areas . Smiling at many species of primates may also be considered a threat, and while a primate may \"smile\" back, realize he is not smiling, but showing you his teeth, which may indicate a sign of aggression. Try not to point at the animals with your finger, and do not stand close enough to any enclosure that the primate may be able to touch or grab you. If a chimpanzee, gorilla, or orangutan were to grab any part of you with just one finger, it could cause significant injury or damage. Great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans) may also spit water or throw fecal material or other items at strangers or at people they know but do not like, e.g., the veterinary staff . They may be obvious in picking up fecal material or items in their enclosure and throwing it in your direc tion; however, many wait until you turn your back, and can hit their targets with amazing accuracy. Orangutans have a longer reach than the other great apes . Maintain an extra distance of greater than 4 feet from them as a margin of safety. BEWARE: Macaqu es are unapparent carriers of Herpes B virus, which is deadly to humans without appropriate and immediate treatment. One drop of saliva or urine from a macaque shedding the virus splattered into a human eye or mouth or transmitted through a bite or scratch injury has been known to cause the fatal disease . If you are inspecting a facility with macaques, be sure to protect yourself from the possibility of a bite, scratch or spray of urine or feces from these animals . Some facilities require personal protec tive equipment such as a clear face guard or safety goggles, a surgical mask, gloves, and protective clothing when entering rooms housing macaques . When there are no protective equipment requirements, you must stay a minimum of 5 feet away from any macaqu e enclosure . Any inspection of macaque species within 5 feet or less of the animals or enclosures requires the use of a full- face shield, respirator, disposable gloves, footwear, and coveralls. Inspectors must not enter rooms when facility employees are s praying, or cleaning enclosures or room surfaces or performing functions that could result in splash hazards or aerosol production. 3.2.4.2.2 Big and Small Nondomestic Cats Cats are sensitive animals and may become agitated in the presence of strangers . Cats of all species will flatten their ears when angry or agitated . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-11 Recognize this behavior and step away from the enclosure before the cat becomes more agitated and either vocalizes or hits the enclosure fence . Talking to the animals when they are agitated rarely soothes them, as you are a stranger in their environment. Many cats will spray -mark their environment . Often big cats, especially tigers and lions, will exhibit this behavior towards people . The cat may be standing near the front of the enclosure or will calmly walk to the enclosure fence, often near the area where people are standing . They will then turn, lift their tail, and spray urine up to 10 feet away . If you notice this behavior, you will have only a moment to step out of range. BEWARE: Many encl osures, especially night quarters or gates to enclosures, have a small space between the bottom of the enclosure, fence , and the ground, or around gates or feeding chutes . Livestock wire fencing has ample spaces in the fencing itself. Big cats (and small nondomestic species) are able to reach through these spaces and have been known to attack unsuspecting persons who are standing too close . Stay a minimum of 3 feet away from all big cat enclosures . Many licensees will have a protocol and an obvious painted \"safety line\" on the floor or a barrier running adjacent to the big cat enclosures . If entering a narrow hallway between two cages, ensure you know the whereabouts of the cats, and be careful not to back up against one enclosure with a cat present if you are startled by another cat across the hallway . Try to maintain your distance from all enclosures when in tight quarters, and if the situation seems dangerous, ask the keepers to shift the cats to enclosures away from the hallway while you conduct your inspection. 3.2.4.2.3 Elephants All elephants have the potential to be dangerous . Elephants can reach up to 8 feet with their trunks . Staying back a minimum of 8 feet, even if the elephant is chained or behind a barrier, will help to ensure your safety . Keep the handler between you and the elephant(s) at all times . Work with the handler to determine the best (safest) place to make your observations, while maintaining an 8-foot distance from the elephant's trunk . When inspecting elephants, always have an escape route planned. When inspecting other areas of the elephant barn and the yard(s), ensure a handler or facility representative always accompanies you . Always ensure that you know the location of the elephant(s) during the entirety of your inspection. Elephants are usually handled in two basic ways: protected contact or free contact . Protected contact involves managing an elephant with a barrier between the handler and the elephant. In protected contact, handlers do not share the same space as the elephant. Free contact involves managing the elephants without a barrier between the handler and the elephant. In free contact, the handlers share the same space as the elephant. In this management system, handlers commonly use an ankus when workin g with the elephant. An ankus is a device that resembles a short boat hook and has a spike and a hook. In a protected contact system, ask the handler(s) to position the elephant(s) --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-12 behind a barrier so that an inspection of the animal's feet, skin, teeth, and other parts can be conducted as needed. Although the elephant is behind a barrier, be cognizant of the elephant's trunk and maintain an 8 -foot distance from the head of the elephant to ensure your safety . If needed, use your camera to get a closer view. In a protected contact management style, handlers will not enter the enclosure with the elephant(s ), and you must not either. In a free contact system, the handler will often invite the inspector to get up close to the elephant(s) . Remember to keep t he handler between you and the elephant, have an escape route planned and maintain your 8 -foot distance (using your camera for a closer view, if needed) . Do not go into an enclosure with an animal handled in free contact . Ask the handler to position the elephant in a manner that will allow you to conduct an inspection from a safe location and in a safe manner. Regardless of the contact system, if the elephant shows signs of agitation (vocalizing, flapping ears, pulling itself to its full height, jerking i ts head up and down) or is not responding appropriately to the handler's commands, immediately leave the area and let the handler manage the problem. If necessary, find a location to continue observing the animal that will maintain your safety . Remember, elephants have the potential to be dangerous . Being cognizant of their location, behavior, and management style is essential to conducting a safe and thorough inspection. Working with the handlers to conduct the inspection is essential, keeping in mind that you are putting yourself at risk when you go near an elephant, even if the handler appears to be exceptionally -type nond omestic hoofstock, as well as cervids (generally bucks), have been known to charge or butt people without warning . When inspecting nondomestic hoofstock, ensure a sturdy fence is between yourself and the animals, and do not stand within reach of these animals . It is rarely necessary to enter a hoofstock enclosure, but if absolutely necessary, ensure the handler/keeper is always between you and the animals, and consider an escape route before entering the enclosure . Whenever possible, enter veldt -type enc losures (large pens housing multiple species of hoof stock) in a vehicle. Camels and llamas may spit when upset, and llamas have been known to push upon, and knock over people . Note that llamas will flatten their ears when getting ready to spit. Camels may be dangerous, especially intact males . Male camels have reached over enclosures and bitten or lifted people off the ground. Nondomestic hoofstock, have varying flight distances, which is the distance they will allow someone to approach before they flee or bolt . It is undesirable to upset the hoofstock in an exhibit, and inspectors must maintain a reasonable distance between themselves and the hoofstock living in that enclosure . Allow the keepers to suggest a distance for you to observe that is appropr iate and non - --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-13 threatening to the animals. BEWARE: Some facilities may house ostriches with their hoofstock . Ostriches, especially males, may be deadly, and have been known to attack and seriously injure or even kill people, often unprovoked and without wa rning. Their kick is powerful, and they kick high and forward, aiming directly in front of them . Never enter a mixed exhibit on foot where male ostriches are housed . Cassowaries are also very dangerous birds . Never enter an enclosure housing a cassowary . 3.2.4.2.5 Potential Rabies Exposure If you are inspecting facilities where you will be entering exhibits or enclosures which contain free -roaming (or free -flying) mammals, such as raccoons, skunks, or bats, and you feel there is a potential for being bitten or scratched, or you feel there is potential for rabies exposure via the aerosol route (no matter how remote), you should wear personal protective gear, such as a mask or respirator and goggles, and have pre -exposure rabies prophylaxis. 3.2.4.2.6 Birds Almost all bird species are considered prey species with a few exceptions; birds in general are easily stressed by human presence. Sudden movements or any new or unfamiliar objects or person(s) will cause stress and be viewed as a potential threat initially. Avoid making exaggerated or quick gestures. Many birds are sensitive to sounds, so try to minimalize noises. This includes picking up your feet when walking, avoid speaking in a loud voice, keeping your phone on \"vibrate\", minimizing the number of people near the avian enclosure, and limiting the number of objects you are carrying such as a handbag or backpack. When inspecting around parrots it may be comforting to gently talk to the animal. When inspecting around a nervous bird it may be better to look at them sideways or with one eye and not stare at them directly with both eyes. If there is a way to shield yourself from the bird's view that is preferred. Additionally, try to inspect diurnal birds while you are in as much light as possible so the bird can see you and avoid standing in the shadows. If it is necessary to take a picture avoid using the flash. Forgo wearing sparkly jewelry or large amounts of perfume, cologne, or other products with a strong odor. Try to minimalize disruptions during breeding, hatching, and sleeping times as much as possible. BEWARE: Most avian species have a sharp beak and nails that can bite and scratch the skin. It's always recommended that you conduct an inspection outside of an avian enclosure. For large, public aviaries where yo u may need to go inside the enclosure with free flying birds, always be aware of your surroundings and know your exits. During periods of breeding and hatching many species will have an increase in aggressive behaviors. And always be extremely careful around any active nests. Keep in mind a sick or threatened bird may be more aggressive and will attack the face and eyes. Additionally, there are several species groups you need to be more cautious around. Parrots have an extremely high biting force with thei r beaks and can cause --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-14 severe injuries to fingers, hands, and the face. Furthermore, birds can be extraordinarily quick in their strikes, especially with strangers or during breeding or hatching times. Allow for enough distance away from the cage that you a re not within biting range. Even with correctly sized enclosures, most birds can stick their beaks several inches outside the cage or use the tip of the beak to hook and draw in an object. Consider ear protection when working around birds, especially psittacines. Several species of birds, such as the Nanday Conure, have a decibel range up to 155dB. This is comparable to firecrackers and jet engines. Finally, while most birds produce a dander -like substance from their feathers, cockatoos, cockatiels, and ama zon greys produce a large amount of fine powder that can cause some people to have an allergic reaction. If you are sensitive to bird dander wear a respirator and keep your distance from these species. Gallinaceous birds (e.g., pheasants, turkeys, and othe r land fowl) have sharp spurs on their legs and screamers, a South American duck -like species, have a large spur on the first digit of the wing. While best to avoid being in the same enclosure with a spur equipped bird, if you are, keep your distance, never turn your back to the bird, and know your exits. If you feel any concern about your safety or the bird is displaying any signs of aggression, leave the area immediately. Many sharp beaked shore or water birds such as cranes, herons, egrets, and cormoran ts can mistake the reflection in people's eyes as the flash of a fish in the water. These species are extremely fast and are equipped with a sharp beak designed to hold -on to slippery fish. Bites from their beak can easily cut humans and all handlers shoul d always wear eye protection. Inspectors should not approach these animals and should wear eye protection if in the same physical space. Raptors not only have a sharp beak used for tearing into flesh but also have sharp talons with a high gripping strength that can rival the jaw strength of many big cats. Unless under the control of a trained handler, you should never be in the same space with a raptor. Large birds such as ostriches, emus, and cassowaries have powerful legs with long claws that will charge, kick, and sometimes jump on top of a person or animal that they perceive as a threat. People have been killed by these birds and you should never be in the same enclosure with these types of birds. Stopping the Inspection for Veterinary Care If during an inspection, you notice an animal that needs immediate veterinary care, instruct the licensee to seek veterinary care for the animal and stop the inspection if necessary. Examples of when an animal may need immediate veterinary care include, but are not limited to: Unresponsive animal Pale pink or white gums --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-15 Labored breathing/open -mouthed breathing Fractured or dislocated limb Severe bleeding or injury Severe, watery , or bloody diarrhea Pet Dogs Because personal pet dogs of the licensee often end up being br ed and moved to the kennel, the following guidance should be followed if the personal pet dogs are housed on the same premises as the kennel or in the kennel itself: All intact females, capable of breeding, should be listed on APHIS Form 7005 Pet dogs do n ot need to be tagged, although they should be assigned a tag number on APHIS Form 7005 The only time there would be a concern about disease transmission would be if the pet dog was sick and was in need of veterinary attention The only time there would be a concern about containment is if there was a history of dogs getting hit by cars or injuries related to non -confinement Inspectors should discuss with licensees the issues of non- containment and disease transmission, e.g . Brucella canis, Parvovirus, etc. Barn Cats If a licensee has barn cats, i.e., loose cats used as pets and/or for pest control, not for regulated breeding purposes, the barn cats are not covered because barn cats rarely end up being used for regulated purposes . Ther efore, they do not need to be inspected or follow any of the Regulations or Standards . However, if the barn cats have a negative effect on the regulated animals, this should be cited under the applicable Standard for the species impacted, not the Standard s for cats. Examples of negative effects include, but are not limited to: Cats getting into the food supply Cats contaminating the animals' food and/or water Cats harassing or causing stress to a regulated animal such as in a prey/ predator situation Sick cats possibly transmitting disease If the licensee allows the barn cats to have kittens, you should determine if the disposition of the kittens will be a regulated activity . Facility Inspection \u2014 Specific Guidance The inspector must develop a consistent method for inspecting facilities that --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-16 ensures inspections are thorough, accurate, and all citations are based on the Regulations and Standards . Guidance on specific issues related to facility inspection include: Housing Facilities - Indoor , Sheltered or Outdoor When determining if a facility is indoor, sheltered, or outdoor, the inspector must assess the facility in a stepwise fashion beginning with the indoor housing definition. If a facility does not meet this definition, then the inspector should next consider the sheltered housing definition if the animals housed therein are dogs, cats, or nonhuman primates . A facility is only to be considered an outdoor housing facility if it \"does not meet the definition of any other type of housing... \" 3.2.5.1.1 Indoor Housing The AWA Regulations define Indoor Housing as: any structure or building with environmental controls housing or intended to house animals that: 1. Is capable of temperature control within the limits for species of animal therein, maintaining h umidity levels of 30 to 70 percent, and rapidly eliminating odors from within the building; and 2. Has a continuous connection of a roof, floor, and walls (a shed or barn set on top of the ground does not have a continuous connection between the walls and the ground unless a foundation and floor are provided); and 3. Has at least one door for entry and exit that can be opened and closed (any windows or openings which provide natural light must be covered with a transparent material such as glass or hard plastic) A housing facility must meet the conditions for all aspects of the definition of \"indoor housing facility\" to be considered an indoor housing facility under AWA regulations . If the temperature, ventilation, and humidity are not controlled in an indoor hou sing facility as required by the applicable section of the Standards, the building should be cited as noncompliant. An example of an Indoor Housing Facility includes, but is not limited to: A climate -controlled shed or barn that has a floor with a continuo us connection with the walls and a roof and at least one door for entry and exit 3.2.5.1.2 Sheltered Housing The AWA Regulations define Sheltered Housing as: a housing facility which provides the animals at all times with: 1. Shelter, and 2. Protection from the elements, and 3. Protection from temperature extremes A sheltered housing facility may consist of runs or pens totally enclosed in a barn or building, or of connecting inside/outside runs or pens with the inside pens in a --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-17 totally enclosed building. If a housing facility is capable of meeting all aspects of th e definition of a \"sheltered housing facility,\" it is considered a sheltered housing facility . Even if walls, large doors, or panels are removed for part of the year, it is still considered a sheltered housing facility if it provides the animals at all times with shelter and protection from the elements and temperature extremes. Examples of Sheltered Housing include, but are not limited to: A facility consisting of connecting inside/outside pens with the inside pens contained in a building A facility with primary enclosures entirely enclosed within a building which is set on top of the ground and does not have a floor which is continuously connected to the walls A facility consisting of some enclosures that are fully enclosed within the building AND some en closures that are connecting inside/outside pens 3.2.5.1.3 Outdoor Housing The AWA Regulations define Outdoor Housing as: any structure, building, land, or premise, housing or intended to house animals, which does not meet the definition of any other type of housing facility provided in the Regulations, and in which temperatures cannot be controlled within set limits. Examples of Outdoor Housing Facilities include, but are not limited to: A facility with outdoor pens that has an open building -like structure with a roof and partial walls over the pens that do not provide protection from temperature extremes Hutch -like enclosures in a yard with no protective covering A chain link enclosure with a dirt floor and one or more dog -house type structures for shelter for the a nimals A facility with primary enclosures enclosed within a building without a climate -control system or protection from temperature extremes at all times Lids on Self -Feeders Self-feeders may be used for feeding dry food to dogs and cats . The AWA Regulat ions do not require lids for self- feeders . Rather, food for dogs and cats must be uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and sufficient in quality and quantity to maintain good health. Food receptacles must also protect food from rain and snow . If the lack of a lid contributed to poor food quality, the lack of a lid may be noted in the citation describing the noncompliance. Perimeter Fence 3.2.5.3.1 Determine if the licensed facility requires a perimeter fence [3.127(d)] The perimeter fence requirements are: --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Proc edures 3-18 1. Dangerous animals that require a perimeter fence Dangerous animals, such as large felids (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars , ligers, and jaguars), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, elephants and polar bears (See Appendix B - Dangerous, Potentially Dangerous, and Special License Animals ) require a perimeter fence that is: o Not less than 8 feet high, AND o 3 feet or more in distance from any enclosure housing animals NOTE : A facility may submit a written request to AC for approval of a perimeter fence that is less than 8 feet high and/or less than 3 feet from an animal's enclosure (variance request). 2. Non -dangerous animals that require a perimeter fence Non -dangerous animals (e.g., fox, kangaroo, capybara, and prairie dog) and nonhuman primates and marine mammals require a perimeter fence that is: o Not less than 6 feet high, AND o 3 feet or more in distance from any enclosure housing animals NOTE : A facility may submit a written request to AC for approval of a perimeter fence that is less than 6 feet high and/or less than 3 feet from an animal's enclosure (variance request). 3. Situations where regulated facilities are not required to meet the perimeter fencing requirements Situations where a facility does not require an approved written variance to deviate from the perimeter fence requirements are: o Traveling facilities with appropriate security measures o Outdoor housing facilities that: - House only domesticated farm -type animals (such as cows, goats, pigs, sheep, llamas, and alpacas, and any hybrid crosses thereof); AND - Have effective and customary containment and security measures (e.g., farm- type pens, barns, and fences) Note : If you come across other farm animal species that are not listed above but may be eligible to deviate from the perimeter fence requirements, contact your supervisor for guidance . Animal Care has granted standing approval (i.e., the facility does not need to seek a written variance) where alternative security measures contain the animals: o Wild/exotic hoofstock (such as, but guanacos, zebra, camels, warthogs, deer, caribou, elk, reindeer, and bison); AND --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-19 o Have effective and customary containment and security measures NOTE : If you come across a hoofstock species that is not listed above but may be eligible to deviate from the perimeter fence requirements, contact your supervisor for guidance . Facilities with the following conditions and the facility has obtained written approval (variance) from the AWO Director: o A primary enclosure made of sturdy, durable materials (concrete, wood, glass) that is high en ough to restrict entry by animals and people o A protective natural barrier at an outdoor facility that is high enough to restrict entry by animals and people o Alternative security measures that contain the animals 3.2.5.3.2 Perimeter Fence \u2014 Open Gate During times when a zoo is open to the public, there will usually be an opening in the perimeter fence allowing public entry . Most zoos have a ticket booth or attendant between that open portion of the perimeter fence and the animal enclosures or some other method to assure that the animals are safely contained when the zoo is open to the public. The mere presence of an open entry gate at a zoo is not a stand -alone noncompliance . If after review of the entryway, perimeter fence, and the animal enclosures, you ha ve concerns about the containment, especially of dangerous animals, you should cite the perimeter fence or contact your supervisor. As a performance -based Standard, if an incident occurs tha t involves an open, unstaffed perimeter fence gate (escape, injury, death, etc.), the fact that an open, unstaffed gate contributed to the incident can be included in the language of the citation, which should be cited under the section that caused the incident. 3.2.5.3.3 Unsafe Facility Conditions Be alert for unsafe facility con ditions: If the condition(s) adversely affects the inspector, he/she must leave the facility If not all the animals are safely contained, the inspector must leave the area or facility until it is safe to conduct an inspection If the condition(s) is noncompliant with the AWA, cite the noncompliance on the Inspection Report. Examples include, but are not limited to: o Bare wiring o Electrical wires near water o Electrical wires within reach of animals o Unprotected heat lamps If the condition(s) is not something wit hin the AWA regulatory requirements, --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-20 report the item to the licensee, research facility representative, or an authorized representative at the facility . Examples include, but are not limited to: o Locked emergency exits o Unlocked or unsecured controlled subs tances If you feel that you are being threatened, abused, or harassed: o Leave the facility (see Workplace Violence in the AC Safety and Health Manual), and o Document what occurred in a memo to your SACS, including who said what to whom, when, where, and how, using specific language If you have additional concerns, contact your SACS and the AC Safety and Health Officer . Contingency Planning Contingency planning regulations require all licensees and registrants to develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. In reviewing a contingency plan, check that the following required components are specified in the plan: When is the plan triggered What actions are to be taken Who is responsible for the actions, and How will the actions be accomplished with respect to materials and training Written documentation that the plan is reviewed and updated annually Note that whil e written training records are not required, it is permissible to confirm verbally that training for new employees hired after August 3, 2022 had been conducted within 30 days of hire. Licensees and registrants may use the APHIS Form 7093 but it is not required. The intent of the Contingency Plan is to encourage licensees and registrants to think through possible emergencies and plan ahead. Animal Care does not intend to collect or evaluate the quality and effectiveness, post- event, of any plan. NOT ICE Marine Mammals have additional Contingency Plan requirements. See Section 4.14 Marine Mammal Facility Inspections. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-21 Non -Disclosure Agreements Non -disclosure agreements (NDA) are contracts by which a party agrees not to disclose confidential information, as part of doing business together. Some facilities may have staff and/or veterinarians sign NDAs as a condition of employment. NDAs do not re lieve the responsibility of a licensee, carrier, or intermediate handler from furnishing information that an inspector or other APHIS official has requested in connection with enforcement of the AWA. If you find that you are not able to obtain the information you require for an inspection due to an NDA, please contact your SACS for further guidance. Miscellaneous Inspection Guidance Authorized Person Conducting Regulated Activity An authorized person can represent the licensee during a USDA inspection. Generally, any employee of a licensee (dealer or exhibitor) may conduct sales of , or exhibit animals owned by that dealer/exhibitor and also may accompany the inspector. An authorized person may not sell or exhibit animals he or she owns unless said person has his/her own license . In summary, a licensee (Person A) is not able to legally empower someone else (Person B) to conduct regulated activity without a license . Hence, Person B may not sell or exhibit his/her own animals under Person A's license at any time. Team Inspections Under certain circumstances, an inspector, SACS, or Animal Welfare Operations leader may request or require a team inspection . A team inspection may include an ACI, VMO, and/or a Specialist. A team inspection is required for: Next full inspection of a facility with a Direct veterinary care NCI cited by an ACI. The second inspector must be a VMO. Possible confiscation Facilities where the licensee/registrant has threatened, abused , or ha rassed the inspector Other possible reasons for conducting a team inspection include, but are not limited to: Focused inspection follow -up of a Direct veterinary care NCI cited by an ACI Multiple indirect veterinary care issues ACI has concerns about the program of veterinary care Multiple noncompliances --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-22 Repeat noncompliances Large facilities or complex inspections Facilities with current IES investigations Expertise in a particular species needed Training Complaints, such as multiple complaints against the same facility or the same issue at the facility Licensee/registrant has a history of appealing NCIs Be sure all inspectors and Specialists involved are listed in eFile . Field Specialist Consultations If an inspector has an issue or situation that would benefit from a consult with a Field Specialist, the inspector may contact the Field Specialist . The inspector must inform his/her SACS (by email cc or phone) about consulting with the Field Specialist. After the initial consultation with the Field Specialist, the inspector and the SACS will determine how further consultation with the Field Specialist should occur, i.e., going through the SACS or the inspector contacting the Field Specialist directly and copying the SACS on any correspondence. Action to Take on Noncompliant Item Noted While Off Duty If you are off duty and notice a noncompliance at a licensed facility or find an unlicensed exhibitor, you are not required to take any action . However, if you choose to take action, suggested actions inc lude: Assess the severity of the noncompliance If in your territory, return to the facility when on duty and conduct an inspection or evaluation of the situation If not in your territory, contact your SACS when on duty to determine a course of action Take appropriate immediate action, if required If you elect to conduct an inspection or evaluation of the situation: Contact your SACS or SOTW for approval prior to initiating an inspection or evaluation If action was taken, send your SACS: NOTICE Remember that you cannot work overtime without your SACS approval. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-23 o A me mo documenting the situation and the action taken o The Inspection Report, if appropriate Life-Threatening Situation If there is a life -threatening situation, such as a dangerous animal escape, then: 1. Leave the area im mediately 2. Contact facility personnel/management 3. Call 911, if appropriate Non -Life-Threatening Dangerous Situation If you believe that the noncompliance results in a non -life threatening but dangerous situation to the animal or the public, speak to the licensee or an authorized representative . If the licensee does not correct the NCI at that time, then: 1. Speak to the management of the venue 2. Call your SACS, the SOTW, or the Animal Care Office's emergency contact number and discuss a course of action Contact local authorities, such as the local police or animal control officer, if appropriate, e.g., a non -regulated species is involved. No Immediate Danger If you believe that the noncompliance results in no immediate danger to the animal or the public, you may choose to: Speak to the licensee or authorized representative, or Take no action at that time --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-24 3.3. Completing the Inspection Report General Information The in spector must complete an official Inspection Report as soon as possible at the end of the inspection . (See Notice Box below) . Remember that Inspection Reports with a Direct NCI must be completed and delivered to the licensee/registrant immediately after the inspection. The Inspection Report should follow the format of the Inspection Report template in eFile.

Develop a consistent method of writing citations. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-28 EXAMPLE Standard: SECTION 3.1(a) HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL Noncompliance: The roof in the southeast corner of the kennel building is falling in due to rotting wood. Pieces of wood from the roof have fallen int o the pen below that houses three adult dogs. Why a noncompliance: Housing facilities must be kept in good repair, and the kennel building is not in good repair. The falling roofing material and wood beams could injure the dogs and result in the dogs being exposed to rain and other weather conditions. How to comply: The roof must be kept in good repair . Maintenance problems need to be identified and fixed in a timely matter to keep the facilities in good repair and protect the animals from injury. Correct ion date: Correct by (date). EXAMPLE Standard: SECTION 3.83 WATERING Noncompliance: The water receptacle in the enclosure housing ten adult macaques has a layer of debris and scum floating on the top of the water and a thick layer of algae along the sides. Why a noncompliance: Nonhuman primates must be provided with potable water and water receptacles must be kept clean and free of contamination . The presence of debris, scum, and algae is an indicator of contamination of the water which can cause illness in the animals. How to comply: All water receptacles should be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often , if necessary, to keep them clean and free from contamination such as dirt, debris, scum, or algae. Correction date: Corr ect by (date) . EXAMPLE Standard: SECTION 3.104(b)(1)(i) SPACE REQUIREMENTS Noncompliance: Two beluga whales are housed in a pool that only provides a Minimum Horizontal Distance (MHD) of 25 feet. Why a noncompliance: Two beluga whales must be housed in a pool to have an MHD of 28 feet and the pool the whales are housed in only provides an MHD of 25 feet. How to comply: Measures must be taken to provide the required MHD for the whales. Correction date: Correct by (date). --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-29 EXAMPLE Standard: Section 3.125(a) FACILITIES, GENERAL Noncompliance: The enclosure housing three adult tigers has a wire panel next to the den which has a broken wire . The ends of the broken wire have sharp edges and are protruding into the enclosure. Why a noncompliance: Housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals . The tiger enclosure is not being kept in good repair which could result in the tigers being injured by the sharp points on the wire. How to c omply: The wire should be repaired or replaced . Maintenance problems must be identified and fixed in a timely manner to keep the facilities in good repair and protect the animals from injury. Correction date: Correct by (date). EXAMPLE Multiple Sections and Multiple Species: If an NCI involves multiple sections of Regulations/Standards and multiple species, each section of the Regulation/Standard must be cited separately. For example: A food storage room used to store food for guinea pigs, rabbits, nonhuman primates, and wild/exotic animals is cluttered, dirty, and has broken bags with food spilling on the floor, and the unopened bags of nonhuman primate food are stored directly on the floor and up against the walls. Sections 3.25(c), 3.50(c), 3.75(e), an d 3.125(c) - STORAGE OF FOOD would be in noncompliance . Each of these sections should be cited for the species affected. EXAMPLE Multiple Noncompliances under one Section and Subsection: If multiple noncompliances involve one section and subsection of the Regulations/Standards, these NCIs may be grouped together. For example, for camels in a petting zoo: The roof of the barn is in disrepair and has an opening/hole which allows rain and snow to fall into the pens. The partition between the camel pen and the food storage area has numerous holes allowing the camel access to the stored food. The front gate of the outdoor pen has a broken hinge and does not close properly. SECTION 3.125(a) -STRUCTURAL STRENGTH would be the noncompliance and all three items cou ld be cited together. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-30 EXAMPLE Multiple Noncompliances under the Same Section but Different Subsections: If multiple noncompliances involve the same section but different subsections, each NCI must be cited separately. For example, for nonhuman primates: There are multiple NCIs of SECTION 3.80 PRIMARY ENCLOSURES -General Requirements SECTION 3.80(a)(2)(i)- A pen housing four spider monkeys has broken wire mesh flooring in the right rear corner with sharp wire ends sticking up into the pen. SECTION 3.80(a)(2) (vii)-There is no shade area in the outdoor nonhuman primate exhibit, and it is summer with ambient temperatures over 100\u00b0F. SECTION 3.80(a)(2)(ix)- A pen housing four baboons has wooden walls with all the paint scratched off so that the walls can no longer be properly cleaned and sanitized. Each of these should be a separate citation. EXAMPLE Standard: 3.158(a) CLEANING Noncompliance: An enclosure with 50 adult zebra finches had an excessive accumulation of feces on the perches, nest boxes, and floor of the enclosure. Multiple birds were seen with feces attached to their feet and tails. Why a noncompliance: Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of feces to prevent soiling of the birds conta ined in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. How to comply: Remove excreta from the bird's primary enclosures to prevent excessive accumulation of feces. This includes removing excreta to prevent soiling of the birds contained in the primary enclosures. Correction date: Correct by (date). Information Inspectors Should Not Include in the Narrative The narrative section should not contain: Administrative messages to the Animal Care offices or staff Animal inventory Comments on public complaints Date of last inspection --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-31 Personal comments about the facility Personal or proprietary information, such as: o Addresses, other than the licensee/research facility mailing and/or business address o Driver's license numbers o Names of animal handlers o Names of buyers of animals o Name(s) of person(s) accompanying you on the inspection, except for other AC personnel o Names of principle investigators or research facility personnel o Names of sellers of animals o Social security n umbers o Sources of animals o Telephone numbers, other than your contact information, if applicable Recommended enforcement action Repeat Noncompliant Item Identified Refer to Repeat NCI in Chapter 2 for information on Repeat noncompliant items.

Critical Noncompliant Item Identified Refer to \"Critical\" NCI Identified in Chapter 2 for information on Critical noncompliant items. Noncompliant Item with Correction Time Remaining Focused Inspection If you are conducting a \"focused\" inspection, such as follow up on a Direct or NOTICE Remember that the Inspection Report may be used by our Office of the General Counsel (OGC) as evidence in a court pr oceeding . The Inspection Report is also available to the public through a Freedom of Information Act request or viewed via the Internet at the Animal Care website. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-32 Repeat NCI, and there are previously identified uncorrected NCIs that still have correction time remaining, do not re-cite or mention these NCIs on the Inspection Report. These are not repeat NCIs . Be sure to specify that this was a focused inspection in the Inspection Repo rt inspection type . Full Inspection If you are conducting a full inspection and there are previously identified uncorrected NCIs that still have correction time remaining, do not re-cite these NCIs . Note on the Inspection Report that the NCIs have not been corrected, but that the correction date has not passed . These are not repeat NCIs. No Regulated Animals Present Even though there may be no regulated animals present at a facility, an inspection may still be conducted. Factors to consider when deciding whether to inspect a facility include, but are not limited to: Are there areas of the facility that you have never inspected before, e.g., a new building? Are there records to inspect? Are there transportation vehicles to inspect? Does this facility have a history of noncompliance? Even though there are no animals currently at the facility, do regulated animals go in and out of the facility, such as traveling animal acts? Is the facility due for an inspection? Is this a new facility added to your territory? Is this an active research registrant that has not been inspected this fiscal year? After using your best judgment and determining that there is nothing to inspect, you may choose not to conduct an inspection. If you con duct an inspection: Classify the inspection as \"Routine\" Only cite NCIs found during the inspection if the area with the noncompliance: o is currently in use, but no animals are there on the day of your inspection, or o is ready for use For the correction date, use the following or a similar statement: \"Correct --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-33 before being used for animals regulated by the Animal Welfare Act.\" If a partial inspection, state which areas were inspected, such as records and/or specific buildings State in the narrative, \" No regulated animals present at this time.\" If you do not conduct an inspection: Do not complete an Inspection Report Send a memo to your SACS explaining why you did not conduct an inspection Non -regulated Animals Non -regulated animals should not be inspecte d or mentioned on the Inspection Report unless there is potential for a negative effect on the health or well -being of the regulated animal(s). EXAMPLE Examples of a potential negative effect are: A horse is chasing a deer in a pasture on public display and causing the deer stress or injury Rats of the genus Rattus bred for use in research with an infectious disease are housed in the same room with rabbits The number of non- regulated animals is so large that the current staffing is inadequate to properly care for the regulated animals Correction Date A correction date is the time period in which a noncompliant item must be corrected . Include an actual date with the citation; do not use the term \"immediately.\" A correction date should be: Appropriate to the severity of the NCI Determined with the concurrence of the licensee/registrant or authorized representative, if appropriate Realistic as to what the facility can accomplish A correction date is given for: Newly identified \"Direct\" NCIs . Give these NCIs a short correction period, NOTICE If the Inspection Report is being sent by certified mail, allow for the mailing time when setting the correction date. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-34 e.g., by close of business on (date), within 72 hour s, within 5 days . The correction date for direct NCIs should never exceed 14 days. Newly identified NCIs other than \"Direct\" NCIs . If reasonable with respect to the health and well -being of the animals involved, an inspector may allow up to 1 year for some corrections . Some examples of corrections that may warrant a year- long correction period are: o Perimeter fence replacement o Full replacement of animal enclosures o Instituting a new protocol form For NCIs with long correction dates, the inspector should p eriodically check on progress with the licensee/registrant, either via a telephone call or a courtesy visit For NCIs corrected during to the inspection: The correction should read \"Corrected during the inspection.\" and do not give a correction date. A co rrection date is not given for: Airline transportation noncompliances NCIs identified on a Prelicense Inspection NCIs cited on a New Site approval inspection, except for a Direct NCI Repeat noncompliant items Extension of Correction Date An extension is an additional amount of time to correct a noncompliant item granted through Animal Welfare Operations leadership. A licensee/registrant may request an extension if he/she will not be able to correct the NCI by the correction date. At the time of the inspecti on, if a licensee/registrant anticipates that an extension will be needed because you cannot agree on a correction date or the licensee/registrant wants more than one year, explain to him/her how to request an extension. NOTICE Reinspect for correction of a \"Direct\" noncompliant item no later than 14 days after the date of inspection. NOTICE Extensions are for spe cial circumstances . Do not suggest an extension to the licensee for correction of routine noncompliant items . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM General Inspection Procedures 3-35 An extension request, whether anticipated or unexpected, must be: 1. In writing 2. Appropriate, i.e., only for an NCI other than a direct NCI (e.g., one related to facility maintenance) 3.

Attempted Inspections The purpose of this procedure is to standardize attempted inspections by utilizing enhanced communication and outreach in an effort to reduce attempted inspections . The goal is to use all tools at our disposal in order to decrease the number of attempted inspections conducted. This will help to ensure the welfare of the animals at our regulated facilities by increasing facility access, as well as improve consistency when conducting attempted inspections. All procedures must be documented on an Attemp ted Inspection Checklist. The checklist must be uploaded into eFile. Attempted Inspection General Procedures These proc edures will be followed for all attempted inspections regardless of repeat status (i.e. , first attempted and all repeat attempted inspections): 1. If an authorized person is not present at the facility, every effort should be made to contact them at the time of the inspection. This includes, but is not limited to: o Call all numbers previously provided by the licensee/registrant, including those in eFile o If possible, leave a message stating your name, purpose, phone number, and request for a return phone call o Attempt to get the attention of anybody who may be on the property (honk horn, ring doorbell, and knock on facility doors that are readily accessible) 2. If contact is not made by phone : o wait 30 minutes o If a facility representative does not arrive at the facility or return your call within 30 minutes , continue with the attempted inspection procedures listed below, starting with #4 - Prior to leaving the facility o If the licensee/registrant returns your call during the 30 -minute window, follow the procedure list ed in #3 for when contact is made. 3. If contact is made by phone: o Determine if an authorized person can be at the facility within 60 minutes o If not, let them know you will be in contact with them at a later date to discuss attempted inspections . Continue with the attempted inspection procedures listed below, starting with #4 - Prior to leaving the facility. o If so, wait up to 60 minutes for the authorized person to a rrive and conduct an inspection --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-10 o If the authorized person or a facility representative does not arrive within 60 minutes , call them back to check if they are still on their way . Use your professional judgment as to how much longer to wait (e.g., If the licensee says they will be there in 5 -10 minutes, waiting for 5 -10 minutes more is reasonable) . Conduct an inspection when they arrive at the facility. o If they do not show up or are unable to arrive at the facility within a reasonable time, continue with the attempted inspection procedures listed in #4 . 4. Prior to leaving the facility, complete a n Attempted Inspection Leave Behind Flyer and leave it in a location where it can be easily found . Do not leave the flyer in a mailbox. 5. Follow the procedure in Attempted Inspections in Chapter 2 for documenting an Attempted Inspection . Designate the attempted as a \"repeat,\" if appropriate. After leaving the facility, the inspector should attempt to contact the licensee/registrant up to three times, preferably by phone , and within one wee k of the inspection and: When contact is made: 1. The inspector should explain to the licensee or registrant the importance of: o Conducting an inspection o Business hours and optimal hours (See Section 4.3.8 Optimal Hours for eligibility) o Facility representatives o Providing contact information such as cell phone numbers, etc. The \"Script Following an Attempted Inspection\" can be used for this purpose. 2. The inspector should attempt to identify the reason for the attempted inspection and work with the facility to find a solution 3. The inspector will complete or update the \"Facility Contact Worksheet \" with input from the licensee or registrant . This work sheet must be uploaded into eFile within five days (See the Facility Contact Worksheet for uploading instructions). 4. In addition to the above, if this is the facility's first repeat attempted ( Second consecutive attempted or the third attempted inspection in the past two years), follow Section 4.3.2 - Courtesy Visit Procedures If no contact is made after three tries: 1. The inspector will send the Attempted Inspection Letter and Enclosure by regular mail --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-11 2. A copy of this letter should be uploaded into eFile 3. The inspector should wait at least two weeks after sending this letter before attempting another inspection 4. If the licensee/registrant contacts you at any time after this letter is sent, the inspector will follow the instructions above for when contact is made, including the Courtesy Visit Procedures, if eligible. Courtesy Visit s A Courtesy Visit will: Allow Animal Care to check on the welfare of the animals at facilities where access has been limited Allow Animal Care to explain to fac ilities the importance of conducting inspections Help to improve or establish better working relationships with licensees/registrants Provide an opportunity for Animal Care to work one -on-one with licensees/registrants to identify reasons for attempted ins pections along with possible solutions to prevent future attempted inspections Provide Animal Care an opportunity to obtain and document information from the licensee/registrant, such as optimal hours, which will help to preve nt future attempted inspections Allow Animal Care a chance to inform the licensee/registrant about other reso urces Animal Care has to help them maintain compliance (e.g., breeder resources, Field Specialists, compliance specialists, etc.) Scheduling a Courtesy Visit In addition to the Attempted Inspection General Procedures , the following procedures should be done for all facilities receiving their first repeat attempted (Second consecutive attempted or third attempted inspection in two years ): 1. The inspector will schedule a courtesy visit with the facility at an agreed upon date and time . The courtesy visit should be conducted within two weeks from the date of the phone call. 2. If the licensee or registrant declines a courtesy visit, the declination should be documented on the Attempted Inspection Checklist 3. If a Compliance Specialist (CS) is already involved with the facility , the inspector will reach out to the CS prior to conducting the courtesy visit so they are aware of the visit Conducting a Courtesy Visit A courtesy visit will be offered to all facilities receiving their first repeat --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-12 attempted (i.e., two consecutive attempted inspections or the third attempted inspection in two years ). Courtesy Visit Procedures: 1. A facility walkthrough and records review should be conducted (as you would during a routine inspection) . Do not document the results of the walkthrough or review . If the licensee/registrant wishes, they can take notes regarding your findings or suggestions. 2. The following information will be provided to the licensee/registrant during the courtesy visit: A. The PowerPoint \"The Animal Welfare Inspection Process and Attempted Inspections\" will be presented to the licensee B. The inspector will complete or update a \"Facility Contact Worksheet\" with input from the licensee/registrant . This worksheet must be uploaded into eFile within five da ys (See t he Facility Contact Worksheet for instructions). C. The inspector should attempt to identify the reason for the attempted inspection and work with the facility to find a solution D. The inspector should let the licensee or registrant know that the courtesy visit will be followed by an unannounced inspection. Do not give them a timeframe for this inspection. E. Stress the importance of making this a successful (non -attempted) inspection F. Leave your business card/contact information and encourage them to cont act you with questions, schedule changes, changes in optimal hours (if eligible), etc. The courtesy visit should be recorded in eFile as a \" courtesy visit to follow -up on compliance concerns. \" See Section 4.8 \"Courtesy Visits\" for more i nformation on documenting courtesy visits in eFile . Conducting an Unannounced Inspection after the Courtesy Visit A routine unannounced inspection should be conducted within two months after the courtesy visit. If an inspection is conducted, complete an Inspection Report following normal procedures. If this inspection is an attempted inspection : Follow the Attempted Inspection Procedures (not including the courtesy visit) Document the attempt on an inspection report, and --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-13 Designate it as a \"repeat\" (second repeat) This facility will be referred to the Compliance Support Staff Compliance Assurance Staff (CAS) If the inspector, after consultation with their SACS, feel s that a compliance call or visit would help at any step in the Attempted Inspection or Courtesy Visit process, they should send a request to CAS . Third Attem pted Inspection (Second Repeat AI) The third Attempted I nspection (second repeat) will automatically trigger a referral to a CS who will be assigned to work with the facility . The CS will contact the inspector prior to c ommunicating with the facility . Th e inspector should let the CS know everything they have done to try to work with the facility and provide any other information or guidance that might be helpful . The inspector, SACS, and CS will determine the best course of action for the CS to take (e.g ., calling, going on a compliance visit, or riding with the inspector on a visit/inspection). Compliance Assurance Staff (CAS) Referral A facility will be referred to RSS for possible license revocation after the fourth Attempted Inspection (third repeat Attempted Inspection). Additional Attempted Inspection Guidance To facilitate and build cu stomer relationships with licensees and registrants, inspectors must remain aware of varied traditions, religious requirements, community culture, and emergency situations that can sometimes affect the daily operation of our regulated facilities . In an e ffort to become more customer service oriented, inspectors must be courteous, considerate, and demonstrate compassion to the needs and efforts of our licensees and registrants in these situations . Remaining cognizant of traditions, religious requirements, and emergency situations will help to build trust and improve working relationships with our licensees/registrants . This will help to ensure that our suggestions, guidance, and talking points are accepted and implemented to improve the health and well -being of all regulated animals. Common Amish Holidays The following are common Amish holidays not normally observed by federal employees . Work with the individual Amish communities to develop a plan for completing an inspection around these days. Old Christmas (6 January) Good Friday & Easter Monday (Friday & Monday prior to and following --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-14 Easter) Ascension Day (40 th Day after Easter Sunday) Pentecost Monday (7 th week after Easter) St. Michael's Day/Michaelmas (11 October) Second Christmas (26 December) New Year's Eve (31 December) Weddings are typically held on Tuesdays or Thursdays in the fall/harvest season through winter Choosing Not to Cite an Attempted Inspection at a Facility In some circumstances, when an inspector arrives at a facility, it may be determined that it is not appropriate to conduct an inspection (see examples below) . If a n inspector is unsure whether or not to conduct an inspection, or if this is a recurring issue at this facility, the inspector should contact their SACS. If an inspection is not conducted, the inspector should document the visit on their Weekly Activity R eport, but it should not be cited as an Attempted Inspection. Examples of situations where the inspector may choose not to conduct an inspection include, but are not limited to: Contagious disease in the animal facility , such as parvovirus (the inspector may want to contact the attending veterinarian for more information) Illness of the licensee or close family member Personal events such as weddings, funerals, doctor/veterinarian appointments, or family emergencies Inspections with Facility Representatives If the licensee or registrant agrees to utilize a facility representative in order to conduct an inspection, the inspector must be sensitive to the licensee's or registrant's wishes an d should give them the opportunity to address issues that arise during the inspection and/or be involved in the exit briefing . In order to accommodate the request, up to two business days can be allowed for extra time to answer questions, address concerns identified during the inspection, and complete an exit briefing with the licensee or registrant . This courtesy will help to alleviate some of the potential hesitation associated with utilizing a facility representative . This option should be offered as a potential solution to conduct a successful facility inspection. The Facility Contact Worksheet The Facility Contact Worksheet should be updated, as needed, to maintain current optimal hours, contact information, and facility representative information . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-15 This worksheet must be uploa ded into e File within five business days . Optimal Hours The inspector should attempt to identify the optimal hours of inspection for all licensees and registrants that are not open to the public . Record the optimal hours on the Facility Contact Worksheet . Optimal hours are generally four -hour blocks of time during daylight hours three days per week . This is not, however, a requirement . The inspector should use their professional judgment to consider two entire days per week, or another set of optimal hours, which will facilitate the unannounced inspection. If, after discussion, the suggested optimal hours still seem unworkable, the inspector should contact their SACS. If the licensee/registrant is not at home during the designated hours, cite as an Attempted Inspection. If the inspector stops by the facility at other times and the licensee/registrant is not home, the inspector should record the visit on their Time and Attendance sheet, but the inspector should not cite the inspection as an Attempted Inspection. Unsatisfactory Op timal Hours Form Letter The Unsatisfactory Optimal Hours Response Letter (UOHR L) is an optional form that can be used on a case by case basis when the supervisor, inspector, and licensee/registrant cannot agree on acceptable optimal hours of inspection. Once the supervisor has determined that the OHFL is appropriate, the inspector should complete the letter and send it to the licensee/registrant via certified mail with return receipt. A copy of the letter should be uploaded into eFile. The UOHR L can be sent at any point when unsatisfactory optimal hours have been given and the supervisor, along w ith the inspector, feel the letter would be beneficial. This is a separate letter than the \" Attempted Inspection Letter\" and \"Benefits of Inspection and Optimal Hours Enclosure \". See Section 4.3.1 Attempted Inspection General Procedures for more informat ion on the \"Attempted Inspection Letter\" . Handy Tips When attempting to reach a licensee or registrant with limited availability: o Attempt to call 7 to 8 am, 5 to 7 pm, or over the noon hour if the inspector knows the licensee/registrant works during the day o Try calling at different times during the day o Always leave a message with a return phone number If traveling near their facility, stop by and leave a \"Leave -behind Flyer\" . Document that a flyer was left at the facility, and the date it was left, in th e notes section of the \" Attempted Inspection Checklist .\" On routine inspections, or other contact with the licensee or registrant, remind --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-16 them to reach out with changes in their schedule, vacations, times when they know they will not be home, or optimal hour changes. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-17 4.4. Auction Market Inspection The auction market operator and the consigner of the animal, if the consigner is licensed or required to be licensed, are responsible for compliance with all applicable Regul ations and Standards Criteria At the time of the Prelicensing Inspection(s) of the auction facility and during Routine Inspections, the inspector should ensure that the applicant/auction operator understands all the applicable Regulations and Standards emp hasizing the following: All animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public . Operators of auctions during public exhibition should use sufficient barriers and/or distance so as to ensure the safety of the animals and public . A sufficient number of readily identifiable attendants should be present at all periods of public contact with the animals [2.131] Incompatible animals must not be held in the same enclosure Requirements for record keeping, transportation, cleaning, sanitation, and general animal health and well- being are monitored and met during the auction The animal enclosures meet the space requirements: o Animals are considered to be \"in transit\" and may remain in the enclosures while at the auction as long as all requirements for transport enclosures (from the Transportation Standards for the appropriate species) are met or exceeded The auction operator is responsible for compliance with all Regulations and Standards, including applicable Transportation Standar ds, once the animal is accepted by the auction market. The auction's responsibility does not extend to animals kept in transport vehicles in auction parking lots. At the time of the auction, you (the inspector) should: 1. Contact the licensee or his/her representative at the facility 2. Introduce yourself 3. Show official ID, if requested 4. Ask the licensee or representative if: o He/she or a designated person should accompany you around the auction grounds, or o If it is permissible for you to inspect the grounds and the sellers/buyers on your own 5. Check for regulated animals --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-18 6. If a USDA licensee brings in a regulated animal, conduct an inspection of the animal in transit 7. If an unlicensed person brings in a regulated animal: A. Inform the person of the Animal Welfare Act licensing requirement and that regulated activities may not be conducted without a license B. Explain the Regulations and Standards for his/her animals C. Give the person an application packet, if appropriate , or contact information for the AWO office to obtain an application packet 8. Answer any applicable questions 9. Check the animals for any visible signs of illness or distress (see Animals Requiring Veterinary Care ). 10. If a licensee purchases and transports a regulated animal, conduct an inspection of the animal in transit prior to the licensee leaving the auction facility, if possible Animals Requiring Veterinary Care The auction operator is responsible for obtaining veterinary care for sick animals in his/her custody being sold for regulated purposes. If a licensee has transpo rted a sick or injured animal, the inspector should ask if the attending veterinarian or a veterinarian at the auction has been contacted. If not, the licensee should be cited for this noncompliance. Records Sale Day Ensure that licensees who have transported dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates across a S tate line have health certificates . The auction operator is not required to maintain a copy of these records. After the Sale Day Conduct an inspection of the records containing all the information for the animals consigned to and sold by the auction operator on a different day than the sale day. NOTICE If a noncompliant item is noted at the time of consignment, inform the auction operator or auction representative of this noncompliance. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspectio ns 4-19 Acquisition Records Follow -Up A person consigning a regulated animal to an auction market may or may not require a USDA dealer's license. Consignment of regulated animals to an auction is not sufficient cause alone for requiring a license since the consignor may be exempt from licensing under Section 2.1(a)(3) of the Regulations or excluded. The inspector should: 1. Collect the names/addresses of unlicensed persons consigning regulated animals to the auction 2. As time permits, c onduct a search of any unlicensed person in your area selling regulated animals to determine if he/she is conducting any regulated activities 3. Send sales information for unlicensed persons not in your area to the appropriate SACS or inspector to conduct a search if deemed necessary NOTICE The auction catalog is a good source for this information and should be obtained, if available. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-20 4.5. Barrier Facility Inspection Animals housed in a barrier facility must be maintained in accordance with all Animal Welfare Act Regulations and Standards . Barrier facilities can include but are not limite d to quarantine/isolation areas, areas conducting research with infectious agents, areas housing animals that are Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) or gnotobiotic. Criteria The inspector must be able to inspect all regulated animals and all animal- related areas at a licensed barrier facility to ensure compliance. If it is not possible for the inspector to enter the animal rooms in the barrier facility due to the possibility of disease exposure and/or contamination of the inspector or the animals, the inspection may be conducted by: Analyzing environmental records. Selecting random animals to be visually inspected Video viewing from outside the barrier room Visual inspection through an adequate viewing window The inspector should follow the entry procedures normally used by the facility's personnel. The facility should: Not require more stringent entry Standards for the inspector Provide the protective cl othing and supplies needed to complete the inspection, such as pen, paper, flashlight, etc., if the facility will not allow you to take your own supplies into the barrier area Provide a means of taking photographs, such as taking the photos for you or prov iding a disposable camera, if the facility will not allow you to take your camera into the barrier area or you are conducting the inspection from outside the barrier area The facility may ask the inspector to verify that he/she has not been in contact with , or exposed to, certain animals for a specified period of time, generally 72 hours . This verification is acceptable. NOTICE The facility should supply a copy of its barrier entry procedures upon request . NOTICE Do not sign any statement which places you responsible for the health of the animals in the barrier facility. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-21 All supplies required to maintain compliance should be available within the barrier facility . For example, veterinary equipment required for the procedures should be present in a surgery room behind a barrier when surgical activities are conducted. Alternativ e Methods of Inspection Video Camera Inspection If a video camera is to be used for inspecting the barrier facility, the facility should meet the following minimum guidelines: If possible, record the inspection so the inspector and licensee or designated person can refer back to the recording to review an area if any questions arise after the facility inspection Have sufficient or supplemental lighting in the room to allow for good visibility Have a color monitor so that color differences can be seen . For example: to distinguish blood from other fluids, or to see algae/scum growth in water. Have a communication system between the person operating the camera and the inspector so that the inspector can direct the person to view different areas, or zoom in on an area A high -resolution video camera should be used so that the inspector can clearly see the animals in the enclosures and see subtle differences, such as being able to distinguish between bedding and feces in or beneath the enclosures Use a portable video camera with the ability to video all parts of all the rooms that will require inspection, such as the animal rooms, food and bedding storage areas, medication storage areas, and enclosure washing/sanitizing areas Through a Viewing Window If the inspection is to be conducted through a viewing window(s), the facility should meet the following minimum guidelines: All parts of all the rooms that will require inspection, such as the animal rooms, food and bedding storage areas, medication storage areas, and enclosure washing/sanitizing areas, must be visible through the window(s) The lighting in the room must be sufficient to allow for good visibility or the facility must have supplemental lighting available There must be a communication system be tween the person inside the room and the inspector, so that the inspector can direct the person to bring enclosures or animals to the window, or to open cabinets or containers --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-22 4.6.

If this Due Date cannot be met, the inspector must notify their SACS as soon as possible so other arrangements can be made. Upon completion of the complaint inspection/investigation, the inspector must: Draft a formal complaint response Submit this first draft to their supervisor for review and approval. The method of submission is either by email or entering into the Results field in eFile. NOTICE An inspector may never reveal, or confirm, the source of any complaint. The complainant does NOT have to give his/her name to file a complaint . If the complainant does provide his/her name, it may b e subject to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-26 Change the com plaint status to \"Pending SACS Review\" If edits are needed to the response, make the edits and resubmit the response to their supervisor for final approval and change the complaint status to \"Pending SACS Review\" The SACS must: Review the complaint response, and any associated documents, for accuracy and completeness If edits are needed, discuss the edits with the inspector who will make necessary edits and change the complaint status to \"Pending Inspector Review\" When the final response is agreed upon by the inspector and SACS, the SACS will follow the procedure to close the complaint Review and approve all memos or supporting documentation. Internal memos, or other supporting documents associated with complaints, will be kept to a minimum and only used if necessary. NOTE: Memos must be sent to the SACS for review prior to uploading into eFile. NOTICE For complaints involving birds at licensed facilities, inspector must note within the complaint response that birds are covered by the AWA, but no sta ndards are being enforced at this time and document all observations made or actions taken (e.g., verifying veterinary care has been provided, advising the licensee that veterinary care was necessary, forwarding the information to state or local authorities, etc.) . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-27 4.8. Courtesy Visits Courtesy Visits are opportunities for Animal Care to provide learning opportunities and build relationships with facilities . A Courtesy Call may be conducted as opposed to a face -to-face visit as appropriate . General Information Courtesy Visits are appropriate for: Facilities that are considering seeking licensure or registration under the AWA Facilities seeking guidance or suggestions regarding how to ensure that they meet compliance Standards Facilities seeking to improve their understanding of the AWA requirements, and to verify that improvements they are making meet compliance Standards Courtesy Visits are scheduled and announced in advance. If an inspector goes to a facility for an unannounced inspection: An inspection must be conducted A Courtesy Visit may be scheduled for another time, but you cannot perform a Courtesy Visit in lieu of an inspection Courtesy Visits should not influence or change the inspection or enforcement process at a facility . A Courtesy Visit is not a Compliance Visit . Compliance Visits, which are conducted by Compliance Specialists (or SACS for research facilities), are visits to follow -up with the licensee/registrant on the noncompliant items and provide personalized assistance for the compliance challenges . If you think a Compliance Visit is more appropriate, you should discuss this with your SACS. If you are unsure if it is appropriate to conduct a Courtesy Visit at a facility or if a facility requests more than one Courtesy Visit, contact your supervisor for guidance . If you get a request for a Courtesy Visit but are unable to fit it into your schedule, contact your supervisor to see if coverage can be obtained. NOTICE Courtesy Visits are not permitted after the 1st or 2nd prelicense inspection. Courtesy Visits are not permitted within 90 days of the license expiration date of a licensee whether the licensee has submitted their relicense application or not. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-28 Documenting a Courtesy Visit All Courtesy Visits, whether at regulated or non- regulated facilities, must be documented in eFile : If two or more employe es are involved in the activity, only one employee will make the entry into eF ile If the visit is not a follow up to a noncompliant item(s), the home or lead inspector will make the entry If the customer does not have a CID, contact Program Support to have one created and then enter the activity The specific activity should be entered into eFile. For the Description, enter the specific corresponding activity type that most appropriately describes the visit, using the following definitions: 1. Courtesy visit with applicant: These visits are to ensure an applicant understands the Regulations and Standards and is prepared for the first Prelicense Inspection . These visits are done prior to the first Prelicense Inspection. 2. Courtesy call to applicant: Same as \"courtesy visit with applicant,\" except done via telephone as opposed to face -to-face . In addition to calls made before the first Prelicense Inspection, these calls can also be made between the fir st and second, and/or between the second and third Prelicense Inspection. This includes emails and texts for the same purpose. 3. Courtesy visit to follow up on compliance concerns: Face -to-face visit with the licensee/registrant (L/R) to ensure that the L/R understands how to correct a noncompliance of the Regulations or Standards . 4. Courtesy call to follow up on compliance concerns: Same as \"courtesy visit to fo llow up on compliance concerns,\" except done via telephone as opposed to face -to-face . This includes emails and texts for the same purpose. 5. Courtesy visit due to change in circumstance (new building , species, etc.): Face -to-face visit with a L/R to review a new, or \"in -the-works,\" project to determine if it would be in compliance with the applicable Regulations or Standards . Examples include but are not limited to: new construction, new research proposal, acquisition o f a new species, new site, new handling NOTICE \"Courtesy call to applicant\" is not the standard call made to all applicants as part of the prelicense process . It is in addition to that call. Courtesy visits and calls to applicants also include visits and calls to 'potential' applicants who are seeking guidance about whether their facility would be in compliance. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-29 methods, etc . 6. Courtesy call due to change in circumstance (new building, species, etc.): Same as \"courtesy visit due to change in circumstance,\" except done via telephone as opposed to face -to-face . This includes emails and tex ts for the same purpose 7. Courtesy visit with the attending veterinarian (AV): These visits are to establish and/or maintain and/or develop a relationship with a facility's AV . Visits with the AV to discuss a potential non compliant item or a specific veterinary care issue identified during an inspection are not considered courtesy visits; they are part of the inspection process. 8. Courtesy calls to the attending veterinarian: Same as \"courtesy visit with the attending veterinarian,\" except done via telephone as opposed to face - to-face . This includes emails and texts for the same purpose. Conducting the Courtesy Visit UNLICENSED/UNREGISTERED FACILITY For a facility that is NOT licensed or registered: Discuss AWA requirements for the type of facility being visited and ensure the representative understands the expectations Offer to walk through the facilities and animal areas, and provide feedback regarding the facility's level of compliance LICENSED/REGISTERED FACILITY For a current licensee or registrant: Offer to look at areas they are concerned with, and offer suggestions for short and long -term compliance and/or where they can obtain helpful information If a Direct noncompliance is identified during the co urtesy visit, the L/R should be instructed to address the cause of the noncompliance immediately, and promptly notify your supervisor NOTICE If a \"Direct\" animal welfare problem(s) is identified during a Courtesy Visit at a facility that is not licensed or registered, write a memo describing the areas of concern and contact your supervisor or the SOTW for guidance. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-30 Courtesy Visits, when used appropriately, can be a valuable tool to improve compliance, and can promote animal welfare at some facilities . NOTICE If a Direct NCI(s) is identified during a Courtesy Visit at a licensed/ registered facility, the Courtesy Vis it does not become an inspection and an Inspection Report is not completed . Instruct the licensee/registrant to correct the NCI(s), and promptly notify your supervisor to discuss how to follow up on the Direct . For example: Return and conduct an unannounced inspection in 1 or 2 days Return and conduct an unannounced inspection with a VMO in 1 or 2 days Call the licensee/registrant to determine what action has been taken Call and discuss with the Attending Vete rinarian --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-31 4.9. Dead Animal/Parts or Serum/Blood Dealer Inspection A dealer who sells dead animals, unborn animals, organ s, limbs, blood, serum, or other body parts of regulated animals must meet all applicable Regulations and Standards. Dead Animal/Parts General Information 4.9.1.1.1 Dogs and Cats If the animals arrive at the premises dead, specific areas to inspect include, but are not limited to: Records of acquisition Records of disposition If the dogs/cats arrive at the premises alive and are held prior to euthanasia, the facility must meet all the applicable Standards, including official USDA identification . A complete inspection should be conducted. 4.9.1.1.2 All Animals Other Than Dogs and Cats If the licensee does not acquire nor take control of the animals prior to the animals' deaths, no records are required. If the animals arrive at the premises alive and are euthanized upon arrival, specific areas to inspect include, but are not limited to: Animal holding/euthanasia area Euthanasia procedures Acquisition and Disposition Records If the animals arrive at the premises alive and are held prior to euthanasia, conduct a complete inspection. Blood and Serum Collection A dealer's procedure for collection of blood and serum should be evaluated carefully to ensure the welfar e of the animals . Removal of excessive amounts of blood may have negative effects on the animal. General Guidelines If an animal is held long -term for collection of blood and/or serum, the inspector procedure should review: Volume per collection o Normally, the maximum amount of blood that should be withdrawn in one bleeding is 15% of the total blood volume (TBV) --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-32 o TBV is usually estimated to be 5 - 10% of total body weight (TBW) for most species, with one gram equal to one milliliter Frequency of collection An animal has to recover from the previous blood draw before another blood draw o Recovery times usually range from 1 - 4 weeks depending on the species and volume of blood drawn Long- term care If the inspector has concerns about the amount of blo od being drawn or the frequency of collection, he/she should discuss with the attending veterinarian and/or his/her SACS. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-33 4.10. Dogs and Cats in Residence Inspection Inspecting dogs and/or cats that are being kept and/or bred inside the licensee or applicant's home can be challenging . Many of the Standards used during routine kennel /cattery inspections are not applicable . It is important that the inspector take the overall conditions into account in making a determination and always contact a supervisor if there are questions. Please note the following: All regulated dogs and cats must be officially identified and listed on the appropriate animal inventory form Do not enter or stay in a residence unless you are sure you are safe Do not intrude into areas of the home which are not critical to evaluating the conditions for the regulated dogs or cats Do not open cabinets, refrigerators, drawers, or doors unless you have the expressed permission of the owner and the contents are directly related to the care of the dogs or cats Do not refer to the facility as a \"house\", \"home\", or \"residence\" on an Inspection Report. Use the term \"facility\", or some other mutually agreeable term such as \"small dog area\" or \"retired breeder housing area.\" Do not use the impervious surfaces Standards under sections 3.2(d), 3.26(d), or 3.51(d), unless there is a designated housing or whelping area inside the home . For example, a bathroom used for whelping should have surfaces that can be sanitized but that applies to the bathroom area only . A living room where dogs hang out and watch television cannot be required to have surfaces that are impervious to moisture. Focus on the health of the animals and any direct hazards to their health or safety, particularly in areas not dedicated to housing animals . For example, in the living room, you would be looking at the health of the animals and such potential hazards as access to electric wires, bleach, choking or ingestion hazards, or significant waste disposal issues. Occasionally, a mudroom, laundry room, enclosed porch, or bathroom is used as a designated whelping or housing area . When animals are present, these areas must provide adequate temperature and ventilation and be easily cleaned and sanitized for the health of the animals. Wear clean boots or shoe covers to enter the premises . Do not use the same boots or shoe covers in which you inspected any other kennel /cattery buildings. When photographs are required, be extremely careful to only photograph what is necessary to document the noncompliance . Be sensitive to the fact that taking a large number of photographs in someone's house or photographing personal belongings may add stress to the inspection process . Take the minimum number of photographs needed. It is important to be sensitive to the fact that this is the licensee's or applicant's --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-34 home and act accordingly . There is no limit under the AWA on the number of pets that a person can have in their house . We know from experience that a large number of dogs or cats housed in a residence can create unhealthy conditions . If you encounter an unusually large number of dogs or cats in a residence, or have concerns about general conditions in a residence, postpone the completion of the inspection and contact your supervisor. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-35 4.11. Domestic Hoofstock Inspection A dealer, exhibitor or research facility using domestic hoofstock who does not meet the AWA exclusions or exemptions must meet all applicable Regulation s and Standards, including the T ranspor tation Standards. Domestic hoofstock are: Alpacas Cows Goats Llamas Pigs and mini- pigs Sheep Hybrid crosses of the above animals Domestic Hoofstock Housed in an Agricultural Setting Agricultural settings include, but are not limited to: Pastures or ranges Outdoor pens with shelters and/or barns Production housing When inspecting an agricultural setting, the inspector should use Subpart F of the AWA Standards . The inspector may also refer to the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Teaching and Research, Third Edition, January 2010. Domestic Hoofstock Housed in a Non- Agricultural Setting Non -agricultural settings include, but are not limited to: Zoos Indoor displays such as nature centers or sportsman shows Research facilities When inspecting a non -agricultural setting, the inspector should use Subpart F of the AWA Standards. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-36 4.12. Drive -through Zoo/Park Inspection A zoo or animal park which allows people to drive through, either in their own vehicles or a zoo/park vehicle, must meet all applicable Regulations and Standards. Consider a team inspection for drive -through parks . In addition to the regular equipment, inspectors should bring: Binoculars for each inspector to facilitate viewing of animals Cameras with adequate zoom to photogr aph animals at a distance Conducting the Inspection Driving through the Zoo/Park Driving through the facility for inspection can be done in a facility -owned vehicle or in a GOV: Due to restrictions on the use of GOVs, the facility representative cannot accompany the inspectors in a government vehicle During the inspection, it is acceptable to ride in a vehicle provided and driven by the facility representative Safety while driving through the zoo/park: Pay particular attention to safety while moving Watch for animals and other vehicles in the roadways Driver's attention should be focused on driving safely Passenger should be taking notes, photographs, and observing animals Regardless of whose vehicle is used, it is important to: Drive slowly Stop frequently to observe the animals and their behavior Stop in locations where you can view animals congregating Pay particular attention to animals that may be isolated from the groups Observe the other vehicles driving through the zoo/park Watch for public interactions with the animals If public feeding is allowed, observe how it is accomplished --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-37 Animal Inspection Inspectors should evaluate the licensee's methods for providing both routine herd -wide preventative health care (as required by the facility's attending veterinarian) as well as care to individual animals that may become sick or injured . These methods may include: Annual or semi- annual animal 'round ups' where preventative care such as vaccination and deworming can be administered to all animals Moving individual animals into smaller areas to facilitate treatment using training or chutes Chemical immobilization administered by a remote delivery system To help evaluate the handling methods, ask or look at: The equipment in use, such as: o Chutes o Drugs o Remote drug delivery systems Ensure that the equipment and drugs are appropriate for: o The species o Setting/terrain Expansive habitats may necessitate the use of chemical capture and restraint drugs . To be considered adequate veterinary care the facility staff must be trained in their use and have the appropriate facilities and equipment to respond to adverse events if they occur . Handling When inspecting for compliance with the Handling Regulations at a drive - through zoo/park, some recommended items to evaluate include, but are not limited to: Compatibility of the animals in an area Caution signs, such as: o Do not get out of car NOTICE When inspectors are conducting the inspection from a GOV, the facility representative can accompany the inspectors by driving behind the inspectors' vehicle . In this case, cell phones or a radio may be used to point out any potential noncompliance or to ask questions that may arise . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-38 o Do not put fingers in cages o Feeding only allowed when facility attendants are present Posting or distribution of the safety rules Monitoring of the zoo/park by employees during their regular duties Number of employees/attendants to patrol the zoo/park Monitoring of areas not readily visible to attendants Procedure in the event of an animal escape or attack Public Feeding The public may not bring outside food into the facility for public feeding . Food must be provided by the facility [2.131(d)(4)] . Remember to ask questions about measures that the facility has in place to prevent this practice and what actions are taken if this situation is found by the facility . Food offered to the animals must be: Wholesome Palatable Presented in an appropriate manner There are many methods for public feeding at drive -through zoos/parks which may be compliant . For example: Facilities use designated areas for feeding so that attendants can be present at those areas . Feeding in other areas is not permitted and the facilities have methods in place to discourage this practice. Facilities only permit feeding from facility operated vehicles that have sufficient attendants accompanying the public group Regular patrolling by facility staff of the feeding area Video surveillance of the feeding area with radio dispatch Distribution of written policie s on feeding, such as handouts given to the public stating feeding rules such as, windows must be closed unless a facility attendant is present, and no feeding of animals unless an attendant is present Posted Caution Signs When public feeding occurs from facility -owned vehicles, inspectors should evaluate how many attendants are present and whether they can intervene in the event of a problem . When the vehicle driver is the only attendant, it may be difficult to ensure both animal and visitor safety . This is particularly true for large vehicles, those with driver separation from the public, or horse drawn vehicles . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-39 Facility Inspection When inspecting drive -through zoos, remember to evaluate all aspects of the facilities . Ask about alternate housing . Many drive -through zoos/parks: Move a portion of the animals to alternate housing Rotate pastures May close for a portion of the year and move the animals Separation of Businesses Some drive -through zoos/parks also have other animal- related activities that are not considered by the park's owner to be part of the regulated enterprise, such as production farms or hunting preserves . It is important to determine what is regulated and what is exempt: Generally regulated if: o The animals are all comingled through out the facility pastures or enclosures o The animals are viewed by the public during their visit to the facility o The animals from an off -site area are brought to and from the exhibit site Animal Compatibility Drive -through zoos/parks often have large multi- species enclosures. This can lead to compatibility issues if care is not taken in selecting the species and individual animals . During inspection: Pay attention to animal interactions particularly around resources such as feeders, water sources, shelter, etc . Assess body condition . This can also be helpful in determining whether animals are getting adequate feed or if competition is negatively impacting them . Remember, not all compatibility issues are constant . Seasonal hormonal fluctuations associated with breeding season/rutting season can impact both intra -species and inter -species compatibility, so vary inspections by time of year. Evaluate animal records closely to help identify injuries or deaths which may be due to compatibility issues Access to Shelter Adequate shelter is essential for all animals at all facility types . The large --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-40 enclosures provide opportunity for naturalistic habitat, but also present unique challenges. Natural shelter such as trees may not be sufficient in all circumstances . When natural shelter is not adequate to protect animals from discomfort, artificial shelter must be available . When evaluating artificial shelter, the inspector should ensure that: There is sufficient space for all animals There are enough shelters for all animals to fit into comfortably Shelters are strong enough for all species Access to Potable Water Ponds and/or streams used as the sole water source may be considered adequate potable water . However, the following items must be evaluated: Natural stream, river, pond , or lake water should appear clear and there should be no indication of animal impacts caused by the water When covered by algae, water beneath should appear clear. Presence of algae does not mean the water is not potable. Ponds may freeze during the winter presenting a hazard for animals when the only water source Ask the facility representatives to point out potable water sources during inspection as additional water sources may be concealed to provide a natural looking environme nt. Environmental Hazards These natural environmental features may be hazards for some species but be appropriate habitat for others . You will need to make determinations about safety for the animals . Therefore, when inspecting, remember to: Evaluate the physical terrain Know the natural history of the animals Be aware that some of these hazards change seasonally or between inspections Evaluate the facility's program for self -identifying/correcting issues before adverse animal impacts occur NOTICE Remember to assess the shelter in combination with compatibility as dominant animals may prevent submissive animals from using shelters if there is insufficient space. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-41 Review the facility records for injuries, deaths, and animals provided veterinary care to help evaluate the impact of physical hazards Records Exhibitors are required to make, keep, and maintain records of: Acquisition (including births) Disposition (including deaths and euthanasia) Animals on hand [for animals other than cats and dogs, see Section 2.75(b) (1)]. Increased mortality or decreased births can be indicators of both animal health and/or welfare problems . Therefore, accurate record keeping is essential for: Facilitating communication be tween the licensee and the attending veterinarian AC Personnel to evaluate compliance with the AWA Regulations and Standards. Evaluating effects of natural hazards Evaluating compatibility issues When reviewing records of animal deaths/euthanasia, inspecto rs should remember to ask questions . For example, what were the circumstances surrounding the death or serious injury and was appropriate veterinary care provided? Necropsy Records In some circumstances, necropsy examinations may be appropriate as part of the provision of adequate veterinary care . For example, if there are: Abnormally high death losses Significant unexplained mortality Other conditions indicative of an undiagnosed infectious disease Inspectors should request to see documentation of necropsy examinations . If such records exist, they must be made available for inspection pursuant to section 2.125. Animal Inventory In large drive -through zoos/parks, there may be instances where it is not possible to ensure accuracy when counting a particular species during the inspection. For example: A large group of fallow deer in expansive multi -acre exhibit Pot-bellied pigs allowed to roam the entire facility --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-42 Small number of shy animals that are easily hidden in the natural environment Prairie dogs in a confined space that has only overhead viewing In these cases, the inspector must assess the accuracy of the records . Examples of methods that may be used include, but are not limited to: Facilities may record births or deaths as they occur and then c onfirm total numbers of animals on hand at annual or semi -annual 'round -ups' where routine health procedures are also conducted Although individual animal identification is not specifically required by the AWA (for animals other than dogs & cats), licensees may ear -tag or otherwise identify individual animals as a best practice Some States may require ear- tag or other type of permanent identification for cervids If the facility's method for maintaining records of animals on hand appears adequate, inspectors may use the facility's animal count for the purposes of the inspection inventory . Training and Qualifications During the evaluation of records is a good time to ask about the qualifications and training of the employees . Employees may be involved in activities that require specialized training, such as: Immobilization of animals Movement of large dangerous hoof stock Movement of very flighty hoof stock Determining compatibility among varied species Distinguishing between normal and abnormal behavior for a variety of species Observing illness/injury among a variety of species It is important to check that employees are adequately trained and supervised by someone who has the necessary knowledge to instruct them. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-43 4.13. Lion and Tiger Enclosure Inspection This document provides guidance for assessing lion, tiger, and lion -tiger hybrid enclosures under commonly found circumstances at stationary facilities for purposes of primary containment . Enclosure s that clearly do not meet performance Standards for containment as per 9 CFR section 3.125(a) must be cited . All citations must refer back to the language of the Regulations and Standards ; there are no engineering Standards . Evaluating Enclosures Facto rs to consider when evaluating enclosures include: Height . Acceptable fencing for lions, tigers, and lion -tiger hybrids is typically a minimum of 12 feet in height, plus an additional method of preventing escape, such as, but not limited to: o A kick -in at the top o Hotwire attached to the fencing around the entire enclosure with sufficient joule rating to prevent the big cat from climbing to the top o A 2.5 - 3-foot-wide section of non -climbable material such as sheet metal attached to the fencing below the top of the entire enclosure fence to prevent climbing o An enclosure with a completely covered top (Note: Enclosures with a complete covered top must be high enough to allow for normal and typical behaviors and postures.) A wet or dry moat can be used to contain lions, tigers, and lion -tiger hybrids . Moats are typically 25 feet wide or greater and 16 feet deep or filled with 5 feet of water . Remember that if the animal enclosure is higher than where the public is standing, additional distance is needed as animals can jump farther when going from high to low ground. Trees and cage furnishings should be far enough away from the enclosure fence to prevent the big cats from climbing out Note that this guidance is for enclosure design for compliance 9 CFR 3.125(a), and does not address handling requirements such as public barriers, which may need to be assessed as a separate issue. NOTICE If the inspector has any concerns about an enclosure's ability to contain lions, tigers and/or lion tiger hybrids, the inspector should contact his/her supervisor and Animal Care's Big Cat Specialist for guidance. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-44 Compliant big cat fencing The inspector should consult with the licensee on an appropriate identifier for each enclosure .

Marine Mammal Facility Inspections A licensee who conducts regulated activity with marine mammals must meet all applicable Regulation s and Standards, including the T ransportation Standards. Conducting the Inspection Prior to inspecting a marine mammal facility, you should revie w the Marine Mammal Standards, Subpart E, and the facility's recent inspection history. When inspecting a facility with marine mammals, some items to evaluate are listed below. Veterinary Care Marine mammals must be provided adequate veterinary care, inclu ding but not limited to: All marine mammals must be visually examined by the attending veterinarian at least semiannually . Also, all cetacean or sirenian must be physically examined by the attending veterinarian annually, unless APHIS grants an exception based on considerations related to the health and safety of the cetacean or sirenian. Each marine mammal must have medical records that include physical examination information Review records for each animal with medical concerns or under treatment first. Verify that animals with inappetence over 24 hours are documented and the attending veterinarian has been notified. Ask about any births or deaths Ask how the facility cleans, disinfects, and stores equipment used for medical/husbandry behavior training ( e.g., gastric tubes, toothbrush, sample collection containers) Ask if any marine mammals are in quarantine or isolation and why Ensure that quarantine or isolation pools/areas for marine mammals held for nonmedical purposes meet the minimum space requirements Review the medical records and attending veterinarian justification for any marine mammals held for medical purposes for more than 2 weeks in quarantine or isolation pools/areas that do not meet the minimum spa ce requirements Evaluate and inspect holding areas (for isolation, separation, and treatment): o If a marine mammal is kept separated or isolated, there should be veterinary justification and provisions for periodic review of the plan by the attending veteri narian Review necropsy/histopathology reports --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Typ es of Inspections 4-46 Review any incident, husbandry, daily feeding and supplement logs and training logs Space Marine mammal primary enclosures must meet the space requirements in section 3.104. Space requirements for marine mammals housed in unusual circumstances Situations that may require further evaluation of space to assess compliance for marine mammal pools may include: Irregularly shaped pools Pools with islands or obstructions within the swimming area of the animals Pools with varying depths, where the shallow areas of the pool do not meet the minimum depth requirement for the species housed Pools with gates or channels that must be included in the minimum horizontal dimension (MHD) calculation for the pool to meet the required minimum horizontal dimension Gather clear documentation necessary to submit to your SACS to thoroughly assess the situation . This documentation should include photographs and measurements. Photographic documentation should include, but not be limited to: Document the pool(s) using photographs taken from at least two different angles, with photos taken across the width and length of the pool, or two different views of a round or irregular pool Include two -view photographs of obstructions, such as i slands or pool outcroppings that may impede an animal's ability to swim within the pool Include close -up and distance photographs of channels, gates, and/or narrow areas that may require animals to adjust their swimming patterns . Include photographs taken looking down from the side of the pool, documenting the depth of the channel, gate design, or shallow areas. Include photographs of channels, outcroppings, or islands taken from underwater viewing windows, when possible Try to obtain video footage of the animals swimming in the pool, optimally when they are passing through gates, narrow channels, or swimming in a pattern around an island, to determine the animals' ability to navigate the narrow or irregular areas or to document the animals' ability to swim through shallow sections that do not meet the depth requirement Measurements should include, but not be limited to: --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-47 Measurements of the depth, width and length or circumference of shallow areas of the pool that are noncompliant and that require further as sessment For pools with a sloping bottom, determine from either architectural plans, or from your own measurements, the approximate point at which the pool is a compliant depth for the largest species housed Create a map of the pool indicating the areas me eting the minimum depth requirements Measure the length, width, and depth of all channels that are necessary for the animals to use Determine from written records, facility personnel or SOP , the amount of time gates are left open for the animals to access separate areas of the pool Measure the width, length, and depth of irregular areas of the pool if there is a question about calculating the MHD of the pool Feeding Food for marine mammals must be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and must be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain marine mammals in good health. To minimize nutrient loss and bacterial contamination, frozen or thawed food must be stored, thawed, and prepared properly . At a minimum, you should: Inquire about the source(s) of the food Inquire about types of food being fed and their nutrient analysis . Diets must be prepared with consideration for factors such as age, species, condition, and size of the marine mammal being fed Be aware that fatty fish, such as mackerel and tuna, have a shorter shelf life (4-6 months) Check freezers and refrigerators to verify proper temperatures . Freezers/cold storage must be maintained at a maximum temperature of 0 degrees F Examine the stored food and ask how food is store d and rotated to ensure that it maintains optimal nutritive value by minimizing freezer storage time and does not become freezer burned Check the catch date on boxes - old food loses nutritive value over time Verify frozen food has not thawed and refrozen or boxes damaged indicating possible contamination: o Check for water, blood, or ice pooling beneath or frozen to boxes, and o Check for freezer burn which could affect palatability and moisture content of the food. Signs of freezer burn include white or desi ccated --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-48 flesh. Ask how food is thawed . Thawing must be conducted in a manner that minimizes contamination and will assure that the food retains nutritive value and wholesome quality until the time of feeding . When food is thawed in standing or running wat er, cold water must be used. Ask to see and examine a representative sample of thawed food to verify wholesomeness . Attention should be given to skin appearance, gill color, eye clarity, elasticity of the flesh, odor, and condition of viscera. Review the diet and amounts fed for each animal and ask how it is determined Review how calories/needs are calculated Review the feeding schedule/frequency Ask about supplementation and how it was determined. For example, cetaceans should have a multi -vitamin with B 1 (Thiamine) at a minimum. Review daily food consumption records for each marine mammal All food must be fed to marine mammals within 24 hours once removed from freezers for thawing Water Quality The water in the primary enclosures must not be detrimental to the health of the marine mammals . When inspecting pools, at a minimum, you should: Ensure that each pool is being monitored and tested Look at SOPs for water testing Ask about frequency of testing Who does testing/where performed? Is it i n-house or sent out to the lab? Review water quality data for preceding year for ALL pools Keep in mind that pools that are rectangular in shape or have a narrow passage into another pool should be monitored carefully because dead spaces may affect water quality If water is tested at an intake valve, the facility may also consider testing water taken from another area of the pool Daily testing: o pH must be tested daily: - A pH between 7.6 and 8.0 is ideal for marine mammal life support systems - Facilities with natural sal twater do not have to test for pH o Water samples shall be taken and tested at least daily for chemical --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-49 additives (e.g., chlorine and copper) added to the water to maintain water quality standards Weekly testing: o Coliforms must be tested at least weekly o Coliforms with a consistent value of zero each week may be of concern o if coliforms exceed 1000MPN/100 ml, action must be taken: - Two subsequent samples may be taken within 48 hours intervals and averaged with the first sample to obtain new count - If number still exceeds 1000MPN/100 ml, then water is unacceptable and must be immediately corrected - Many facilities will do a partial to full water change to correct the problem Check Salinity levels: o Salinity should range from 15 - 36 PPT (parts per thousand): - Natural seawater salinity is 32 - 35 PPT - Salinity less than 20 PPT is likely to cause skin and eye pathology in cetaceans - Eye problems may be observed in pinnipeds housed in fresh or brackish water Shelter and Shade All marine mammals kept outside m ust be provided with shelter to afford them protection from the weather and direct sunlight. When inspecting the shelter provided, at a minimum, you should: Look carefully at each animal for eye damage which can be caused by inadequate shelter from direct sunlight and is a serious, painful health concern for both pinnipeds and cetaceans Look at supplements being given (Eye -Sea is a common supplement given to marine mammals with eye damage and/or to prevent damage) Check if any animals have zinc oxide on heads or back . If yes, they may be ill and may need additional shelter. Observe a training session . Ensure animals are not being asked to look into sun during feeding. If public feeding is allowed, then observe the activity to ensure that the animals are not forced to look directly into the sun while getting their food reward Shelters can be natural or artificial so long as they are appropriate for the species concerned when local climatic conditions are taken into --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-50 consideration . For example, facilities may use moveable umbrellas to protect animals' eyes during training. Polar bears: The dry resting and social activity area for polar bears must be provided with enough shade to accommodate all polar bears housed in the primary enclosure at the same time. Public Barriers The requirements for public barriers are contained within section 3.101 (a)(2) under General Facilities and section 2.131(c)(1) under Handling: All marine mammals must be provided with protection from abuse and harassment by the viewing publ ic by: o The use of a sufficient number of readily identifiable employees or attendants to supervise the viewing public, or o The use of physical barriers, or o A combination of these [3.101(a)(2)] During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the animals and public [2.131 (c)(1)] You should routinely observe public viewi ng areas to verify: If employees or attendants are used to protect marine mammals from abuse or harassment, then: o There are a sufficient number of uniformed or readily identifiable employees or attendants to supervise the viewing public, and o The attendants are adequately trained and attentive to the actions of the public The attendants are able to quickly respond to situations where the public potentially could have unsupervised contact with the animals: o Ask how the attendants would respond to any unsafe be haviors by the public . A common problem seen at marine mammal facilities involves the accidental or deliberate dropping of inedible items in the pool which can pose a serious health hazard if ingested. If physical barriers such as fences, walls, or glass partitions, are used, then they must be sufficient to protect the marine mammals from abuse and harassment by the viewing public and to assure the safety of the animals and the public If a combination of attendants and physical barriers are used, then they must effectively provide protection from abuse and harassment and assure the safety of both the marine mammals and the public --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-51 Separation Marine mammals known to be social in the wild must be housed with at least one compatible animal of same or biologically related species, except when the attending veterinarian, in consultation with the husbandry/training staff, determines that such housing is not in the best interest of the marine mammal's health or well- being. When inspecting, at a minimum, you should: Check that social needs of the marine mammals are being addressed . If unsure, contact your SACS for guidance. Marine mammals housed together must be compatible and other animals housed near the marine mammals must not cause them unreasonable stress or dis comfort or interfere with their good health For marine mammals housed separately, check for a written plan approved by attending veterinarian, and developed in consultation with husbandry/ training staff, justifying the length of time of the separation and outlining the type and frequency of enrichment and interaction to be provided to the marine mammal Employees A facility must have a sufficient number of adequately trained employees or attendants working in concert with the attending veterinarian to maintain the husbandry practices as required in the AWA Standards . Such practices must be under the supervision of a marine mammal caretaker with demonstrable experience in marine mammal husbandry and care. When inspecting, at a minimum, y ou should: Review written documentation that the employees/attendants have successfully completed a facility training course which includes, but is not limited to: o Species appropriate husbandry techniques o Animal handling techniques o Proper reporting protoco ls on recordkeeping o Notifying veterinary staff of medical concerns Check that any training of marine mammals is being done by or under the direct supervision of experienced trainers Ensure that trainers or handlers meet professionally recognized standards for experience and training .

The Contingency Plan must be in writing and approved by the AC Deputy Administrator. Contingency plans must include, but not be limited to : Specific animal evacuation plans in the event of a disaster Description of back -up systems and/or arrangements for relocating marine mammals requiring artificially cooled or heated water If the emergency contingency plan includes release of marine mammals, the plan must include provision for recall training and ret rieval of such animals Contingency plans should be sent by the facility to the Fort Collins AWO office for approval. If you have concerns that the Contingency Plan is out- of-date, discuss with your SACS. Recordkeeping Marine mammal facilities must main tain all records required under Subpart G - Records and any specific records required for marine mammals, such as: Medical records for individual animals Necropsy records Feeding records Water quality records When inspecting records, at a minimum, you should: Review all of the required records and ensure they are being kept for 1 year (or 3 years for necropsy records) Contact National Policy Staff (NPS) if you need to obtain National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) inventory data Verify th e facility's inventory and cross reference with NOAA inventory Swim -with -the-dolphin (SWTD)/Interactive Programs Section 3.111 Standards have been suspended. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-53 4.15. New Site Approval Inspection New site approvals are only required for licensees. Registrants are not required to have a new site approved prior to use. Animal Care designates housing areas that are roughly 35 miles or further from the main address of the licensed or registered facility as separate sites . Site designations are used for tracking and inspection management purposes. If the use of a single site designation causes a major problem at a facility, discuss the situation with your SACS. The amount of time necessary to inspect all housing/exhibition facilities at a site is not a rationale for designating a separate site. The licensee must list all sites and their addresses on the Application for License (APHIS Form 7003 -A). New buildings or enclosures at an existing or nearby site do not require pre - approval. It is often helpful to perform a courtesy visit of new or proposed construction at currently licensed or registered sites, but it is not a requirement. All buildings and enclosures in use should be inspected during the routine unannounced inspection of the existing site . Addition of a S ite A site may be added to an existing license as follows: Licensee must notify, preferably by certified mail, the Ft . Collins AWO Field Office of the address of the new site AWO Field Office will inform the field inspector Inspector should schedule an inspection with the licensee as soon as possible No additional license fee is required to be paid for the addition of a new site. No regulated activities may take place at the new site until it has passed inspection.

Do not conduct a Prelicense Inspecti on until all the applicant's/licensee's paperwork has been processed by the Program Section and the inspector has been informed that the applicant may be inspected. There must be regulated animals at the facility at the time of the inspection. If this a problem due to State laws/regulations or local ordinances, contact your SACS. Prelicense Inspections are the best time to help the applicant learn more about the AWA Regulations and Standards using the enhanced prelicense process . Required written records ( e.g., a program of veterinary care and a plan for environmental enhancement for nonhuman primates) must be completed by the applicant and reviewed by the inspector during a Prelicense Inspection to consider the facility in compliance . There must be a written record of animals on hand with as much of the required information completed as possible. All Prelicense Inspection Reports must be hand delivered . If hand delivery is not possible, discuss extenuating circumstances with your SACS For facilities that are relicensing , the process has some differences. See Section 4.19.7. Initial Contact with the Applicant Prior to conducting the first Prelicense Inspection: Contact the applicant within ten days of receiving the notification letter from the AWO Field Office Schedule and conduct a Prelicense phone discussion o The discussion can be done in person but not at the same time as the Prelicense inspection o The discussion should be scheduled since it can take 45 -90 minutes, and o The applicant will need time to gather paperwork and prepare questions for the discussion o For this call to be effective, the applicant and the inspector must be focused and prepared for the discussion NOTICE Courtesy Vi sits are not permitted after the 1st or 2nd prelicense/relicense inspections. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-65 Have a phone discussion with the applicant to determine if the facility is ready for the First Prelicense Inspection Schedule the First Prelicense Inspection o Let the ap plicant know this could take 4 -6 hours and will involve discussion and review of the AWA requirements and an inspection o Contact your SACS to request second inspector or Compliance Specialist to accompany you if you feel that you may need assistance First Prelicen se Inspection Conducting the Inspection Prior to starting the physical inspection: Go through informational materials with the applicant Focus on using informational materials that are applicable to all facilities for a new applicant Remind the applicant that they are legally responsible for being familiar with and compliant with the AWA (9 CFR) Remind the applicant that interference during the inspection and/or refusal to allow an inspection are serious issues During the inspection of animals and the faci lity: Be sure to inspect all animals used for regulated purposes For dealers with dogs , you must: o Have the applicant pull all dogs showing signs of medical issues so that you can evaluate whether veterinary attention is needed and/or is already being prov ided, and o Also select ten percent of the remaining dogs for the applicant to pull so that you can look for medical issues associated with their mouths, teeth, ears, eyes, skin, general condition, etc . Do not just focus on one area; take the opportunity to look at the entire dog for medical issues . Remember , wear a new pair of gloves after touching each dog or after each enclosure. If you identify a veterinary care issue that would normally be cited during a Routine Inspection, it must be cited on the Inspection Report for the Prelicense Inspection Inspect the entire facility thoroughly: o This includes equipment and vehicles intended for use with animals o Be certain to verify the locations of all animals on site and off s ite that are used or intended for regulated use Inspect all housing areas thoroughly: --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-66 o This includes all housing for all regulated animals - even if the applicant states it is temporary housing o If you have a concern about the primary enclosure, especially for large carnivores, elephants, great apes, and/or marine mammals, you should contact your SACS to discuss Inspect all storage areas thoroughly: o Including vaccine and medication storage o All food and bedding storage NOTE: If the applicant was previously licensed, he/she must re -apply for any variance (e.g., perimeter fence , records ) granted under the cancelled license .

Public Walk -In Aviary Inspection Exterior Aviary Check & Entering Before entering, walk around the outside o f the aviary. Assess compliance by: Looking for any evidence of pests or predators Examining the sides of the enclosure for any holes, disrepair, or potential areas of escape or predator entrance Assessing for vegetation over -growth or clutter near the a viary When entering the aviary: Look for and follow all biosecurity precautions such as hand -washing stations or foot baths Evaluate the double -door entry system or any equivalent system in place to prevent the accidental escapes of the birds in the aviar y Ask the facility about any escapes that have happened since the last inspection Inside the Aviary Aviary Configuration and Safety When assessing the safety of the aviary some key areas to consider include but are not limited to : Presence of d efined pathways and handrails that limit public access Sufficient areas in the aviary where the birds can visually and/or physically retreat from visitors Are daily observations performed to quickly identify injured or sick birds and provide medical care Aquatic areas which are large enough to pose a drowning risk have preventative measures such as a netting, sloped edges, or objects in the water to allow birds to climb out Placement of perches, nests, enrichment items, food, or water receptacles are not within arm's reach of the public. This includes ensuring food is not placed in public pathways. Are risky behaviors of birds and members of the public being monitored and discouraged. This includ es interacting not under the direction and supervision of facility staff. Note: Birds may be more aggressive during breeding or nesting times. Are there signs/posted information notifying the public to watch for birds on the ground to avoid stepping on or otherwise injuring the birds, not to chase the birds, or when entering/exiting to watch for birds to minimize escapes. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-75 For aviaries with free -flighted birds, the risk of collisions needs to be continuously evaluated and mitigated. This can include: o Using materials that are obviou s to birds in flight such as bird -safe glass or using materials that are pliable in case of collisions, such as mesh netting o Use of acclimatization and conditioning for new bird introductions to the enclosure and minimizing significant changes to areas which could lead to collisions o Providing a low -stress environment that minimizes birds getting easily frightened and frantically flying away. This involves having only compatible animals in the aviary and monitoring the public for unsafe behaviors such as ch asing. o Ensuring the birds are not overcrowded in the aviary o Having adequate and appropriate lighting for birds to clearly see all obstacles Environmental Conditions Depending on the design, materials, or ventilation system , an aviary may have problems with high temperature and/or high humidity. Temperature, humidity, and ventilation need to be assessed for the bird's comfort along with asking about how they maintain the aviary in all weather extremes. For indoor aviaries, ensure the opening of exterior doors do not cause significant temperature changes or drafts that affects the bird's comfort. If the aviary is an outdoor enclosure, shelter needs to be closely examined to determine if it is appropriate for the local climatic conditions to protect all birds from all adverse weather conditions. Shelters must be adequately ventilated, have shade, provide protection that comfortably contains all the birds at one time without causing intraspecific aggression or grouping of incompatible birds, and prevent their di scomfort from direct sunlight, precipitation, or wind. Assess drainage in aviary and ensure all birds have access to a dry area. Observing the Birds During the inspection, you should: Ask the facility how daily observations to assess the birds' health are performed, including reclusive birds, birds on a nest, and chicks Visually inspect and count as many birds as possible. Look for long toenails, poor feathers, beak symmetry, obvious eye issues or injuries, evident respiratory issues, lameness or swelling o f the feet, and adequate body condition. If you see any flight capable birds staying on the ground or any bird holding its wing in an abnormal position, ask the facility about the health status of that animal. For large aviaries, you should consider using --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-76 binoculars . Evaluate interactions between animals in the aviary. Look for signs of aggression and determine if the bird can easily get away. Signs of aggression can include raising the wings, loud vocalizations, biting, hissing, picking at another's feathers or bald spots, dilating pupils, chasing the other bird around the enclosure, and preventing access to food or drinking wate r. Also look at non -avian animals possibly negative ly impacting the birds. Water and Food Sources During the inspection: Visually inspect the placement and cleanliness of the water and food receptacles. Aviaries with multiple birds must have enough food and clean water sources for all animals. For flighted birds the receptacles should be elevated and easy for the birds to access. Aq uatic areas should be assessed for appropriate sizing (including the dry area and proper slope into and out of the water), and for appropriate water quality (no trash or food waste present, and no excessive algal growth/turbidity, etc.) . If food is placed directly on the ground, the floor must be dry, clean, and ensure the food is wholesome, palatable to the birds, and free of contamination or residual cleaning products. Assess the area for signs of pests. Assess all aquatic areas for potential entrances by predators and pests Cleaning & Sanitization All animals need to have access to a clean space (including perches) , be free of excessive feces and food waste, and prevent accumulation of dirt and debris, and other disease hazards . Water and food rece ptacles need to be clean and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Small or young aquatic avian species can become entrapped or drown during the emptying of aquatic pools. Evaluate the safety of the drainage system when these pools are cleaned. Mesh covers over drainage openings or low flow drainage can alleviate this risk. Perches and Vegetation During the inspection, you should: Ensure the aviary has plenty of perches for e very bird and that the perches are an appropriate size, suitable materials, and in good repair Ask if the plants inside the enclosure have been determined to be safe for the animals inside the aviary. Look at any large trees or plants in order to --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-77 evaluate safety. For birds that may be stressed by human presence, v erify there is an area for the birds to retreat (both visually and physically) from visitors Public Feeding and Public Interaction Determine if the facility is intentionally having the birds interact with the public. Some factors that indicate the facility is intentionally having the birds interact with the public include , but are limited to : Selling seed sticks or any other food items intended for the birds Birds are regularly landing on people or advertisements of the aviary include photos or videos of the public handling the birds Having perches, enrichment items, food, or water receptacles within in arms reach of the public Not monitoring or discouraging birds from interacting with the public if it does happen No instructions or signs discouraging public interactions with the birds For public interactions: If the facility has periods of public contact with the avian species or other covered animals in the aviary, the facility must : Follow the han dling regulations ( \u00a7 2.131) , including handl ing with minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers , and Having an identifiable attendant at all times that can monitor the activity If you are able to view a public interaction on inspection, it's highly encouraged. Recordkeeping During the inspection, you should: Ask about adverse incidents involving the birds or public since the last inspection Check records for significant number of deaths, deaths from traum a or aggression from other animals, or unexplained deaths. Deaths, injuries, and escapes need to be assessed for compliance. Check inventory numbers with what you saw on inspection. Refer to sections 2.6.2.2 Difficult to Count Species and 2.6.2.3 Species/Circumstances where Accurate Counts are Impossible when inventory is not matching what was seen on inspection. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-78 4.21.

Traveling Exhibitor Inspection Each inspector should develop a consistent method of conducting inspections of traveling exhibitors that ensures a thorough and accurate inspection. Home Site Inspection A Traveling Exhibitor must have a home site (001) . If animals are housed at the home site, the facility must meet all the applicable AWA Regulations and Standards for a permanent location. If a Traveling Exhibitor uses a PO Box or other mail drop location as the home site, they must have another permanent location where animals can be inspected, especially for the Prelicense Inspection. If no one is home and/or available for an inspection at the home site, there is no itinerary showing all animals were traveling and it is during the exhibitor's optimal hours if applicable, then an Attempted Inspection Report should be written . If animals are not housed at the home site, i.e., it is a business or mailing address: An inspection must still be conducted at this site If the licensee is not at the home site, an authorized person should be designated by the licensee and available to conduct an inspection At a minimum, records, such as the program of veterinary care and acquisition/disposition/animals on hand, should be available at the home site Note on the Inspection Report that no animals are housed at this facility and that it is a business/mailing address . For example: \"No animals present at facility . This site serves as a ma iling address.\" General Information Inspections of traveling exhibitors are different from inspections at the home facility . However, all of the applicable AWA Regulations and Standards must be met. If you become aware that a traveling exhibitor is, or will be, performing in your territory: Check eFile for the date and results of the last TRA inspection.

However, if the records are at another site or location, it is acceptable for the records to be emailed or faxed to the site of the inspection during the inspection if possible . Otherwise, the exhibitor can email or fax the records to the inspector within 48 hours to be in compliance. If the required records are not available and not received by the inspector within 48 hours, cite as a noncompliance under the appropriate Section. A traveling exhibitor must have all the appropriate records for the regulated animals for up to 1 year from the disposal or euthanasia of the animals. The following records, when applicable, must be available for review during an inspection on the road, as required by the Regulations and Standards: Acquisition records or a record of animals on hand for all regulated animals present Disposition records for all regulated animals that have left the cu rrent tour since it began, or died or been euthanized while on the road Exercise plan for dogs Health certificates for dogs, cats, nonhuman primates and marine mammals, if required Individual medical records for marine mammals Necropsy records for marine mammals Nonhuman primate environmental enhancement plan Bird environmental enhancement plan Program of veterinary care appropriate for the animals being exhibited Water quality records for marine mammals NOTICE Copies of the original records are acceptable. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Specific Types of Inspections 4-89 Transport Vehicles Inspect transport vehicles for: Cleanliness Condition of the floor, i.e., rotting areas which could give way and/or allow entry of exhaust fumes Food storage areas Separation of species while in transit Space and height for the species transported Structural strength, such as: o Bent or warped surfaces o Loose fittings or grates o Protruding edges Vehicle safety features, such as: o Door latches and locks o Good tires o Proper hitches o Tires rated for the weight load carrying o Vehicle rated for the weight load carrying Ventilation and temperature when doors are closed Working temperature control systems, such as heaters, fans, and air conditioners Accessibility to the animals as needed Adequate barriers, protection, and security of the transport vehicle/trailer to keep the public from getting close to the animals while the vehicle is stopped, such as at a motel or restaurant. This is especially important for trailers with large openings, such as stock trailers. Animals in Transit When in transit, all regulated animals must be housed in enclosures that meet the transportation requirements for that species.

Inspection Guidance General Information All of the covered animals and the facility's program of veterinary care and veterinary care practices and records should be thoroughly reviewed during the inspection. The information in this section is provided for your guidance but all citations must be based on the Regulations and Standards . If you are unsure, you should contact your SACS. Adequate Veterinary Care Sections 2.33, 2.40 and 3.13 require regulated facilities to establish and maintain \"programs\" of adequate veterinary care . The purpose in requiring a program of adequate veterinary care is to ensure that facilities attend to the health needs of animals . The program of adequate veterinary care must include having appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the Regulations; appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose , and treat diseases and injuries, including emergency and weekend care; daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well- being; guidance by the attending veterinarian to personnel in animal care and use techniques, including the use of pain- relieving drugs and euthanasia; and adequate pre -procedural and post- procedural care . Upon inspection, you should evaluate the appearance and condition of the animals as well as the facility, to determine whether the overall veterinary care program is adequate to ensure that proper care is being rendered, and whether the facility is following its written program of veterinary care. An animal is considered to have received adequate veterinary care if it has been: Discussed with or examined and evaluated by a qualified veterinarian (either the attending or a consulting) in a timely manner, and Prescribed a treatment plan which is appropriate for the animal's condition, potentially including further observation without treatment if appropriate, and Treatment s have been administered as prescribed The outcome of the treatment is not the determining factor for the adequacy of veterinary care, provided that the care is in keeping with appropriate standards of veterinary care . If the treatment plan provided was not adequate, appropriate, or timely, the inspector may contact his/her SACS for additional guidance if needed. Determining Adequate Veterinary Care If there are minor veterinary issues ( e.g., nails, teeth, minor injuries, and eyes) with little or no discernible impact on an anim al's overall health and that are --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licens ees 6-16 observed in only a small number of the facility's animals, and the issues can be rapidly addressed, a facility is maintaining adequate veterinary care because, overall, the facility has demonstrated it has an ongoing program that provides adequate care to animals and is, therefore, in compliance . If an inspector identifies one or more animals with serious veterinary issues that require medical attention, or more than a small number of animals experiencing minor veterinary conditions (as described above), the inspector should determine if the facility is in compliance for adequate veterinary care. Facility is in compliance if: 1. The veterinary care issue was identified by the facility prior to your inspection and the facility is authorized (for example, in the PVC or an SOP) to provide treatment for the condition without contacting the attending veterinarian, and the treatment plan is being followed, and the animal appears to be responsive to the treatment, or 2. The veterinary care issue was identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and the facility contacted the attending veterinarian (verified by the inspector through records, receipts and/or treatment logs or by contact the AV), and the treatment plan is being followed, and the animal appears to be responsive to the treatment, or 3. The veterinary care issue was identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and the facility is following the authorized treatment plan or has contacted the attending veterinarian, and the treatment plan is being followed but does not appear to be effective ( i.e., the animal's condition is clearly declining or worsening), and the licensee has re -contacted the attending veterinarian for additional instructions and is following those instructions (verified by the inspector through records, receipts and/or treatment logs, or by contacting the AV) , or 4. The veterinary care issue occurred after the last daily observation on that day, or 5. The veterinary care issue could not have been observed by the facility and the facility did not have a 2.40(b)(2) or (b)(3) citation within the last 3 years Facility is not in compliance if: 1. The veterinary care issue was not identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and veterinary care issue occurred p rior to the daily observation for that day, and the facility is authorized to provide treatment, but the attending veterinarian's treatment is not being followed, and you have contacted the attending veterinarian and the attending veterinarian is not comfortable with the facility's treatment or management of the issue, or 2. The veterinary care issue was not identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and veterina ry care issue occurred prior to the daily observation for that day, and the facility did contact the attending veterinarian, but the treatment is not being followed, and you have contacted the attending --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-17 veterinarian and the attending veterinarian is not co mfortable with the facility's treatment or management of the issue, or 3. The veterinary care issue was not identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and veterinary care issue occurred prior to the daily observation for that day, and the facility d id not contact the attending veterinarian, and the facility had a 2.40(b)(2) or (b)(3) citation within the last 3 years, or 4. The veterinary care issue was not identified by the facility prior to your inspection, and the veterinary care issue occurred prior to the daily observation for that day, and the facility did not contact the attending veterinarian, and the facility did not have a 2.40(b)(2) or (b)(3) citation within the last 3 years, and the veterinary care issue should have been observed by the facili ty Guidance for Communicating with the Attending Veterinarian If the inspector cannot determine from facility records, receipts, and/or treatment logs if the attending veterinarian was contacted, the next step is to contact the attending veterinarian. In most situations, a telephone call with the attending veterinarian is sufficient to confirm communication with the licensee, whether or not the attending veterinarian was consulted, and what if any instructions were given to the licensee . If the attending veterinarian confirms that he/she was contacted by the licensee about the animal, and the licensee is following the instructions, then the licensee is in full compliance with the provision to provide adequate veterinary care If the attending veterinarian has not been contacted, and/or instructions are not being followed, cite the NCI under the appropriate paragraph in 2.40 for failure to provide adequate veterinary care If the inspector needs to contact the attending veterinarian, the following guidance should be followed: The inspector should make two attempts to contact the attending veterinarian using the number provided by the licensee, leaving messages after each attempt. The first call should be made after the animals have been observed, and a secon d call should be attempted during the exit interview. If the attending veterinarian doesn't return the calls, the inspector should ask the licensee for assistance with communicating with the attending veterinarian If the contact with the attending veterinarian cannot be made while on site, explain to the licensee that if the attending veterinarian does not respond within the following two business days, then an NCI will be cited under 2.40 for failure to provide adequate veterinary care During the e xit interview, explain that although not required, it would be helpful in the future for the licensee to keep a record of visits or other --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-18 communications with the attending veterinarian that includes the date, time, animal ID, and treatment and/or observation/follow up instructions If by the morning of the second business day the inspector has not heard from the attending veterinarian, notify the licensee that morning that the attending veterinarian has not communicated with you. And advise the licensee tha t if you don't hear from the attending veterinarian by COB, you will be issuing a report with a citation. If an inspector believes it would be best to meet with the attending veterinarian in person, he/she should contact the attending veterinarian ahead of time, to make sure a time convenient for the attending veterinarian is arranged: o Note: if the licensee prefers, he/she should initially contact the attending veterinarian to help set up a call or meeting o If an ACI does not have an established relationsh ip with the attending veterinarian, it will often help to involve a VMO or SACS in the first meeting When communicating with the attending veterinarian, you must always: o Be respectful o Be professional o Be cognizant of his/her time o Inform him/her of Attending Veterinarian module on our website o Provide our AV -related tech notes and extension pamphlets (as available) o Thank them for their time When communicating with the attending veterinarian: o Introduce yourself and that you are conducting an inspection of the U SDA licensed/registered facility, and provide the name of the licensee o Explain that the purpose of the call is to simply confirm whether or not they have examined and/or communicated instructions for the veterinary medical condition of the specific animal of concern . Provide the species, breed, color, age, gender, ID number, and location of the animal. o Conclude the conversation by thanking them for their time, and offer your phone number in case they would like to contact you in the future for any reason o Do not challenge the attending veterinarian's diagnosis or instructions o If the attending veterinarian states that communication or treatment took place, we accept that fact o We do not pay consulting fees for attending veterinarians (should that come up in co nversation) --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-19 If you have not had the opportunity to meet with the attending veterinarian at a facility, consider reaching out to introduce yourself and see if they have any questions about attending veterinarian responsibilities under the AWA proactively, b efore the need arises . Building a relationship and open line of communication with attending veterinarians will help ensure animal welfare and facilitate discussions regarding specific animals and treatments in the future as needed. Recognition of Pain an d/or Distress It is often difficult to assess pain and/or distress in animals because of a lack of methods to validate and objectively measure the pain or distress . Additionally, not all animals demonstrate pain or stress in a similar manner. Basic biolo gy, natural history, and individual variation all have a significant impact on the demonstration of clinical signs associated with pain . Listed in Table 6 -1 are some possible signs of pain or distress. However, presence of these signs does not necessarily mean the animal is in pain or distress . Or a lack of these signs also does not mean that the animal is not in pain or distress . If you see conditions that are likely painful and animals are not showing clear signs, or if you are seeing signs that are suggestive of pain/distress and are unsure of why, you should contact your SACS or the appropriate Field Specialist for help with interpreting the situation. Table 6-1. Signs of Pain and/or Distress Species Species -Typical Signs of Pain Dogs Quiet, reluctant or unwilling to move, abnormal posture, lameness, lack of alertness, whimpering, groaning, howling, shivering, loss of appetite, increased respiration, growl or exhibit apprehension when approached, looking at, licking at, rubbing, or chewing a wound or potentially painful area, response elicited when touching or manipulati ng an area (withdrawal, whine, snap, etc.) Cats Ungroomed/unkempt appearance, greasy hair coat, quiet/withdrawn, apprehensive facial expression, loss of appetite, crying, hissing, hiding (often in litter box), crouching, or hunching, purring, tail flicking, response to handling (often aggressive but individuals may also purr in combination with other signs) Guinea Pigs Quiet, lethargy, decreased activity, decreased food and water consumption, anorexia, rough hair coat, reluctance to move, sunken eyes Hamsters and Gerbils Decreased activity, piloerection, ungroomed appearance --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-20 Species Species -Typical Signs of Pain Rabbits Inactivity, appear apprehensive or anxious, hunched appearance, hide, squeal or cry, possible aggressive behavior with excessive scratching and licking, facial expression (tightening of eye, cheek flattening, nostril tightening, pulling back whiskers, tightening ears) Nonhuman Primates May mask signs of pain, appearance of misery and/or dejection, huddling or crouching, stops eating/drinking, sad expression, moaning, screaming, stops grooming, clenching of teeth, self -directed injuries, licking / chewing at injury, impaired used of limb, guarding behavior, dilated pupils Marine Mammals Cetaceans: dolp hins, porpoises, and whales Tend to mask illness/pain, arching/hunching, squinting, one or both eyes closed, regurgitation, inappetence, changes in behavior, unusual posture in pool, floating at surface or sinking to the bottom, reduced activity, animal isolating itself from others in pool, dull or excessive sloughing of skin Marine Mammals Pinnipeds: Seals, Sea Lions, Walrus Typically stoic, laying with flippers tucked to sides, decreased activity, reduced alert behavior, rubbing / biting affected areas, blinking, squinting / one or both eyes closed, decreased time in pool, social isolation, decreased appetite, excessive vocalization (especially walrus) Bears Typically stoic, may show decreased foraging / appetite, decreased locomotion, slow / reluctant to move, development of stereotypic behaviors Big Cats Typically stoic, may show slow / weak / abnormal gait, obvious lameness, reluctance to rise / ambulate, hair pulling, chewing / biting, quite depressed attitude / lethargic, eyes frequently squinting or closed. Note: young cubs that are excessively handle d may be too weak, cold, or exhausted to show overt signs of distress or pain. Elephants Often subtle and hard to detect. Lameness, shifting weight, \"bucket stance\", localized heat / swelling, reluctance or slow response to per - form trained behaviors, movement away from touch (by trainers), head pressing, trunk pressing, restlessness / touching abdomen / kicking abdomen (similar to colic in a horse), excessive blinking (eye pain), changes in ear flapping frequency, decreased appetite (though chewing hay may also be a soothing behavior) Cattle Dull, depressed appearance, heads bowed, lack of alertness, loss of appetite, rapid/shallow breathing, rigid posture --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-21 Species Species -Typical Signs of Pain Pigs Changes in overall demeanor, social behavior, gait, and posture, unwilling to move, hiding, excessive squealing when handled Sheep and Goats Similar to cattle and vocalization, teeth grinding, increased lip curling, isolation from the flock Exotic Hoof stock Similar to other ruminants, although individuals may be more adapted to hiding overt si gns of pain, lameness, gait abnormalities, misshapen hooves (with long -term weight bearing abnormality) Birds Typically stoic, birds may appear withdrawn, inactive, or isolating such as under the feeder or at the edges of the enclosure, less responsive to external stimuli, changes in \"personality\"/behavior, decreased appetite and weight loss, hunched posture where the neck is retracted towards the body with a fluffed out appearance of the feathers, the tail droop, tail may bob when the animal is at rest indicating increase in respiratory effort, eyes half opened or closed, dull feathers and a loss of interest to preen, a wing or foot held in a lower or abnormal position, small species struggle less and emit fewer distress calls than large spec ies, increase in heart and respiratory rates. Signs of Distress Possible signs of distress in an animal include, but are not limited to: Change in the animal's behavior Abnormal behavior, such as stereotypies Abnormal respiration (shallow, rapid, panting , etc.) Reduced grooming Runny, glassy, or unfocused eyes Hunching or cowering in a corner of the cage Changes in body weight Absence of alertness or inattention to ongoing stimuli Vomiting Decrease in appetite and water intake Intense or frequent vocaliza tions Hair plucking and self -trauma Young animals dispersing from nests/dens (such as seen with heat stress) --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-22 It is important to remember that signs of distress such as the presence of stereotypic behaviors may outlast the cause for the development of those behaviors . If you observe abnormal behavior such as stereotypic behavior it is important to discuss the behavior with the facility to determine when the behavior began and what is being done (if anything) to address the behavior . If you are unsure if an animal is exhibiting signs of either pain or distress, or whether the facility's response is adequate you should discuss with your SACS. Medication and Medical Supplies The inspector must ensure that all medications and medical supplie s at licensed facilities are being used in a manner that is consistent with providing adequate veterinary care to prevent, control, diagnose and treat disease and injuries . [2.40(b)] Methods to assess the use of medications and medical supplies to provide adequate veterinary care include, but are not limited to: The licensee has directions for appropriate use of all medications and medical supplies prescribed by a licensed veterinarian . The licensee should be able to demonstrate knowledge of the: o Name an d concentration of the medication and appropriate use, dose, frequency, and route of administration o Instructions for use of the medication which may be located on a prescription label directly on the product or documented in writing from a veterinarian, as long as the information is readily accessible, understandable, and available for use at the facility All medications and medical supplies are: o Stored within manufacturers recommended humidity and temperature range o Protected from light (if required) o Labele d appropriately, including the drug name, concentration, and expiration date if transferred out of the original container o Stored in a manner that prevents contamination Expired medications or medical supplies are NOT being used for covered animals If expir ed medications or medical supplies are present at the facility, to avoid misuse the inspector may recommend that they be: o Clearly labeled \"expired\" o Separated from other medications and medical supplies --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-23 Medications of Special Welfare Concern The licensee mu st establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: Adequate guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia [2.40(b)(4)] Certain medications used for these procedures present special animal welfare concerns, particularly when used by non -veterinarians without the direct supervision of a veterinarian . Listed below are some methods to assess the proper use medications for the se purposes. Paralytics or Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs The use of paralytic or neuromuscular- blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight, and care (including the use of general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care [2.40(b)(2), 2.40(b)(4)]. 6.4.5.2.1 Anesthetics and Controlled Drugs The use of anesthetics, including certain controlled drugs, by non -veterinarians without the direct supervision of a veterinarian, may not be consistent with providing adequate veterinary care. If you identify anesthetics during an inspection, you should visit with the licensee and review available records of use and determine how the facility uses the drugs, including but not limited to: Specie s Purpose Administration practices, including dosing, route of administration, and names/doses of any drugs given with it Monitoring practices during and after administration Supportive care provided Procedures or handling occurring after administration Training and qualifications of individuals giving the drug(s) Anesthetics, including certain controlled drugs, should: Be used in accordance with any local, S tate, or federal laws Be used according to the written instructions for use by the veterinarian, including dose, frequency, and route of administration Only be used by personnel with appropriate training to ensure the anesthetics are used in a method that is consistent with providing appropriate veterinary care (see below) --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-24 Be stored within manufacturers recommended humidity and temperature range and protected from light (if required) Be stored in a manner that prevents contamination If the individual(s) administering the anesthetics is not a veterinarian or is not directly supervised by a veterinarian, th en you should assess the training and qualifications of the individual by inquiring about his/her ability to: Monitor vital signs such as respiration, heart rate, and hydration status Recognize the effects of the drug, including signs of overdose or underdose Recognize when medical intervention is necessary and what steps to take Surgeries and Specialized Surgical Procedures The licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include, but are not limited to: The availability of appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the Regulations and Standards The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries Adequate guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia Adequate pre -procedural and post -procedural care in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing procedure [2.40(b)(5)] If surgeries a nd/or specialized surgical procedures are being performed at a licensed facility, the inspector should ensure that: The attending veterinarian has been consulted by the licensee The licensee is following all of the attending veterinarian's guidance All animals are receiving adequate veterinary care All procedures are being conducting consistent with standard veterinary practice The inspector should evaluate the qualifications and assess the adequacy of training of non -veterinarians conducting surgeries . Sample questions that you could ask the personnel about the procedures they are performing include but are not limited to: What are the signs of pain and distress and related questions , such as: o Describe the drug regimen that will be used o Describe anticip ated effect of the drug o Describe the signs of pain relief --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-25 o Describe when further intervention may be necessary o What is the plan if the pain is not relieved o When will the veterinarian be called Describe the aseptic technique used, including use of gloves, ma sks, tools, and steps taken to appropriate clean the area and equipment between animals Describe the steps of the procedure to ensure they are following guidance from the attending veterinarian and verify appropriate veterinary care Which vital signs are b eing monitored and related questions such as: o Describe the operation of the monitoring equipment o Describe the interpretation of the results of the monitoring Describe the length and interval of monitoring and when it will be discontinued Describe ability t o recognize and respond to potential veterinary medical emergencies that could occur, including excessive bleeding, cessation of breathing, or other potential complications and related questions, such as: o When is medical intervention necessary o What medical intervention will be used o What equipment available for medical intervention and how is it operated o When will the veterinarian be called Euthanasia Guidance for Inspections The Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR) define \"euthanasia\" (9 C.F.R . \u00a7 1.1) as: The humane destruction of an animal accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, OR A method that utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousnes s and subsequent death This is the regulatory standard inspectors must apply when determining whether a method of euthanasia is compliant with the AWA . Facilities, in consultation with their attending veterinarian, may determine the humane method of euthanasia they wish to use provided it meets the regulatory standard. AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia The methods of euthanasia listed as \"Acceptable\" or \"Acceptable with Conditions\" (when conditions are met) in the American Veterinary Medical Association's (AVMA) Guidelines on Euthanasia meet the regulatory --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-26 definition of euthanasia, and facilities may consider the AVMA guidelines as a source that describes humane methods of euthanasia that are compliant. The AVMA Guidelines themselves cannot be enforced because they are not part of the R egulation s. This means an inspector cannot cite a facility for the failure to provide adequate veterinary care because the facility's method of euthanasia is not listed as an \"acceptable\" or \"conditionally acceptable\" (with conditions met) method of euthanasia in the AVMA Guidelines . Instead, the inspector must assess whether the facility's method of euthanasia meets the regulatory definition above, and, if not, explain in the citation how the method does not meet the defi nition . Methods of Euthanasia Listed as \"Acceptable with Conditions\" in the AVMA Guidelines If the method of euthanasia is \"acceptable with conditions,\" the inspector must confirm the facility is following the specified conditions by: Reviewing the program of veterinary care (PVC), and Asking the licensee/registrant questions and/or visiting with the attending veterinarian (AV) Methods of Euthanasia Not Listed as Acceptable or Acceptable with Conditions in AVMA Guidelines To assess whether a method meets the regulatory definition, the inspector must discuss the method with the licensee and the attending veterinarian and review: The method of euthanasia the attending veterinarian approved for use at the facility How the method of euthanasia is administered The factors the licensee and attending veterinarian considered when adopting the method What equipment is required to carry out the method The observation of the animal and its behavior/appearance before, during, and after applying the method How the animal's death is confirmed The timeframe between administering the method and the animal's death Any other questions the inspector thinks are relevant to assessing compliance with the regulatory standard Method of Euthanasia Not on the PVC or as Described by t he AV If the facility is using a method of euthanasia that is not the same method listed in the PVC or described by the attending veterinarian, and the facility is performing the euthanasia, the inspector should include a citation on the --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-27 Inspection R eport under 2.40(b)(4) for using a method of euthanasia not consistent with the attending veter inarian's guidance . Facility Conducting Euthanasia If a facility is conducting euthanasia , the inspector should determine whether: 1. The person the attending ve terinarian approved to perform the specific method of euthanasia is performing the euthanasia, and 2. The attending veterinarian provided the person(s) with adequate training and guidance for properly conducting the euthanasia, and 3. The facility maintains appropriate facilities, equipment and/or supplies 4. If any of these conditions are not met, the inspector should include a citation on the Inspection Report under 2.40(b)(4) for lack of adequate guidance and/or 2.40(b)(1) for lack of appropriate fa cilities, equipment, or supplies Other Important Notes Euthanasia conducted under emergency conditions may require extreme measures, and inspectors who encounter situations like this should discuss them with their SACS Assessing compliance involves applyin g the regulatory definition of euthanasia. Any noncompliance involving euthanasia should describe why the method does not meet the regulatory definition. A method of euthanasia not found in the AVMA Guidelines is not necessarily a noncompliance with the Regulations . Citations in Inspection Reports and justifications in inspection appeals must focus on the regulatory definition of euthanasia and must not rely upon (or reference) the AVMA Guidelines . If needed, the SACS and inspector can request guidance from the AWO on whether the method meets or does not meet the regulatory definition of euthanasia. If the AWO determines the method of euthanasia does not meet the regulatory definition, AWO will issue a written correspondence to the facility to convey the determination to the facility and the attending veterinarian, and will list available resources pertaining to the humane euthanasia of animals (including the AVMA Guidelines, the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines on: Euthanasia of Animals Used in Science (which can be found at http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Standards/Guidelines/Euthanasia.pdf), and guidelines in the European Food Safety Authority Journal, pp 25 -42 (which can be found at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.292/epdf ) Additional Requirements for Inspecting Dogs For all Routine I nspections , you, the inspector, should: --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Veterinary Care Requirements for Licensees 6-28 Examine dogs according to the following criteria: o Ask the licensee to pull from the enclosure any dog showing signs of a medical issue if you need have a closer look and take photos and/or a video to document any veterinary care noncompliance , and o Ask the licensee to pull any dogs that were previously identified as having a medical issue to recheck the dog if you need a closer look , and o Select 10 percent of the remaining dogs ( up to maximum of 10 dogs) for the licensee to pull and check for medical issues associated with their mouths, ears, eyes, skin, general condition, etc. Inspect the entire dog for medical issues; do not just focus on a single specific area Check for proper identification For all Prelicense I nspections , you, the inspector, should: Examine dogs according to the following criteria: o Ask the applicant to pull from the enclosure any dog showing signs of a medical issue if you need to have a closer look , and o Ask th e applicant to pull any dogs that were previously identified as having a medical issue to recheck the dog if you need a closer look , and o Select 10 percent of the remaining dogs (up to maximum of 10 dogs) for the applicant to pull and check for medical issu es associated with their mouths, ears, eyes, skin, general condition, etc . If you identify a veterinary care issue that wo uld normally be cited during a Routine Inspection, then it must be cited on the Inspection R eport for the Prelicense I nspection.

If the CEO delegates authority to appoint the IACUC, the delegation must be specific and in writing . (Note: This requirement is consistent with OLAW Policy) The IACUC must be composed of [2.31(b)(2) and (3)]: A Chairperson At least one Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) At least one nonaffiliated member Although not specifically prohibited by the AWA, APHIS strongly discourages one person from filling more than one of those positions . NOTICE The AWA specifically prohibits Animal Care from stopping research at any research facility (registered or unregistered but requiring registration). Therefore, you (the inspector) may NOT instruct a research facility to stop conducting research under any circumstances. [AWA 2143(a)(6)(A)] --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-4 In assessing IACUC membership, you sho uld evaluate whether: All the required positions are filled The DVM has training or experience in laboratory animal science and medicine, who has direct or delegated responsibility for activities involving animals at the research facility The nonaffiliated member represents the general public, i.e., has no conflict of interest either personally or financially, and is not a laboratory animal user at any research facility There are no more than three members from one administrative unit of the research facility, unless the facility only has one administrative unit IACUC members are qualified to assess the research facility's animal program, facilities, and procedures Alternate Members There may be alternate members appointed to the IACUC by the Institutional Official (IO) . Alternates may only serve as an alternate in t he membership category(s) for which they are qualified . For example, the alternate for a non -affiliated IACUC member would need to also meet the non- affiliated member requirements. If the regular member fulfills a specific membership requirement(s), his o r her alternate must also fulfill that requirement(s) . One alternate may be appointed to serve for multiple regular members provided the alternate fulfills the specific membership requirement of the members for whom he or she is substituting . However, an alternate may not represent more than one member at any one time. Note: This guidance is consistent with the OLAW Policy. IACUC Meetings In assessing IACUC meetings, you should evaluate whether: All members are informed of all meetings Meetings are held at a time when all members, especially the nonaffiliated member, can attend Required members (committee chair, nonaffiliated member, and attending veterinarian) are in attendance at most meetings .

Protocol Review Information Inspection Protocol Review Guidance Protocols and the IACUC approval and monitoring of protocols should be completely and thoroughly reviewed during an inspection. Sampling Guidance The inspector is responsible for conducting a thorough review of: The protocol approval process The IA CUC's monitoring of protocol activity IACUC -approved protocols and changes to protocols Detailed below is guidance to assist you in evaluating the IACUC protocol review. However, you must use the Regulations and your professional judgment to determine if an IACUC or protocol is in compliance. Prepare Write down the necessary ID information for any animals about which you have a concern, and Review the most recent Annual Report to identify species and numbers of animals used in columns E and D and all protocols with reported exceptions Determine whethe r you know of and have access to all protocols subject to AWA Regulations, including but not limited to: o Active protocols o Inactive protocols from the past 1 year, and o Protocols where no regulated species are currently present at the facility NOTICE For large facilities, if you think that following these requirements will result in the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time, seek guidance from your SACS before the inspection. NOTICE If a protocol has been reviewed by an AC VMO within the last year, then the protocol does not need to be re -reviewed unless the VMO noticed a concern with an animal being used for that protocol. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-13 Review Always review the following protocols: All protocols of concern identified during the inspection All column E protocols (if not reviewed during the last year) All protocols with IACUC -approved exemptions/exceptions (if not reviewed during the last year) Protocols cited as noncompliant during the last inspection Review Additionally If the facility has five or fewer remaining protocols, review all remaining protocols If the facility has greater than five remaining protocols, select five addit ional protocols, including at least one protocol from each of the following categories, if applicable: o Select o ne protocol for each regulated species present o For the following high -risk procedures, select one from each of the categories below, if applicable: - Potentially painful/distressful procedures (Column D) - Antibody production - Food/water restriction - Neuromuscul ar blockers - Surgical procedures - Teaching or trauma training protocols - Toxicity studies - Infectious disease studies - Vaccine potency/efficacy studies Research Facility Protocol Selection Worksheet You must complete the Protocol Selection Worksheet for every inspection, even NOTICE You have already reviewed the protocols of concern, so this step is meant to ensure a 'random' sample of other protocols. There may be protocols in each of these categories at a particular facility totaling more than 5. Use your professional judgment to select 5 from the other species and the high- risk procedures categories and do your best to mix those up in subsequent years. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-14 if no protocols are reviewed .

Procedures When reviewing protocols involving procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain/distress/discomfort (protocols in Categories D and E), some areas to pay special attention to include: The principal investigator has considered alternatives to the painful/ distressful procedure There is a detailed narrative describing the methods and sources used to determine that no alternatives to the painful/distressful procedure are available Measures used to alleviate the pain/distress are clearly stated, including: o Drugs, dosages, routes, and frequency of administration o Other methods may include: - Acupuncture - Hydrotherapy - Hot/cold p acks o A PRN (pro re nata) or \"as needed\" frequency of administration is not acceptable unless there are detailed instructions and criteria for determining administration of the drug Availability of experience d personnel, especially at night and on weekends and holidays, to assess and administer pain relief If pain/distress relief is not to be used, there is an adequate justification and endpoints are described that will be used to terminate the study and/ or used as the basis for when treatment or euthanasia will be performed The principal investigator has consulted and involved the attending veterinarian or his/her designee in the planning of the procedure and pain/ distress relief There is not the use of

appropriate --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-18 Antibody Production Protocols When reviewing protocols involving antibody production, some areas to pay special attention to include: The principa l investigator has considered alternatives for painful/ distressful procedures An alternative search, if done, was conducted and includes a narrative that describes the methods and resources considered when determining alternatives were not available The j ustification for the number of animals to be used was appropriate, such as the amount of antibody needed and the amount which can be produced by an animal There is a complete description of the procedure to induce antibody production and the collection of blood/serum and minimize pain and distress Food and/or Water Deprivation or Restriction When reviewing protocols involving food and/or water deprivation or restriction, some areas to pay special attention to include: The food/water deprivatio n or restriction is adequately justified If the animals are likely to experience distress, the principal investigator has considered alternatives to the distressful procedures Procedures used to restrict food/water are adequately described and easily under stood Procedures for selection of animals and training and monitoring the animals are described Baseline physiological data are being collected as needed Physiological parameters are being monitored during the study, such as: o Body weight o Hydration status o Behavioral changes NOTICE If the research facility has written, IACUC -approved standard operating procedure(s) (SOPs) for such things as, but not limited to, surgical procedures, pain/distress relief, antibody production, routine veterinary care, housing, euthanasia, etc., and these specific procedures are not described in a PI's submitted protocol, the PI's protocol must reference and follow the applicable SOP(s). --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-19 o Plasma osmolality Supportive care is provided to any animal showing signs of dehydration or stress If supportive care cannot be provided, there is an appropriate scientific justification for not doing so How the animals' daily food and wa ter intake was determined The protocol addresses how the animal is to receive its required daily food or water intake, such as: o During its working sessions o Supplementation to the amount consumed during working sessions o Whether small amounts of food or wate r provided as rewards are, or are not, considered part of the animal's daily food or water requirement If the animal is not to receive its daily food and water requirement, procedures and parameters for monitoring the animal are detailed in the protocol The endpoint has been determined and identified Neuromuscular Blockers When reviewing protocols involving the use of neuromuscular blockers (NMB), some areas to pay special attention to include: The use of the NMB is appropriate The use of the NMB is adequately described in the protocol The NMB is being used with general anesthesia All personnel working with the animal and NMB are properly trained in its use and possible adverse reactions The animal is being properly monitored, such as: o Heart rate and blood pressure o Not using the pain withdrawal response as it is not an appropriate measure of the level of anesthesia since this response would be prevented by the NMB Appropriate supportive care, such as ventilator support, is being provided during anesthesia Surgical and anesthesia records contain the appropriate information Recovery procedures are appropriate, i.e.: o The animals are reversed from the NMB when reversal agents are available before being allowed to recover from the anesthesia o Recovery is being monitored --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-20 Surgical Procedures When reviewing protocols involving surgical procedures, some areas to pay special attention to include: The pre -procedural care and surgical preparation of the animals are clearly

Contracted Research or Projects that Involve Multiple Registrants When registered research facilities (RF) contract research out to be conducted at another facility, it is the responsibility of the registrants to determine which party is responsible for th e functions of the IACUC, animal care and handling, and reporting of the animals on the Annual Report. No Delegation of Responsibilities If the research facilities have not delegated responsibilities or projects involving multiple registrants where there a re no clearly designated areas of responsibility for each research facility, then: Both registered parties are responsible, and Both IACUCs should perform all required functions, and Only one of the RFs should report the animals on the Annual Report The inspector should cite both RFs for any noncompliances identified Specific Responsibilities If the contract designates specific responsibilities to each partner, the facility is a site of both registrants . The inspector should inspect only the designated institution for the specific responsibility agreed upon in the contract. For example : RF A is designated to perform the semiannual program review and facility inspection, while both RF A and RF B are designated to review the protocol, then: o Both RF A and RF B are responsible for the protocol and both IACUC's must approve the protocol, but o Only RF A is responsible for the semiannual review o The inspector inspects: - The protocol review and approval at both RF A and RF B, and - The semiannual review only at RF A The contract specifies that both RF A and RF B are responsible for the IACUC functions, but only RF B is responsible for the animal care and handling, and reporting on the Annual Report, then: o The inspector inspects: - The IACUC functions at RF A, and - The IACUC functions, animal care and handling, and the AR reporting of the animals under the contract at RF B --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-28 All Responsibilities Designated If RF A contracts the entire project and all responsibilities to RF B, then: o The location of RF B is not a site of RF A o RF A does not have any responsibility for the IACUC functions, animal care and handling or Annual Reporting o The inspector inspects only RF B for the IACUC functions, animal care and handling, and Annual Reporting. Individual researchers or staff frequently partner with multiple institutions . The IACUC reviewing the protocol must assure that all personnel have appropriate training and qualifications .

Guidance for Veterinary Schools and Veterinary Technician Programs (VTP) for the Inspector Teaching versus Research The definition of activity in Part 1 of the AWA means, those elements o f research, testing, or teaching procedures that involve the care and use of animals. For the purposes of the AWR, teaching is equivalent to research . Using farm animals for teaching related to food or fiber, or breeding, management or production efficiency is not regulated. Using farm animals for teaching related to basic science or biomedical research is regulated . Inspection Procedures The inspector should only inspect the animals and animal facilities for animals owned by the facility. Do not inspec t animals or housing areas for animals owned by other entities such as vet clinics, hospitals, or shelters. For Veterinary School Spay/Neuter Programs, IACUC oversight is not required if the Veterinary School has a written agreement with a pound/shelter, which is acting as the owner of the animals, soliciting the service of the Veterinary School to perform spaying/neutering . If the facility asks you to inspect or look at non -regulated animals or facilities, you may go through these areas with the facility representative but do not document any findings on an Inspection Report. Consult your SACS if further guidance is necessary. Records Requirements For regulated animals used in regulated teaching activities, the records requirements are the same as for any other research facility. The following records must be available for review during the inspection, if applicable: Acquisition/disposition records must be kept for any dogs or cats acquired by the facility that do not fall under a veterinary client patient relationship. The use of APHIS Forms 7005 and 7006 are not required but may be used by the facility to keep and maintain the required information . [2.35(b)] Acquisition/disposition records are not required for: Dogs/cats who are patients of the Veterinary or Veterinary Technician school All regulated animals other than dogs and cats All regulated species of animals used for regulated purposes must be included on the Annual Report. [2.36(b)(5 -8)] --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-37 The following animals should not be included on the Annual Report: Client, staff, or student -owned animals Animals utilized for teaching purposes at working farms, ranches, veterinary hospitals or shelters Records must be held for at least three years (beyond the final disposition of the animal) [2.35(f )]. Identification Requirements For regulated animals used in regulated teaching activities, the animal identification requirements are the same as for any other research facility. Research facilities are only required to individually identify dogs and cat s. [2.38(g)]. There are no individual identification requirements for other regulated species. Protocols For protocols involving regulated animals used in regulated teaching activities, protocol and IACUC oversight requirements are the same as for any oth er research facility. For animals that are not regulated by the AWA (i.e ., pets or patients) no protocols or IACUC oversight is required. Special Considerations Contact your SACS if any of these circumstances come to your attention via inspection or anothe r method: Complaints are received regarding the welfare of the animals Inspector becomes aware of animal injury or death as the result of non - regulated teaching procedures The owner of an animal expresses concern about its care or use --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Research Facility Inspection 7-38 7.7.

Animals are deemed to be in a state of unrelieved suffering when they are forced to endure conditions, arising out of the licensee's failure to comply with regulations promulgated under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which causes severe pain or distress, se vere discomfort, or which could directly and negatively impact the health and well -being of the animal if immediate actions are not taken by the licensee to remedy the situation. Examples of conditions that may cause suffering include but are not limited to: animals with serious medical problems that are not receiving adequate veterinary care; animals without adequate food or water; animals exposed to temperature extremes without adequate shelter or bedding; and animals held in unsanitary enclosures. Anim als do not need to be in jeopardy of dying to be in a state of unrelieved suffering. Veterinary Medical Officers (VMO) are legally qualified to determine whether an animal is suffering. There are some conditions that if allowed to worsen, may contribute t o a situation that results in a confiscation. The following information pertains to situations where confiscation should be considered. Veterinary Care Issues Veterinary care issues are a source of chronic or acute suffering for the animals inspected. These include: General conditions o Animals are severely malnourished and/or emaciated with no veterinary assessment o Animals are severely lethargic with no veterinary assessment o Animals are observed to have chronic, untreated intestinal issues NOTICE Citations listed are examples only . The specific citation will be dependent on the situation and should be discussed with your supervisor . --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Guida nce 8-4 o Animals are found to be dead, dying, or in overall poor health Infectious disease processes in which the animal is suffering or distressed and without veterinary assessment or treatment Trauma/injuries/untreated problems in which the animal is suffering, such as, but not limited to: o Fractures or open wounds o Severe chronic skin or eye issues o Severe chronic dental issues o Skin ulcerations or sunburn o Animals are found with severely matted hair causing significant skin problems o Foot or hoof foreign bodies o Halters, collars and other restraint devices that are too tight or poorly fitted and are causing injury to the animals, especially those permanently left on the animals Certain husbandry requirements may become veterinary care issues that lead to unrelieved suffering: o Heavy unshorn coats Sheep/certain goats/ llamas/alpacas, if not sheared for an extended period of time, c an be in a chronic state of suffering. This is especially true in warm weather. This may also apply to long -haired breeds of dogs, cats, and other species. Coats which remain unshorn for long periods of time may become infested with maggots or cause chro nic skin irritation. 8-1. Sheep suffering from unshorn coat in hot weather - this sheep had not been shorn in five years 2.40(b)(2), 2.131(b)(1). o Hoof/Nail Care Untrimmed nails or hooves that are causing lameness and/or locomotion difficulties may also contribute to joint pain and arthritis later in life.

Guinea pigs in unsanitary conditions 3.31(a) an animal enclosure 3.11(a) (dogs); 3.131(a) Ventilation/Air Quality Confiscation is appropriate when non -compliances involving animals with unrelieved suffering or distress due to ventilation/air quality are identified. High ammonia levels can lead to acute discomfort of the respiratory tract and mucous membranes. Exposure to elevated ammonia levels in the air may also result in adverse long term animal health outcomes, including immunosuppression, chronic respiratory disease, and decre ased growth rates and reproductive abnormalities in a number of regulated species. A determination of whether ammonia levels are too high is based on the presence of noxious fumes (e.g., your eyes burn) at the level of the animal's eyes and nose. Since ventilation non -compliances cannot typically be photographed, document the animal's clinical signs of suffering such as squinting, conjunctivitis, watery eyes, coughing, sneezing, etc. Also document any similar clinical signs experienced by the ACI/VMO. If t wo Animal Care veterinarians state that one or more clinical signs were observed, along with the description of the smell and human discomfort, confiscation may be considered. Separation/Behavior Incompatible animals should not be housed together. Confiscation should be considered if animals are: --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Guidance 8-11 Housed in incompatible groups exhibited through clear signs of distress and/or physical injury Constantly under threat or stress from other animals, whether in the same or adjoining enclosures, such that there ar e clear signs of suffering. Severe stress levels can result in death of animals. Example: A wallaby penned between two tigers at one facility collapsed and died from the stress. Before it died, it spent all of its time tucked tightly in the one corner as far as it could get from the tigers. The cage bars were hardly adequate separation in this case. Feed/Water Below are feed/water issues that may support confiscation. No food or water is available, and the animals are noticeably underweight, dehydrated, showing clear signs of distress, or are exhibiting gastrointestinal disorders (chronic diarrhea) Food/water is contaminated such that animal health is severely impacted Water and food receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitized, and animal health is severely impacted by this Insufficient and/or poor -quality food is fed such that animals are displaying nutritional deficiencies or chronic intestinal problems Inappropriate diet for the species such that animals are exhibiting associated clinical signs su ch that animal health is severely impacted Improperly stored feed that is unsafe for the animals or is contaminated, decomposing or deteriorated to the point of being nutritionally inadequate or inedible Feeding practices which may cause serious, life -thre atening harm to the animals: Chronic insufficiency of feed; or Providing food that is inappropriate for the species, such as feeding dog food to any species of cat Watering practices which may cause serious, life -threatening harm to the animals: Inadequate water Poor quality water may create chronic health problems such as internal parasite loads, giardiasis, bacterial or fungal infections Standing water may harbor disease -carrying insects such as mosquitoes--- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Guidance 8-12 Photos The photos below are not stand- alone reasons to confiscate but may help to document a pattern of suffering. 8-32.

Docum entation Document all non- compliant items with photos and/or videos Accurate and thorough documentation is critical to the confiscation process. Detailed write -ups, photographs, and videos all help to convey the severity of the situation and demonstrate the unrelieved suffering of the animals. Proper documentation is also necessary to clearly identify which specific animals are being considered for confiscation. The write -ups should be clear, concise, and accurately identify the animals. Provi de as much detail as possible including the species, physical description, age, sex, and identifying marks so that the animals can be clearly identified. Also include a detailed description of any environmental conditions that are of concern. Be sure to include any pertinent information from verbal exchanges with the licensee, and/or carriers and intermediate handlers. Photographs and videos should be clear and demonstrate the condition(s) prompting consideration of confiscation. When possible, include both the animal and the condition in a single photograph/video so that the viewer has no doubt of what is being conveyed. Photographs/videos should: Be taken before and during the confiscation Accurately and clearly depict the noncompliant items as well as the specific animals of concern, including ID (use photos in this document as examples) Be accurately labeled with a description that is complete and detailed in order to prompt your memory should you be asked to testify about the inspection/confiscation years after the fact Use videos to depict things that cannot be ascertained from photographs, such as the extreme thirst of an animal - example: video of animal drinking for 2 minutes straight. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Taking meaningful photographs .

Guidelines and Responsibilities for the Confiscation of Animals AC Inspector Responsibilities During an inspection, promptly recognize animal suffering and initiate confiscation procedures in accordance with the regulations and resource material Immediately involve and coordinate all on -site efforts wi th your supervisory animal care specialist (SACS) Clearly communicate to the dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, verbally and in writing, all conditions that are causing animal suffering and the actions necessary for providing relief of th at suffering. This includes writing a detailed inspection report which includes the following: 1. Number and species of animal(s) found to be suffering and the individual identification numbers (for dogs or cats); also include the name of the animal (if verifiable), and/or a brief description of each animal, and/or the location of each animal (i.e., provide as much descriptive information as you can) 2. Identification of non- compliances or conditions causing the suffering 3. Steps that must be taken to correct the problem and alleviate the suffering , e.g., examination and treatment by a qualified veterinarian 4. The time period in which the condition must be corrected so the animal is given relief and adequate care. This time period must be as soon as possible after determining the animal is suffering, but typically no more than 24 hours Take good photographs and videos of the involved animals and conditions o Take videos of lameness or neurologic problems, if possible o Take videos of thirsty animals drink ing when offered water. It may be of benefit to take a longer video to demonstrate how long the animal drinks when offered water. o Take videos of animals demonstrating incompatibility Keep the SACS informed of the situation and current on all pertinent facts and issues. This includes providing inspection reports, photographs, videos, and other relevant documents. When discussing the situation with licensees, and/or carriers and intermediate handlers, be clear about what can and cannot be agreed upon prior to the actual confiscation or voluntary relinquishing of the animals. If you are unsure about this, contact your SACS. Any agreements should be put in writing and signed by the responsible facility representative. If the suffering animal subject to confiscation is an endangered species or a marine mammal, notify Animal Welfare Operations (AWO) Management, --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Guidance 8-31 who will then ensure coordination with appropriate government agencies.

Animal Care inspectors and management are working together to ensure the animals located at (licensee facility) in (City, State) that are most at risk of (description of issue) be removed as soon as possible to prevent the animals from further suffering. The animals most at risk have been determined to be (description of the animals to be transported). 1.2 Objective The objective is to safely remove XX (name species) that have been identified as \"at risk\" animals and transport the animals to (name the facility and the means of transportation) 1.3 Scope of Work (SAMPLE DESCRIPTION) The contractor will travel from their facility in City, State to the licensee's facility in City, State, approximately XXX miles each way. The contractor will be responsible for: Providing the appropriate transport vehicles and transport cages necessary to move XXX animals. Add brief description of the animals to be transported. Assisting with loading the animals into transport cages which may include immobilizing (tranquilizing) some of the ( name species ) to ensure safety of both the personnel and the (species) Furnishing a veterinarian with experience working with, and immobilizing (name species) Providing all drugs, supplies and equipment necessary to immobilize and safely move ( name species ) 1.4 Period of Performance SAMPLE DESCRIPTION The period of performance of this contract is approximately a (estimate how long the operation should take from when the contractor leaves until they retu rn to their facility) xxx hour period and is dependent on the dates that best work for the security of the personnel, and for removing the (species) in a timely manner once the intent to confiscate is issued. The working date of this operation is INSERT D ATE HERE but may be subject to change. It is understood the contractor will need to travel to City, State the night before the operation. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM Confiscation Guidance 8-46 1.5 Place of Performance Facility located in City, State 2.0 Specific Requirements/Tasks 2.1 Task One Load (name species) into Transport Enclosures Safely load (species), listed below, into (species specific) transport enclosures furnished by the contractor. This process involves the use of a series of veterinary supplies (get list of necessary supplies from contractor) (EXAMPLE) including drugs for immobilization, emergency drugs, fluids and drip sets, and blood testing supplies to screen for nutritional disease and other diseases. (EXAMPLE) A forklift or other lifting device may be necessary and should be on hand to move the larger cages into position to load the (species), and to load (species) that are in the transport cages into the transport vehicles. It may be necessary to define how the animals are housed and the general plan to load the animals into transport enclosures The groupings of the XX identified (species) are listed as how the animals are presently housed. The adult (species), four 10 -month old (species), and two 8 - month -old (species) may be able to be lured into transport containers without the need for immobilization. However, the contractor should be prepared to immobilize these (species) to safely load them in to transport enclosures. The cubs and younger juveniles may likely be captured safely without the need to immobilize them.

If you are unsure if an issue is an NCI and a Direct or a Critical, contact your SACS. If an issue is identified as a non -critical NCI, the inspector should determine if it should be cited on the Inspection Report. Any issue that does not rise to the level of an NCI is in compliance. --- Animal Care Inspection Guide --- Savedate 7/19/2023 8:55 AM NCI/Direct/Critical Noncompliance Examples C-3 Examples for Dogs and Cats Section 2.40 - Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Vete rinary Care and Section 3.13 Veterinary Care for Dogs The Veterinary Care Flow Chart should be followed for all applicable decisions regarding veterinary care citations.
