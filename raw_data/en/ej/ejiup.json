If you are interested in becoming a member, you may simply call the office and request registration material. Once you become a member, you will be given a binder that contains all pertinent information about the practice along with all of our current classes and events being offered at that time. Conventional medical services will be billed to your health insurance. In addition, a quarterly membership fee of $400 will provide you with a selection of alternative services. Once the membership fee has been exhausted, patients can pay for services out of pocket. The quarterly membership provides an allotment of 1600 points per year which is equal to $1 of services each. These points are used to obtain the services recommended in your treatment plan. The points also are used to offset your office copay. Insurance deductible and coinsurance are not covered by the points. The quarters coincide with the calendar year. First quarter is January1-April 1, second quarter is April 1-July 1, third quarter is July 1-October 1, and fourth quarter October 1-January 1. If a patient joins in the middle of a quarter cycle their first payment will be prorated for the remainder of that quarter. Unused points will expire at the end of each year (December 31).
