Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [(FD&C Act](/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act)), when the Secretary of HHS declares that an emergency use authorization is appropriate, FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when certain criteria are met, including there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The HHS declaration to support such use must be based on one of four types of determinations of threats or potential threats by the Secretary of HHS, Homeland Security, or Defense. Please note: a determination under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act that a public health emergency exists, such as the [one issued on January 31, 2020](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-nCoV.aspx), does not enable FDA to issue EUAs. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19. Subsequent HHS declarations supporting use of EUAs and based on this determination are described in the blue boxes below. Information on terminated and revoked EUAs can be found in [archived information](/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization-archived-information). Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) [Information on the PREP Act can be found here](https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/Pages/default.aspx). The PREP Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to add section 319F-3 (42 U.S.C. 247d-6d). The HHS Secretary has issued several Declarations pursuant to section 319F-3 of the PHS Act to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID-19. PREP Act - COVID-19 Related Information On May 9, 2023, HHS Secretary Becerra signed the [11th amendment](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/12/2023-10216/eleventh-amendment-to-declaration-under-the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act-for) to the declaration under the PREP Act for COVID-19 Medical Countermeasures. The Secretary issued this amendment to clarify that COVID-19 continues to pose a credible risk of a future public health emergency, add two new limitations on distribution, extend the time period of coverage for certain Covered Countermeasures and Covered Persons, clarify the time period of coverage for Covered Persons authorized under the Declaration, and extend the duration of the Declaration to December 31, 2024.

This guidance was updated on March 16, 2020, May 4, 2020, and May 11, 2020. On September 27, 2022, FDA [updated this policy](/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-coronavirus-disease-2019-tests-revised) to ensure continued access to tests while encouraging the transition of these important public health tools to traditional premarket review pathways. The updated policy describes the FDA's intent to review only a small subset of new EUA requests for diagnostic tests and encourages developers of all test types interested in marketing authorization to pursue authorization through the de novo classification or 510(k) clearance pre-market review pathways. CDC has granted a right of reference to the performance data contained in CDC's EUA (FDA submission number EUA200001) to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device.

On October 20, 2022, FDA also published [lists of certain laboratories](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/monkeypox-and-medical-devices#Laboratories) that have notified FDA of their laboratory developed monkeypox diagnostic test ( [LDT](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/monkeypox-and-medical-devices#LaboratoryDeveloped)), modification to an FDA-cleared or EUA-authorized monkeypox diagnostic test, or laboratory developed monkeypox serology test, as described in Sections IV.A.2, IV.A.3, and IV.C, respectively, of the [Policy for Monkeypox Tests to Address the Public Health Emergency](/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-monkeypox-tests-address-public-health-emergency). While FDA has not reviewed the laboratory's validation of the listed tests and has not issued EUAs for these tests, we are providing this information to promote transparency.

Therefore, the doxycycline emergency dispensing order and EUI should be used by stakeholders for anthrax preparedness and response instead of the mass dispensing EUA. The July 21, 2011, doxycycline mass dispensing EUA, and the October 14, 2011, National Postal Model anthrax EUA will be terminated by FDA, and notice of such termination will be published in the Federal Register.

Ebola Diagnostic Tests with De Novo, 510(k) or PMA [OraQuickEbola Rapid Antigen Test](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/denovo.cfm?ID=DEN190025)- On October 10, 2019, FDA [allowed marketing](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/DEN190025.pdf)(PDF, 255 KB) of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect Ebola virus antigens (proteins) in human blood from certain living individuals and samples from certain recently deceased individuals suspected to have died from Ebola (cadaveric oral fluid). The OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test is the first rapid diagnostic test the FDA has allowed to be marketed in the U.S. for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The test provides a rapid, presumptive diagnosis that must be confirmed. Also see the FDA news release: [FDA allows marketing of first rapid diagnostic test for detecting Ebola virus antigens](/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-rapid-diagnostic-test-detecting-ebola-virus-antigens) The OraQuick Ebola Test was reviewed under the [De Novo premarket review pathway](/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/de-novo-classification-request), a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this marketing authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that determine the requirements for demonstrating accuracy, reliability and effectiveness of tests intended to identify Ebola virus antigens. These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type. This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA's 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. |Medical Product||Date of EUA Issuance||Letter of for EUA||Fact Sheets and Manufacturer Instructions/Package Insert||EUA Determination and Declaration (Effective Date)||PREP Act Declaration (if applicable)| | | EZ1 Real-time RT-PCR Assay | | August 5, 2014 (initial issuance) October 10, 2014 (reissuance) | || || | | | CDC Ebola Virus NP Real-time RT-PCR Assay | | October 10, 2014 (initial issuance) March 2, 2015 (reissuance) October 8, 2019 (amended) | || || | | | CDC Ebola Virus VP40 Real-time RT-PCR Assay | | October 10, 2014 (initial issuance) March 2, 2015 (reissuance) October 8, 2019 (amended) | || || | | | FilmArray Biothreat-E test | | October 25, 2014 November 12, 2019 (amended) | || || | | | RealStar Ebolavirus RT-PCR Kit 1.0 | | November 10, 2014 (initial issuance) November 26, 2014 (reissuance) | || || | | | LightMix Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR Test | | December 23, 2014 | || || | | | Xpert Ebola Assay | | March 23, 2015 June 13, 2023 (amended) | || || | | | DPP Ebola Antigen System (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.) | | November 9, 2018 April 2, 2019 (amended) | || || | Also see FDA News Release: [FDA takes action to support American military personnel by granting an authorization for freeze-dried plasma product to enable broader access while the agency works toward approval of the product](/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-action-support-american-military-personnel-granting-authorization-freeze-dried-plasma) (July 10, 2018) |Medical Product||Date of EUA Issuance||Letter of Register Notice for EUA||Fact Sheets and Manufacturer Instructions/Package Insert||EUA Determination and Declaration (Effective Date)||PREP Act Declaration (if applicable)| | | Pathogen-Reduced Leukocyte-Depleted Freeze Dried Plasma (Centre de Transfusion Sanguine des Arm\u00e9es) | | July 9, 2018 (initial issuance) May 8, 2020 (amendment) August 29, 2023 | || || | Determination by DoD (June 7, 2018) For more information about the diagnostics below, also see Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices: [2013 H7N9 Influenza EUA Issuance||Letter of EUA||Fact Sheet and Manufacturer Instructions/Package Insert||EUA Determination and Declaration (Effective Date)||PREP Act Declaration (if applicable)| | | CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel-Influenza A/H7 (Eurasian Lineage) Assay | | April 22, 2013 (initial issuance) March 27, 2018 (reissuance) | | | || || | | | Quidel Lyra Influenza A Subtype | | February 2014 | || || || | | | A/H7N9 Influenza Rapid Test | | April 25, 2014 | || | For more information about the diagnostics below, also see Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices: [2013 Coronavirus Issuance||Letter of EUA||Fact Sheets and Manufacturer Instructions/Package Insert||EUA Determination and Declaration (Effective Date)||PREP Act Declaration (if applicable)| | | CDC Novel Coronavirus 2012 Real-time RT-PCR Assay | | June 5, 2013 (initial issuance) June 10, 2014 (reissuance) | || || || | | | RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit U.S. | | July 17, 2015 February 12, 2016 (reissuance) | || || | On July 9, 2018, FDA [approved](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2018/212319Orig1s000ltr.pdf) (PDF, 49 KB) the 2 mg Atropine Auto-Injector manufactured by Rafa Laboratories, Ltd., for the treatment of poisoning by susceptible organophosphorous nerve agents having cholinesterase activity as well as organophosphorous or carbamate insecticides in adults and pediatric patients weighing over 90 lbs [41 kg] (generally over 10 years of age).
