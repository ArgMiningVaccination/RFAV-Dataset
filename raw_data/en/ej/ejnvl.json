You must like small print. Perhaps you should consider law school. Unlike most universities, we \"build our own stuff. \" Our award-winning publications are designed, written and produced in-house. We believe our publications should reflect Marquette \u2014 its people, programs and spirit. We want you to learn about \"us, \" especially who we are as an institution, from our students, faculty and staff \u2014 not from publications consultants and marketing firms. The publication you are holding represents countless hours of writing, proofreading, photo shoots and reflection. We think the time we spend creating our publications not only conveys who we are (especially our wacky sense of self), but also helps you better understand the story of Marquette University. It's one way we strive to Be The Difference.

It's a challenge to students, faculty, staff and alumni to change their community. To ask questions. To reflect upon what we've done and to do it better. To challenge the status quo. We believe education should be transformational. You will be engaged in the classroom and in the community, challenged in your work, treated with dignity and respect. We believe our community is a reflection of who we are and that we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. It's no wonder that nearly all Marquette graduates participate in meaningful community service before graduation. We believe we can change the world. We've been known throughout our history as an activist campus \u2014 not because we hold signs and march through the streets \u2014 because we see the problems in the world and actively do something about them. we are Marquette. w e are the difference.

The University Core of Common Studies ensures that regardless of your major, you'll develop a wide body of knowledge \u2014 and that's going to be really helpful after you graduate.

I decided to study some more for my big communication test and looked outside my window. Something strange \u2014 to me \u2014 was happening. It was snowing! Being from Southern California, snow was a rare occurrence. As in, it never occurred and I had never seen it fall. When I came to the Midwest, I knew it would. But seeing it for the first time is something I will never forget. While everyone continued to sleep in McCormick Hall, I went outside and took pictures and immediately sent them to my mother. I will forever remember how beautiful it was, and my Marquette experience would not be complete without seeing it. Jennifer solorio Fountain Valley, Calif. Broadcast and electronic communication major, Class of 2012marquette.edu/explore16 YoU'RE A FREShMAN freshman first year freshMan MeMories As the youngest of three children, I was beyond ready for college after hearing the escapades of my brother and sister. However, they didn't quite prepare me for the transition into what seemed like another world. My first week of classes began with a stellar four class line-up that came to an end at 5 p.m. I was not used to going to class that late and I strongly considered dropping a class. I called my mom and she told me that I was going through a normal transitional phase and suggested that I talk to my professors during office hours. While this helped for a short time, I still felt a bit lost in this new culture. The next evening, a friend of mine asked if I wanted to join her at the 10 p.m. Mass at St. Joan of Arc Chapel. She said it might calm me down and help me out through the week. Upon arrival at 9:35, I realized exactly why she had asked me to come with her: There were more than 100 people gathered in this tiny chapel. The Mass was incredible because I truly felt like I was a part of the Marquette community. Being among those students was a blessing and couldn't have come at a better time during my week. I felt com-forted and it allowed me to calm down and take on the first week of freshman year. As a Marquette junior, I have missed about five Tuesday night Masses since that day in 2009. It is something that I hold close to my heart, and my Marquette experience would definitely not be the same without it. Jim love Chicago Corporate communication major, Class of 2013 You're the new kid in town, unsure of where to go, what to do, how to act. We've got you covered: first year reading program Our incoming freshmen read a common text and discuss it with fellow students and faculty during Orientation. Inspired by a desire to bring faculty, administrators, and students together outside of the classroom, the reading and discussion aim to help you begin the life-long process of finding meaning. marquette.edu/osd/reading introduction to inquiry What makes a class more exciting than an intense discussion? It's what college is about \u2014 arguing your point of view, questioning others' assumptions, reconsider - ing your own position and discovering what you really think. This is what happens in Introduction to Inquiry, the first-year seminar for students in the Klingler College of Arts and Sciences. It offers you a way to learn the ropes of the most important place on campus, the classroom. marquette.edu/as Your orientation Plan to attend this exciting week, which begins the day you move into your residence hall.

At marquette, students get help charting a course from our excellent staff at the career services center. Much of your life has been laid out in front of you so far. You started elementary school and were off to middle school, high school and eventually college. But what about life after college? We'll provide guidance before you enter the working world. Our advisers can help you identify a position that fits your talents and degree. Remember, there are several steps to take to get where you want to be.so WHAT Are you GoinG To Do AFTer colleGe? To make a good career decision, first become aware of your interests, skills areas and work values. The Career Services Center staff will help you through surveys and personal counseling sessions. This self-assessment is a crucial part of the career planning process, and it can begin as early as your freshman year. Once you've identified your interests, skills, values and personality traits, you'll want to take the next step. That means doing research to learn more about different careers that might appeal to you. Let the Career Services Center staff be your guides. Take advantage of the many resources available at the cen- ter, including publications that profile job vacancies and industry information, and a variety of directories that help job seekers uncover potential employers or appropriate graduate schools. And when you're ready, the Career Services Center staff will offer key insights on r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter writing and give you opportunities to participate in mock interviews and two career fairs on campus. (Employers often come to campus to interview our students). Of course, the Career Services Center will also help you obtain internships and shadow opportunities with professionals, both of which are ample here thanks to Marquette's strong reputation and location in downtown Milwaukee. At Marquette, we believe you ought to pursue a major and career path that you're passionate about. If you excel in that pursuit in college, you're more likely to find a fulfilling career \u2014 a calling \u2014 and will have more success as a professional. And that's worth more than any degree.You can geT There from here...marquette.edu/explore 22 campusDaily visits: The best way to see campus. Perfect for incoming students, prospective undergraduates and transfer students. A daily visit will provide you with everything you need to know about Marquette. We'll start with a presentation by an admissions counselor and follow up with campus and residence hall tours. We welcome thousands of visitors from across the country each year. During our most popular visit days we'll offer group visit appointments (Group is a bit of a misnomer; we'll still have a relatively small number of people on campus and intimate tours with one of our expert tour guides). You'll still be able to get your individual questions answered during a group visit, and you may appreciate hearing what other folks are asking about, too. Daily visits are available, well, daily. OK, we're never open for daily visits on Sunday. We recommend at least two weeks' advanced notice for weekday visits. Saturday visits fill quickly and generally book 4 to 6 weeks in advance. Parents and family are welcome. shadow visits: It's a great way to become a Marquette student \u2014 without all the homework. The shadow program pairs you with a current Marquette student, allowing you to actually experience the university's classes, food, residence halls and social life. Shadow visits are available to high school seniors on a limited basis, and three weeks' advanced notice is required. Check out the available dates at marquette.edu/explore. Mom and Dad are welcome for the admissions portion of your visit but there are no accommodations provided to parents. class visits: If you don't have the time for a formal shadow visit, we invite you to be our guest at a Marquette class. This is your chance to spend an hour or two seeing what the classroom experience is like. Discuss Dostoyevsky, experience engineering, amaze the professor by answering the tough questions ... all this and more. Our class offerings vary each semester and include typical freshman classes. A guide to our offerings is posted each semester at marquette.edu/explore. Class visits are not available during summer sessions and generally are not available if class is not in session (we think this is fairly obvious but we'll put it in writing just to be safe). No advanced notice is required but plan to be in attendance for the entire class period. We also recommend having a backup class just in case your first choice is taking an exam. You'll have to leave your folks and other family behind during a class visit.Come see for yourself what makes Marquette special. We offer many ways for you to experience campus. Rev. John P .

I was leaving everything I knew and wasn't sure if I could make it. Would I feel comfortable with the people? Would the weather send me packing? Would this city be too fast paced for my island lifestyle? I heard about the people in the Midwest and was always told they were the friendliest, but I had some reservations. Within the first week of school I had already acquired the nickname \"hawaii\" and brought the shaka to the Midwest. I was comfortable being myself, and everyone was truly very accepting. After saying I was from hawaii, I constantly got: \"Cool. Do you surf?\" I established a close group of friends who all shared the same love of exploring the city. We enjoyed trying new restaurants, found trendy shops and made sure we took advantage of the city. Amid my explorations, I forgot about the weather because it was comparable to hawaii. But when it hit November and December, comparable went out of the window! But the winter was manageable. I found out that if you wear the proper clothing, you'll be fine. And to much of my family's amazement, I returned to Marquette, ready to enjoy the next winter. Coming from a small rock in the Pacific, I worried that I wouldn't be able to adjust to life in the city. Boy, was I wrong! Marquette is its own entity, its own island of sorts, with the city of Milwaukee as its playground. kellee T om Kailua, Hawaii Real estate major, Class of 2011 That just about sums it up. Loosely translated, it means hospitality or the good life, and that captures the spirit of Milwaukee. And it's only fitting that it's a German word \u2014 the Germans were by far the biggest influence on Milwaukee's culture. Of course, as a historically industrial city, each new wave of immigrant workers found ways to integrate their culture into the growing city. Today, Milwaukeeans celebrate this melting pot heritage with a variety of ethnic festivals and food, historic neighborhood churches and amazing architecture. Milwaukee is often called a big small town. Vibrant and cosmopolitan yet accessible and friendly, it offers everything to amp up your social life, including cultural activities, dining, sports, music, performance and visual arts. With a thriving arts and music scene, plenty of fun people and festivals all summer long, there is so much to do and see in the city. There is just something amazing about a city with a legendary work ethic, progressive spirit and an abundance of college students \u2014 Milwaukeeans work hard and play hard.

It's time to begin thinking about the next step. Or, rather, steps. The process of becoming a Marquette student is fairly painless, especially if you follow these handy tips. 1. Apply for admission First, circle this date on your calendar: December 1. It's Marquette's application deadline. Anything received after this date is considered late. Ideally, you'll want to start thinking about your application early. At Marquette, we use a \"pooled admission process, \" which means we wait until we receive all of our applications before we make admission decisions. Effectively, you \"compete\" against all applicants for a space in our freshman class. Still, we recommend submitting your online application in late August or early September. You'll want to finish your application before classes begin in the fall. Let's face it \u2014 you don't want to be writing college essays and English papers at the same time. Regardless of when you apply, you will not receive an admission decision until mid-January. There are five main components of the Marquette application: The online application (you must apply online) Your high school transcripts Your SAT or ACT (with writing) scores Your essay Your counselor recommendation You may include separate letters of recommendation from teachers/ coaches/employers if you wish, but they're not required as part of your application. In fact, we recommend saving any such letters for scholarship applications. When making an admission decision, we place the greatest emphasis on the courses you have taken and the grades you have earned. Everything else (test scores, activities, recommendations) is important but secondary. Of course, for some programs, your supplemental material will carry more weight. We want to know that you have challenged yourself and that you have done well in your course work. Admission decisions are mailed beginning in mid-January. Look for your letter in the mail by the middle of February. While you're waiting, start thinking about your scholarship applications.2. Apply for scholarships (and scholars programs) Marquette offers a wide variety of merit scholarships that support the university's mission while recognizing student achievement \u2014 excellence in and out of the classroom, commitment to community service, and demonstrated leadership. A scholarship is a form of gift assistance that does not have to be repaid. Scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis to students of high academic ability who enroll full time in an eligible college, and they are awarded by Marquette and private organizations. For complete scholarship details, visit marquette.edu/scholarships. Although not scholarships in the monied sense of the word, our scholars programs also require separate applications. Interested in the Honors Program? Want guaranteed acceptance into dental or law school while saving on a year of college? Marquette's scholars programs may be for you. Each program has specific goals and requirements. Visit the scholarships section of the admissions website for details. You will be automatically considered for most of our scholarships. Those scholarship and scholars programs requiring a separate application have a February 15 deadline. Most scholarship applications require essays, letters of recommendation (which is why you may want to save yours for scholarship applications and not the application for admission) and other credentials. Scholarship applications are typically available in early fall and can be downloaded from the admissions website: marquette.edu/explore. As long as you're beginning to think about college expenses, start thinking about financial aid.

Apply for financial aid Financial aid fact: Approximately 90 percent of our students receive financial aid, including scholarships, grants, student employment and low-interest loans. The financial aid process can be confusing and stressful at times, but we're here to help you figure it all out. We encourage all families to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA will take income tax information from you and your folks and determine your expected family contribution. Essentially, the form calculates how much your family will be able to afford to pay for college, regardless of the institution you choose to attend. After filing the FAFSA online (fafsa.ed.gov), your results are forwarded to the colleges you choose. We'll subtract your EFC from the total cost of attending Marquette. The difference between total cost and your EFC is your demonstrated financial need. If you do not demonstrate need, we can still put together a package of loans and employment to defray expenses. (Everyone should apply for financial aid, even Bill Gates.) An important note: Colleges vary widely in how much tuition costs, but the amount you're expected to pay does not. Therefore, your potential for financial aid increases with higher-cost schools. To file the FAFSA, you and your parents must register for a Personal Identification Number. Visit fafsa.ed.gov to register for a PIN or visit Marquette Central (marquette.edu/mucentral/financialaid) for step-by-step instructions. You can begin to file the FAFSA January 1, but you can get your PIN at any time. We strongly encourage filing the FAFSA by February 1 using estimated income tax numbers. Finally, don't worry. We'll walk you through each step of the admissions and financial aid processes. Follow our recommended deadlines, and you'll have a clear picture of your admission decision, scholarship and financial aid status \u2014 just about everything you need to make a good decision about college \u2014 by April 1 . That gives you four weeks until the most important college deadline: may 1 . The national deposit deadline for all colleges and universities. You'll need to let us (and any college to which you have applied) know your intentions by submitting a non- refundable tuition and housing deposit. The deposit secures your space in the incoming freshman class. Scholarship timeline June July aug. sept. oct. nov. dec.

Depending on your focus, you might face several paths after graduation. Some of our students head to graduate or profes- sional schools. Others take the skills they have learned into the working world. A great service available to students who want to learn more about where their career path could lead is our Career Services Center. This is a place where students can meet with advisers to talk about their next steps. but, wait, there's more. You also may choose to pursue a minor. Minors typically consist of six courses focused on an area of interest outside of your major. Minors can add breadth to your area of expertise. In some majors, you can also pursue a concentration \u2014 a cluster of focused courses within the major. i'm undecided. We have a new word for you: multi-interested. It's not that you haven't a clue. It's that you can see yourself in several different fields. That's great. In fact, multi-interested is our most popular major. The most important thing to note is that you're not alone. More than 20 percent of our students enter as undecided. Once you're here, you'll find advisers and services prepared to help you figure out what you want to do. the university Core of Common studies Perhaps our best tool for the multi-interested student is the University Core of Common Studies. This is a core curriculum composed of nine academic areas. All students (whether you have a major or not) are required to take at least one class from each of the nine areas. This is a great way to sample everything, and you might discover an area of academic interest and aptitude you've never considered before. advising Every student is required to meet with an academic adviser before registering for classes each semester. Your adviser will help you navigate through a degree program to graduate on time. If you are multi-interested, your adviser will work with you to select a class schedule and make sure you are aware of all of your options. still multi-interested? Marquette offers countless combinations of majors and minors. With all of the options, you'll be able to pursue the best academic program for you. There are several ways to define the word major. A musical key, our national pastime (Major League Baseball), a military officer and, of course, that academic thingamajig. At Marquette, a major is a compre- hensive course of study consisting of a minimum of 30 semester hours in a chosen discipline. Put simply, it's a specialization in academic achievement. When you leave Marquette as a graduate, this is the one area in which you will be most proficient. An expert, if you will. But how do you pick just one area of specialization? That's the hard part. marquette offers more than 100 majors. Just check out the following pages. Some students have known what they wanted to do since kindergarten. For others, it takes a little time.WHAT Does iT All meAn?minors? Majors? marquette.edu/explore 39Direct entry means that you apply to and are admitted into one of our seven colleges. There is no general admission. Think of it this way: Marquette, the university, is the umbrella organization for each of the colleges on campus. This allows you to draw on the expertise of all of our colleges, and it's one of the strengths of the core curriculum. You also can remain relatively undecided and switch between most programs. For all intents and purposes, the college is the functional level for students. Your adviser is a faculty or staff member from your college. Your graduation requirements are dictated by your college. Your college houses the department that offers your major. It's simple but often causes a little confusion with prospective students. Most Marquette majors can also be pursued as minors or second majors.
