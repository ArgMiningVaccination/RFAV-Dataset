Understanding the use of TM in Ghana is a complex topic due to the various intertwining factors such as cost, availability, access, socioeconomic status, and sociocultural factors which influence the use of TM. Herein, the objective of this thesis were twofold: (1) to further the understanding of factors that drive the use of TM among elderly individuals in Ghana, and (2) to investigate whether a shift in prevalence of TM use exists. Using Rosenstock's Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework , and seventeen in-depth interviews , this thesis examin ed the perceptions and motivations surrounding the use of TM among elderly residents located in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Thematic analysis of the interviews indicate th at the use of TM is still pervasive despite the increasing availability of WM. The findings suggest that factors including availability of TM as a sociocultural commodity, health perceptions and health seeking behaviours, and other modifying factors are all influential factor s driving the continued use of iii TM. Contrary to previous literature, the dependency on TM as the sole form of medication may no longer be prominent, rather an increase in WM use may be inevitable. iv Acknowledgments I would like to begin by sincerely extending my gratitude to all the respondents of our study. Without their willingness to open their homes to us to share their experiences, this study would not have been possible. As indicated throughout this paper, most participants of our study belong to low SES groups and took time away from work and providing food for their families to help with our study, and for that I am forever grateful. Likewise, I would also like to thank our translator Caesar for his constant h elp and his initiative to propose new research ideas, but also for extending his friendship beyond that of a research assistant. Caesar's guidance in Ghana and timeless availability to discuss research, but also everyday conversations outside of the resear ch context are dearly appreciated. Next, I would like to thank my supervisor and lab mates. Dr. Vincent Kuuire, who I have known for close to five years now has providing me with nothing but guidance and support throughout my Master's. My relationship wit h Dr. Kuuire began as a student in his health geography course. As a psychology and political science major I had little to no knowledge of geography, however over the duration of this course I became deeply invested and passionate to learn more. Expressin g this newfound desire to Professor Kuuire, he quickly offered me a ROP position which only further developed this devotion for the subject. Throughout this journey Dr. Kuuire was more than helpful in his guidance and met regularly to ensure I was always o n track. Moreover, Dr. Kuuire pushed me past my comfort zone to present my research at well -known conferences in which I was the only undergraduate student. I can confidently say that is v something that I believe I would not have had been able to do if it w ere not for his confidence in me. Fast forward two years, and now I am underway of completing my Masters in Geography with Dr. Kuuire's supervision and I could not be happier with this decision. With all that being said, I would just like to say thank you so much for all that you have done for me, I would not be in the position that I am today if it were not for you. Moreover, I would like to thank my lab mates Irenius Konkor, Atuoye for their continuous support, whether it may be for conference presentations, research ideas, or possible publication papers, they have always been on my side. Thank you to Dr. Sarah Wakefield and Dr. Mark Hunter who served as my committee members. Without your ti me and assistance, this defence would not have been possible and for that I am very grateful. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family. Thank you to my long -time friends Abdallah Ismail and Gurjit Mander for their encouragement and support throughout my academic journey. Thank you to Sahar Sohrabipour for your endless support, academic advice, and valuable feedback. Special thanks to my ol der brother Kanwal Singh. Thank you for always guiding me in the right direction and having the best advice. No matter the situation you have always been there for me, and for that I am forever appreciative . Your guidance and expertise throughout the resea rch process have not gone unseen, thank you for making me a stronger research student. I would also like to thank my uncle, Amrjit Badwal, and my grandparents Ms. Gurmanjit Kaur -Tamber, Mr.Gulzar Singh Badwal, and late grandmother Mrs. Malik Kaur for alway s believing in me and being an inspiratio n. Lastly, I would like to thank my parents and dedicate this thesis to them. To my father, Lakhbir Singh, and my mother, Devinder Kaur, you vi are the reason I work so hard and have the desire to be successful one day . Witnessing the hard work that you have gone through to provide our family with a great life i s truly inspiring. Although words could never describe how thankful I am for the opportunities and support you have given, I would just like to thank you from th e bottom of my heart for all that you have done for our family. vii Table of Contents Table of Contents Abstract Background and problem statement ................................ ................................ ...................... 1 1.2 Significance and Research Objectives ................................ ................................ .................. 6 1.3 Outline of the dissertation ................................ 7 Chapter 2: 2.1 Introduction ................................ ................................

Irrespective of the dominance of WM , the use of non- western style of medicine such as traditional medicine (e.g. , herbs and spirituality), complementary, and alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, etc.) remains a prominent source of health care across the world (Shakya, 2016). To that end, millions of people in several low - and middle -income countries (LMICs), such as Ghana, continue to rely on traditional medicine (TM) . The con tinued use and importance of TM in countries such as Ghana is associated with many factors including challenges of accessibility . The definition of \"medicine\" varies greatly from one society to another . Consequently, defining \"medicine \" in the context of this research can be complicated. In western societies, \"medicine \" is something that individuals take to prevent or treat an illness; however, an alternative or traditional view of medicine is \"anything that has a magical influence on the posses sor\" (Bierlich, 2007, p.56). However, differentiating between TM and WM is not as simple as these definitions make it seem, both are heavily dependent on the context in which they are used. For instance, what is considered to be complementary/unconventiona l medicine in one area, may be regarded as conventional 2 medicine in another area. To further elaborate on this point, homeopathic medicine is considered to be a form of conventional medicine to many individuals in various parts of Asia, whereas in the West it is considered to be complementary/unconventional medicine. It is not always clear as to what is considered to be conventional or unconventional medicine. Thus, for the purpose of this study, it is imperative to clarify the difference between western and traditional medicine. \"Western medicine s/services\", consists of, but are not limited to, antibiotics, prescription medications, over -the-counter drugs, X -rays, intravenous injections, surgeries , and other services or drugs typically found in a western health care system . TM on the other hand, involves herbs, plants, spiritual treatments, herbalists, and other traditional doctors. Notably, the main difference between the two forms of medicine is that TM takes a holistic approach to understand ing health and may involve a \"spiritual\" aspect to diagnos es and treatment s (Richter, 2003) . In Ghana, the medicine and health care realm are significantly influenced by religious and spiritual practices. Many individuals in Ghana believe that there are illnesses that cannot be cured by WM (White, 2015). These illnesses require spiritual and religious attention that WM fails to recognize (White, 2015). The role of reli gion in Ghana dictates a major component of many people's lives (Bierlich, 2007). In his seminal work on TM in Ghana, Bierlich (2007) mentions that the concept of disease and illness is heavily reliant on the idea that these are caused by the will or desir e of God. Bierlich (2007) further explain s that there are typically two dimensions to sickness : (1) disease, and (2) illness. Disease is \"external\" and involves biological and psychological organisms, whereas illness is \"internal\" and is the cause of cultu ral and interpersonal 3 conflicts (Bierlich, 2007). Regardless of these differences, treating both illness and disease often requires the help of spirits (Bierlich, 2007). Such knowledge about medicine and medical practices is often passed on orally through ancestral lineage (Tora & Heliso, 2017). To elaborate , African culture is rather collective, where knowledge passed through generations holds strong importance and is often accepted without questioning its legitimacy because it is based on trust. It is also valuable to also recognize that religion and culture are not only considerably influential in the diagnosis and treatment of illness, but also in terms of an influential factor in an individual seeking treatment in the first place (White, 2015). Typical ly, medicine in Ghana is not similar to what is seen throughout western countries. Rather, it is widely considered as being traditional in its use and formation. Although Ghana has implemented the biomedical model into its healthcare system, a significant number of individuals continue to use traditional forms of medicine (Peprah et al., 2020) . For example, a recent study conducted by Gyasi and colleagues (2017) found that 86% of individuals had used, or were continuing to use TM or traditional complementar y medicine in Ghana . In response to the increased availability of WM in Ghana, there has been opposition between users of both forms of medicine (Richter, 2003). Some individuals believe that TM is immoral, while others hold similar beliefs about WM (Bie rlich, 2007). Reasons for this tension may arise from the perception of WM. Research suggests that issues root ed in colonialism may have faltered the trust that Africans have with westernized technologies and ide ologies (Abdullahi, 2011), a subject that wi ll be further 4 discussed later in this thesis . Literature in the field of medicine in the African context depicts that medicine is a concept that is a very personal concept people. Many have gone as far as to say, \"our medicines are more powerful than yours (WM)\" (Bierlich, 2007, p.56). One reason for this strong attachment to personal medical ideologies is that medicine in the African context is deeply rooted in traditional and cultural aspects of life (Abdullahi, 2011). Research also suggests that a loss o f trust between provider ( western corporations) and consumer (African patients) can deter acquisition or use (Amery, 2017). It is plausible that these reasons are potential causes of this conflict . Despite this strife , one cannot ignore the effectiveness of either form of medicine as both have evidence of efficacy (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 2001; Abdullahi, 2011; Tang & Wong, 1998). There is paleontological evidence of plants being used for medical purposes across various regions of the world dating back 60, 000 plus years (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 2001). Even today, traditional and alternative medicines are perceived to be effective, as they are still used by more than 80% of the world's population (Ekor, 2014). Extensive research has shown that there is great value in the use of plants for medicine in treatment of illness and drug discovery (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 2001). Many natural compounds that are found in various TMs around the world have been found to make important contributions to the development of modern medicine (Yuan, Ma, Ye, & Piao, 2016). However, o ut of the millions of species of phytochemical (biological ly active) plants, only a select few have reached the international market as active components in modern medicine (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 20 01; Abdullahi, 2011). For instance , the 5 plant species Ancistrocladus Abbreviatus used in Ghanaian TM remedy can be found in modern day anti -HIV medication (Abdullahi, 2011). Nonetheless, it is imperative to mention that despite the growing number of activ e ingredients from plants being used in modern drugs, it is estimated that only a small fraction of plant species can be used for medicinal purposes. Fabricant and Farnsworth (2001) found that after examining approximately a million species of plants for p otential pharmacologically active compounds, only 6% were deemed appropriate for pharmaceutical trials. Together, factors such as religion, culture, and efficacy explain a predominant association with the use of TM. However, returning to the opening parag raph of this thesis, accessibility in particular is an important factor of TM use in Ghana, especial ly among elderly in dividuals. WM doctors in comparison to TM doctors represent a small fraction of health care providers in Ghana. Coupled with the lack of WM doctors, and other barriers associated with accessibility (such as , distance and availability) individuals are often left to seek TM ( Abdullahi, 2011 ; Cameron, Ewen, Ross -Degnan, Ball, & Laing, 2009 ; & Anvinam, 1987 ). As a result , elderly individuals are increasingly impacted because factors such as frailty and compromised immune systems require this population to have special medical needs and attention. Moreover, elderly individuals are more susceptible to complex ill nesses such as chronic diseases ( Maresova et al., 2019 ). Chronic diseases often cause individuals to require reoccurring visits to healthcare professionals (Syed, Gerber, & Sharp, 2013 ), which further increases the need for easily accessible care. These fa ctors will be further discussed in the next chapter. 6 1.2 Significance and Research Objectives Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) have identified that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent annually on traditional medical practices and interventions (WHO, 2019). The WHO's most recent global report on TM stated that 80% upwards to 99% of the Ghanaian population have used TM (WHO, 2019). Due to the high prevalence of TM use in the country, this research investigate d perceptions about TM and its perceived efficacy in Ghana. Several studies have show n that factors such as culture, religion, individual preferences , and vari ed demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds impact choice in medicinal use (i.e., western or traditional ) (Boakye, Pietersen, Kotze, Pharr, & Bungam, 2012; & Schioldann et al., 2018 ). Much of the research on understanding factors associated with TM use focus on general populations (Boakye et al., 2015; Andel & 2017; Cameron et al., 2009; & Sato, 2012 ), while others focus on specific health conditions (Osamor & Owumi, 2010; Ampofo et al., 2020; Teame et al., 2019; & Yarney et al, 2013), or a group of health conditions such as chronic diseases among populations (Ekor, 2014; Gyasi . Despite the association b etween these aforementioned factors, and the continued reliance on TM in LMICs, discussions on exploring these multiple factors have received limited research 7 attention. Furthermore , research on factors that influence the use of TM among the elderly popula tion is generally scarce , and even more so in elderly population s of LMIC s. This research departs from previous work by focusing on perceptions and perspectives of older persons . Thus, the specific objectives of this research are as follows: 1. Further the understanding of factors that drive the use of TM among elderly individuals in Ghana; and 2. Investigate if there is a shift in the prevalence of TM use, and if so, what are the factors that may be associated with this change Together, these research objectives will develop a profound understanding and contextualization of factors associated with choice of medicinal use in Ghana. These objectives will help us understand the multifactorial relationship that is driving the contin ued use of TM contempt to the increasing availability of WM. In order to comprehensively achieve these objectives, this thesis requires a thorough investigation of previous and current research on TM use in Ghana (and other LMICs ), analysis of in - depth int erviews (primary research) , and a framework that comprehends the complex intertwining nature of multiple factors driving one's medicinal choices. The requirements to achieve these objectives will be further discussed in detail in the upcoming chapter. 1.3 Outline of the dissertation The next chapter will examine past and current literature on TM and complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) use . Specifically, it will examine literature 8 on Ghana , other LMICs similar in context to this research's study po pulation, and a few relevant comparisons to western countries. The chapter begins by providing an overview and justification of the theoretical underpinning of this thesis. Next, the chapter introduces the individual level factors that impact one's health care decisions. These factors include psychological factors, knowledge of TM, demographic and socioeconomic factors. The chapter then proceeds by examining community level factors such as culture, accessibility and availability of TM, as well as the impact of psychosocial factors. The chapter also assesses literature on the efficacy of TM, trends in TM use around the world , and patterns of TM use among elderly individuals . The chapter then concludes with a brief description of the study location profile . Chapter 3 discusses the methodology that was adopted for this study. Specifically, the chapter delves into a justification and rationale of the selected methodology (qualitative methodology), before moving onto the recruitment process. Next, the chapter outlines the data collection and analysis techniques utilized in this study. The chapter concludes by highlighting my positionality as a researcher and its impact on th e research project as a whole. Chapter 4 presents the results of the interviews conducte d with elderly research participants in Ghana . Specifically , the chapter begins by restating the objectives of the research and presenting the study participants' characteristics. The chapter consists of an analysis of 17 in -depth interviews that were cond ucted using an interview guide in various communities of the Upper West Region of Ghana. This chapter then highlights the themes that emerged from the data analysis in the following categories : (1) 9 availability of traditional medicine as a socio -cultural commodity, (2) health perception and health seeking behaviours, (3) the modifying factors in the use of traditional medicine, and (4) the changing culture and a shift towards western medicine. The ch apter concludes by summarizing the key results of each category . Chapter 5 contains a discussion of the findings of the research , and further detail s the trends from the results. This portion of the paper utilizes the theoretical framework as a guide to c ontextualize and analyze the findings . Alongside the theoretical and practical justifications behind the perceived findings, this chapter compares this study's findings with existing literature. While many of the findings are parallel with th at of other research, there are also some interesting, novel findings that are contradictory to past and current literature. Some of these trends include the differences in perceived efficacy of TM between rural and urban communities, the shift towards WM, and gender di fferences in factors associated with TM use. The chapter then retur ns to the implications of the research and provides suggestions for the government of Ghana, as well as local and global doctors. The thesis concludes by highlighting some of the limitations of the study and recommendations for future research. 10 Chapter 2 : Literature Review 2.1 Introduction This chapter presents a com prehensive l iterature review on TM use. Accordingly , this chapter is divided into five main categories . The first portion presents the theoretical framework of this study , its foundation and evolution, and how it is contextualized within this thesis. The next portion of the chapter discusses literature on how individual level factors such as psychological factors, demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and TM knowledge are associated with TM and CAM use . The third section prese nts an overview of the literature on how community level factors ( such as culture, and availability ) impact the use of TM . The fourth section of this review explore s literature on the efficacy of TM, associated risks, and false positives associated with TM use. Further, trends in the use of TM in different regions of world will be assessed to exemplify the importance of understanding its ongoing use . Next, the chapter examines literature on the use of TM amongst elderly residents of Ghana. Finally, the chap ter concludes with a brief overview of the study location. 2.2 Theoretical Underpinning of the Study A central component of health care research is understanding the factors that influence health related behaviours . In 19 66, the Health Belief Model (HBM) was 11 officially created to better understand the psychosocial determinants of why people seek health care services. Though the HBM was originally conceptualized in the 1950s to explain why individuals may or may not accept screening for tuberculosis (Champion & Skinner, 2008; Rosenstock, 1974 ; Janz & Becker, 1984 ), it later became a prominent conceptual framework in the study of health behaviour. Many versions of the framework have emerged over the years in response to the peculiarity of resea rch questions in health care. In this dissertation, Rosenstock's original version of the framework is utilized as it provides an overarching examination of both psychological factors associated with perceived health risks and disease severity, and a cost/b arrier analysis to healthcare influence the choice of medicine. Though, other versions by Rosenstock 's HBM later merged to incorporate other factors that impact health service access behaviors, his original version is best suited for this thesis. For examp le, Rosenstock, Strecher, and Becker (1998) introduced a new version of the HBM that included aspects of the Social Cognitive Theory, but this version was focused largely on providing insights to the influence of self -efficacy in behaviours of health service access. Specifically, this adaptation is focused on examining the individual's perception of making changes to health -related habits and behaviors, rather than the efficacy of health care service itself (Rosenstock, Strecher, & Becker, 1998) . Self -efficacy in this model refers to one's internal belief of whether or not they think they will be able to adhere or commit to the changes suggested by health care professionals, and how th at impacts their overall decision of seeking health care servi ces. For example, if an individual was seeking help from a nutritionist, their self -efficacy will not be focused on the effectiveness of the 12 nutritionist being able to reduce their weight, but rather focused on the individual's belief of whether or not the y will be able to follow their recommendations and their capability of losing weight and eating healthy. For the purpose of the current thesis, it is more imperative to understand the perceived efficacy of TM using Rosenstock's original framework as it be tter reflects one's healthcare choices , and is directly measured in the \"perceived benefits\" portion of the original framework . Rosenstock's original HBM ( 1966 ) is dependent on four major components that result in the trigger of a response . The first comp onent is \"perceived susceptibility\", which is one's understanding of the \"perceived seriousness\" associated with an illness or disease ( Rosenstock, 1966; Aday & Andersen, 2005). In terms of this study, an individual's likelihood of accessing TM or WM is based o ff their understanding of how susceptible they were to a serious illnesses or serious consequences of a possible ailment. The second factor examined the \"perceived benefits of taking actio n as well as the barriers\" ( Rosenstock, 1966 ). This is an individual's assessment of the benefits that they would bear if they were to acquire medical care (i.e., relieving pain) in comparison to the costs (i.e., medical expenses) (Rosenstock, 19 66). The t hird portion of this model examines \"the cues that trigger a response\", these cues are either internal (i.e., symptoms), or external (i.e., media or interpersonal interactions) (Rosenstock, 19 66). The final component assesses the \"modifying factors\" that e voke one's response to an illness or disease. These modifying factors include demographic variables, and socio - psychological variables ( Rosenstock, 1966 ). 13 Apart from being a widely cited and established framework, there are many practical motives behind the HBMs use in this thesis. As a key objective of this study is to examine the underlying reasons behind TM use, it is important to examine in detail the motivations behind the decision -making process. Given that this study employs the use of in-depth int erviews, the HBM appropriately provides a thorough understanding of the multidimensional relationships that may be responsible for the on -going use of TM and the potential shift towards WM. Particularly, this framework conceptualizes the psychological aspe ct behind the decision -making process of medicinal care by examining the perceived benefits and barriers of health care, while also accounting for the influence of other factors such as perceived need, as well as social and demographic variables driving th eir decisions. The HBM is a better representation of the cohort being examined in this study. The HBM specifically focuses on demographic variables, such as class, gender, and age, which better reflect the present cohort, which consists of older persons in a LMIC ( Figure 2.1.). Further, the HBM also takes into account psychological characteristics such as personality, and cultural values to a larger extent, which play influential role in the decisions that elderly individuals in Ghana make when seeking health care. Other competing frameworks fail to understand an individual's unique motivations behind their health care decisions, but are increasingly focused on health care systems themselves and predisposing factors. Ultimately, the discussions of health ca re related behaviours of this thesis are guided using the HBM. Specifically, this thesis utilize s Rosenstock's original HBM framework as the theoretical underpinning to help guide and explain the on -going use of 14 TM in Ghana . However, the model is conceptua lized and reorganized to provide an accurate depiction of this study's research objectives . Based on this, the various components of the HBM will be examined by categorizing health perceptions and health seeking behaviour factors into individual (internal) and community (external) level factors. In regard to the HBM, individual factors consist of perceived susceptibility /severity , perceived costs and benefits, internal beliefs, knowledge of TM, and modifying factors related the individual, such as , gender and income. Community level factors consist of interpersonal relationships, and external modifying factors , such as, culture and health care accessibility. In the context of health geography and public health disciplines, literature on TM and complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) consists of uncovering factors associated with their use. In general, the characteristics of TM and CAM use are broadly categorized into individual and community -level factors. Individual -level factors examine the role of personal , internal characteristics and beliefs , in shaping medical decisions and TM use (Hardon et al, 2004) , while community level factors emphasize the role of social pressures, culture, and availability of TM practitioners relative to western he alth facilities. Below, I begin by examining the connection between individual level factors and the use of TM. 15 Figure 2.1. The Health Belief Model. This figure provides a visualization of factors that impact one's decision -making process of seeking heal th care. Adapted from : Rosenstock, I. M., Strecher, V. J., & Becker, M. H. (1988). Social learning theory and the health belief model. Health Education Quarterly, 15, 175183. 2.3 Individual Level Factors 2.3.1 Psychological Factors A central component of psychological research on medical care is understanding the factors that influence why one seeks certain avenues of care . As mentioned above, the HBM identifies various psychological aspects as determinants of health care services utilization . Perceived susceptibility and vulnerability signify the patient's opinion of how vulnerable they are to an illness , whereas perceived symptom severity is an individual's notion of how life -threatening a condition appears (Campbell & Roland, 1996). Research 16 depicts that perceived symptom severity accounts for approximately 16% of observed variance in seeking medical care (Campbell & Roland, 1996). A study by Campbell and Roland (1996) used data from the 4th National Morbidity Survey to identify differences i n the likelihood of seeing a doctor during times of need. With a sample size of 1000 patients, researchers found that an individual's health seeking behavior increased as perceived severity and impairment of daily life increased (Campbell & Roland, 1996). In addition , the HBM suggests that an individual's decision on obtaining medical care is based on whether or not the perceived benefits of seeking care outweigh its costs (Campbell & Roland, 1996). Financial charges, transportation costs, and losing time o ff work were all found to be barriers that may deter an individual from seeking medical care (Campbell & Roland, 1996) . Further , possible negative side-effects of the treatment can also discourage the individual from seeking care (Campbell & Roland, 1996). Lastly, knowledge about the illness and its associated treatment (s) can impact one's decision about seeking medical care (Campbell & Roland, 1996) . Acquiring more information about an illness has been illustrated to increase an individual's likeliness to pursue medical intervention(s) (Campbell & Roland, 1996). This is also evident in Richter's (2003) work on patients with HIV and AIDS, which found that TM users tend to skip scheduled meetings with their doctor and do not adhere to their pre scribed medication. The lack of information regarding the severity of their illness often lead to further complications and unwarranted health outcomes (Richter, 2003; Campbell & Roland, 1996). Individuals with higher levels of information tend to explore more types of medical outlets (Campbell & Roland, 1996). For the purpose of this study, various 17 components of the HBM are of significant importance to the foregoing discussion about TM use among elderly people in Ghana. Irrespective of the choice that indi viduals make to receive TM, WM, both TM and WM, or neither, it is important to understand the basis of this decision and whether the factors specified in the HBM play a role. 2.3.2 Knowledge of TM As mentioned earlier, knowledge of TM is generational because it is passed on verbally between family and community members. Similarly, traditional healers also obtain their knowledge in a parallel method , and apply th eir knowledge through patient practices (Boakye et al. , 2015). Previous literature demonstra tes different pattern s in the frequencies of certain TM practices (Boakye et al., 2015). Specifically, some remedies are widely known , while others var y between local communities due to the idiosyncrasy component of knowledge (Boakye et al., 2015). Thus, v ariations found in the frequency of TM use between different communities may be a result of differences in lineal knowledge. A study examining the factors associated with the continued use of TM in Suriname found that TM plant knowledge and health status were of the strong est predictors of TM use (Andel & Carvalherio, 2013). These findings provided useful insight because Suriname is similar to Ghana, as they are both rapidly urbanizing countries. Similarly, a paper by Schioldann et al. (2018) highlighted that factors such as , religion, marital status, education, gender, employment status, number of children, and health insurance were all influential , but not as significant as TM knowledge . For this 18 reason, when examining the use of TM use among participants of this study, it may be useful to question these participants TM plant knowledge as a potential influential factor . However, it is important to note that research on knowledge of TM among healers shows no significant correlat ion between age of TM doctor and number of TM species reported (Yineger & Yewhalaw, 2007). Rather, a correlation was found between the availability of medicine (shrubs and trees are the most common form of medicine and are most commonly available during al l seasons) and TM species reported (Yineger & Yewhalaw, 2007). Moreover, m ajority of plants proven to have medical importance were not cultivated by TM doctors (Yineger & Yewhalaw, 2007). With respect to this research, th e study underlines that TM knowledg e may not be the most influential factor in the use of TM; thus, we must be careful to not over emphasize the prominence of TM knowledge . The current research identif ies the opposing viewpoints in literature by examining patients rather than healers , and providing novel insights from the patients' perspective . To add , the literature depicts that p rofessional TM doctors may not be prescribing medicine based on efficacy, but rather based on availability. Taken together, t hese findings will validate the rationale behind examining medicinal availability and access among the elderly patients . 2.3.3 Demographic Factors Apart from knowledge of TM, demographic factors such as , gender, age, and marital status can represent strong predictors to be consider ed. Research illustrates that in 19 many countries of the developing sub -Saharan African region, women are more avid users of TM (Gyasi, Mensah, & Siaw, 2015). For example, a study on the characteristics of CAM use in Ghanaian cancer patients demonstrated that women were more likely to use CAM than men (Yarney et al., 2013). Likewise, g ender, occupation, and marital status were all significantly associated with the use of TM , and TM practitioners amongst patients living with hypertension in Nigeria (Osamor & Owumi, 2010). Specifically, there were higher frequencies of TM use amongst women and those with higher levels of income in comparison to men (Gyasi et al., 2017). Further more, education in Ghana was also a predictor of TM use among women (Gyasi et al., 2017). Women who were educated were less likely to use TM (Gyasi et al., 2017). In co mparison , in the United States , age , income , education, ethnicity, and gender were all positively associated with the use of CAM and TM (Ni, Simile, & Hardy, 2002). Although most of the previous literature on these various demographic factors does not focus on the elderly population, factors such as education, gender, and marital status remain impactful and thus need further elaboration. The impact of demographic factors on the use of TM among elderly individuals remain unclear and require s further examination . With that being said , past and current research recognizes the significance of socio economic status (SES) in the use of TM (Williams, 1990; Pharr, Moonie, & Bungum, 2012; Gyasi et al., 2017; Sato, 2012). 20 2.3.4 Socioeconomic Factors Literature on socioeconomic factors illustrate those individuals with low SES have inadequate health care due to financial barriers ( Williams, 1990). These financial barriers can include the cost of the prescriptions, transportation costs, consultation fees, and more. Thus, individuals tha t are unemployed are less likely to consult a doctor (Pharr, Moonie, & Bungum, 2012). It is evident that those with high er SES are at an advantage in terms of seeking and obtaining health care. Although t he impacts of SES are universal , they are pertinent when studying TM use in Ghana. Aa study on income, age, and health in Ghana found individuals older than 50 years within the three lower SES groups were significantly more likely to report poor health , compared to those from higher SES groups (Fink, Weeks, & Hill, 2012). Moreover , individuals belonging to low -income groups are more likely to delay health care services (Pharr, Moonie, & Bungum, 2012). In line with this study, th e evidence supports that individuals that are resource -deprived may avoid seeking WM care and /or expensive medication . Alternatively, these individuals are more likely to seek TM instead. As previously mentioned, many individuals in Ghana belong to lower SES groups . Majority of West African individuals over the age of 60 are u nemployed and many are unable to support themselves financially (Ogwumike & Aboderin, 2005). Consequently, these individuals a re placed at a higher risk of poverty. Research in Nigeria, another LMIC similar to Ghana, found that poverty significantly increases as individuals surpass the age of 45 (Ogwumike & Aboderin, 2005). Considering the current 21 study population , older persons may be more inclined to use TM, which is often free or inexpensive , whereas WM has financial cos ts associated with its use . In the Ghanaian context, a rise in income was found to be associated with a reduction in TM use (Sato, 2012). Specifically, research depicts that as income rises, the utilization of TM as the individuals first choice of health c are decreases (Sato, 2012). Overall , while these individual -level factors are significant, some prominent findings also exist in the literature regarding community level factors that affect the utilization of TM. 2.4 Community Level Factors 2.4.1 Culture Culture is a unique aspect of an individual's identity as it harvests a varying set of beliefs, values, norms, and behaviors by which one acts. In the realm of medicine, culture has been indicated as being influen tial in an individual's management of health -related issues . Research has shown that patterns exist among culturally unique areas when investigating rural health disparities (Hartley, 2004). In particular, culture can guide how individuals manage or even perceive certain illness es. Differences in management techniques can be witnessed from one community to another . Despite the positive influence of culture in disease prevention and treatment, research depicts that it can also have negative effects on one's well -being (When Medic ine and Culture Intersect, 2014). For example, Campbell and Roland's (1996) study found that Indian and Afro -Caribbean individuals were less likely to consult mental health care in comparison to Caucasians. 22 Although this population is not from the West Afr ican context, it still illustrates the differences in health care that may be facilitated by one's culture. To add , culture can influence the avenue of healthcare that individuals pursue. For example, First Nations have been often noted for consulting traditional healers over medical doctors ( \"When Medicine and Culture Intersect \", 2014). With respect to the current study, this highlights the significance of possible cultural differences within a single country. For example, a First Nation s community in Canada , was found to have significantly higher preference for TM in comparison to the rest of the population. Culture has also been found to influence individual's diet and f asting rituals, which can indirectly impact the recovery and management of illness es (\"When Medicine and Culture Intersect \", 2014). The role of culture goes far beyond the few aforementioned examples . In fact, previous literature highlights that the development of colonies in African culture may have strongly influenced care-seeking beh aviour s among individuals . Ali Abdullahi (2011) introduced the idea that the arrival of Europeans in Africa was a turning point for their medical system. In hindsight, TM was deeply rooted in the African culture prior to their arrival and was considered the main medical system at the time. Abdullahi suggests that w ith the arrival of the Europeans and societal shift, there may have been a permanent setback to accepting new \" westernized \" technologies and methodologies (Abdullahi, 2011). When the Europeans arrived, they implemented their culture through \"slavery, capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, and other forms of domination and exploitation\" (Abdullahi, 2011 , p.116 ). These damaging tactics and events may have caused a \"cultural ideological clash\", whic h resulted in an imbalance of 23 power. Ultimately, this predicament led to a lack of trust and avoidance of new western technology and culture, such as modern medicine (Abdullahi, 2011). It is imperative to recognize and explore these forced cultural changes during colonial times, as the British outlawed many indigenous practices during their reign, and this was extremely impactful. During the reign of the British, many new institutional practices were introduced, however not all of these practices were openl y accepted by the indigenous Ghanaian population. With respect to TM, its use was banned in some cases by colonizers due to its use of \"witchcraft\" , which resulted in the present difficulties observed in the implementation of TM in the healthcare system of previously colonized countries (Abdullahi, 2011) . It may be worthwhile to explore the connection between the use of WM and the exploitative effect of colonization. As mentioned earlier, African TM generally incorporates both physical and spiritual dimensi ons in its health care remedies outside the official healthcare system (Abdullahi, 2011). However, WM fails to incorporate the spiritual realm, which is a major component of TM, and can possibly explain why individuals are not using WM (Richter, 2003). Non etheless, TM survived this assimilation , and is still carried out throughout various regions of the world, despite its substantial spiritual element. Bierlich's Cultural Model of Health and Illness takes into account the role of both the spiritual and biol ogical realm to explain why individuals tend to use TM as opposed to WM (Bierlich, 2007) . The Cultural Model of Health and Illness depicts that there are various components that impact an individual's health and likelihood of developing an illness or disease (Bierlich, 2007). This model was developed on the basis of four components, 24 which include: (1) ancestors of the individual, (2) their society and kinship, (3) their relationship with the land, and (4) the bush (Bierlich, 2007). The bush plays a signifi cant role in an individual developing an illness as it is apprehended that the bush hides many dangers such as snakes, scorpions, and evil spirits (Bierlich, 2007). Likewise, children that develop convulsions are believed to have had mothers that took bath s after sunset and were victims of \"bush attacks\" (Bierlich, 2007). The Cultural Model of Health and Illness suggests that the balance between these four components and the individual is what causes or deters illness and disease (Bierlich, 2007). Bierlich (2007) suggests that if a person has an imbalance between these interrelated factors, then that person often loses the \"protection of their ancestors\" and becomes weary of illness. With respect to this research, the significance of this model is that it in corporates the cultural and spiritual aspect of TM , and provides an alternative explanation behind the use of TM among the elderly population . 2.4.2 Accessibility and Availability of TM Availability and access to health care are imperative factors that are situated in the broader theme of health geography, and health care use in general. In practicality, an individual is more likely to acquire medication or go see a doctor when the doctor is close in proximity. In a LMIC such as Ghana, modern medicine has been shown to be inadequately available, despite recent increases LMIC s has illustrated that a signifi cant 25 portion of the population lack s access to modern medicine (Peprah et al., 2020) . As a result, individuals turn to TM as an alternative, which may explain its widespread use (Cameron et al., 2009). In Ghana, the ratio of TM healers to the population was 1:200, whereas for medical doctors it was 1:20,000 ( Krah, Kruijif, & Ragno, 2018 ). The difference between these two ratios is substantial in terms of accessibility. The limited number of local medical doctors and large number of TM healers makes it convenient and more likely for individuals to seek TM. A major component of research on accessibility is often focused on distance, and how distance can act as a deterrent to health care seeking beha viour (Anyinam, 1987). Notably , the distance an individual is willing to travel to seek health care is associated with the nature of the illness itself (Anyinam, 1987). The greater the severity of an illness or injury, the more likely an individual would b e willing to travel further distances for the appropriate care (Anyinam, 1987). Research on Ghana's population has shown that individuals are more likely to travel greater distances when they are seeking specialist services, despite poor or extensive trave lling conditions (Anyinam, 1987). Thus, when examining use of TM and other health care needs, it may be important to question the attainability and accessibility of the health care , and having the means to travel to obtain health care . It is essential to note that the current research's study population consists of older persons, thereby making long distance s more difficult to travel . Examining the severity of the illness is important as it can impair the ability to travel, as well as the likelihood of gett ing necessary care . 26 Apart from the relationship between accessibility and availability , and one's location in relevance to obtaining health care , geography plays an important role in the idea of space and the interaction with the environment. In particular , the idea that spaces become \"places\" is an important factor in this study. Locations become \"places\" when they hold emotional and a reciprocal meaning (Gatrell & Elliott, 2015). The environment can provide a sense of security and livelihood, which can ma ture into meaningful relationships . Since, TMs are often derived from local trees, plants, and bushes they too can form a sense of meaningful relationship . Whether these individuals are consciously aware of this relationship or not, these \"places\" provide individuals with essential goods and develop this meaningful relationship . Understanding how health care services are organized spatially is equally as important. Spatial variability impact s the capability of individuals to easily access these goods (TM co mponents) . This geographical concept of spatial variation is essential in understanding the differences between TM and WM use among residents of urban and rural communities. 2.3.3 Impact of Family Members A central component of health care research is the influence of interpersonal relationships , particularly the impact of family members. Families that provide formal advice on coping, treatment, and whether an individual should seek care, and can increase or decrease one's rate of seeking medical care (Campbell & Roland, 1996). Social support is an important factor to consider . Multiple findings have shown that patients 27 with high levels of social support require fewer visits to healthcare professionals , have better overall health , and more efficient coping me chanisms (Ozbay et al., 2007; Campbell & Roland, 1996) . Beyond levels of social support , the family structure of an individual can impact the likelihood of obtaining health care as well (Heck & Parker, 2002). Campbell and Roland (1996) suggest that widowed or divorced individuals were more likely to consult medical care due to fewer developed social networks , whereas single or married individuals were better equipped to cope with illness due to well - developed social support systems (Campbell & Roland, 1996). Research on family -level support also depicts the importance of discussing symptoms of illness with family members and the likelihood of getting medical testing (Vedio, Liu, Lee, & Sal way, 2017). The impact of family members is important to the current study population because most of the medical knowledge possessed by these individuals has been passed down through multiple familial generations. This trusted knowledge often lingers with in the family, and the advice of elderly members (often the source of information) may influence the individual's TM use. Moreover, Ghana is considered to be a collective society , in which family members are very important financially and socially; therefo re, making the family unit significantly vital in the decision -making process of seeking, obtaining, and administering health care. 28 2.5 Efficacy of TM and Risks Conversations of TM use are often shaped largely by the discussions of its efficacy. In terms of medicine, efficacy is persistently one of the most important factor s for patients of both TM and WM. Previous research has shown TM to be effective, at least to a certain extent (Fabricants & Farnsworth, 2001; Yuan et al., 2016; & Abdullahi, 2011). Literature on perceived efficacy in Ghana suggests that the majority of TM users believe that it is effective in curing numerous conditions, such as boils, piles, AIDS, and fevers (Gyasi, Mensah, Adjei, & Agyemang, 2011). It is necessary to recognize that a substantial sum of the population continues to use TM; therefore, making efficacy an important factor to investigate. According to the WHO (2019), 80 -99% of the Ghanaian population currently uses TM. Additionally , approximately 70% of the population in Ghana relies exclusively on TM (Traditional healers broaden health care in Ghana, 2019). Considerable time, financial resources, and rigor ous scientific research is conducted on testing the efficacy and safety of WM; however , \"rigorous testing \" for TM is questionable and strengthens the conversation of its efficacy . For instance, in 1991 it was estimated that 231 million dollars were spent over a 10 -year period on testing contemporary medicine to ensure its efficacy (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 2001). Although most TM is derived from plants, which are unlikely to have high toxicity levels, it is possible that prolonged use may cause negative side effects to the body (Fabricant & Farnsworth, 2001). Since many individuals use TM, it is fundamental to examine its effectiveness to promote better health and prevention. Preventing the use of ill -advised medicine is required to reduce unnecessary spending for individuals, as money is an 29 amenity that many people lack, especially in LMICs. Recent research in Ghan a found that nearly 50% of individuals lived under the poverty line with an income of less than $2 USD a day (Fink, Weeks, & Hill, 2012). Preventi ng the use of ineffective medicine is paramount for cost efficiency and crucial for deterring the consumption of harm ful toxins. As research indicates, there are risks associated with using TM, such as poisoning (Sercan & Selahattin, 2018). Although, rare, consumption of certain plants can occur and result in respiratory failure (Sercan & Selahattin, 2018). Similarly, po isoning from WM is also possible as instances of overdose or adverse effects due to the use of incompatible medications can also occur. However, most WM has explicit instructions and warning labels to prevent these unwanted effects from occurring. In contr ast, TM is not accompanied with such warnings or instructions which can lead to the mixing of incompatible herbs or even the consumption of poisonous plants or herbs. Irrespective of these risks and unclear efficacy , many individuals in Ghana continu e to use TM; therefore, it is important to understand the perceived efficacy when looking at TM use. A study on snakebite patients in Myanmar indicated that many individuals seek TM despite the increased availability of the WM, such as antidotes and antibiotics (Schioldann et al, 2018). Snakebites are a precarious concern in many developing countries as inadequately equipped farmers are increasingly exposed to snakes in grassland fields (Schioldann et al, 2018). Untreated or delayed treatment of snakebites can b e life -threatening, which makes it important for these individuals to seek the appropriate health care urgently . Unfortunately, a significant number of individuals die each year due to ineffective traditional healing methods, such as tattooing or applicati on 30 of snake stones (Schioldann et al, 2018). Despite the mass sum of individuals dying from using ineffective traditional methods, these practices continue. It is worth investigating why these individuals continue to use these traditional methods. With the use of focus group discussions in the Mandalay division of Myanmar, Schioldann and collogues (2018) concluded that individuals seek TM care due to cultural an d traditional beliefs, proximity to care, low cost, and perceived insufficiency of WM. The author s also highlight the fact that these TMs may not be as effective as individuals believe (Schioldann et al, 2018) . Specifically, sometimes snakes do not release poison when they bite, or they do not release a lethal dose; thus, when individuals proceed to u se TM and they do not fall sick, they believe it was due to TM (Schioldann et al, 2018). Inaccurate perception s of illness severity may be responsible for the individual healing , not the effectiveness of the medical care itself . For example, a snakebite from a snake that is not poisonous , individuals may be over -estimating the seriousness of their illness. These individuals administer TM as a remedy for various illnesses and recover; however, it may not be the TM that was responsible for this, but rather the body's immune system or a placebo effect. This finding suggests that the perceived efficacy may not be the actual efficacy of TM. As a result, when examining the efficacy of TM amongst the current study's subjects, it is crucial that we are not conclus ive, and examine other possible factors that may be of contribution . 31 2.6 Trends in Use of TM in Different Regions of the World Recent trends have demonstrated that use of TM exceeds the realm of LMIC s, in fact, patterns of increased TM use in western societies can be witnessed (Rashrash, Schommer, & Brown, 2017 ). Over time, alternative medicine ha s become more acceptable in treating and caring for individuals' health care needs (Honda & Jacobson, 2005). Research has publicized many potential factors fo r this pattern of increase in TM use in western societies. Although this research does not directly correlate with the target population, it may highlight some possible phycological and personality factors that may influence one's decision to use TM. Honda and Jacobson (2005) led a study on roughly 3000 adults in the United States to uncover the influence of personality, coping strategies, and social support on TM use. Results indicated that individuals with high er levels of openness to experience were posi tively associated with all types of alternative medicine use (Honda & Jacobson, 2005) . Individuals with higher levels of perceived social support were also associated with increased usage of alternative medicine (Honda & Jacobson, 2005). Additionally, an i ndividual's belief about medication has shown to affect the efficacy of the medication, which in turn may influence whether an individual re -adheres or administers the medication (Crayton et al, 2017). This finding highlights the importance of the placebo effect when studying the efficacy of a treatment. I t may be valuable to consider how factors such as individual beliefs and predisposed biases towards TM use can influence its efficacy and use . 32 2.7 TM Use Among the Elderly The United Nations World Population Aging Report (2015) indicates that there will be approximately 2 billion individuals over the age of 60 by 2050, of which about 80% of individuals will be living in LMIC s. LMIC s are known for the economic challenges they face, and the increase i n their elderly population will have substantial implications and burden on their healthcare systems ( Kuuire, Tenkorang, Rishworth, Luginaah, & Yawson, 2017 ). More specifically, in Ghana, the population is quickly shifting to a society dominated by elderly individuals ; therefore, recognizing the needs of these aging individuals is essential (Kuuire et al, 2017). As previous ly indicated, e lderly individuals are considered to be a vulnerable population due to relatively higher risks of ill health and increased susceptibility to disease that results from the age -associated weakening of their immune system. Their conditions create a situation where it is necessary for them to receive age -appropriate treatment for their ailments. However, available eviden ce demon strates that many older persons in LMICs tend to have unmet health care needs during times of illness (Kuuire et al, 2017). WHO suggests that one third of the world's population lacks regular access to the medication that they require, and this fig ure rises to over 50% in African countries (Hardon, Hodgkin, and Fresle, 2004). This lack of access to healthcare pertains to the general population, not just the elderly population; however, the lack of access for elderly population is another compound fa ctor (Hardon et al, 2004). It is estimated that over 80% of populations in LMIC s rely on TM to treat various illnesses, including chronic 33 conditions, which tend to be associated with lifestyle choices and older age (Ekor, 2014). However, other studies have noted that there are no correlations between age and use of TM (Gyasi et al., 2015; & Oyebode et al. , 2016). In a recent study by Oyebode and colleagues (2016), it was found that many users of TM were 40 years and older; however, there was no association found between age and use of TM. This finding may be a result of the large difference s of individuals in the sample. Specifically, the study had much larger sample of individuals that were ages 40 and younger and this may have swayed the results . Nonethele ss, the conflicting results of various studies make it important for us to clarify the possible association between age and use of TM . Most literature on the topic is not recent, and this topic requires a contemporary analysis as the political and industri al landscape of Ghana is rapidly changing , and the availability of WM is increasing. 2.8 Brief profile of the study location This research was conducted in Ghana, a country located on the West coast of Africa. The population of Ghana consists of approximately 30 million individuals, with a relatively even ratio of males and female (51% males, and 49% females) (World Development Indicators: Population dynamics, 2020). The current World Bank report (2020) depicts that 3% of the pop ulation of Ghana is 65 years or older. Moreover, t he life expectancy in Ghana for males is 63 years while for females it is 65 years (World Development Indicators: Population dynamics, 2020) . The International Monetary Fund (2019) estimates that the current GDP of Ghana is $73 billion, with a per -capita estimated 34 at $2,374. To put into perspective, Canada's GDP is estimated at approximately $2 trillion, with an approximate $50,000 per -capita, while Nigeria ( neighboring West African Country) has a n estimated GDP of $442 billion and a per -capita of approximately $2,150 (World Economic Outlook Database, 2019). In general , the economy of Ghana has improved substantially over the last 40 years , and has obtained a stable GDP growth since the 1980s (Aryee tey & Kanbur, 2017). This relative increase can be primarily attributed to the oil and natural mineral industries in Ghana (Aryeetey & Kanbur, 2017). The elderly population of Ghana was selected as the model population for this study for numerous reasons described below . First, Ghana is currently facing a failing healthcare s ystem (Agbenorku, 2012) . Despite Ghana having a national health insurance plan meant to provide elderly individuals with health care expenditure relief, many elder s are still left wit h these burdens (Drislane, Akpalu, & Wegdmam, 2014). This failure of the healthcare s ystem could potentially be attributed to the lack of government spending on health care. The World Bank (2020) estimate s that only 3.5% of total GDP is spent on healthcare , whereas countries such as Canada, France, and Sweden spend closer to 11%. Even when c ompared to fellow West African countries , Ghana's expenditure on healthcare is relatively low. For instance , countries such as Togo spend s 6.2% , Niger spends 7.3%, and B urkina Faso spends 5.6% of total GDP on healthcare, respectively (World Bank, 2020) . In Ghana, a pproximately 40% of total expenditure on healthcare is paid by the public , whereas countries such as Canada, Sweden, and France are closer to 10% (World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure Database, 2010). It is worth nothing that access to health care among the poor and populations located in rural areas 35 of the country is increasingly limited , and even absent in some cases. For example, Ganle (2014) found that limitations in funding to rural areas for healthcare services, staffing, and other expenditures significantly limit both the access and availability of health care for residents of these communities. Further more , Peprah and colleagues (20 20) recently found that reasons such as the impact of colonialism , government allocation of funds for urban development, transportation fees, financial barriers , and socio -cultural factors all decreased the access of healthcare services for individuals liv ing in the Upper West Region of Ghana . The impact of limited healthcare funding has caused significant reduction in access to health care facilities , thus leading to negative health outcomes for the residents . Taken t ogether, the elderly population of the U pper West Region of Ghana serves as an excellent model population for studying health care behaviors. Wa is a town located in Wa Municpal, which is found in the Upper West Region of Ghana. According to the most recent census, Wa has a population of approximately 110,000 with a n even gender distribution (District Analytical Report, 2014). Moreover, the census depicts that approximately 35% of the region's population resides in surround ing rural localities, and 65% of individuals in the region are migr ants (District Analytical Report, 2014). The employment rate in Wa is a unique feature that makes this population more intriguing to study . In this region, the unemployment rate is considerably high, as indicated by 45.2% of the population being unemployed (District Analytical Report, 2014). Out of those employed , approximately 53% are self -employed and a third are agricultur al labourers (District Analytical Report, 2014). These rates are alarming because as previously stated, income and financial means substantially 36 influence one's choice of seeking health care , which in turn impacts the type of medic al care an individual seeks (TM or WM) . Moreover, c onducting research in Wa is particularly important as it is one of the least urbanized areas in Ghana, and access to healthcare is limited. For example, a recent study has shown that the WM physician -to- population ratio in the Upper regions of Ghana is considerably lower relative to the rest of Ghana (Krah, Kruijif, & Ragno, 2018) . In particular, the ratio in Upper Ghana is 1:100,000 ; whereas , the rest of the country has a ratio of 1:20,000 WM doctor to population (Krah, Kruijif, & Ragno, 2018). As previously indicated , accessibility and availability are a significant predictor of health car e decision -making (among other related factors such as distance, transportation, costs, etc.) ; thus, this limited availability of WM doctors significantly influences the use of TM. Ultimately , the unique features of Ghana's healthcare system speak to the bro ader theme of health behavio r discrepancies within Ghana , and highlights the importance of conducting research in the country, particularly Wa . 2.9 Conclusion This chapter examine d previous literature related to the study topic , and its research objectives. Specifically, the chapter beg an by contextualizing and justifying the theoretical framework of this study.

Specifically, the chapter is divided into 6 portions . The first portion discusses the research methodology used in this thesis. Next, the chapter identifies the selected qualitative technique utilized in this thesis and its justificati on. The next portion of this chapter details the recruit ment process, followed by the data collection and analysis methods. This portion of the chapter also outlines the participants ethical and confidentiality portion of the research. Approval of the proj ect was successively permitted by the University of Toronto's Office of Research Ethics and all actions of this project were carried out under the guidelines. The remainder of the chapter highlights the researcher positionality , its impact on the thesis , and a conclusion to the chapter . 3.2 Research Methodology The research methodology utilized to fulfill the research objective (s) of this study was qualitative in nature . There are various benefits of applying a qualitative 39 methodology for the purpose of this study . Although quantitative studies can be useful for understanding trends, relationships, and creating predictive /explanatory models, they are unable to explain in detail the various reasons behind individual decisions. Additionally, quantitative te chniques are inadequate in capturing personal experiences and nuances in perceptions. Considering that an objective of this study is to provide an in -depth explanation and description of a behaviour/choice, it is imperative to use a qualitative method (Sil verman, 2005). The use of a qualitative methodology provide s a thorough understanding of the relationships between the use of TM and various factors such as, perceived efficacy, availability and access, income, among other demographic factors. Conversely, qualitative methodologies provide a component to health research that quantitative studies fail to grasp. This component of research is known as phenomenologism. Phenomenologism is the notion that any individual in the study is important to understanding t he topic as they provide a unique perspective (Wilkinson, Bouma, & Carland, 2019), and this is principal to this thesis. Qualitative research embraces the detailed interpretations and accounts of the study participants to provide diverse explanations behin d the topic at hand. Ultimately, qualitative methodologies provide rich descriptions and illustrations of topics that are being investigated, which can often be overlooked by other research approaches. 40 3.3 In-depth Interviews The specific qualitative research technique utilized in this thesis was in -depth interviews. Although findings from in-depth interviews are not intended to be generali zed, the technique serve s as a valuable method of describing meaningful personal insights of respondents, which can sometimes represent the larger population (Hardon et al, 2004). Substantial research highlights the many benefits of in-depth interviews . For instance, this qualitative technique allows for symbolic interactionalism, which is the understanding of the beliefs that individuals have developed for others or objects through interactions and experiences (Van den Hoonaard, 2014). With respect to this study, the use of TM is a phenomenon that individuals have given meaning to through inte raction, and this meaning is principal to its use. Through the utilization of in-depth interviews, I can derive \"this meaning \" and the shared understanding of the experiences that influence the use of TM among elderly individuals. On the other hand , the cooperative nature of interviews allows participants to contest questions and responses, and can prevent inaccurate and premature conclusions from being formed (Dunn, 2016). Qualitative techniques allow researchers to avoid making assumptions based on broad patterns that are often displayed by many quantitative methods . In-depth interviews give an opportunity to ask respondents questions in which they have open -ended and detailed responses. This technique allows for a wide variety of possible outcomes versus the limited responses a person would be restricted to give in a survey (Wilkinson, Bouma, & Carland, 2019). Nonetheless , qualitative research is very time consuming, and is often demonstrated by having small sample sizes. Fortunately, this small sample size issue can 41 be overcome once theoretical saturation occurs . Theoretical saturation occurs when responses start to become repetitive (Van den Hoonaard, 2014). 3.4 Recruitment Process Participants of this study were recruited with the assistance of an experienced translator . Steps were taken to incorporate extensive variability within respondents by recruiting from various urban and rural communities in the Upper West Region. In total, there were eight different communities where the interviews were conducted . These communities include d: Kparisaga, Pi'isi, Sagu, Jang, Nakor, Navogluu, Charolie, and Wa Municipal. The purpose of examining the many communities was to ensure that examples of both urban and rural communities could be provi ded to better understand the contributing factors that facilitate the relationship between geography and TM use. An important inclusion criteri on in this study was that participants ' age had to be 60 years or older because the goal was to analyze the elder ly population. All recruited participants were defined as elderly residents of the Upper West Region of Ghana . The recruitment process would begin with the translator initiating contact s with liaisons within the community of interest for potential particip ants. The liaisons ensured that appropriate community entry protocols were followed , since they were members of the communities from which participants were recruited. Individuals that were willing to participate were provided a time and day for which the interview would take place. As per university guidelines, a ll interviews were conducted at the respondent's residence to ensure there 42 was no inconvenience or travel restrictions for the participants. Often, th e liaisons would prepare a fe w elderly individuals that were willing to part -take in this study per community . Once potential participants agreed to take part in the interview, they would be met by the translator and myself (and at times the liaison ) for the formal discussion . In total, 17 interviews met our criterion and were included in the study with participant consent. Although this project employed the use of an experienced translator, there are a few reasons for which I utilized the help of the liaisons . As mentioned above, it is important to follow appropriate community entry protocols. Secondly, at times it was difficult to enter a community and find individuals to interview; thus, participants were prepared in advance by the liaison . The translator also raised the point that the interview process can get chaotic at times, particularly when an outsider to the community, who does not share a similar race, enters. Many people within the community can crowd around during the interview , which can create an overwhelming environme nt and make the interview difficult to conduct. Thus, to avoid crowding , the liaisons would organize a given time and interview location to ensure that there was a smooth interaction . 3.5 Data Collection Data collection took place during the summer of 2019 . The first interview was conducted on July 22nd and concluded on August 2nd. Between this period, a total of 17 interviews were collected with an average interview duration of 29 minutes and 28 43 seconds . Prior to the commencement of the interview proce ss, consent was obtained from all participants verbally , and tape-recorded. Specifically, the translator would inform the participant of who we were, the institution funding the project, the interview process itself, an estimated time of completion, and finally would seek consent to participate and be tape recorded. This conversation also served as brief introduction and an opportunity to establish quick rapport between the respondents, the interviewer, and the translator. Moreover, this introduction serv ed as a demonstration of the research process being a relaxed conversation. Subsequent to this , respondents were told of their rights as participant s and ensured full anonymity, the right to refuse answering any questions they did not feel comfortable with , and the right to withdraw from the project/interview at any given time. These interviews were documented in the form of audio files using a Sony tape recorder , as well the recording app Voice Memo on a Macintosh laptop . Questions for the interview were a sked by the researcher with the help of the trained translator. Questions would be proposed using a predetermined in -depth interview guide (Appendix A) to the translator, who would facilitate the conversation between both parties. Participants were asked q uestions regarding their general knowledge of TM, underlying health conditions, physical and mental health, and other questions found in Appendix A. The interview guide was clarified and understood by the translator prior to the first interview to ensure t hat he was accurately reproducing the questions. Ensuring that the translator was familiar with the questions allow ed him to efficiently address inquiries or misunderstandings of questions and ultimately make the interview process more polished. Participants' responses were translated while simultaneously jotting field notes . These 44 separately recorded field notes consisted of interesting findings and/or differences in general trends . Once data was collected, it was stored on a separate drive for s afekeeping with the researcher . The interviews were later transcribed into written responses verbatim from the audio files so that they could be analyzed . All recordings, translated responses, and field notes were placed into a secure, password protected f ile. 3.6 Data Analysis Process Once the interviews were completed, they were transcribed into a Word Document (n=17) verbatim of the translations. In the case of handwritten notes, they were also transcribed into Word Documents. No names or other personally identifying characteristics were noted (apart from their age, community, and gender) during this process, rather participants were identified according to the order of their interview ( i.e., interviewee 3 was classified as par ticipant 3). Once transcriptions were complete d, all data was imported into NVivo12 for thematic analysis. Since t his study utilized a case study approach to examine the use of TM and the factors associated with this use , it took a more exploratory in natu re, rather than confirmatory (Hancock & Algozzine, 2006) . Based on this, the responses w ere typically rich in descriptions to illustrate key aspects behind TM use . When investigating the responses, this study approach was taken into consideration. In doing so, the organization of the codes w as based on the themes and trends that emerged from the interviews as organically as possible , rather than having predisposed themes and organizing the results to match those predisposed themes. This 45 technique is known as open -coding. The open -coding method involves taking notes on ideas and themes as they emerge and are compiled after the fact, rather than organizing themes into predisposed categories (Crang, 2005) . With the utilization of this method , I can avoi d generalizing the results, and ensure that themes emerge naturally. The particular method in which th e data analysis was conducted consisted of a few steps. First, each interview was carefully examined, and notes were taken on the responses of this study's participants. Initial themes that emerged were noted on a separate document which later served as the nodes in NVivo. Nodes in this case served as a tool for which I used to document similar information to ease the observation of themes that emerge d from the study. Further, these nodes facilitate d the generation of ideas and implications behind our responses. The second step of the analysis was the careful re - examination of the transcriptions to ensure that the recorded themes were the only ones that emerged. Once I was confident that these themes were accurately noted and nothing was overlooked, they were created as nodes in NVivo. The next step was similar to the first two steps , this consisted of coding these themes into more refined themes based on prominence . Moreover, a careful re -exami nation of all nodes was conducted to ensure that they were coded appropriately without any bias. Studies have depicted that during the analysis of qualitative research, researchers can place an emphasis on the fre quency of results, and this can result in misleading findings (Sandelowski, 2001) . Therefore, this was always kept in mind and the analysis was based on patterns of similarit ies or differences of responses as much as possible. The final step consisted of re -reading the transcriptions to ensure that no themes were missed, nor forced during the analysis. 46 Interviews were not coded in their entirety, rather, only perceived trends were coded into \"nodes\". Upon complet ion of the thematic analysis, a total of 37 nodes were categorized. Of these 37 nodes, they were grouped into 4 main categories (consisting of various sub -categories) based on general trends and themes organically formed by participant s' responses. These general trends and themes form ed the results, and ultimately shape d the findings. Based on an analysis and contextualization of these findings, broad generalizations are attributed to the theoretical framework to examine how the finding s of this research compare to those of other literature. 3.7 Research er positionality It is imperative to note the role of positionality , as it is central to any research. Prior to conducting this research as a master's student, I was a Political Science and Psychology major. My interests as a student have been rooted in understanding the motivations behind individuals' behaviors and how society, its rules, and formation facilitate these behaviors. These interests can be exemplified within this research itself, particularly my fascination with understanding the psychosocial aspect of medicinal use. This can be further exemplified by the theoretical framework selected for this study as it focuses largely on the psychologic al, socioeconomic, and demographic factors associated with health care decisions. Moreover, during the interview process, I was subconsciously building connections behind these psychosocial factors and participants responses in anticipation of possible relationships between these variables. However, this can be 47 problematic as it can create a potential bias in the analysis component of the researc h. Therefore, I was consciously aware of not making any generalizations of the results and analyzing the data with an open mind independent of previous experiences . As a Canadian -born South -Asian collecting data in a foreign country, this experience was v ery unique to say the least. In fact, one of the first words I learned throughout my stay in Ghana was \"Nunsala\", which meant \"white guy or outsider\" in the local language. Prior to conducting these interviews, I knew that as an outsider with no ethnic tie s would face immense difficulties developing rapport with the study participants. Thus, I was always as polite and appreciative of these individuals, their land, and their opinions to develop a respectful relationship. Apart from this, t he significance of this term is that when \"Nunsalas\" come to these communities, they are often from a non-government organization (NGO) or foreign aid; thus, these participants may have had some sort of false association between myself and these groups. This false associatio n is significant because these groups often enter these communities with the motive to provide financial /resource aid. Consequently, individuals may have anticipated possible aid and altered responses to seem more appropriate of receiving said aid. Unfortu nately, this is something that was inevitable and difficult to control since the data was collected by m yself as the principal investigator and may be a limitation of this study. Likewise, being a ethnic minority in the country meant that I was constantly perceived as an outsider and treated differently. While majority of individuals were curious and intrigued by my unique appearance, background, and experiences, some were not as friendly. For example, upon arrival to Ghana I was stopped twice on my way out of 48 the airport for \"random\" bag checking while all others simply exited . Similarly, I was stopped several times by police checkpoints and questioned repeatedly. Upon departure, I was also stopped and asked to step a side to provide documentation while others effortlessly checked -in. In addition to the constant looks, instances such as these reflect the social profiling issues that minorities tend to feel everywhere. Although this did not directly impact my research in any way, at times it was a bit overwhelming. I believe it is important to highlight these occurrences as they add to the overall research experience. Putting these few negative experiences aside , my overall visit to Ghana as a Canadian university student was very pleasant . Apart from this, being a child of Indian immigrant parents, I was previously aware of various TM remedies and had personal experience with their efficacy and use. These experiences allowed me to understand the importance that these TM ha d in curing ailments and their symptoms , but also their significance in maintaining culture and identity. 3.8 Conclusion The purpose of this chapter was to outline the methodological components of this research study. The first portion of the chapter underlined the significance of using a qualitative methodology; specifically, the use of in-depth interviews as a form of primary research. The chapter then detailed the participant selection process, followed by the data collection procedure. This portion of the chapter also described the participant confidentiality and consent process. Next, this chapter explained the data analysis process 49 and its associated coding techniques. Chapter 3 concludes with an analysis of the researcher positionality and its impact on the study. 50 Chapter 4 : Results 4.1 Introduction This chapter presents the results of the 17 in -depth interviews conducted with elderly participants in the Upper West region of Ghana . The main objective of this dissertation is to explore the use of TM in Ghana. This involv es explaining factors that influence the choice of TM as a source of cure, providing insight into the changing dynamics of TM use in contemporary times, and presenting the future direction of this form of health care in Ghana. In order to achieve these objectives, the study was anchored in two interrelated research questions: 1. What factors drive the use of TM among elderly individuals in Ghana ; and 2. Is there a shift in the prevalence of TM u se, and i f so, what are the factors that may be responsible for it ? This chapter is structured along key thematic areas that emerged from the data analysis. The chapter begins by presenting the characteristics of the study participants are presented . The second section discusse s how TM forms part of the socio -cultural fabric of northern Ghana, and therefore, is readily available. The third section highlights how socio -culturally constructed belief systems shape people's conceptualization of health and prom oted TM as being more efficacious than WM. The fourth section highlight s the modifying effect of culture, religion, education, gender, geographical variation, and 51 socio -economic status in the choice of TM over WM in the Upper -West region of Ghana. The last thematic area in the chapter provide s evidence of the changing cultures in contemporary times and the shift towards the use of WM. 4.2 Characteristics of study participants As indicated in the Chapter 3 (methodology) , the study involved a representative of community leaders and ordinary community members in 17 in -depth interviews. The characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 4.1 . As previously stated , these 17 interviews were conducted in variou s districts of the Upper -West Region of Ghana. These various interview locations are displayed in Figure 4.1 . Table 4. 1. Study Participant Characteristics. N=17, Men = 9, Female = 8, Avg time: 29:28.

(2014). 4.3 Availability of traditional medicine as a socio -cultural commodity An influential factor in one's likelihood of seeking and administering medical care is their perception of effectivenes s, and the acceptable associated costs and benefits. While respondents may identify many benefits in utilizing both TM and WM, they are often confronted with huge costs associated with accessing these services. Health care costs are a significant barrier to healthcare utilization for most poor individuals; however, costs can be offset by their expected benefits. Ma ny respondents indicated that their choice of seeking TM for their own health care needs, as well as that of others (e.g. 53 family members) was based on the convenience of accessing TM , often for free. This position was clearly articulated in various intervi ews. \"One of the advantages is that you don't need to buy it (TM), you know where it is and you can easily get it for yourself and don't have to buy it.\" (Male, Sagu) \"[...] she doesn't think there are any problems associated with TM. Not hard getting it, people are using it and they are getting better.\" (Female, Jang) \"[...] he says it is helpful (TM), but if he had money, he would have tried the hospital, but the TM is what is available to him.\" (Male, Charolie) Nonetheless, others also indicated that TM i s expensive in some circumstances . Particularly , TM is deemed expensive if one is to seek what is considered \"professional help\". Profession al care often involves consultation (diagnosis) and the process of medication , which comes with purchasing items and animal(s) (e.g. fowls, goats, sheep) for sacrificial purposes. \"[...] some people that specialize in TM, who may try to do consultations before they treat you, those that are specialized and try to do consultations they demand money and animals for sacrifice, that makes it quite expensive.\" (Male, Charolie) \"Contrary to what people believe it is not very cheap, especially if you have to go to people that practice it, they will charge you money or tell you bring a goat or owl.\" (Male, Kparisaga) Unlike WM doctors , TM doctors are more flexible with the payments for cost of care, particularly those relat ed to consultation. T M doctors allow individuals with insufficient funds to pay for the cost of service (s) over a period o f time. With respect to the perception of efficacy and benefits of the two forms of health care, TM was widely considered the first choice of treatment for common ailments . Some 54 participants frequently mentioned common ailments included headaches and abdo minal pain. Participants of the study even went as far to conclude that TM ha d no challenges or disadvantages. \"For mostly fever, stomach -aches and diarrhea and basically roots of different trees and plants as well as their leaves that they are boiled for these things [various forms of TM]\" (Male, Sagu) Two male individuals from Charolie mentioned... \"He is saying that when we look at the TM there are not disadvantages, most of them are very common... \" (Male, Charolie) \"He says there are no challenges for TM, he says if you look at it, there is no clinic here and that is one thing wrong with WM. \" (Male, Charolie) As stated above, TM has many advantages (e.g. readily available). In contrast, there are a lso some limitations associated with its use , despite the few individuals stating other wise. A widely mentioned barrier include s the necessity of having a profound understanding and knowledge of TM in order to safely use this form of care. Many individuals incorrectly create TM by easily generaliz ing herbs and leaves , thereby leading to poisoning. Moreover, an individual also mentioned that there are many taboos associated with the use of TM , which may result in further complications if taken incorrectly. This result may be related back to the previous chapters that discuss the holistic component of TM. \" One main problem, sometimes some of the herbs and plants look alike but not the same, others might be poisonous and not for use and if the person does not know they can sometimes make a mistake and combine the wrong ones and get a 55 negative side effect an d get more sick. In using it one must know the particular herb.\" (Female, Pi'isi) \"Mostly the problems for TM for her is that sometimes there are taboos and certain kinds of treatments that you cannot mix with. For example, if you break some of these taboo s there are consequences and you will not get better, if you do get well you are going to get sick again.\" (Female, Sagu) Although availability is a key advantage of TM, many respondents indicated that this was not the case for WM. Participants stated difficulties in obtaining WM due to lack of local availability . Moreover, the disadvantage of WM most commonly pointed out by the participants was the immense cost s of WM , which limited their use. Affording WM is very difficult without any health insurance. Other commonly mentioned issues include costs associated with travelling and difficulty finding correct medication without prescriptions. A few individuals mentioned that WM doctors occasionally prescribe medication that is only available in major cities , making it difficult to access these medications due to travel -related barriers . \"First thing is that the cost, a lot of people are poor, second is distance, from here to Wa, Wa is the biggest town so if you are going to get there you can't walk so you need money to get there. Sometimes too he says the prescription is not in the hospital and they tell you to go and get and you can't find.\" (Male, Nayogluu) \"Mostly she is saying that she knows that number one that if you are sick you have to tell the over the counter person what is wrong with you and they have to see what he or she will give you the medicine. Assuming you get the wrong drug, now you will have been more sick and go to the hospital. She also says that if you go to the hospital, they prescribe yo u medicine, and you cannot afford or even find the hospital. Sometimes they will tell you to go to Wa or Tamale to find the medicine and they won't even have it there.\" (Female, Sagu) 56 4.4 Health perception and health seeking behaviour Apart from perceived disease severity , and knowledge of TM's benefits and challenges , there are supplementary determinants of TM use . As suggested by Rosenstock (1974), disease severity , as well as perception of cost and benefits are important but not key determinan ts of trigger ing health seeking behaviours. Rather, health seeking behaviours are initiated by internal and external triggers. These two groups of factors were revealed in the discussion of TM practice and its utilization . Internal triggers relate to the p sychological and physical state of an individual ; whereas , external triggers are situated in the broader socio -cultural landscapes . Specifically, external triggers includ e the community's cultural practices, interpersonal interactions, social networks, and the media landscape. The ensuing sub -sections present further analysis of internal and external triggers driving the use of TM in the northern part of Ghana. 4.4.1 Internal triggers The most prominent internal trigger mentioned in the inte rviews with respect to the use of TM was the individuals' reaction s to symptoms of illnesses. Illnesses with more visible and known symptoms tend to contribute to similar response s of health seeking behaviour. This position is illustrated in the words of a few respondent s: \"For things like common cold or flu, you have mostly you feel itches on your ear, you are tempted to put your fingers in your ears, there are trees where the leaves are picked, they pick them and grind the leaves fresh, don't dry it. This can also cure so many other infections, you grind it and get some juice out of it and you apply it to the itchy areas.\" (Female, Sagu) 57 \"When the hernia comes out, if it is out the only way is through operation, the only way is WM. If it is not out you can use TM, but if it is out you have to use WM at that stage.\" (Male, Kpar isaga) Another respondent from Navogluu share d... \"So they use it to cure fever, headache, and general body aches. If you have fever you go around and get some roots and leaves from different trees, there are different leaves you combine from roots from a different tree and these are boiled. Then you put some down to cool so you can drink it and you bath the rest.\" (Male, Navogluu) The physical symptom of hernia which appear s as a lump on the body , trigger s individuals to seek healthcare in formal health facilities. Pain, fatigue, and other debilitating non -physical symptoms trigger the use of TM as the first line of care. The interviews also revealed that unorthodox sickness or complicated feeling s of poor health is interpreted as illness with spiritual dimension s, which often prompt s the use of TM. An individual's assessment of the need for a spiritual cure is connected with the c oncept of spirituality within the broader socio -cultural context. This interconnectedness between the broader context (external triggers) and the individual (internal triggers ) with respect to TM is explained in the response below : \"WM is also good, but we go to the TM doctor with sicknesses meant for TM, spiritual sicknesses. You know WM can't cure some sicknesses because their spiritual aspects have to be cured first before the other aspects can heal. Even the TM doctor is able to diagnose and identify sicknesses that are not spiritual in nature and should be handled by WM.\" (Male, Nakor) \"[...] traditionally it is believed especially in these parts if two people that are lovers are having sex if any person coughs in the process, it means that technically the other person, if a man coughs for example during the process of sexual intercourse it is a taboo to cough, it means you have infected the other person. Traditionally you will go around taking TM, but until you find out the other 58 person coughed during i ntercourse the cough will not top. She mentioned that there was a time that her brother had this issue. What normally happens is that the one who coughs gives the other person. Originally, they thought her brother had tuberculosis, dry cough or issues rela ted to it but until you find out it was because of the person coughing during sex. Her brother confessed that at a point he was having intercourse and the women was coughing. Essentially when it happened and they did all the treatments for what they though t was tuberculosis, dry cough, or chronic cough someone suggested that since normally in these areas when you are treating them they should not last so long, then the brother confessed. In his family there are a lot people who specialized in TM, so someone advised her brother to contact the girl's parents and it was then they found out and gave this charcoal like medicine from roots to apply.\" (Female, Sagu) As shown in the statement above , initiating TM treatment could be an individual decision ; however, the concept of sickness, and the classification of some sicknesses as having spiritual dimensions are influenced by the external socio -cultural environment. 4.4.2 External triggers The interviews also revealed the influence of community members, family and friend networks, and TM doctors in regard to TM use. The network of social influence and conformity is a crucial part of the culture and traditions of communities. A respondent highlight ed how information on T M use transcends generations along with their cultural values. Interpersonal interactions between family members seemed to be the most common form of external influence on the choice of TM over WM. \"With this medicine (TM) as we know it, it is mostly pass ed down from generation to generation. Whatever information that you are told by people before you, you don't change it or add to it, you also pass the information about our ways of healing to the younger ones to help them.\" (Female, Sagu) 59 \"Yes, sometimes people will say that you are wasting your time... some people said he was wasting his time, but he still went [referring to hi m going to the TM doctor ] (Male, Kparisaga) Family members are often responsible for assisting with TM access and are a major influ ence on the decision -making process of when and how to access TM. For many elderly individuals, younger family members decide if or when to access TM. This is because younger family members are often more economically resourceful, and can therefore support their elder relatives by supplementing health care costs . Thus, although elderly individuals may be more informed about where and how to access TM, younger family members often act as the final decision makers . Other respondents reported social pressure s from community members to use certain forms of medication , and feared scrutiny by community members for unpopular medical choices. \"Generally, a lot of people use TM. People would say similar things about TM as her. Some people even know m ore. She is saying that TM or our medicine has always been with us, people have been using it to cure colds, or not imagined or developing, it is developed.\" (Female, Sagu) \"The children are concerned and have asked me to stop taking the herbs that I boil\" (Female, Pi'isi) In addition, the study revealed the role of weather, a factor in disease profile, in triggering the utilization of TM. For instance, some respondents observed increasing trends of TM use during the rainy season s because of increas ed mosquitoes bites result ing in higher rates of malaria, and therefore the use of TM as a cure. \"[...] because of the rainy season we have a lot of mosquitoes and malaria\". (Male, Charolie) 60 \"[...] when it rains and she is in the rain, she is itching a lot and this causes her worry\" (Female, Charolie). 4.5 The modifying factors in use of traditional medicine This portion of the results examine s other modifying factors that have or may have influen ced the participants' choice of medical care. These modifying factors include psychosocial/cultural factors, SES, and demographic variables. The most frequently mentioned modifying factor amongst the studied population was the influence of others in their decision -making process. Community members, as well as family and friends , were all influential in the decision to seek or administer medical care. Specifically , it was the cultural and psychosocial influence that indirectly pressured these individuals to seek or administer medical care, specifically TM (as mentioned in the section 4.4.2. ). During the interviews, m any individuals when speaking of TM referred to it as \"their medicine\" or \"our medicine\" . They also mention ed that TM was passed down to them from many past generations and will continue to be passed on to future generations. \"She is saying that TM or \"our medicine\" has always been with us, people have been using it to cure colds, or not ima gined or developing, it is developed...she is saying that with this medicine as we know it mostly it is passed down from generation to generation, from whatever info that you are told by others older than you. You don't change it or add to it...\" (Female, Sagu ) \"If we look at our grandparents and their grandparents, they didn't even know what WM was, they just used to treat themselves and most people lived longer. So, it is from their experience that knowledge has been passed down, it is good, that is why.\" (Ma le, Kparisaga) 61 \"Many people use these herbs because they believe it is god that has shown them these herbs, her mother had trained her and has been pasted on from generations\" (Female, Pi'isi) 4.5.1 Gender Perspectives Primarily , most perspectives on traditional and western medicine efficacy, prevalence, and challenges were similar amongst both m ale and female participants. However, th ere were a few exceptions. Male participants largely focused on financial barriers compared to female participants during the interviews. Specifically, they mentioned that what limited their use of both WM and TM were the costs . This limitation was less likely to be mention ed by women , and those women that did mention cost as being a barrier , indicate d that if they are sick, they will pay the required costs. For instance: \"The cost does not matter if you are sick, whether it is TM or WM, you will look for the money to get well. You will ask a relative.\" (Female, Jang) Moreover, while male participants alluded at costs playing an influential role in their decision to use TM, a female participant stated, \"even if WM was free, she would still prefer TM as her first choice of care \". This ultimately signifies that the choice of TM for women may be beyond that of financial barriers. \"She will prefer the TM first. She says that there are instances where the children are sick, and they take them to the hospital, and they give the treatment and they give the medicine and once the dosage is over the child is still sick. But when she tries the TM it works better, so she mostly prefers to use the TM.\" (Female, Nakor) 62 An examination of gender differences among the participants also reveal ed that women tend to have a personal, emotional, and cultural attachment to TM. For instance, a woman mentioned that TM is \"our medicine\" . She further explaine d that \"those individuals that don't use TM are ignorant \". Additionally, when a female participant was asked to explain her reasoning b ehind her TM use, she mentioned that \"it is god who has shown them this medicine\". Although male participants did mention their connection with TM , as it has been passed down through many generations, they did not express any personal attachments as the wo men did . Below are detailed encounters with the women mentioned above: \"She feels that people that say they don't believe in TM are ignorant, if you tell her you don't believe in it she would give you testimonies... she is saying that TM or our medicine h as always been with us.\" (Female, Sagu) \"Many people use these herbs because they believe it is god that has shown them these herbs, her mother had trained her and has been pasted on from generations\" (Female, Pi'isi) 4.5.2. Geographical comparison of urban vs rural area perceptions A further examination of community perspectives revealed a few interesting differences between this study's rural and urban communities . For the purpose of this study, the participants have been divided into two categories, (1) those that belong to urban communities, and (2) those that belong to rural communities. The characteristics of these individuals are categorized in the table below (Table 4.2.) . As can be seen from the table, the total number of individuals from urban areas (n=5) is significantly less than 63 those from rural areas (n=12). Thus, this substantial difference in sample size should be considered when taking these variances into account. Despite the sample size discrepancy , there are still some striking differ ences in particular perceptions of TM and WM. Table 4.2. Details on Study Participants' Demographic Characteristics . This table displays the participants' community characteristics (rural or urban), and the number of participants within the specified community. Rural participants (n=12), Urban participants (n=5) Community Name Rural Urban Total Number of participants per/ community Kparisaga X 1 Pi'isi X 1 Sagu X 3 Jang X 1 Nakor X 4 Navogluu X 1 Charolie X 5 Wa Municipal X 1 Results of these interviews indicate that participants from rural communities largely prefer local TM over WM , in comparison to those from urban communities. Specifically, majority of the participants from rural areas made some explicit remark s of their preference for TM over WM . On the contrary , a single respondent from urban areas mention ed such a thing. Respondents from these rural communities state d: 64 \"[...] they [people in the community] prefer the local medicine in comparison to WM... some people who fall very ill don't prefer to go to the hospital, everyone uses TM, can't think of one person who does not like it .\" (Male, Kparisaga) \"I asked if it was still free would she still try the tm, she said yes. They have to rely on it be cause it is cheaper, all the trees are around, you just look for them and use it. Also, the hospital is far.\" (Female, Nakor) Similarly, when a female from Charolie was asked if she would still use TM if WM and the hospital was free, she responded... \"Onl y go to the hospital if they don't get well from the TM\" (Female, Charolie) Likewise , participants from rural communities mentioned facing difficulties in accessing WM (such as distance), whereas no participants from urban communities mentioned this limita tion of their WM use. Rather, one participant from Wa Municpal (an urban municipality) stated that accessing some TM is difficult : \"[...] she doesn't know their names, but they are always bitter [referring to TM used to cure CD], they use those for the pe rson to drink to heal the person... she says very difficult to get it.\" (Female, Wa Municipal} An urban community participant also mentioned a decline of TM use in the community due to the increase d availability of WM, particularly hospitals in the area. This was something that no rural community participants had stated. \"He says overall that many people in the village don't use tm, he said because of late there have been many hospitals around that people go to.\" (Male, Sagu) Individuals from Charolie, a rural community on the other hand mentioned the opposite... 65 \"Within this community there is no clinic here.\" (Male, Charolie) \"So, one of the issues with WM is that there are no hospitals here.\" ( Female, Charolie) Interestingly, results from the interviews indicate unique variations in the perceptions of TM efficacy based on geographical differences. Irrespective of the sample size differences, both groups of individuals had similar accounts of participants ' perception of TM efficacy, specifically for CD. If both groups had a similar sample size, the perceived efficacy of TM, at least in terms of curing CD may substantially vary in terms of frequency . Although this study does not directly accoun t for frequencies as it is qualitative in nature , regardless , this finding is important to highlight. As mentioned previously, the i nfluence of interpersonal relationships is evident in i nfluencing medicinal use, given that increases in the perception of T M efficacy in the community can in crease its use . Particularly, i ncreases in the perception of TM efficacy will impact the use of TM through the influence of interpersonal relationships and the pressures to comply to socially accepted behaviours. Participants living in urban areas who have increased access to WM perceived TM as more effective than those in urban communities. This finding was unexpected because one would believe that those with increased access to WM and decreased access to TM would question the efficacy of TM. In contrast , individuals from rural communities stated that TM had limitations in curing complex illnesses , such as CD . For instance, a rural communit y participant mentioned: \"So I gave examples of CD, I mentioned diabetes, hyp ertension, and tuberculosis. He said that these kinds of diseases you cannot use tm to cure cd, even though he does TM himself, even his relative used to chronic cough and vomit blood, they sent them to Jarapa hospital, and it was there that they were d iagnosed with 66 tuberculosis. He would not try to cure CD with TM. Blood pressure or hypertension are lifestyle issues, these come from things that we eat. If you come to him and he detects that it is a CD, he will tell you to go to the hospital.\" (Male, Nakor) 4.6 Changing culture and a shift towards western medicine Majority of respondents indicated that their first choice of medical care is TM, which is often applied in illnesses of varying severity. However, the manner in which respondents switch from TM to WM is interesting. A thematic trend observed in the responses suggests diverse perceptions of illness severity. These perceptions influence the use of TM or WM. For instance, although individuals often use TM, they usually switch to WM if the il lness or disease persists , or when the severity is adjudged to increase. A response from a participant in Charolie provides an explanation to the dynamics of disease severity and multiple use of traditional and western medicines. \"In time of poor health, w e first use TM. We only go to hospital if we don't get well after using the TM\" (Female, Charolie). Another similar instance presented by an elderly woman in Pi'isi. \"She has used WM before, for instance she has undergone surgical operation. Initiall y she was using tm but wasn't getting better and decided to use WM and that was when she got surgery and found out she was poisoned\" (Female, Pi'isi). A male respondent in Navogluu also mention ed: \"He says if it is at the early stages then yes, there a re some roots that are very very bitter, if you start tsking that one it will go back, but if it comes out you will have to go for surgical operation, it has gone beyond their knowledge\" (Male Navogluu). 67 Nonetheless, some of the respondents indicated t hat they revert to the use of TM when WM is proven ineffective, which happens for most CD cases and other forms of illnesses that are difficult to diagnose in primary health care - the first point of call in WM. Additionally, some respondents combine both TM and WM with the hope of alleviating the severity of their illnesses and increasing their odds of getting better from one of the medications. \"So, regarding why people use TM, ... when we try WM we don't get well, but when we try TM we get well with WM, it is good for some people and not so good for others, some people may go (to the hospital) for anything but if it does not work they turn to TM\". (Fe male, Pi'isi) The interviews revealed that perception of disease severity is an important consideration in the use of TM and WM. Respondents explore the use of alternative medicines when the efficacy of the first source of medicine is assessed against th e prevailing perceived disease severity. For instance, while some individuals who start with one form of TM and move on to explore another form of TM, others completely shift to WM when the first use of TM is assessed as ineffective at reducing the severit y of the disease. Similarly, the degree to which individuals perceive illness severity varies markedly among respondents. For example, while one individual suggested going to the hospital for anything apart from a headache, another respondent only utilized the hospital when the perceived risk of the condition was high and life -threatening ( i.e., being bitten by a venomous snake). Interestingly, the latter participant indicated that they still prefer the use of TM over WM for life -threatening conditions. 68 Notably, providers of TM commonly resort to WM when they assess that the severity of their health condition is life threatening. For instance, TM providers for ailments such as headaches and abdominal pain resort to WM when they are bitten by a snake. One of the providers explained why they seek healthcare beyond TM under certain conditions. Particularly, the respondent was asked why they did not try using any TM, despite being a TM doctor, prior to going to the hospital when she was bit by a snake and experi enced vomiting: \"[...] she was bitten by a snake, initially she did not know it was a snake bite, she thought it was a bush that cut her she just wiped the blood. She even forgot about it till she fell ill, and they took her to hospital. She was vomiting and not feeling well, she did not try any TM.\" (Female, Pi'isi) There are a few likely explanations for the switch to WM for aforementioned TM doctor. First, she may not have had the sufficient energy needed to prepare and process local herbs and leaves to make the TM. Second, the TM doctor may have realized that the symptoms of the illness were too severe for TM to resolve and therefore, decided to obtain WM treatment. The second possibility is consistent with many other responses, which suggest s that WM is utilized when disease symptoms are perceived as too critical for the on -going or first -hand use of TM. Moreover, majority of respondents (including another TM doctor) indicated that illnesses such as CD(s) a re widely managed using WM because of the perceived high degree of severity and associated complexity. However, responses indicate that some respondents perceive CD as curable by TM, and many individuals seek this form of 69 medication first. Below are responses from three interviews that aptly capture opposing perceptions on TM and WM efficacy in treating CDs . \"He said it cannot cure [TM] , has never heard of anyone using herbs to cure CD.\" (Male, Charolie) \"He said that these kinds of diseases you c annot use TM to cure CD, even though he does TM himself (local TM doctor), even his relative used to chronic cough and vomit blood, they sent them to Jarapa hospital and it was there that they were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He would not try to cure CD w ith TM. Blood pressure or hypertension are lifestyle issues, these come from things that we eat. If you come to him and he detects that it is a CD, he will tell you to go to the hospital.\" (Male, Nakor) \"She says yes... When I mentioned liver or sclerosis, she says that they have some herbs, she doesn't know their names, but they are always bitter, they use those for the person to drink to heal the person.\" (Female, Wa Municipal) On the other hand, religion was also portrayed as a persuasive factor in the participants ' decision -making process when seeking medical care. More specifically, Christians or individuals with Christian children were less likely to use TM. As mentioned earlier in the results section, the explanation whereby individuals avoid TM may b e due to the \"unethical\" practices. For instance, many consultations include sacrificial practices. To that end, some individuals prefer not to use TM themselves, or for others, and their children prevent ing them from doing so as well . \"He says that becaus e of education and some people that are Christians. When you look at TM, aside from the common ones, there are also others that involve the use of animals for sacrifice, for some that people that are educated, or Christians feel it is against their religio n. But for the general ones that are common that don't involve sacrifice people still use it, but believes that some people don't use it for these reasons. So it's not because it is bad, but because of education. He gave an example, assuming that you have your son and you are to pass that knowledge to your son about tm and these leaves and your son says he is Christian is not willing to listen then you die with this knowledge.\" (Male, Charolie) 70 \"The children are concerned and have asked her to stop taking t he herbs that she boils, but she has ignored them because she thinks it helps. The children say they are Christians and because of that they don't want her to take the TM.\" (Female, Pi'isi) 4.7 Conclusion of results The result s of this study reveal the varying perspectives of TM and WM use, efficacy, availability, and challenges among various other factors regarding their use. With the help of the HBM, we can conceptualize the multifactorial relationships that exist and their impact on TM use. Facto rs such as availability, health perception and health seeking behaviors interact with socio -cultural and demographic factors to influence the use of TM and other health care services. Results of this study indicate a possible cascading trend in the sole us e of TM, demonstrating that previous research elucidating that 80% of African population 's only source of health care is TM , may not be as accurate in a more recent Ghanaian context (\"Traditional healers broaden health care in Ghana \", 2019). Rather, partic ipants of this study illustrate the increased use of WM and allude to a possible shift away from TM. A thorough examination of these results and the possible underlying implications can provide an opportunity for health care officials to recognize the heal th care needs of Ghanaians , but also allow health care professionals to improve patient centered care. Consideration of these results can create many possible opportunities to improve LMIC s' healthcare systems. 71 Chapter 5 : Discussions and Conclusion 5.1 Introduction Research on TM to date fails to account for multiple factors that impact its use . Rather, broader literature on TM has been largely focused on examining specific factor(s) or conditions in relation to the use of TM (Boakye, Pietersen, Kotze, Dalton Pharr, & Bungam, 2012; & Schioldann et al., 2018) . For instance, the use of TM in the context of solely cancer patients (Yarney et al., 2013) . Moreover, research has largely failed to represent and recognize the elderly population of LMICs. Following these shortcomings of existing literature, the main objectives of this study were to examine the many factors that drive the continued use of TM among older persons in Ghana, and the shift in the paradigm of TM as the dominant form of health care. With that being said, t he purpose of th is chapter is to examine the possible implications behind the results and provide comparisons with the existing literature. Conceptualizing these findings organically within this study's framework demonstrates the possible implications behind our results . Further more , this chapter discusses the trends of TM use and the possible factors that influence the continued use of TM amongst the study cohort. This portion of the chapter also draws out the possible conclusion s in comparison to those of similar researc h, highlighting the similarities and novel findings . To add , the chapter 72 also discusses the shift in prevalence of TM use as the single form of medication, and the factors that are associated with this new trend. The final section of this chapter discusses the practical implications of this research and recommendations for future health care conversations in Ghanaian healthcare systems, and concludes by stating the limitations of this work . 5.2 Summarizing our findings The findin gs suggest that factors such as lifestyle compatibility, readily availableness of medicine , and efficacy all positively influence the on -going use of TM, yet a shift to WM may be imminent. The costs and barriers of each form of health care (WM or TM) , heavily influenced the use of the competing form of care. For example, the inability to afford WM costs increased the use of TM. As expected, the many perceived benefits of TM were a motivation of its continued use. C ommonly stated benefits of TM were its relatively low cost (often free), and its ability to account for cultural needs. However, widely mentioned limiting factors included issues of accidental poisoning and the use of animals for sacrificial purposes. Conversely , commonly stated benefits of WM included its rapid effectiveness and efficacy. Barriers of WM included its expensive cost and difficulty accessing local clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. It was also indicated that health perceptions impact the use of TM. Particularly, findings suggest that TM was more effective for common ailments with lower perceived severity . As perceived severity increased , a shift towards WM use was witnessed . Internal cues such as culture, and 73 external cues such as social pressures to conform, all positively influe nced the use of TM. Ultimately , the findings specify that with all things considered, we may be witnessing an increasing shift towards WM. This provides a novel perspective which has yet to be identified by o ther qualitative research, to our knowledge. However, the findings challenge the assumption that women are more likely to use TM over males , as indicated by previous literature (Yarney et al., 2013; & Gyasi, Mensah, & Siaw, 2015) . To our knowledge, various research has investigated the impact of gend er in relation to TM use, however, no qualitative research has focused on the factors that impact the use decision making process of using TM. Rather, much of the previous literature investigating the impact of gender has focused largely on frequencies of utilizing health care services (Ben -Arye et al., 2009; Shih et al., 2012) . Although this study does not directly measure the number of males vs . females using TM, due to the qualitative nature of this study, there were no substantial gender -based differenc es in TM use. Instead, I observed gender -based differences in the decision -making process of TM. For instance, men demonstrated more financial barriers to health care , particularly with WM, which often increased their preference for TM. In contrast, some women mentioned that were willing to bear the expenses of WM treatment if it were necessary . In addition, the results also indicate the influence of emotions and culture on the use of TM , predominantly among the female participants . This finding is in line with previous literature which has displayed women a s being more likely to take culture into account when making health care decisions (Shewamene, Dune, & Smith, 2020; & Baghramian & Ingram, 2000) . The avenue through which these women were taught TM, 74 emphasizes the importance of culture. For example, individuals are often taught by their parents and grandparents which emphasize s this lineage and highlight s the importance of African culture in their teachings. Findings suggest wome n are more likely to gravitate to these cultural teachings. Further, the findings suggest that this cultural importance may increase women's use of TM due to lifestyle compatibility , as WM lacks this holistic understanding . Alternatively, it may be the cas e that women are more open to sharing their emotions in research , as previous literature has depicted women as being more emotionally expressive in their research responses than men (Fischer & LaFrance, 2014; & Chaplin, 2015) . Another novel finding of this study was the variation of perception of TM efficacy between rural and urban community respondents . It is widely believed that factors such as increased education, wealth, and access to health care facilities for urban community members would suggest that they are less likely to use TM . Therefore, one would expect urban residents to have lower perceptions of efficacy for TM (Appiah, Amponsah, Poudyal, & Mensah, 2018) ; however , the findings do not demonstrate this. Urban community members, despite having increased access to WM and potentially more financial means, still found TM to be effective, especially for CD. These findings may speak to the inherent trust that the elderly population has in TM. 5.3 The cost -benefit analysis of health care options in Ghana Consistent with previous literature, the findings illustrate that the major benefits of TM further motivate its use. These benefits include its inexpensiveness, availability 75 and accessibilit y, and flexible payments of TM doctors (\"Traditional healers broaden health care in Ghana \", 2019; Shaikh & Hatcher, 2005; Sato, 2012). Similar to other literature, this study's findings also suggest that there is a relationship between the availability and accessibility o f TM and its use. Since TM is more widely available and easily accessible, individuals are more inclined to use TM. Peprah and colleagues (2020) indicate that the general lack of WM and difficulties in access ibility further promotes the use of TM . The lack of physicians to population (1:100,000) in the Upper West Region of Ghana is a clear representation of the lack of availability of WM (Krah, Kruijif, & Ragno, 2018). In contrast, TM doctors are easily available and accessible even in remote regions (1:200) (Krah, Kruijif, & Ragno, 2018). Given the influential role of accessibility and availability in the use of health care services, it may also explain the shift towards WM . Despite there being a limited number of WM doctors currently available in Ghana , it is becoming more widely available and accessible than ever before and may play a significant role in this shift . This study also suggests that in addition the low cost of TM , TM doctors permitting flexible payments is an influential factor in the use of TM (Kusuma & Babu, 2019) . Whereas WM practitioners and pharmacies d o not offer the same flexibility (Kusuma & Babu, 2019). Borrowing money for health care needs was a c onsiderable factor brought forward by the correspondents I interviewed. Thus, not only does the relatively higher cost of WM deter its use, but the lack of flexible payments options similar to TM doctors further limit its use among st this study's predominantly lower SES population. 76 It has long been established that individuals are more likely to delay seeking health care when they belong to lower SES groups , by the simple fact that they lack the financial means; therefore, cannot prioritize their health ( Ampofo et al., 2020). For instance, research on cervical cancer screening in Ghana observed that unemployed participants are significantly less likely to get cancer screening compared to those who are employed (Ampofo et al., 2020). Similarly, another study conducted in Ethiopia, a lso a LMIC in Arica, depicted that employed participants were four times as likely to get cancer screening compared to unemployed individuals (Teame et al., 2019). Referring back to the profile description of Wa, there are a significant sum of individuals within this region that are unemployed, and thus most likely belong to low SES groups. This may explain why many of the participants stated that their first form of care is TM because they were unable to afford the cost of WM. One's perception of health care barrie rs are a strong predictor of health seeking behavior (Obirikorang et al., 2018). Research has depicted that one's perceptions of associated costs of care are enough to prevent them from seeking the care (Obirikorang et al., 2018). P erceived barriers such a s cost of WM and its associated travel costs , coupled with the lack of availability and access may deter the use of WM seen in this study's population. Many responses from this study indicated that individual's choice of TM was based on their perception of barriers associated with WM use. These perceptions of costs were based on personal experiences or the influence of others and their experiences with WM. 77 This study found that a significant benefit of using TM is its perceived efficacy. The responses of t his study indicate that TM is effective , at least to some degree. Correspondents indicated that TM was most effective for common ailments such as headaches and abdominal pain , which was c onsistent with previous literature . For example , a study examining the variables responsible for the popularity of TM in Ghana found that avid users of TM believe d it was very effective and reliable, at times claiming that it ha d better results than WM (Sato, 2012). In addition, similar to perceived ba rriers of medicine, previous research also indicates that the positive perception of effectiveness can increase actual effectiveness and further promote medicinal use (Sato, 2012; Murphy, Rosenman, Yoder, & Friesner, 2011 ; & Obirikorang et al., 2018 ). Rese arch on TM use in Ghana shows that a majority of individuals using TM have high levels of satisfaction with its outcomes (Sato, 2012). This increase in actual effectiveness can be influenced by the positive perception that the participants display, and ult imately further promote the use of TM. Thus, high level of satisfaction coupled with perceived effectiveness , and the financial burden of WM can help explain the profound use of TM among this study's participants. Findings of this study strengthen the not ion that a barrier of TM is the extensive knowledge that is required for its safe use. Without extensive TM knowledge, it is easy to confuse remedies, resulting in negative side effects. Secran and Selahattin (2018) found that there are several risks assoc iated with the consumption of TM because many plants and herbs have similar characteristics, and accidental consumption of the wrong substance can result in multiple organ failure. Researchers Parveen and colleagues (2016) 78 argue that a significant limitati on of TM use is the accurate identification and incorporation of the correct plants and herbs used in the creation of the medicine. Another commonly reported barrier to TM use is difficulty accepting TM because of the common perception that traditional hea lers are \"informally educated\" Powell, & Hodnicki, 2006). Thus, individuals may have a hard time adhering to their medical care advice and prescriptions. However, this was not mentioned by participants of the study. Rather, findings suggest that individuals seemed to be more concerned about their own knowledge of TM. A possible explanation for this may be that a majority of the participants were more likely to seek these herbs and plants themselves, rather than be ing obtained from a TM doctor . Nevertheless, the se barriers and perceived challenges of TM may be dwindling the use of TM, and deviating individuals towards WM. Surprisingly, while the correspondents of this study profoundly mentioned the benefits of WM; it did come with concerns of cost and availability. The findings proffer that a motivator of WM is its rapid effectiveness. Specifically, despite its associated barriers, WM was often stated to be very effective for both common and chronic ailments. Simila r findings were confirmed by a study conducted in a South African community , in which many participants had the same positive perceptions of WM's efficacy (Peltzer, 2000). Th e study also found that WM was the initial preferred form of care, and that indivi duals only sought TM if WM did not treat their illnesses (Peltzer, 2000). This finding is in line with other research conducted in Ghana which indicate d that individuals may be more likely to seek WM because of its efficacy alone , rather than 79 other charact eristics such as WM having trained professionals who can provide both preventative care and educate individuals on possible side effects (Sato, 2012 ; & Tabuti, Dhillion, & Lye, 2003 ). Though my study had many participants that found WM to be effective, res ponses generally indicated that an individual's choice of care was based on factors aside from efficacy . For example, factors such as availability and access were more influential in the participant's choice of seeking care, and often result ed in the participant adhering to TM. The findings tend to be similar to other studies that suggest individuals prefer TM over WM , as it blends easily into the socio -cultural lifestyle of participants and is readily available (Sofowora, 1996; Luoga et al., 2000). However, my study found a relationship between disease severity and WM use. For instance, the more severe the disease, the more likely an individual was inclined to seek WM. In contrast, the use and perceived efficacy of TM declined with disease severity . Moreover, our correspondents acknowledged the rigorous scientific testing of WM and its efficacy. Irrespective of the benefits of WM mentioned above , the study found several challenges, thereby limiting its use. The findings suggest that financial barri ers are a profound challenge associated with the use of WM. This finding is consistent with existing literature both within and outside of the Ghanaian context , which posits that cost of care is one of the most significant factors of health care utilizatio n and adherence (Kretchy et al., 2014; Kusuma & Babu, 2019; Sato, 2012). Despite Ghana having a national health insurance scheme for its citizens, many elderly individuals still cannot afford WM. Individuals are still responsible for the payment of prescri ptions and over - the-counter medications, which is considered costly for a majority of the respondents 80 consider ed to be costly. Research indicates that people are more likely to delay treatment or cope with symptoms if they lack sufficient financial means (Kusuma & Babu, 2019). Consequently, the participants may be obligated to use TM and cope with illness symptoms before using WM, ultimately explaining why individuals may prefer TM as their first choice of medical care. Another commonly stated limitation of WM was its availability and accessibility. As previously stated, this study was conducted in the Upper West region of Ghana, w ith a majority of participants from rural areas outside of town. Contempt to the increase in hospitals in this region, I found that access to WM practitioners and WM itself still remain ed a major limitation . Other researchers have also indicated that indiv iduals living in rural regions of Ghana have increased difficulty accessing WM which ultimately limits its use (Shaikh & Hatcher, 2005; Sato, 2012). It is possible that the cost of travel to access WM can hinder its use (Sato, 2012) , which in fact is a lim itation mentioned by the respondents . Lastly, the results signified that WM fails to comprehend the holistic aspect of health and medicine, which is fundamental to TM. More specifically, the findings suggest that there are some spiritual components that cannot be justified, nor cured using WM. Other research on traditional and western medicine use in Ghana has found similar concerns of WM failing to recognize spiritual concerns, thus limit ing its use (Putsch & Joyce, 1990 ; Puchalski, 2013; Sato, 2012). Taken together , these barriers may be a significant reason for why we observe fewer individuals using WM as their initial form of medical care. 81 5.4 The impact of individual health perception in TM use Findings of this study illustrate that TM is often th e initial form of medication for illnesses varying from acute to chronic. However, an overarching theme suggests that the use of TM for acute illnesses is more prominent, w hile WM use increas es as perceived severity of illness intensifies . More specificall y, as the susceptibility to serious health consequences and illness severity increased, individuals were more likely to use WM. Despite increased difficulties in accessing WM, the perception of one's severity seemed to often outweigh these costs , which is consistent with previous literature ( Anyinam , 1987) . Anyinam (1987) found that individuals were more likely to endure the associated costs of care if the y perceive the severity of the illness or injury to be high. Differences in the urgency of common acute health issues (i.e. headaches or stomach aches) versus chronic illnesses may also be a contributing factor to the use of WM as well. Individuals who have lower levels of perceived illness severity and susceptibility may demonstrate higher use of TM. Previ ous studies have noted that individuals with acute illnesses demonstrated a stronger will to wait at least one day to receive care from their regular physician rather than going elsewhere for help , compared to those with higher perceived seriousness ( Jurge ns, 2006; Love & Mainous, 1999). This demonstrates that the underlying health care seeking behaviour of individuals is similar with respect to disease severity perception . This study also observed that those with more serious perceptions about their illness may be more likely to seek professional help from hospitals or WM, while those 82 with acute illnesses were more likely to try TM first and then shift towards WM if their condition worsened or did not improve. Thus , TM was often their preferred form of medicine as a first response . Other studies have reported similar findings in which increased perceptions of the seriousness of an illness result ed in individuals seeking formal care ( Rosenstock, 2005; Kusuma & Babu, 2019). To add, individuals may be more inclined to delay the treatment if it is not thought to be serious (King, Faan, & McGuire, 2007; Burnett, Blumenthal, Mark, Leimberger, & Califf, 1995). These findings may explain why individuals in this study were more likely to use TM first, and then see k WM if the TM was not effective. For example, a respondent mentioned that they tried to heal her son's hernia with TM, but went to the hospital once it was physically visible . Again, this demonstrates that i ndividuals seek WM care once symptoms are percei ved as more serious. Research examining pandemic risk perceptions and behaviors found that individuals with higher perceived susceptibility for the pandemic influenza (H1N1) and increased risk of complications , were more likely to comply with official recommendations (Prati, Pietrantoni, & Zani, 2011). These health behaviours can be reflected in the current COVID -19 pandemic. Similarly , research on ambulance use and self-rated illness se verity found that individuals are significantly more likely to call an ambulance if they have higher levels of perceived seriousness (Toloo et al., 2013). Altogether , it is evident that increased level of perceived susceptibility and illness severity prompt an individual to seek professional care . These findings may explain why the participants may delay WM treatment until their sickness is perceived as increasingly serious . This study found that TM is often the preferred form of medical care; and thus, 83 may create a delay in the acquisition of WM as individuals may wait until they believe the TM is no longer effective. Alternatively, the findings also suggest that TM has limited ability to cure complex illnesses, such as CD, and that these severe ailments require WM. These findings further support the idea that increased perce ptions of severity result in the use of WM. However, despite this shift to WM with increased perceived severity, TM remains the preferred choice of care for majority of the individuals . 5.5 Meaningful internal and external cues guide health related behav iours Internal cues are an influential factor in the decision -making process of elderly individuals when it comes to administering medical care. More specifically, findings of this study imply that personal and cultural beliefs play a significant role in the choices individuals make when seeking health care . Our f indings suggest that participants hold a personal connection to TM as it is passed down by various generations. TM has been imbedded i n the local culture for hundreds, if not thousands of years. S ato (2012) refers to this as \"cultural path dependency\", in which individuals behave in accordance with ancestors and other locals alike. A study examining health care access found that an individual's compliance with beliefs outweighed other factors of he alth care, such as cost and accessibility (Mshana, Hampshire, Panter -Brick, & Walker, 2008). Th erefore, individuals' internal beliefs are an influential aspect of their decision -making processes when pursuing health care. This is consistent with previous l iterature that suggests that in LMIC s, individuals seek TM because it aligns with their cultural beliefs (Shaikh & 84 Hatcher, 2005; Ampofo et al., 2020). The findings of the study also parallel the sentiment that individuals prefer to seek traditional practi tioners or TM because they believe TM is better suited to understand their cultural and spiritual beliefs (Shaikh & Hatcher, 2005). However, previous literature has depicted that internal cues can deter treatment as well. Individuals are likely to lie or h ide their use of TM to WM practitioners in fear of being denounced (Peltzer, Friend -du Preez, Ramalagan, & Fomundam, 2010) . This factor will be discussed in more detail shortly. Nonetheless, internal beliefs and the fear of social stigmatization might have led to the increased use of TM among this study's population. External pressures are also influential in one's choice of health care , as demonstrated in the findings of this study. Precisely, findings suggest that an individual's choice of medical care was based on their perception of how they would be judged by others. For instance , some participants mentioned that their choices were questioned by members of their community . These members generally included neighbors and family members . While some elder ly individuals in this study had their children make their health care decisions, others made decisions on the behalf of their family members. King, Faan, and McGuire (2007) found that when examining differences in duration taken to seek care upon initial onset of symptoms, individuals' response s were heavily influenced by family members. Additionally, Prati and colleagues (2011) found that family members and friends can affect an individual's response and compliance with recommended behaviors when seeking H1N1 vaccines. Together, these studies depict the important role of interpersonal relationships in one's health care behaviours. This could be a possible explanation for the profound use of TM , as individuals who are avid users of TM in the 85 community may b e influencing others to use TM as well . It is equally possible for the opposite to happen. In fact, this study found that households in which children did not approve of TM use subsequently limited its use among the elderly population. This restriction by the participants' children was often based on educational and religious reasons . Ultimately, findings suggest that some individuals make their health care decisions based on the influence of others, and often to avoid social scrutiny and stigmatization. The issues of being influenced by local social norms when it comes to health care choices is also reflected in existing literature (Kretchy, Owusu -Daaku, & & Hatcher, 2005). Avoidance of mentio ning TM use to WM practitioners to avoid scrutiny can also have dangerous consequences . Mixing various forms of medication or taking insufficient forms of medicine can prolong treatment or even lead to further complications. An individual's external influe nces can either significantly encourage or discourage their choice of TM or WM use. Overall , in this study , majority of the external influences resulted in individuals seeking or administering TM. Nonetheless, there may be other variables influencing these behaviors, known as modifying factors . These factors include, demographics, income and SES, education, gender , and community perspective according to the HBM and may be of interest. 86 5.6 Copious modifying factors regulate the use of TM In congruence with the present study, previous literature has indicated that modifying factors such as demographics, education, and socioeconomic status (SES) are fundamental factor s that influence an individual 's choice of medical care. As mentioned earlier, one's geog raphical location can be persuasive in the decision -making process of which form of medical care to pursue. The time taken to obtain care, as well as the transportation that is required, are both central geographic factors that have been well - documented in literature concerned with one's choice of health care (Sato, 2012). Considering the lower rates of WM use, research describes that accessibility issues of WM, and issues related to cost of transportation, influence an individual's preference of TM over WM (Mshana et al., 2008; Sato, 2012). Similarly, a study examining the perspectives of TM users in Ghana discovered that costs associated with travel and long distances significantly impacts individuals' decision to seek help and their choice of care (Sato, 2012). Th us, it is plausible that individuals living far ther away from hospitals or WM pharmacies may be less likely to travel to obtain WM; therefore, these individuals may seek local TM doctors and medical alternatives instead. As a result, the profound continued use of TM occurs , especially for acute illnesses. Together, t hese studies demonstrate that geographical and logistical factors influence individual's choice of medical care, and outline the possible reasons for why accessibility barriers associated with WM may be limiting its use , especially among the elderly population . 87 Income was reflected as a significant stressor in this study. Respondents indicated that poverty and income concerns were part of their daily stressors as they primarily belonged to lower SES classes. Noteworthy research (within and outside of LMIC) on SES and its impact on health care access has found that financial worries and insufficient income puts a large toll on one's ability to access and afford appropriate medical care (Obirikorang et al., 2018; Kusuma & Babu, 2019; Manu & Sriram, 1999; Sato, 2012). In terms of TM use in Ghana , research also suggests that the high cost of WM was a major deterrent of its use (Obirikorang et al, 2018; Sato, 2012) . These findings are consistent with this research , as majority of my respondents stated that financial means were often a major barrier of WM. Therefore , an individual's SES can be a significant predictor of preferred type of medical care within this study. Particularly, low levels of SES and income , especially with in the elderly participants can prompt the use of TM as it is often free and has limited associated costs. In comparison to WM, which is primarily expensive without insurance and has additional costs, such as th ose associated with traveling to hospitals/clinics and the added cost of prescription medicines. Another modifying factor that has been shown to influence TM use and health care is education. Though this study did not directly measure participants ' level of education, extensive literature exhibits the significance of education in relation to health care. For instance, compelling research indicates that one's educational level is associated with compliance of professional recommendations, perceived barriers an d benefits, choice of medical care, and overall better health outcomes (Kusuma & Babu, 2019; Obirikorang et al., 2018; Sato, 2012). Despite the education level of participants not 88 being directly measured in this study, it is noteworthy to understand its po ssible impact TM use . Future studies may also want to consider investigating the influence of education given the previous literature findings on the relationship between education and type of heath care, and the current rise in formal education within Gha na. Gender variances in health care have been examined by various researchers across many fields of study. Research on TM use often depicts women as being more likely to use TM in LMICs as an alternative to WM (Broom, Doron, & Tovey, 2009; Cameron, 2010; & Keshet & Simchai, 2014). However, findings of this study indicate contradictory results to this predominant view. As discussed in Section 5.1, the findings suggest that an approximately equal use of TM among both men and women. Rather, the striking gender differences were associated with financial and emotional factors. This study found that men demonstrated more financial barriers with health care , especially with WM, whereas women were less likely to mention similar financial concerns . Fascinatingly, some female respondents stated that they will endure the costs of treatment if it were necessary. This sentiment was not shared among any of the male respondents. A possible explanation for this result is that men may have more financial responsibilities than women in Ghana. Various studies in Ghana indicate that men are more likely to hold the financial responsibility for their families (William, Appiah, & Botchway, 2015 ; Adam, Boadu, & Frimpong, 2018; Arku & Arku, 2009) . Typically, men are responsible for the financial well-being of their family, as they are usually the primary source of income (Dumbaugh et al., 2014) . This responsibility of men extends to paying for the health care needs o f the family as well (Dumbaugh et al., 2014). Research on gender differences associated with 89 financial literacy in Ghana also argues that men typically have a greater understanding of finances (Adam, Boadu, & Frimpong, 2018). This greater comprehension of financial situations may explain why men in this study did not state their willingness to endure excessive health care costs, and more commonly cited cost as a barrier to health care. Men may be in a different position when deciding which form of health care to pursue with regards to factors like affordability. Interestingly, a study based in another LMIC, Brazil, found that women are often responsible for the diagnosis of illness and treatment recommendations of their family (Albuquerque e t al., 2011). Furthermore, Albuquerque and colleagues (2011) found that women often refer to men to collect the resources necessary for treatment. In relation to this research , women may be less concerned with financial barriers of treatment because they leave this responsibility to the men in the household. Hence, they mentioned fewer financial concerns for necessary treatments. The gender roles mentioned above are generalized based on the findings, but may be shifting, whereby men and women share similar responsibilities . Apart from gender difference s, the findings also found that cultural and emotional factors may influence the use of TM in women. In particular , women have cultural and emotional attachments to TM that male participants did not allude to. For instance, female participants mentioned that TM was \"their people's medicine\", or that \"god has given us this medicine\". Perhaps, th is emotional relationship with TM , facilitated by cultur e, is promoting their use of TM . Much like the findings of this research, previous research has also shown that women are more likely to take culture into account when making health care decisions (Shewamene, Dune, & Smith, 2020; & Baghramian & 90 Ingram, 2000). Alqethami, Aldhebiani, and Teixidor -Toneu (2020) argue that there are various gender differences in knowledge accumulation of TM , and that these differences result in distinct motives behind their health care decisions. For example , women often interpret their use of TM through cultural conditions of learning whic h emphasizes the importance of holistic factors (Alqethami, Aldhebiani, & Teixidor -Toneu, 2020). Some women may value the cultural and religious components of TM; thus, they highlight this emotional attachment in the responses of this study . An alternat ive explanation may be that women are more open to sharing their emotions. Research has shown that women are more emotionally expressive than men (Fischer & LaFrance, 2014; & Chaplin, 2015), which may explain their increased willingness to share emotional att achments, relative to male participants. Irrespective of these gender differences and their possible implications, these findings are based on a fairly small sample size. Thus, the need for future studies on this topic may be warranted. To reiterate, d istance, access, availability, among other factors have all been used as measures of health care access and utilization in many studies. Along with the aforementioned factors, research has also depicted the importance of geographical location with regards to a ccess, availability, accumulation, and use of medicine. In line with previous literature, the findings also suggest a lack of equity in access and availability of health care services based on community location (Weisgrau, 1995; Drislane, Akpalu, & Wegdmam al., 2015), particularly for WM. The findings depict a preference of TM over WM for rural communit y members in 91 comparison to individuals from urban communities. This preference was often based on the ease of access and availability of T M. Intuitively, one would assume that individuals residing in urban areas would be less inclined to believe in the efficacy of TM due to their greater access to WM, higher levels of education, and greater income (Buor, 2005; & Adjasi & Osei, 2007). Howeve r, our findings indicate that the opposite is true, which is a novel finding to our knowledge. Interestingly, individuals residing in urban communities had more faith in the efficacy of TM, especially for curing CD. In comparison, participants from rural c ommunities questioned the efficacy of TM in treatment of complex illnesses, such as CD. A possible explanation for this belief in the limited efficacy of TM by rural communities could be the extensive knowledge and experience with TM obtained over their long -term and frequent use . Their increased use of TM a ccompanied with their limited use of WM may have led rural community members to experience the limitations of TM , thereby leading them to realize its limited use f or CD. With re gards to participants from urban communities , those who stated that TM was effective for CD also highlighted the difficulties of obtaining the required ingredients for creating said TMs. This finding may give further credence to the idea that urban communi ty members have less experience and familiarity with TM, which might be why they are more likely to believe in the effectiveness of TM for curing CD, relative to rural community members. Moreover, rural community members also live in open agricultural area s surrounded by various trees, leaves, bushes, and roots, providing them with easier access to TM. Urban 92 community members live closer to towns and cities, and have more access to hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, and consequently have easier access to W M Despite the finding that urban community members were more likely to believe in the efficacy of TM for curing CD relative to rural community members, in general , the findings suggest that upon development of CD, only WM is perceived as the appropriate treatment by both groups . Moreover, our findings indicate that both groups of participants believe TM can only help alleviate some symptoms of the CD, and not the illness itself. In essence, the lack of experience and knowledge regarding the preparation and use of TM may be a possible explanation behind this study's urban participants perceived efficacy of TM for CD. The increased experience of TM use among rural community members may limit its use of TM for CD as they have more knowledge and experience of its limitations. Nonetheless, considering the previously mentioned limitation of varying sample size (n = 5 in urban areas, and n = 12 in rural areas), these findings should be perceived cautiously. 5.7 Changing dynamics of profound TM use in contemporary times Contrary to previous research, this thesis demonstrates that the dependency on TM as the sole form of medication may no longer be prominent, rather an increase in WM use may be forthcoming . These findings are novel and paramount considering that previous literature in Ghana has depicted high frequencies of the exclusive use of TM (\"Traditional healers broaden health care in Ghana \", 2019; WHO, 2019). Irrespective of 93 the previously mentioned factors, such as perceived severity, barriers, and benefits which encou rage TM use, I found this shift to be possibly attributable to the local rise in education , religion, and an overall improvement in the access and availability of WM. The findings indicate a wide use of WM despite the participants preference for TM. In comparison to previous literature, the findings suggest that individuals may be more open to the idea of using WM and no longer solely dependent on TM. Researchers Fatie et al. (2009), and Sato (2012), found that individu als in Ghana prefer WM as their initial form of care and then turn to TM if it is ineffective . In general, the findings are on par with other literature that has depicted that participants sought TM prior to other forms of medication (Peltzer, 2000). Furth ermore , I found that regardless of what form of heath care individuals chose initially, if it did not improve their condition, individuals sought the alternative form of health care (i.e. WM then TM , or TM then WM). My findings suggest that individuals are generally open to using WM, and in some cases, individuals have recently switched to WM as their preferred use of health care. The ongoing rise of education in Ghana, especially since the Education Act of 1961, which made it compulsory for children to attend school, may be a possible contributing factor to th e preference of WM (Adena, 2000). Unfortunately, our respondents were born prior to this act, and the rapid rise in school enrollment began later in the 1970s. Although this study's participants may not be as educated, their children are much more likely to be. As mention ed previously , the family structure has a pronounced influence on an individual's health care decisions, especially with older individuals who may rely on their children for support. Many of the elderly respondents mentioned that the ir children were responsible 94 for their shift towards WM. Based on the participants' age, it is likely that their children went to school as education rates at this time were much higher . For instance , both secondary and tertiary education rates were significantly higher at the time that the participants' children would have attended school (Ministry of Education, 2015). Access to education in Ghana itself has increased significantly at all levels of school ing. For example, the percentage of children enrolled in elementary private schools in Ghana increased from 13 percent in 1999 to just over 28 percent in 2018 (Kamran, Liang, & Trines, 2019). The gross tertiary education enrollment rates have also gone from less than 1 percent in 1971 to just over 16% in 2015 (Kamran, Liang, & Trines, 2019), as seen in Figure 5.1. It is plausible that the increased rates of education and access to education have augmented exposure to principles grounded in science . This comprehensive understanding may have increased the doubt that individuals have about TM practitioners \"unscientific and unempirical\" forms of care (Appiah et al., 2018) . Moreover, this increase in education may result in higher SES to allow individua ls to afford more expensive forms of health care, which are often associated with WM. In conclusion, education may promote the seeking of WM, as mentioned by various research (Obirikorang et al., 2018; Ampofo et al., 2020; Sato, 2012). 95 Figure 5.1. Te rtiary Gross Enrollment Rate in Ghana. Graph exemplifying the increasing rate of tertiary gross enrollment in Ghana. Source: Kamran, Liang, & Trines, (2019). In addition to education, it may be worthwhile to explore the overlooked impact of religion and its evolving nature and its relationship with TM use. P reviously research has alluded to religion having a positive relationship with the use of TM in the African context . However, the results of this study demonstrate otherwise. This research's findings suggest that religious beliefs increase the likelihood of some individuals usin g TM, while guiding others in the opposite direction. Although some individuals mentioned that TM doctors and medicine aligned with their cultural beliefs, religion was not something that I specifically examined. Nonetheless, some individuals mentioned tha t their use of WM was based on their religious conflictions with TM. Recent surveys indicate that approximately 71% of individuals in Ghana consider themselves Christians (International Religious Freedom Report for 2018, 2019). Considering that previous surveys have illustrated much lower rates of Christianity in the past, this may be an 96 influential factor in the shift towards WM. To be specific, in 1960, the rate of Christians in Ghana was 41% (Owusu -Ansah, 1994), and 68% in 2000 (Ghana, 2009). Interesting ly, all individuals who stated that TM did not align with their religious beliefs stated that they are Christians. These individuals mentioned that although they use TM, they have begun to deter away from such practices because their children are Christian s and do not believe in certain forms of TM . These shunned practices include the use of animal sacrifices and forms of magic. Indeed, this could have possibly encouraged greater use of WM. Ultimately, this shift from TM to WM may be a combination of both e ducation and religious beliefs. Therefore, future research should focus on longitudinal studies to identify differences in perception and use of TM as educational rates continues to rise overtime. 5.8 Limitations and Implications for Future Research Although several novel findings emerged from this work, several aspects of this research will benefit from further investigation . Future research should take these findings to supplement the support of formally implementing TM within the official Ghanaian health care system. Using quantitative techniques may be useful to examine the predictors and correlates of TM use, and further explore the factors responsible for the shift towards WM. Like all research studies, my study also it has its limitations. For example , certain factors were not directly measured , such as education level, employment, income, and religion . Previous research demonstrates the significance of 97 these factors in the role of decision making when seeking TM. Directly measuring the se factors within this study could have strengthen ed the study . Further more , it may have been interesting to also ask participants of their exact age. Although this study focused on individuals over 60 years and older because it fits the d efinition of an elderly person in Ghana, the focus on certain ages could have been useful , especially in terms of examin ing possible differences in the perception and use of TM between various age groups. For example, we may have seen varying use of TM between participants t hat were 60 -65 years old versus those that were 80 years and older. Lastly, as mentioned in Chapter 3, being a visible racial minority in the country resulted in participants and community members associating me with being a researcher from a non -profit or ganization (NGO) . Employees that visit from NGOs often provide these individuals with financial or other materialistic incentives. Along these lines, participant may have altered responses to seem more fitting of receiving these incentives. However, this i s unlikely because we clearly indicated that we were conducting research on behalf of a university in Canada. Another limitation of conducting interviews is that they are largely dependent upon rapport between the researcher and interviewee. Unfortunately, as a foreigner , I had to communicate with the participants through my translator, which made it difficult to build rapport with my respondents. To add, w ith inadequate communication, it was difficult to develop an interpersonal relationship with the respo ndents. This in turn, made me more dependent on the translator and his listening skills, as well as his ability to generate these interpersonal relationships. However, these limitations were inevitable as I do not speak the local language and I am not fami liar with their cultural norms . 98 5.8.1 Policy Implications and Recommendations Research is essential for the advancement of not just science, but all aspects of humanity . It is imperative that research furthers the knowledge of theories, thoughts, and philosophies. Findings of this thesis provide many valuable contributions to the traditional and complimentary medic al field that can be instilled to help improve health care s ystems globally. Often, the discussions of TM and other complimentary medicines are focused on its \"actual/scientific\" efficacy, however, these conversations serve little purpose as my work demonstrates TM to be effective to a certain degree . Rather, the focus should be on understanding the factors that impact the use of effective TMs to help improve the health of Ghanaians and the overall healthcare system of Ghana. As previously mentioned, the findings suggest that the use of TM is largely influenced by its ease of access and availability, as well as its low cost. For a LMIC with a primarily poverty -stricken population, cost of health care was an important factor in an individual's ability to obtain appropriate care. Given that, Ghana may benefit from requiring its medical schools to train prospective doctors to become educated on the local TM to know which plants, leaves, and herbs are effective , and their associated ailments so future doctors can prescribe affordable and accessible TM. A similar strateg y can be witnessed in China's health care system. During the evolution of their healthcare system, doctors that were training in WM were required to also study their local TM (Ho, 2001) . In addition, the government of China invested many resources in to the research and administration of Chinese TM, which has resulted in this form of care becoming one of their mainstream medical practices (Xu & Yang, 2009). Formally implementing TM into 99 the official health care system creates affordable health care treatments that are based on the collaborative relationship between the patient and health care provider . To add, m any participants mentioned that their use of TM was based on its ability to un derstand and appreciate the local culture. I suggest that following China's blueprint may be beneficial for the healthcare system of Ghana . With that being said, if Ghana implements TM into the official health care system that is respectful of patient pref erences , it can ultimately allow for better patient centered care and better health outcomes . As Ghana continues to urbanize and grow economically, WM facilities are increasing within the country; however, access to facilities remains limited in rural comm unities , as exemplified in this study. Findings of this thesis suggest that many people are switching to WM. Given this switch, and the increasing number of people needing WM coupled with the limited access to WM facilities, the government of Ghana must ta ke appropriate actions to increase the availability and access to these health care services. Many participants complained about accessing WM services due to lack of transportation . This barrier to accessing health care may be solved by creating establishe d bus routes to local hospitals from rural communit ies. As stated in Chapter 2 of this thesis, Ghana currently has healthcare insurance schemes that have failed to alleviate the burdens of health care costs. Specifically, programs such as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) and National Health Insurance Scheme need to be re -evaluated as individuals continue to face financial difficulties associated to health care. Despite the existence and purpose of these social welfare programs created by Ghana, participants of this study mentioned that cost of 100 western health care remained a barrier. Thus, these programs may either be ineffective, not widely advertised/available, or difficult to obtain , and ultimately warrant change . Although this study is focused on addressing the literature gap of research on LMICs, findings of this study can be utilized outside this context as well. For example, countries such as Canada, that have large immigrant and mi grant populations may also see large users of TM. As stressed in this thesis, culture is an important factor in the use of TM, and culture tends to transcend borders , and may result in the use of TM in countries where WM is readily available. Similar to Ghana, there seems to be access and availability limitation s of WM in rural communities of Canada, particularly amongst the Aboriginal population. Canadian research has depicted that elderly Aboriginal s face increased barriers to health care services and had higher frequencies of self -reported poor health, particularly those with chronic conditions ( Wilson, Rosenberg, & Abonyi , 2011 ). Moreover, research has also shown a similar cultural battle between the acceptance of modern medicinal techniques and the elderly Aboriginal population (Wilson, Rosenberg, & Abonyi, 2011) , which was prevalent among participants of this study as well . The ideological clash between colonizers and the attempted cultural assimilation has made it difficult for these individuals to accept these western forms of medicine, parallel with some of the elderly Ghanaian population. Together, the limited access and availability of WM for Aboriginal communi ties in Canada in addition to the cultural preference for TM has created a similar situation to Ghana. Thus, it may be beneficial for westernized countries, like Canada to adopt similar policy recommendations m entioned to incorporate TM to provide better p atient centered care. 101 5.9 Conclusion The theoretical and practical contributions of this study coupled with previous literature on TM use further enhance s the understanding of the use of TM and WM in the elderly population of Ghana. Understanding the use of TM in Ghana is a very complex subject matter . There are various intertwining factors that have impacted its on -going use, despite the increas ing shift towards WM. Unfortunately, most existing literature does not grasp the various factors that possibly impact the use of TM and are narrowly focused. Although the study of specific factors behind the use of TM is important and relevant , it is rather imperative to ensu re that a wide range of factors are also examined to cover as many aspects as possible . Overtime, WM has become the dominant and \"official\" health care delivery system throughout the vast majority of the world. However, LMICs such as Ghana have shown resis tance to this change by exemplifying high usage of alternative forms of health care. Western society seems to have a stigmatization towards other forms of health care, such as TM, and deem it ineffective because it takes a holistic approach. However, I suggest that this is far from the truth . Congruent with countless research studies , the findings of this study also suggest TM to be effective. In fact, all respondents of this study stated TM to be effective, at least to some degree. Thus, TM along with its research should not be overlooked . Rather , TM research should be further examined to better understand and appreciate its use and benefits . Ultimately, I hope that this research can influence collective action among policy makers, traditional , and WM physicians to implement these practices into the official health care system of Ghana. 102 Using in -depth interviews , this research reveal ed the detailed accounts of 17 individuals and their interpretations of TM and its use . These interviews highlight ed the implications of the potential forthcoming shift towards WM. Though research has examined the use of TM in Ghana, it has most ly been silent on many important factors. For instance, it has ignored TM's efficacy for CD and the intertwining nature of many of the factors examined in this study , particularly among the elderly population. In addition, studies also have a limited geographical awareness on the use of TM. While TM use was consistent geographically, its perceived efficacy was interestingly varied . The findings from my study provide valuable contributions to the TM and alternative medicine landscape. It is also important to state that although this research is situated in a LMIC, the use of TM extends beyond th ese c ountries . The use of natural therapies can be observed in various parts of the world, including North America. Using data from the 2015 National Consumer Survey on the Medication Experience and Pharmacists' Roles on approximately 26,000 US adults, findings revealed that almost 35% of participants were currently using at least one herbal medicine (Rashrash, Schommer, & Brown, 2017). In contrast , a 2016 study on prescription drug use in the US found that about 59% of individuals are using at least one prescription drug (Kantor, Rehm, Haas, Chan, & Giovannucci, 2016 ). The difference between the two forms of medicine is not as large as one would expect . Rather this difference exemplifies th e vast sum of individuals in industrialized countries using TM despite the easy access and availability of WM, further demonstrati ng the importance of investigating its use. 103 The Rosenstock's Health Belief Model was used to integrate the role of various factors and their impact (s) on the use of TM. This theoretical framework allow ed us to understand the psychosocial and demographic f actors altering the choice of people's health care decisions. Moreover, it provide d a guideline to examine, organize, and contextualize the results to produce the findings . Ultimately, Rosenstock's Health Belief Model was a useful model to carry out my research , as it aligned with this research's focus on the psychological, social, geographic, and demographic factors of interest. Apart from being given an opportunity to attempt to understand a complex and multifactorial issue, this project was an eye -opening experience to the various ways of life that exist on this planet. Going into this project, the only impressions of Ghana that I had were those that I had seen on mainstream media , and their depictions of what life in Africa was like. The m ainstream media portrays African countries as being unable to have self -sufficiency and being reliant on the need of western society to thrive . However , this was not the case, and I can now attest to that. Although I d id witness poverty, these individuals still maintain ed a self -sufficient lifestyle in which they can provide their families with daily necessities. Exploring the various parts of Ghana allowed me to see the various lifestyles that exist within the country. Where some individuals live d lavish lifestyles, others lived in slum -like conditions. No matter the location or lifestyle, these individuals lived in harmony, with great social cohesion and appreciation. Although many of the respondents complained of pove rty, they were also extremely grateful of everything they had. This is something that has re sonated greatly with me . Upon reflect ing on my experience, I have come to realize that although materialistic things are 104 important, they are not everything, rather life is appreciated in many different ways. To the participants and many families that I shared a moment with, I am forever grateful for the experience and the life lessons I learned. 105 References Abdullahi, A. (2011).
