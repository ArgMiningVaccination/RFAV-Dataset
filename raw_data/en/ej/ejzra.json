Description A comprehensive guide to the cosmic influences that underlie health and how to apply them for profound health and healing Examines how ancient and modern traditions of healing interconnect through the doctrine of signatures, \"As above, so below\" Reveals how one's astrological chart has implications for personal health and healing Explains how each sign of the zodiac corresponds not only to parts of the body and its chakras but also to specific plants, herbs, colors, and emotions Explores how to use sound healing to harmonize astrological imbalances When we look at the vast and intricate cosmos--galaxies, planets, organisms, organs, cells, molecules, atoms--there is a fundamental order, a music or harmony of the spheres. Our cells reflect the images of galaxies seen through our telescopes. We are the microcosm, reflecting the macrocosm of the heavens. Our ancestors understood these patterns and connections between humanity and the universe and developed spiritual and healing traditions in line with these cosmic truths. Yet in the 19th century, knowledge of these connections was set aside as medical science sought to create the \"one size fits all\" approaches to healing that dominate modern medicine today. In this comprehensive exploration of the celestial influences that underlie health and healing, Jennifer Gehl, with Marc Micozzi, examines how ancient and modern traditions of healing interconnect through the doctrine of signatures, \"As above, so below\". She reveals how one's celestial nature--the arrangement of the cosmos at the moment of birth--has implications for personal health and how each sign of the zodiac corresponds to parts of the body, the chakras, and specific plants, herbs, colors, and emotions. She explains how sound re-arranges forms according to the principles of harmony, leveraging not only the human self-regulating capacity to restore health but also that of the Earth to restore balance and harmony. Also explored are the recurrence of geometric forms in nature and how to apply this knowledge in sound healing and medical astrology. Weaving together the threads of ancient science and spirit that formed the original tapestry of medicine, Gehl explains how to restore the cosmic foundations of healing for personal, planetary, and universal health and wellbeing.

Praise For... \"In The Science of Planetary Signaturesin Medicine, Jennifer Gehl illuminates connections among elements of astrology, math, history, music and sound, alchemy, quantum science, and principles of Chinese medicine. From the I Ching and the works of Pythagoras and Plato to Nassim Haramein, Jennifer guides her reader through the science and philosophy of the unified cosmos. Masterfully written and extraordinarily readable, this book is a must-read.\" \u2014 Jude Ponton, DC, M.Ac., practitioners \"Jennifer Gehl's book is brilliant. I can hardly wait to share it with everyone I know! The title might suggest it's just for healers\u2014it's not. It is for all seekers. In it you will discover the bridges from the ancient knowing to the present scientific understanding. Any seeker who is looking for the connections between sacred geometry, ancient wisdom, and modern scientific discovery will absolutely love this book\u2014it is a treasure trove of research and where they intersect. I suspect it will become a classic like many other books, referred to again and again to understand something new or old.\" \u2014 Maureen J. St. Germain, founder of Akashic Records International \"Jennifer Gehl takes us on a tour through history. Visiting a wide variety of cultures, systems, philosophers, and thinkers, an underlying thread is unmistakable. We are connected to all of nature, including and especially, the planetary energies of our solar system. Astrology can and does play a central role in all of life, including the healing arts. In The Science of Planetary Signatures in Medicine, we have the basic premise elucidated with striking clarity: There is an order to the universe. What we do with this realization is up to us. How might we integrate astrology and nature's intelligence into 21st-century healing arts? That is the task before us, and this book is an excellent guide for all of us.\" \u2014 Eric Meyers, author of The Astrology of Awakening \"The Science of Planetary Signatures in Medicine will surprise you as a comprehensive and beautifully written text. It offers a strong measure of historical and scientific background while remaining crystal clear and intriguing. Gehl embraces the beauty of music as she draws out the mathematical roots of music theory and lays out its integral connection to the planet and universal laws at play. As an example, we get to explore with the author how the principles of harmonics in music apply to other vibratory phenomena in the universe. The book is a lucid, scholastic exploration that every practitioner will want and will use. It will be hard not to devour every concept on the first read . . . it will continue to serve as an excellent, authoritative reference for years to come!\" \u2014 Steven Weiss, MS, DC, RYT, author of The Injury-Free Yoga Practice \"Jennifer Gehl synthesizes cosmology, history, philosophy, mathematics, music, and physics. She applies these perspectives in a way that expands our knowledge of these disciplines in relationship to healing. Ultimately the connection between sound healing and physics is presented. Healers of all disciplines, and particularly Acutonics practitioners, will find connections that develop the conversation surrounding many of the principles involved in healing.\" \u2014 William Morris, Ph.D., DAOM, L.Ac., author "}
