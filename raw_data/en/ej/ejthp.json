8 - SUMMARY 1. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have introduced no major changes to their trade regimes since their last joint TPR in 2008. Their trade regimes remain generally liberal, except in agriculture, which is still highly protected by tariff and non-tariff measures. 2. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are among the wealthiest countries in the world. Their economies have recovered well from the global economic crisis. Thanks to its \"debt break\" rule and substantial fiscal surpluses accumulated at the federal level prior to the crisis, Switzerland implemented economic stabilization measures in 2009/10, mainly infrastructure spending and labour market measures. Thus, unemployment has been kept in check at about 3-4%. However, a decline in labour productivity in recent years is cause for concern. Liechtenstein's economic performance has been a magnet for foreigners, which represent about two thirds of the Liechtenstein workforce. 3. Trade is an important driving force of the Sw iss and Liechtenstein economies, with the GDP shares of trade in goods and services exceed ing 100%. Given their degree of dependence on trade, both countries remain exposed to develo pments in global demand. The main economic challenge for the two economies has been the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc (due to its safe haven status), which has been threatening to undermine competitiveness. In September 2011, the Swiss National Bank decided to contain the appreciation of the Swiss franc by setting a minimum exchange rate of SwF 1.20 per euro and committing to unlimited purchases of foreign currencies, if needed. Liechtenstein uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. 4. Switzerland and Liechtenstein remain high-price \"islands\" in Europe for a number of reasons, such as the strong Swiss franc and relatively high incomes, but also because of the high level of protection in agriculture, technical barriers to trade, and limited competition in various industries. One of the key policy objectives is improving competition in the domestic market. While a number of initiatives (e.g. Switzerland's adoption of the \"Cassis de Dijon principle\") were taken during the review period to stimulate competition and counter the high prices, overall more effective steps are needed to address the competitive challenges facing the economies, in particular in agriculture. 5. Switzerland and Liechtenstein remain staunch supporters of the multilateral trading system. Faced with the current impasse of the DDA negotiations and a difficult economic environment, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have extended their network of free-trade agreements to help improve access to foreign markets. This trend makes their trade regimes increasingly complex. Since their last Review, eight new FTAs concluded under EFTA (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, and Norway) have entered into force Albania; Canada; Colombia; Hong Kong, China; Montenegro; Peru; Serbia; and Ukraine). In addi tion, a bilateral FTA between Switzerland and Japan entered into force in 2009. Overall, Switzerland has 26 FTAs with 35 trading partners, besides the EU. Switzerland and the EU have deepened their trade relations, notably in the area of customs procedures and mutual recognition of conformity. Under the 1924 Customs Union Treaty, Switzerland acts on behalf of Liechtenstein in Customs Union matters, such as trade policy measures affecting imports, and agricultural poli cy. All trade agreements concluded by Switzerland also apply to Liechtenstein. 6. Switzerland's investment regime is generally open to foreigners. However, investment restrictions continue to apply to areas under state monopoly, including certain postal, insurance, and rail transport services. Restrictions in the form of domicile requirements are also applied in certain sectors, including air transport. Swit zerland provides a number of tax and non-tax incentives at federal and cantonal level. Most non-tax assistance, including direct payments, is accorded to the agriculture sector. 7. Liechtenstein, too, has a generally open investment regime. Investment restrictions apply in public utilities, as well as to a number of financial services (asset management, investment consulting, and trusteeships). Furthermore, residency requirements apply. Following the Liechtenstein Declaration of 2009, in which th e Government expressed its commitment to implement global standards of transparency and exchange of information developed by the OECD, Liechtenstein has taken steps to reform its domestic and international tax policies, including the adoption of a new tax regime in 2011. As a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 9 - Liechtenstein benefits from the \"four freedoms\" of circulation (goods, services, capital, and persons) in the markets of the EU, Iceland, and Norway. 8. The structure of the applied MFN tariff of th e Switzerland-Liechtenstein Customs Union has changed little since the last TPR. All tariffs remain specific; the corresponding ad valorem equivalents range from zero to 1,676%. The simple average MFN rate increased from 8.1% in 2008 to 9.2% in 2012, which reflects in part the a ppreciation of the Swiss franc. Tariff protection varies substantially across and within sectors, averaging 31.9% for agricultural products and 2.3% for non-agricultural goods (WTO definition), with some international tariff peaks on products such as textiles and clothing. MFN duty-free treatment applies to almost 20% of all tariff lines, mainly agricultural products not produced domestically, fish, petroleum, certain chemicals, base metals, as well as products granted duty-free treatment under the Pharmaceutical Initiative, the Information Technology Agreement, and the Pluril ateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Almost 40% of tariff lines carry non-zero rates of less than 2% (nuisance rates). 9. The preferential agreements concluded by Swit zerland-Liechtenstein provide for free trade in most non-agricultural products, subject to certificates of origin. For agricultural products, preferential access is provided mainly through bilateral tariff quotas. Least developed countries benefit from substantial and enhanced tariff preferences in the Customs Union: all agricultural and non-agricultural products are entitled to duty-free and quota-free treatment, including rice and sugar. Switzerland's GSP rules of origin were harmonized with the EU's in 2011. 10. Switzerland and Liechtenstein maintain import prohibitions and export controls on certain products for health, safety, security or environmental reasons, and to ensure compliance with international obligations. The automatic and non-automatic licensing procedures remain substantially unchanged. An automatic licence (general import permit) applies to some products covered by compulsory reserve stock schemes (certain fuels and foodstuffs) or import threshold prices. Non-automatic licensing is applied mainly for tariff-quota management purposes. Under a Swiss-EU bilateral agreement in force since 2011, operators from non-EU countries are required to provide a prior notification and go through securi ty-risk analysis. To help ease the burden of security-related customs procedures, Switzerland ha s introduced an authorized economic operator scheme that is open to accredited operators. 11. Switzerland has taken steps towards reducing technical barriers to trade and enhancing import competition in the domestic market. In 2010, Switzerland unilaterally introduced the \"Cassis de Dijon principle\" for certain products. Together with the MRA on conformity assessment between Switzerland and the EU, the Cassis de Di jon principle ensures that products that are lawfully marketed in the EU or EEA may, in princi ple, be put on the market in Switzerland without further checks regarding their technical requirements. Exports from the broader WTO membership to Switzerland may benefit too, provided the products meet EU/EEA technical requirements. However, some of the potential gains from trade are lost because the Cassis de Dijon principle is not applicable to certain products (e.g. animal feed, pharmaceuticals or certain chemicals), and food imports are subject to special approval procedures. 12. As a consequence of Liechtenstein's EEA membership since 1 May 1995, and because of the Customs Union with Switzerland, Liechtenstein has to ensure in its territory the \"parallel marketability\" of goods under Swiss and EEA rules. To this end, Liechtenstein maintains a Market Control and Surveillance Mechanism, which applies to imports on which customs tariffs (e.g. fish) or non-tariff requirements (e.g. pharmaceuticals, some telecom equipment, salt) differ between the EEA and Switzerland. The mechanism is design ed to prevent goods that do not satisfy Swiss import requirements from entering the Swiss market via the open border. 13. No specific trade concerns have been raised in the TBT and SPS Committees since 2008 regarding Switzerland's measures. Liechtenstein applies Switzerland's TBT and SPS measures under the Customs Union Treaty. Approximately 95% of the 23,080 standards currently in force in Switzerland (unchanged since 2008) are aligned with international or European standards. There have been no major changes to the SPS regime, alth ough a reform of the Swiss food safety regime is under way to further align its requirements with the EU's. The moratorium on approvals for the cultivation of bio-technology crops has been extended. The Swiss veterinary and phytosanitary regimes have been fully harmonized with the EU's since the last TPR. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 10 - 14. Switzerland and Liechtenstein do not have any specific anti-dumping, countervailing or safeguards legislation, and do not apply such measures. They maintain no export taxes, charges or levies. In response to the global economic crisis, Switzerland has introduced new export insurance and guarantee schemes to help improve export competitiveness and ease liquidity problems. 15. The Swiss competition regime remains substantially unchanged. A number of policy recommendations by a task force on competition are under consideration by the Government, aimed at better aligning the Swiss competition framework with international best practices. With regard to state trading, the Swiss Confederation continues to exercise a statutory monopoly over imports of alcohol, though the exclusive import rights have been lifted for bio-ethanol used as fuel. A comprehensive overhaul of the legal and institutional framework governing the alcohol industry is under way, involving the termination of the State's import monopoly. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have their own regimes on government procurement and both countries are signatories of the revised Agreement on Government Procurement. 16. The main development in the area of intellectual property is Switzerland's unilateral decision to introduce the EEA-wide exhaustion principle for patent inventions (products and processes). Accordingly, patent owners cannot prevent the parallel importation of their patented products put on the market of EEA members by themselves or wi th their consent. Imports of products for which prices are fixed by the State, in Switzerland or abroad, require the patent owners' consent, meaning that national exhaustion continues to apply in this situation. This specifically affects pharmaceutical products. 17. Both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have a strong, export-oriented industrial base. Switzerland has a policy to support research and improve framework conditions for all economic sectors but it does not adhere to a policy of national champions. There are no cash subsidies in place to specific manufacturing industries other than measures open to all companies. 18. The electricity sector is in transition from a monopolistic electricity supply system towards a more competitive regime. Since 2009, large end-users may purchase electricity on the free market. To make competition work, the transmission and distribution networks have been opened for non-discriminatory third-party access. The Swiss gas market has also been partially opened to competition, allowing large customers to make direct imports. The Swiss Government has recently proposed a major change of direction of energy po licy (Energy Strategy 2050) with supply security to be achieved without nuclear energy in the medium-term. 19. Switzerland is one the most important financial service centre in the world, attracting large volumes of foreign business. No changes were made to market access conditions during the period under review, except for the signature of four re gional trade agreements containing preferential services commitments. However, two main regulato ry changes have intervened: the reinforcement of prudential regulations, following the financial crisis and the adoption of the Basel III principles; and a notable change in the international fiscal policy, i.e. the lifting of the Swiss reservation to the OECD model tax convention on income and ca pital regarding exchange of information on tax matters. Switzerland is now progressively adapting its bilateral network of agreements to this new setting. A preliminary reflection on the ways to increase the transparency of the Over The Counter (OTC) derivative market has also been initiated. Liechtenstein is a much smaller and specialized financial services centre. 20. The telecommunications and the distribution sect ors are both devoid of market and national treatment restriction in the GATS sense, but th ey remain concentrated by their nature and because of the relatively small size of the market. The postal sector has been liberalized in a manner following broadly the EU internal liberalization process. Transport policy is largely tied to the European context in view of Switzerland's central geographical position and its bilateral agreements on air transport and on land transpor t with the European Union. Reforms are ongoing to liberalize further the railways sector. Switzerland is pursuing a policy of construction of cross-alpine transit infrastructure and of inte rmodal transfer between road and rail through a specific tax. Tourism is open but has suffered fr om the strong Swiss franc and is being promoted at the high end of the spectrum. 21. From a trade policy perspective, agriculture remains the \"Achilles heel\" of the Swiss and Liechtenstein economies, despite its marginal contribution to GDP and employment. A few tariff WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 11 - reduction initiatives have been carried out since the last TPR, but overall the high level of import protection in agriculture has been left largely untouched. Meat and dairy products, the backbone of Swiss-Liechtenstein agriculture, are the most tariff-protected products, with averages over 100% and peaks of up to 1,676%. The tariff-quota sy stem remains highly complex with the 28 WTO tariff quotas being divided into 58 sub-quotas an d aggregated with 80 bilateral preferential-tariff quotas. The Swiss milk-quota system was abolished in 2009, but surplus problems persist. A surplus removal campaign (compulsory milk levy) has drawn criticism from WTO Members. Export subsidies for basic agricultural products were eliminated in 2009, but remain in place for certain dairy products, flour, and other milled products that are incorporated into food products. These export subsidies partially compensate food manufacturers, for instance Swiss chocolate makers, for the handicap of using certain tariff-protect ed domestic agricultural raw materials. 22. A new Agricultural Policy 2014-17 is currently pending before the Swiss Parliament. The core of the new policy is a re-arrangement and fine-tuning of the direct payments scheme (averaging SwF 50,000 per farmer) to improve its effectiveness and address conflicts with WTO Green Box criteria. While Switzerland's agricultural policy has been heading generally in the right direction, Swiss support and protection for agriculture is still almost three times the OECD average. The process of market-oriented reforms needs to be faster. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 12 - 1 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 1.1 Economic Environment 1.1.1 Major features of the economies 1.1. Landlocked countries in the heart of Europe, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have formed a customs and monetary union that has contributed to the high integration of their economies, with the former acting on behalf of the latter in monetary, agricultural, and much of trade (in goods) policies (Chapter 2). This partially explains some of the similarities in their economic strategies, including in areas such as manufacturing and services. Both countries are highly dependent on external trade (exports and imports) in goods and services, which represents almost 100% of GDP. 1.2. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are among the wealthiest countries in the world. In terms of gross national income (GNI) per capita, the World Bank ranked Switzerland seventh (US$70,350) and Liechtenstein second (US$136,540) in the world in 2011 1, with territory of 41,285 km2 and 160 km2, and populations of 7.9 million and 36,3002, respectively. Switzerland ranked top in overall global competitiveness in 2012, for the fourth consecutive year.3 1.3. Services and manufacturing are the main se ctors of the Swiss and Liechtenstein economies, with manufacturing largely specialized in high-technology/knowledge-based (i.e. capital-intensive) products, and driven by, inter alia , research and development (R&D). As a result, the demand for their products, notably pharmaceutical products and precision instruments, is relatively price inelastic in general, and their exports have been qu ite resilient to the global crisis (section 1.3). Nonetheless, manufacturing is less important for Switzerland at around 25% of GDP (Table 1.1) and around one fifth of total employment, than for Liechtenstein (39% of GDP and 41% of employment in 2010 4). 1.4. The services sector is the main employer in both Switzerland (close to 72% of total employment) and Liechtenstein (56%); it contributes some 68% of GDP in Switzerland (Table 1.1), and 55% in Liechtenstein.5 Both are net exporters of services. Financial services represent an important branch of the sector and make a significant contribution to GDP in both countries. The worldwide continued confidence in the Swiss franc, supported by, inter alia , sound macroeconomic (including monetary) policies, socio- political stability, and strengthened by global crises, has contributed to the development of the subsector. 1.5. The economic importance of agriculture remains marginal, at around 0.8% of real GDP and 3.8% of total employment in Switzerland, an d 0.8% of total employment in Liechtenstein 6, despite high protection by various tariff and non-tariff measures (Chapters 3 and 4); overall government support by Switzerland represents 2.8 time s the OECD average (Chapter 4.1.4). As a consequence, despite some reform efforts in the sector, domestic prices of agricultural and food products remain high by international comparison. 1 Using Atlas methodology. Swiss GNI was ranked 14th at purchasing power parity (PPP); no data were available for Liechtenstein. 2 Foreigners represented about 67% of Liechtenstein's workforce in 2011; almost half of the workforce lives abroad, mainly in neighbouring regions of Switze rland and Austria (Liechtenstein Office of Statistics.

Under the 1980 Monetary Union Arrangement with Liechtenstein, Switzerland formulates monetary policy for both countries and the Swiss franc (SwF) is also legal tender in Liechtenstein. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free fl oating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is market determined. Nevertheless, in response to the franc's continued appreciation, the SNB has set a minimum exchange rate for the euro against the Swiss franc (section 1.2). The SNB has succeeded in keeping the minimum exchange rate set at SwF 1.20 per euro since 6 September 2011. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 15 - 1.2 Recent Economic Developments 1.7. The economies of Switzerland and Liechtenst ein had been marked by growth and increasing employment for a couple of years up until their last joint TPR in 2008. Since then, the two economies have gone through a period of over all growth (by 1.3% per year on average in the case of Switzerland), despite GDP contraction by 1.9% in Switzerland and 11% in Liechtenstein in 2009, due to the severe 2008/09 global financial cr isis. Both economies started recovering quickly from the crisis. Indeed, after three quarters of economic decline, Switzerland and Liechtenstein experienced stronger than expected growth from mid-2009, driven largely by domestic demand, as well as by recovery in foreign trade7, supported by preferential access under new trade agreements (e.g. the agreement between Switzerland and Japan) and the free movement of persons in Europe. However, with the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone in spring 2010, their economic recovery lost momentum in 2011; Swiss annual GDP growth was 1.9% in 2011, down from 3.0% in the previous year. 1.8. The global financial crisis, followed by the European sovereign debt crisis has led to an increase in the demand for safe assets. As a re sult, the Swiss franc, which is regarded as a safe-haven currency by market participants, has appreciated substantially since the outbreak of the financial crisis. The decline in global (mainly European) demand, in combination with the appreciation of the Swiss franc, has negati vely affected exports, and employment in export-oriented industries. Nonetheless, unemployment remains relatively low in Switzerland (Table 1.1), and Liechtenstein (with unemployment rates not above 3%). 8 Between 2008 and 2011, labour productivity declined annually by 0.53%.9 This drop was mainly caused by the slump in the foreign trade sector in the course of the financial crisis. However, Switzerland's labour productivity has been slow compared with other OECD countries for many years 10; and this has played its part in the slowdown of the Swiss economy and has limited real income increases. 1.9. As a result of the debt-brake rule im plemented by the Swiss Confederation since 200311, substantial fiscal surpluses were recorded at the federal level over 2006-08. The surpluses allowed the implementation of economic stabilization me asures in 2009/10, as well as the package of measures to mitigate the effects of the strong Swiss franc on the economy in 2011-12. The economic stabilization measures implemented over 2009-10 included expenditures on roads (SwF 158 market measures (SwF 247 million); establishment of an ex port platform for SMEs (SwF 25 million); and early redistribution of revenue from the CO 2 tax (SwF 647 million).12 With a view to mitigating the negative effects of a strong Swiss franc on th e economy, a package of SwF 870 million featured, inter alia , short and medium-term measures on unemployment insurance (SwF 500 million), credit arrangements for hotels (SwF 100 million), compensation payments in the area of transportation (SwF 28.5 million), and export subsidies for processed agricultural products (SwF 10 million). The measures aim to, inter alia , offset any currency-related increase in the difference in raw material costs between Switzerland and the EU. 13 1.10. The economic slowdown led to a downward trend in the overall fiscal surpluses from 1.8% of GDP in 2008 to 0.4% in 2011. The overall gr oss debt ratio to GDP also trended downwards, from 39.2% in 2008 to 35.0% in 2011, with the Confederation accounting for slightly more than 7 State Financial Statement 2011.

Due to statistica l recording difficulties, persons in longer-term further education and subject to a qualifying period are likewis e counted as unemployed.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 16 - 50% (Table 1.1). At the federal level, planned expenditures on energy research and early retirement regulations for special categories of st aff, as well as various tax proposals could result in significant receipt losses and/or additional a nnual expenses as from 2014. In order to prevent fiscal deficits14, and therefore an increase in gross debt, the Confederation is planning a fiscal consolidation programme amounting to some SwF 700 million per year over 2014-16. 1.11. A renewed fiscal equalization system has been in force since 2008 to reduce cantonal differences in financial capacity. It comprises a vert ical redistribution from the Confederation to the 26 cantons, as well as a horizontal redistribution among the cantons. An assessment over 2008-11 found that it has, inter alia , strengthened cantonal financial autonomy and reduced disparities in financial resources among cantons.15 1.12. The current account of Liechtenstein's pub lic budget showed a surplus of SwF 59 million in 2009, followed by deficits of SwF 30 million in 2010 and SwF 160 million in 201116; larger deficits are expected for the coming years. The share of public revenue decreased from 23.5% of GDP in 2009 to 21.5% in 2010. In order to continue its policy of zero external debt and to reach overall budget surpluses by 2015, Liechtenstein is considering savings and tax measures. 1.13. According to the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank 17, the SNB shall pursue a monetary policy that ensures price stability while taking due account of the development of the economy. The SNB defines price stability as a rise of less than 2% per annum in the national consumer price index. Continued appreciation of the Swiss franc and the slowdown of the real economy have exerted downward pressure on consumer prices, with the CPI falling by 0.5% in 2009 from its 2008 level, then growing by 0.7% in 2010 and 0.2% in 2011. 1.14. Monetary policy decisions are based on in flation forecasts over a three-year period; the policy aims to ensure price stability in the medium and long term, while allowing short-term fluctuations. The SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target band for the three-month Swiss franc Libor (in general, a spread of one percentage point), and announces an intended level for the Libor within this band. It steers the three-month Libor by influencing money market conditions through, inter alia , liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing operations. 1.15. During the period under review, the SNB pursued an expansionary monetary policy and significantly increased the supply of liquidity to the money market. In December 2008, the lower bound of target range for three-month Swiss franc Libor attained zero. The SNB further narrowed the target range to 0.0-0.75% in March 2009 and to 0.0-0.25% in August 2011. Furthermore, to alleviate pressures on the money markets, the SNB continued, along with other central banks, the euro/Swiss franc swap operations, which started in 2008, until January 2010. In order to forcefully relax monetary conditions, the SNB declared in March 2009 its intention to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. Foreign exchange interventions were temporarily discontinued in June 2010. In response to the st rong appreciation of the Swiss franc over the following year, the SNB eventually set a minimum exchange rate of SwF 1.20 per euro in September 2011, committing to unlimited purchases of foreign currencies, if needed. As a consequence, the foreign currency reserves at the SNB expanded almost tenfold from SwF 46.5 billion in February 2009 to SwF 429.9 billion in 2012. 18 1.3 Developments in Trade and Investment 1.16. Trade is an important driving force of th e Swiss and Liechtenstein economies, with their GDP shares of trade in goods and services exc eeding 100%. Given their degree of dependence on trade, both countries remain sensitive to developmen ts in global demand and to a certain extent to exchange rates. 1.17. Switzerland's current account has been traditionally in surplus driven mainly by trade in services (financial services in particular), followed by investment income; since 2002, despite low global demand and strong appreciation of the Swiss franc, significant merchandise trade surpluses 14 Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs online information.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 17 - have also played a key role. Nevertheless, the cu rrent account surplus fell significantly in 2008 due largely to the impact of the global financial crisis. In particular, the traditional surplus in investment income turned into deficit in 2008 due to the heavy losses by banks' foreign subsidiaries, largely as a result of the significant fall in the income from financial services and from direct investment (Table 1.2). 19 Table 1.2 Balance of paymentsa, 2007-11 (SwF billion) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Current account, net 46.6 11.8 58.4 82.0 49.2 Goods, net -11.7 -16.9 -19.9 Services, -33.5 -33.4 -37.0 -38.0 -40.1 Tourism, net 2.5 3.8 3.5 3.9 3.2 Receipts 14.6 15.6 15.4 15.6 15.6 Expenses -12.1 -11.8 -11.8 -11.6 -12.4 Bank financial services, net 21.0 18.5 15.7 14.7 13.4 Receipts 23.2 20.8 17.8 16.5 15.1 Expenses -2.1 -2.3 27.9 30.4 29.0 Labour and investment income, net 3.1 -39.4 9.3 32.4 1.0 Labour income, net -12.5 -13.2 -13.6 -16.9 -18.5 Receipts -15.6 -16.2 -19.5 -21.1 Investment 55.2 7.1 52.4 75.3 44.1 Other investment 52.3 46.8 15.6 14.7 direct investment in Switzerland 38.9 16.4 31.4 33.9 10.5 Equity capital 12.5 -0.9 19.9 8.2 1.0 Reinvested earnings 36.1 -1.4 26.0 10.6 13.6 Other capital -9.7 Swiss National Bank (2009).

During the period under review, the total value of merchandise imports decreased by 3.8% when measured in SwF but increased by 13.9% when measured in U.S. dollars. This is due to the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc against major currencies, including the U.S. dollar (Table 1.1). Imports are dominated by manufactures, which account for around 80% of the total value. The shares of individual product categories changed little during the period; machinery and transport equipment continue to be the main import items, followed by chemicals. Imports of energy products remain significant, due mainly to higher prices. 1.19. Switzerland is a net food importer. Import s of agricultural goods have been contained by various trade policy measures (Chapter 4.1), and the share of these products in total imports did not change significantly during the period under review. Imports of \"other consumer goods\" increased by 24.6% (in U.S. dollars) between 20 08 and 2011, while those of \"chemicals\" grew by 19.0%, and \"machinery and transport equipment\" by 10.8% (Tables A1.1 and Chart 1.1).

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 21 - 1.20. Due mainly to the fall in global demand (mainly in 2009), merchandise exports decreased by 3.8% (in SwF) between 2008 and 2011; however, in U.S. dollars, they increased by 17.6%. Manufactured products represent the bulk of merc handise exports (almost 90%) from Switzerland (Table A1.2 and Chart 1.1). Chemical products (n otably pharmaceutical products) continue to be the main export, followed by machinery and elec tronics (mainly industrial machinery). Over the review period, the share of watches and precision instruments grew steadily after having declined slightly in 2009. The share of agricultural products increased to around 4% of total exports. 1.21. Exports of products for which demand is of relatively low price elasticity, notably pharmaceutical goods and precision instruments, re gistered a 1.4% decline (in U.S. dollars) in 2009, but started to recover in 2010. During the revi ew period, exports of \"other consumer goods\" grew by 26.2% (in U.S. dollars), and those of ch emicals by 25.8%, while those of \"machinery and transport equipment\" grew by only 1.7%. 1.22. The European Union (EU) remains by fa r Switzerland's largest supplier of merchandise (around 80% of total imports), and the major destination for its exports (around 60% of total exports) (Tables A1.3 and A1.4; and Chart 1.2). Within the EU, Germany is the main supplier and the main destination; the shares of the two other EFTA members remain low; and the United States is the main non-European trading partner. 1.23. Some changes have taken place regarding the export destinations of Swiss products. The EU's share decreased from 61.0% in 2008 to 56.9% in 2011; this was mitigated by an increase in exports to Asia (mainly China) as well as to the Middle East and Russia, reflecting the continued geographical diversification of Swiss exports (Tab le A1.4 and Chart 1.2). Asia's share as both import origin and export destination for Switzerland has increased since 2008. In general, the destinations for Swiss merchandise exports are more diversified than the sources of its imports. 1.24. Switzerland has traditionally been a net exporter of services (Table 1.2). Receipts from bank financial services, which made up nearly one third of total receipts from services at the time of the last TPR, decreased significantly, from SwF 20.8 billion in 2008 to SwF 15.1 billion in 2011. The global downturn, along with a stronger Swiss franc, also resulted in stagnation in receipts from tourism and a slight decline in its share of the total. However, there was a significant rise in receipts from merchanting 20, which replaced financial services as the most important export category. Technological services accounted for a large share of total service expenses, which have grown significantly since 2008, especially licence and patent fees, and replaced tourism expenses as the most important import category. 21 1.3.1.2 Liechtenstein 1.25. Liechtenstein's direct exports and direct imports (i.e. excluding trade with Switzerland) reached SwF 3.3 billion and SwF 2.0 billion, respectively, in 2011. Liechtenstein runs direct merchandise trade surpluses. However, in addition to direct imports, Liechtenstein imports (e.g. automobiles) indirectly from third countries via Switzerland. The EU is Liechtenstein's main supplier of direct imports, and largest destination for direct exports. Its main single sources and destinations are Switzerland, Germany, and the United States. 1.26. Like Switzerland, Liechtenstein experienced a sharp drop in exports at the beginning of 2009, but the fall in its direct exports was much st eeper (down by 35% from the second quarter of 2008), as its export destinations are less diversified than Switzerland's. Since then, Liechtenstein's direct exports have recovered (Table 1.3). 20 A company engages in merchanting when it purchase s goods from a supplier abroad and sells them to a buyer abroad without the goods entering or leaving the domestic economy. Because merchanting is common in commodity trading, merchanting and commodity tradin g are often used as synonyms (Swiss National Bank, 2012b). 21 Swiss National Bank (2012b). WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 22 - Table 1.3 Liechtenstein's direct imports and exports, 2007-11 Year Direct imports (million SwF) Percentage change Direct exports (million SwF) Percentage Source: Liechtenstein authorities. 1.3.2 Investment 1.27. The high living standards, highly skilled labour force, flexible labour laws, reliable infrastructure, as well as relatively low levels of taxation, are considered to make Switzerland one of the most attractive locations for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world. 22 Despite the high levels of wages and input prices, these conditions have made Switzerland a main destination for FDI in the services sector as well as in high-technology manufacturing branches such as advanced electronics, pharmaceuticals, and medical engineering. Liechtenstein benefits from similar advantages. Nevertheless, the small size of the two countries and their high production costs have somewhat limited investment opportunities and contributed to maintaining gross fixed capital formation at relatively low levels (around 20% of GDP for Switzerland since 1996). 1.28. Inward FDI in Switzerland fluctuated considerably during the period under review (Table 1.2). After a decline in 2008, during the global crisis, it rose in 2009 and 2010, before weakening significantly in 2011. Trade and finance and holding companies received the bulk of these investments, while metals and machinery registered disinvestment. 23 The stock of FDI has been on an upward trend over the period under review (Table 1.4). 1.29. According to the SNB, the low FDI inflows in Switzerland in 2011 were partly due to intragroup lending (foreign companies financing their Swiss subsidiaries), with outflows of SwF 4 billion in 2011 compared with inflows of SwF 15 billion in 2010; purchases and capital increases in equity capital amounted to SwF 1 billion in 2011, compared with SwF 8 billion in 2010.24 1.30. The EU is a major source of FDI in Switze rland (Table 1.4). The United States, the largest single source of FDI in Switzerland in 2008, divested SwF 36.1 billion in 2009 (Table 1.4). 1.31. Switzerland remains a net FDI source, although, in 2009, inward FDI in Switzerland slightly exceeded Swiss direct investment abroad (Table 1.4). The earnings situations of Swiss companies has a significant influence on investment behaviour; Swiss corporate investment activities declined significantly as a result of the financial crisis, in particular the losses recorded by banks and insurance companies. 25 Outward FDI decreased somewhat between 2007 and 2009, and rose significantly in 2010, due mainly to higher investment by finance and holding companies. In 2011, FDI declined again, due mainly to foreign-controlled finance and holding companies' withdrawals from their subsidiaries abroad. 26 1.32. The major destinations for outward FDI from Switzerland are the EU and North America, whose combined share is usually between two thir ds and three quarters of the total. Asia has become an increasingly important destination, with capital outflows to the region amounting to SwF 8.2 billion in 2009 and SwF 16.6 billion in 2011. 27 Switzerland has also invested in the 22 OECD online information, \"FDI Performance and Potentia l Rankings\".

Swiss companies have invested abroad in, inter alia , insurance companies, trade, chemicals and plastics, and other manufacturing industries and construction; investment activity varies greatly among different industries. 29 At SwF 19.8 billion, manufacturing invested significantly more abroad in 2011 after a significant decline in the previous two years. Direct investment by the services sector generally declined during the pe riod under review, except in 2010. In particular, 29 Swiss National Bank (2012a).

Since 2006, Swiss FDI data have also included Liechtenstein; no separate data are available. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 26 - 2 TRADE AND INVESTMENT REGIMES 2.1 General Framework1 2.1. Switzerland is a federal republic with a system of direct democracy in which the people are sovereign. Liechtenstein is a constitutional hereditary monarchy, based on a democratic2 and parliamentary system, in which power is shared by the Reigning Prince and the people. 2.2. The constitutional foundations of Swiss fo reign economic law are found in Articles 54 and 101 of the Constitution. Article 54 gives the Confederat ion comprehensive powers in the area of foreign affairs, and forms the basis for the foreign economic law derived from international treaties. Under Article 101, the Confederation must safeguard the interests of the Swiss economy, which also involves promotional measures (Export Promotion Act). Moreover, Article 101 forms a partial basis for the guarantee relating to export and investment risks and for the legislation on technical barriers to trade. 2.3. In the case of Liechtenstein, trade-related articles in the Constitution include Articles 20 and 22. Article 20 states that the State shall prom ote and support agriculture, the cultivation of the Alps, trade and industry, and that it shall pay special attention to the design of a transportation infrastructure conforming to modern requirements. Article 22 stipulates the sovereignty of the State over hunting, fishing, an d mining and instructs the State, when enacting laws in these sectors, to protect the interests of agriculture and communal revenues. 2.4. In Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), under the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research is responsible for overall economic policy, including the formulation and implementation of trade policy (Table 2.1). SECO also helps to ensure access to all markets for Swiss goods, services, and investment. On the national level, SECO acts as an interface between business, tr ade unions, NGOs, and Government. SECO is also involved in efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries in the form of economic development cooperation. Switzerland's relations with the European Union are coordinated by the Directorate for European Affairs (DEA) of the Federa l Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). 3 Table 2.1 Main trade-related laws and regulations, 2012 Legislation Entry into force/ latest amendment Reference Switzerland Federal laws on intellectual property and protection of data, 1931-01a 1932-2002/2011 Laws in the series RS 23 Ordinances on animal husbandry, 1984-11a 1985-2012/2011 Ordinances in the series RS 916.3 Federal Law on government procurement of 16 December 1994a 1 January 1996/2012 RS 172.056.1 Federal Law against unfair competition of 19 December 1986 1 March 1988/2012 RS 241 Federal Law on cartels and other impediments to competition of 6 October 1995 1 February 1996/2008 RS 251 Federal Law on the protection of animals of 16 December 2005a 1 September 2008/2010 RS 455 Federal Law on war material of 13 December 1996a 1 April 1998/2009 RS 514.51 Federal Law on national economic supply of 8 October 1982a 1 September 1983/2007 RS 531 Customs Law of 18 March 2005a 1 May 2007/2011 RS 631.0 Federal Law on customs tariffs of 9 October 1986a 1 January 1988/2011 RS 632.10 Federal law on stamp duty of 27 June 1973a 1 July 1974/2006 RS 641.10 Federal Law regulating value-added tax of 12 June 2009a 1 January 20101/2011 RS 641.20 Federal laws on taxation of tobacco, beer, alcohol, motor vehicles, and mineral oils, 1932-06a 1933-2007/2011 RS 641.31; 641.411; 680; 641.51; and 641.61 1 See WTO document WT/TPR/S/208/Rev.1, for a detailed presentation of the constitutional and institutional framework for trade policy in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. 2 The people of Liechtenstein enjoy direct democracy rights. 3 As from 1 January 2013, the Integration Office is an Office of the FDFA.

Liechtenstein participates in a customs uni on with Switzerland and employs the Swiss franc as its national currency. Since the entry into force of the Customs Union Treaty in 1924, Switzerland acts on behalf of Liechtenstein in customs union matters, such as trade policy measures affecting imports and exports, and agriculture. Liechtenstein maintains its own regulatory framework in trade in services (i.e. financial services), government procurement, consumer protection, investment, and in some areas of intellectual property rights. In these areas, the bilateral relationship is governed by the EFTA Convention. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 28 - 2.6. Implementation of economic policy is the re sponsibility of the Office of Economic Affairs in Liechtenstein. The Office for Foreign Affairs is responsible for coordinating membership in international agreements (including the WTO Agreement and the EFTA Convention) as well as their administration. In view of Liechtenstein's participation in the European Economic Area (EEA), an EEA Coordination Unit was established. Each office formulates policies in collaboration with other national offices, including the Office for Agriculture 4, and in consultation with the private sector through, inter alia , the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. In 2010, the Government established the Office for International Financial Affairs to coordinate and implement the Government's financial centre strategy and associated measures and tasks. 2.7. Switzerland's primary foreign economic policy objectives are to strengthen the country's economic position in the world. More specifically, Switzerland aims to improve competition in the domestic market; ameliorate regulatory conditions for foreign trade and consolidate its relations with the EU, as outlined in SECO's Foreign Economic Policy Report for 2011; and contribute to economic development in partner countries. Improved market access for Swiss products through multilateral trade liberalization, and bilateral and regional trade agreements is also a main trade policy objective (Table 2.2). Table 2.2 Selected sectoral trade polic y objectives for Switzerland, 2011 Area Policy objectives Agriculture - supply the domestic market with high quality products at competitive prices - continue the reform of the Swiss agricu ltural policy to improve the sector's competitiveness, inter alia , under the hypothesis of further liberalization of agricultural markets Industrial goods - reduce costs associated with cross-border g oods traffic/simplified customs procedures for small shipments - non-discriminatory access to the EU mark et in the area of technical regulations Services - improve market access for Swiss firms in the service sector, especially in financial services, logistics and transport services , tourism services, business services, and distribution services - examine new EU market access regulations fo r certain suppliers of financial services from outside the EU - explore potential for privatization of electr icity market through to the end consumer and for liberalization of postal services Intellectual property - amend the trade mark law and the law on th e coat of arms regarding the applicable criteria to label products or services as \"Swiss\" - include in FTAs provisions for the effect ive protection of intellectual property - support partner countries in establishing authorities and legal systems for the protection of intellectual property Government procurement - improve market access fo r government procurement abroad for Swiss suppliers - harmonize the Swiss Procurement Law - include provisions on government procur ement in FTAs based on the revised GPA Source: SECO online information, \"Foreign Economic Policy Report 2011\". Viewed at: http://www.seco.admin.ch/dokumentation/publikation/00008/00101/04841/index.html?lang=en . 2.8. Liechtenstein's trade policy objectives are set according to the country's trading environment; i.e. the Customs Union Treaty with Switzerland, and membership in EFTA, the EEA, and the WTO. As a country with a very small domestic market and a highly export-oriented economy, Liechtenstein seeks to ensure and extend non-discriminatory market access for its economic operators to the global markets. Libera lization of trade at the multilateral and regional levels (via EFTA), as well as the strengthening of the rules-based international trading system, are high priorities in Liechtenstein's foreign economic policy. 4 In 2013, the Office for Agriculture will become part of the Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Forestry. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 29 - 2.2 Trade Agreements and Arrangements 2.2.1 WTO 2.9. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are both origin al Members of the WTO. They grant at least MFN treatment to all their trading partners, except for certain restrictions related to economic sanctions. 5 Both countries are signatories to the Pluril ateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, the Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products, and the Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). On the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, Switzerland supports a comprehensive round that not only increases market access but also improves existing trade rules, introduces new ones, and promotes coherence between the multilateral trading system and other issues, such as environmental and development policies. 6 Switzerland believes that despite the current impasse, it is important to preserve the progress that has already been achieved in the negotiations, especially in the area of trade facilitation. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are both members of the G107 and are \"W52\" Sponsors.8 Switzerland is a member of Friends of Ambition (NAMA)9, Friends of A-D Negotiations (FANS)10 and of the \"Really Good Friends\" (services).11 2.10. Most of Switzerland's notifications to the WTO also cover Liechtenstein (Table A2.1 and A2.2). However, Liechtenstein submits individual notifications in anti-dumping measures; subsidies and countervailing duties; and state-trading. 2.11. During the period under review, neither Sw itzerland nor Liechtenstein has been involved in any dispute settlement cases, as complainant, respondent, or third party. 2.2.2 Regional agreements 2.12. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are both members of EFTA. In addition, Liechtenstein is a member of the EEA. 2.13. Switzerland has set four main criteria for negotiating preferential agreements: (i) the anticipated economic importance of the country; (ii) the current or potential discrimination towards Switzerland in comparison to major competitors; (iii) the willingness of partner countries to enter into negotiations; and (iv) the political opportuni ties offered by an agreement. On this basis, Switzerland has targeted preferential agreements with three groups of countries: (i) the EU/EFTA countries, with which Switzerland enjoys close relations due to their geographical proximity; (ii) non-European OECD countries, such as the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, and Mexico; and (iii) large emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC countries). 12 2.14. The conclusion of free-trade agreements is aimed at giving Swiss companies greater access to international markets at least equal to that of Switzerland's most important foreign competitors. 5 As of July 2012, sanctions exist against: Iraq, Liberia, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Cong o, Belarus, Democratic Peop le's Republic of Korea (Nor th Korea), Lebanon, Iran, Somalia, Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, and Guinea-Bissau.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 30 - 2.2.2.1 European Free Trade Association (EFTA) 2.15. The EFTA is an intergovernmental organiza tion set up for the promotion of free trade and economic integration to the benefit of its Member s. An updated EFTA Convention was signed in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, on 21 June 2001 by the fo ur current Members: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland and entered into force on 1 June 2002. The revised Vaduz Convention provided a more cohesive framework for economic relations and an improved instrument to manage internal relations, as well as those with current and potential partner countries. In addition, the Convention expanded the scope of EFTA to include new areas, such as trade in services and investment; mutual recognition of conformity assessments; the free movement of persons, social security, and mutual recognitio n of diplomas; land and air transport; public procurement; and intellectual property rights. Mo reover, the functions of the EFTA Council were broadened to reflect the historical changes in EFTA's mission, in particular with respect to EFTA's free-trade agreements with third countries. 2.16. Several amendments to the EFTA Convention have taken effect since 2008. 13 These include amendments on tariff concessions on agricultural products, mutual recognition, air and land transport, and rules of origin. In addition, in 2010, a committee on trade facilitation was established and several committees were abolished from Annex S of the EFTA Convention. 14 During the period under review, negotiations on agriculture have been concluded among EFTA members and are awaiting ratification. 2.17. In 2010, the EFTA states together constituted the world's 11th largest merchandise trader and 7th largest trader in commercial services (counting the EU as one). Intra-EFTA trade was \u20ac2.9 billion, representing 0.6% of total EFTA trade in 2010. 2.18. In July 2009, Iceland made a formal request for EU membership and negotiations for membership were launched in June 2011. If EFTA were to lose Iceland as a member, an evaluation will need to be conducted of the effects on th e rest of the members (Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). All EFTA countries except Switzerland, participate in the European Economic Area (EEA) (section 2.2.2.2. below). 2.19. EFTA states benefit from a large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs). While traditional agreements, known as \"first generation\" 15, are restricted mainly to the movement of goods, protection of intellectual property rights, and competition regulations, more recent or \"second generation\" agreements cover public procurement, services, and investments. 16 I n t h e a r e a o f trade in goods, EFTA FTAs regulate trade in indu strial products, fish, and processed agricultural products. Trade in basic agricultural products is covered by separate bilateral agreements concluded between each EFTA State and the respective partner, individually. 2.20. When preparing for negotiations, EFTA members must first coordinate their national interests. For each set of negotiations with a th ird country, a representative of one member state takes the lead as EFTA spokesperson, with the remaining members also playing an active role. The agreement is signed by all parties and ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures. In EFTA's view, the multilateral and bilateral approaches are mutually supportive. 2.21. Since 2008, seven FTAs between EFTA and other countries have been notified to the WTO, bringing the total number of notified RTAs in force to 23. (Table A2.3). 2.22. Under the Early Announcement provision of the WTO Transparency Mechanism for RTAs (under negotiation, or signed but not yet in force), there are seven agreements between EFTA and other countries (Table 2.3). 13 EFTA online information.

The EEA agreement forms the legal basis for economic cooperation between the three EEA EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and the EU (27 Members). As parties to the EEA, the three countries are full participants in the EU's Internal Market, which is based on the principle of the free movement of goods, services, capita l, and persons, with uniform and common rules governing competition, including state aid. In addition, the agreement covers cooperation in research and development, education, social policy, the environment, consumer protection, tourism, and culture. The EEA Agreement provides for the on-going inclusion of new EU legislation in all policy areas covered by the EU's Internal Ma rket. In total, 6,817 EU acts are applicable at the end of 2012 in Liechtenstein. Switzerland, though not a member, benefits from observer status in the EEA EFTA structure (Box 2.1). 17 2.24. On trade, the EEA Agreement can be regarded as an FTA and, as such, does not include the following EU policies: Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies; Common Trade Policy; Common Foreign and Security Policy; Justice and Home Affair s (the EFTA countries are part of the Schengen area); or Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Box 2.1 Liechtenstein's Market Co ntrol and Surveillance Mechanism As a consequence of Liechtenstein's EEA membership since 1 May 1995, and in order to maintain the Customs Union with Switzerland (Switzerland is not an EEA member), Liechtenstein must ensure within its territory the parallel marketability of goods under both the Swiss and EEA rules. To this end, Liechtenstein maintains a Market Control and Surveillance Mechanism (MCSM), which applies to imports subject to customs tariffs or non-tariff requirements that are different in the EEA and Switzerland. The MCSM is aimed at ensuring that goods that do not satisfy Swiss import requirements do not enter the Swiss market via th e open border. The MCSM has been accepted by the other EEA members (EEA Council Decision No. 1/95). The MCSM applies to professional traders, i.e. dist ributors/dealers (but not to small importers), and to three categories of goods (LGBl. 2009/394, Annex 1): (i) products on which Swiss and EEA import requirements are different (e.g. pharmaceuticals, chemicals/goods hazardous to the environment, genetically modified organisms, some telecom equipment); (ii) goods subject to different tariffs under the 1972 FTA between Switzerland and the EU on the one hand, and the EEA agreement on the other (i.e. fish and fish products); and (iii) sa lt (in accordance with the EEA provisions on state monopolies, Liechtenstein no longer participates in the Swiss state monopoly for salt (Chapter 3.3.4.2.7). The differences in technica l requirements between Switzerland and the EEA have been reduced substantially since 1995. 17 Accession to the EEA Agreement was rejected in a referendum in Switzerland in 1992. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 32 - Under the MCSM, the Swiss Federal Customs Administration clears all imports to Liechtenstein, collects duties, and informs the Liechtenstein Office of Economic Affairs. Where customs tariffs differ, the Swiss Customs reimburses importers the duties paid and informs them of their obligations, including the submission of proof of sale in Liec htenstein. Where import requirements differ, goods destined for Liechtenstein, in transit in Switzerl and, are registered at the Swiss Customs, which sends an electronic copy of the customs documents to the Liechtenstein Office of Economic Affairs for processing. When in doubt (e.g. whether an importer has obtained a wrongful reimbursement of customs duties, or has paid the required customs duties on goods re-exported to Switzerland), the Liechtenstein administration may launch further investigations. For this purpose, any business involved in the production and import of the relevant goods must appoint an official contact person. Wholesalers and retailers must specify in their stores that use of the products is limited to the Liechtenstein territory and must keep proof of sale s. Infringements of MCSM provisions are liable to fines of up to 20 times the amount of the custom s duties wrongfully reimbursed or unpaid, or imprisonment for up to 6 months. Infringements identified so far have not entailed any criminal action; they have led only to written reprimands. Source: WTO Secretariat. 2.2.2.3 Bilateral agreements 2.25. The EU is by far Switzerland's most important commercial partner (Chapter 1). Swiss-EU relations have developed and deepened over th e decades. Since the Free Trade Agreement of 1972, an ever denser network of agreements has been developed. After the rejection by Swiss voters of Swiss accession to the EEA in 1992, Switzerland and the EU concluded seven agreements (in 1999) known as Bilaterals I (Free Movement of Persons, Technical Barriers to Trade, Public Procurement, Agriculture, Overland Transport, Civil Aviation, and Research). These were followed in 2004 by nine agreements (Schengen/Dublin, Taxation of Savings, Fight Against Fraud, Processed Agricultural Products, Environment, St atistics, MEDIA, and Pensions, and an exchange of letters on Education, vocational training, youth) known as Bilaterals II. These agreements provide both parties with extensive market access and form the basis for close cooperation in key policy areas, such as research, security, asylum, the environment, and cultural affairs. 18 2.26. This bilateral approach allows Switzerland to conduct a policy of openness and close collaboration with all its European neighbors. These bilateral agreements have been submitted to the Swiss electorate and endorsed at regular intervals; the last approval by voters was for the extension of the Agreement on the Free Movement o f P e r s o n s , o n 8 F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 9 . O n i t s assessment of the Swiss European policy in 2010, the Federal Council concluded that the Swiss-EU bilateral relations remain the most suitable way for Switzerland's current european policy. 19 2.27. During the period under review, several bilateral agreements were amended or signed. The 1990 Agreement on Customs Facilitation and Security, which regulates the controls and formalities for goods transport at the border between Switzerland and the EU and aims to simplify customs procedures, was amended following the introducti on of security measures for goods traffic between the EU and third countries on 1 July 2009. In order for these EU measures not to apply to Switzerland, Switzerland has modified the 1990 Ag reement and expanded some of its security aspects by negotiating with the EU. The new Agreement on Customs Facilitation and Security precludes the obligation to notify in advance goods traffic between the EU and Switzerland and governs the modalities of further cooperation between Switzerland and the EU in the area of security. The agreement was signed on 25 June 2009 and applied on a provisional basis until it entered into force on 1 January 2011. 2.28. Other amended or newly introduced Swiss-EU trade-related agreements include the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), which is regularly extended and modified, the last time in December 2011. In May 2011, Switzerland and the EU signed the Bilateral Agreement on Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs) of agricultural products. In the autumn of 2011, Switzerland and the EU began negotiations on cabotage law in air transport. Further mutual 18 See WTO document WT/TPR/S/208/Rev.1, pp. 29-31 for some background on the bilateral agreements. 19 Integration Office FDFA/FDEA, \"Switzerland's European Policy\", September 2010.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 33 - market access negotiations and trade liberalization are ongoing with the EU on agriculture, health, electricity/energy and chemicals safety. 2.29. In addition to the agreement with the EU , Switzerland has signed two bilateral agreements: an FTA with the Faeroe Islands, signed in 1995; and an FTA with Japan signed in 2009. The provisions of the FTA with Japan also apply to Liechtenstein, based on the Customs Union Treaty. On 28 January 2011, Switzerland launched negotiat ions with China to further expand its network of bilateral agreements. 2.30. During the period under review, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have not been involved in any disputes under their regional or bilateral agreements.20 2.2.2.4 Non-reciprocal pr eferential arrangements 2.31. Switzerland grants tariff preferences to developing countries via its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).21 The Swiss GSP has been revised several times since its introduction in 1972; the most recent revisions were in 2007 and 2011. On 1 March 2007, the Federal Law on the Granting of Tariff Preferences for Developing Countries (RS 632.91) entered into force, giving a strong, long-term legal basis to the Swiss GSP, which had previously been prolonged by decrees from the Federal Council. On 16 March 2007, the Federal Ordinance on Preferential Tariff Rates for Developing Countries (RS 632.911) was revised, in troducing duty-free, quota-free (DFQF) market access for products originating from LDCs, with two exceptions, broken rice (HS 1006.4020) and sugar (HS1701.1100/9999), on which duties were released fully in September 2009. Furthermore, the countries that could benefit from the Swiss GSP were reconsidered, and tariff preferences for agricultural goods for all beneficiary countries were enlarged by including most processed agricultural products. 2.32. On 1 May 2011, the revised Federal Ordinance on Rules of Origin on Tariff Preferences for Developing Countries (RS 946.39) entered into force, providing origin criteria identical to those newly adopted by the EU and Norway in their GSPs , for products of HS chapters 25-97. The main modifications are reductions in the number of specific rules and in the local value-added required. Moreover, a large number of goods from LDCs are gr anted softer rules than from other developing countries. 22 The list of beneficiary countries and territories was modified on 1 July 2011 and on 15 August 2012, to take into account, among others, new free-trade agreements signed by Switzerland. Producers from developing countri es may take advantage of a unified European market with respect to origin rules. 2.33. According to the Swiss authorities, the Sw iss GSP utilization rate varies between 40% and 50% of its potential because of, inter alia , the complexity of rules conferring national origin to goods (Chart 2.1). In 2011, goods imported into Switzerland under the Swiss GSP amounted to SwF 4.6 billion. This amount could have been SwF 9.2 billion had all exporters potentially qualifying for the Swiss GSP made use of it. The simpler rules of origin, according to the revised ordinance, are expected to enhance access to the Swiss market for products from developing countries. 23 20 Any dispute arising from the EFTA Convention would be dealt with according to the provisions of Chapter XVII of the Convention, which provides fo r consultations among member states, and dispute settlement through arbitration. Specific provisions on th e establishment and functioning of the arbitral tribunal and the implementation of arbitral awards are set out in Annex T of the EFTA Convention. 21 UNCTAD (2013). 22 Federal Ordinance of 16 March 2007 ( Etat 1 July 2011) on Preferential Tariff Rates for Developing Countries (RS 632.911), and Federal Ordinance of 30 March 2011 on Rules of Origin for the Swiss Generalized System of Preferences (RS 946.39). 23 FDEA online information.

Economic freedom, which is guaranteed under the Swiss Constitution, allows nationals and foreigners to operate a business in Switzerland, to form a company or to hold an interest in one. 24 In general, to establish a business, there is no requirement for approval by the authorities, membership of chambers of commerce or professional associations, or annual reporting of operating figures. However, foreign nationals must have both work and residence permits in order to conduct business on a permanent basis. 2.35. Most economic sectors are open to investment by Swiss nationals and foreigners. However, investment restrictions continue to apply to areas under state monopolies, including certain rail transport services, some postal services, and certain insurance services and commercial activities (e.g. trade in salt). Restrictions (in the form of domicile requirements) are also applied in air and maritime transport 25, hydroelectric and nuclear power, operation of oil and gas pipelines, and transportation of explosive materials. 2.36. Licensing provisions and diploma requir ements may apply to some professions and/or commercial activities, such as banking, insurance, and investment brokerage; hotels and restaurants; physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and attorneys; and certain mercantile and services businesses (e.g. wine merchants, private employment agencies, and temporary employment services). 2.37. Swiss company law distinguishes mainly between partnership-type unincorporated companies (sole proprietorship, limited partnership or general partnership), and capital-based incorporated companies (stock corporation or AG , limited liability company or GmbH). The newly created (2006) \"limited partnership for collective investment\" corresponds to the limited partnership form common in English-speaking countries. Approximately 50% of Swiss companies operate under the AG and GmbH legal forms (Table 2.4). 24 The Code des Obligations is the main legal basis for investment in Switzerland. 25 Two thirds of the partners of a ship ping company must be Swiss nationals.

The time can be shorter depending on the business and the specific canton. Foreign operations located in Switzerland generally take the form of a stock corporation (AG). However, if the Swiss branch is being established as a sole proprietorship, a general partnership or a limited partnership, the foundation process may be handled entirely online via the government SME portal. 27 This online process includes documents required for registration of a sole proprietorsh ip in the Commercial Register, for value-added tax (VAT), and for social insurance obligations. In gene ral, any trading, manufacturing or other form of commercial company must be registered in the Commercial Register. All entries and/or deletions from the Commercial Register are published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC).28 2.39. The World Bank ranks Switzerland 26th (out of 183 countries) for ease of doing business, with an average of 85 days to start a business, based on the procedures, time, cost, and paid-in minimum capital for starting a business.29 2.40. Due to Switzerland's federal structure, taxes levied on businesses may be federal, cantonal and/or communal.30 2.41. As at end 2012, Switzerland had signed double-taxation conventions with 86 countries31; and 130 bilateral investment treaties (BITs), kn own as investment promotion and protection agreements. After Germany and China, Switzerland has the world's third largest network of such agreements. Switzerland ratified the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Convention in 1988. It has also been contracting party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States since 1968. 2.3.2 Liechtenstein 2.42. Liechtenstein has a stable and predictable investment regime. Most sectors are open to national and foreign investment, except for reside ncy requirements; restrictions on the purchase of real estate; restrictions in production, trade, an d transport of electricity, gas, and water (subject to state monopoly); and restrictions applied to a number of financial services (asset management, investment consulting, and assuming trusteeships) when these are provided on a professional basis by trustees or trust companies. 2.43. A permit or a licence is required to do business, with specific licensing requirements for financial sector companies and professional services. The establishment of a commercial entity by a natural person is subject to prior permanent re sidence during 12 years for citizens of non-EEA member states (other than Switzerland).

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 37 - government-recognized professional qualifications are required.32 Companies wishing to operate commercially in Liechtenstein must submit an application for a commercial licence to the Office of Economic Affairs. In order to be granted the licence, a manager who meets the 12-year prior-residence and professional-qualification requ irements must be appointed. All entities (of natural or legal persons) must have an office in Liechtenstein that is suitable to carry out the business. 2.44. Liechtenstein corporate forms are regulated under the law on Persons and Companies Law of 1926, known as the \"PGR Code\". Trust companies are established under the Trust Enterprise Law of 1928. The most common entities established under the PGR Code include public limited companies, establishments, and foundations (Table A2.4). All corporate bodies established under the PGR Code must be registered with the Public Register. Processing by the Public Registrar usually takes two to three days. In January 2012, the agency \"Liechtenstein Marketing\" was established to promote, inter alia , foreign investment and tourism. 2.45. Since 1 January 2011, Liechtenstein has a new tax regime with a corporate income tax rate of 12.5% for all economically active companie s (Table 2.5). The special tax treatment of domiciliary or holding companies was abolished since this special tax type threatened to violate the EEA Agreement with respect to the prohibition of state aid. 33 The 2011 Tax Act contains a provision on non-economically-active \"private asset structures\" that is compatible with EEA law.34 Public enterprises not engaged in economic activities; institutions for occupational retirement; or legal entities conducting exclusively charitable activities are tax exempt. The 2011 Tax Act also contains a provision regarding intellectual property related income (IP-Box) that is compatible with EEA law. 35 Table 2.5 Liechtenstein corporate taxes and other selected taxes, 2012 Tax base Standard tax rates Corporate income tax (annual): annual net income 12.5% (minimum SwF 1,200) Private asset structures SwF 1,200 Formation tax: formation of share capital (applicable only when the Swiss provisions on stamp duties do not apply) Capital > SwF 1,000,000: 1% 0.3% Real-estate gains tax (per sale of real estate located in Liechtenstein) Maximum 21% Personal income tax (worldwide income) Maximum 21% Net wealth tax (worldwide net assets) Intellectual property related income Maximum 0.84% 80% of net income is tax-exempt Note: Private asset structures are legal entities that do not carry out any economic activities and that exclusively acquire, hold, administer, and sell financial instruments, as well as participations in other legal entities, cash, and bank account balances. A private asset structure may hold participations only under the condition that such structure, its shareholders or beneficiaries do not exert actual control, direct or indirect, on the manage ment of such companies through influence.

As a result of the Savings Agreement between Liechtenstein and the EU, Liechtenstein has been imposing, since 1 July 2005, a withholding tax on interest and other savings returns paid to beneficial owners resident in EC countries. 36 In 2011, the applicable rate reached the maximum of 35%. The Swiss Federal Law on stamp duty applies under the Customs Union Treaty. 32 There are 64 \"qualified\" or regulated professions.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 38 - 2.47. Since 2009, Liechtenstein has been creating a network of tax information exchange agreements (TIEA) and double taxation agreements (DTA).37 All TIEAs and 6 of the 8 DTAs are in accordance with the OECD model conventions. Liechtenstein has not concluded any bilateral investment protection treaties. 37 19 TIEAs are currently in force (December and the Grenadines; Sweden; United Kingdom; and the United States. 8 DTAs are currently in force with: Austria; Germ Kingdom; and Uruguay. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 39 - 3 TRADE POLICIES AND PRACTICES BY MEASURE 3.1 Measures Directly Affecting Imports 3.1.1 Customs procedures and trade facilitation 3.1. Customs procedures in Switzerland and Liec htenstein continue to improve with the aim of facilitating trade while securing their borders, and protecting consumers and the environment. A customs declaration may be made prior to the arrival of the merchandise, electronically through the e-dec for imports and exports (an electronic system with registration for professionals) or in written form; for tourists, customs declarations may be made verbally. 1 Most customs procedures are done electronically. An electronic customs declaration is obligatory for imports of, inter alia , agricultural goods subject to tariff quotas (with some exceptions)2, and for certain alcoholic beverages that are to be put in a bonded warehouse. However, a paper customs declaration is possible when an electronic one is not prescrib ed or if the importer has not been granted permission to file an electronic customs declaration.3 According to the authorities, as of 1 January 2013, all commercial customs declarations must be in electronic format under a new system known as \"e-dec-web\". This system is free of charge, requires no registration and replaces the Single Administrative Document (SAD). It aims to assist small and medium-sized companies. 3.2. Documentation requirements for customs clearance for exports and imports include the customs declaration, commercial invoice, bill of lading, and certificates for preferential tariffs, health, or quality control purposes. Customs is the only agency at the border and therefore, Switzerland does not have a \"single window\" for the release and clearance of goods. 3.3. Switzerland has been a member of the Schengen Agreement since 2008. As a result of the Agreement, cooperation between participating countr ies in border controls has been strengthened; this also involves joint cross-border activities. 3.4. The 1990 Agreement on Customs Facilitation and Security between Switzerland and the EU was amended following the introduction of security measures on goods traffic between the EU and third countries on 1 July 2009. While the amended agreement precludes the obligation to notify in advance goods traffic between the EU and Switzerlan d, traders from third countries are required to submit a prior notification requirement and are su bject to a security risk analysis. The agreement was signed on 25 June 2009 and applied on a provisional basis until it entered into force on 1 January 2011. In order to help facilitate customs procedures for non-EU traders, Switzerland has adopted an authorized economic operator (AEO) system, which aims to ease customs security regulations for accredited companies. 3.5. Due to its geographical location and its excellent infrastructure, Switzerland is a transit country. Import duties must be secured temporarily (through a cash deposit or a guarantee) for goods in transit through Switzerland. For more than 90% of transit procedures for goods transported by road, duties are secured by a gu arantee valid for several transit procedures. Any applicable bans or restrictions must also be observed. Switzerland mainly uses the two most important international transit procedures in commercial goods traffic: the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) and the TIR procedure. No transit duties or fees are levied. The transit procedures are also applied for moving goods to or from Switzerland as more than 75% of the goods are cleared by Customs at the premises of authorized consignees or consignors inland. 3.6. The Swiss Federal Customs Administration may issue an advance binding ruling of the preferential origin of a good, pursuant to Arti cle 20 of the Customs Law. The application for a binding assessment must be presented in writing to the customs authorities in the country where the applicant is domiciled. Such assessments remain valid for six years provided the facts and conditions under which they have been made remain comparable. 3.7. Switzerland is active in the Negotiating Group on Trade Facilitation (NGTF), where it supports a multilateral agreement on trade facilitation an d has tabled and co-sponsored several proposals. 1 RS 631.013. 2 Refer to RS 631.013, for the list of the exceptions. 3 Federal Customs Administration ordinance on cu stoms (RS 631.013), Chapter 2, section 2 indicates when importers are not authorized to ma ke an electronic customs declaration.

Customs account for more than one thir d of the Confederation's total revenue. In 2011, customs revenue amounted to SwF 23.5 billion, with VAT alone accounting for 51% of total customs revenue, and import duties accounting for 4% (Chart 3.1 ). Customs revenue collected by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration is shared with Liechtenstein on a per capita basis.

As both Switzerland and Liechtenstein levy only specific duties, neither country has specific legislation on customs valuation; however, they do need to assess customs value for internal-taxation purposes, since the value-added tax and the motor vehicle tax are both ad valorem (section (3.1.4). Goods are normally cleared on the basis of their gross weight (in most cases); this dutiable weight comprises the actual (net) weight (the actual weight of the goods, and the weight of the immediate packin g materials), plus the weight of the packing 4 WTO document, TN/TF/W/170, 17 March 2010. 5 WTO document, TN/TF/W/110/Rev.2, 5 October 2009. 6 WTO document, TN/TF/W/133/Rev.3, 26 June 2009. 7 WTO document, TN/TF/W/164, 11 November 2009. 8 WTO document, TN/TF/W/117/Rev.1, 20 February 2009. 9 WTO document, TN/TF/W/136/Rev.2, 28 November 2008. 10 WTO document, TN/TF/W/131/Rev.1, 14 December 2007. 11 WTO document, TN/TF/W/112, 6 June 2006. 12 WTO document, TN/TF/W/155/Rev.2, 3 August 2009. 13 WTO document, TN/TF/W/158, 23 February 2009. 14 WTO document, TN/TF/W/124/Rev.2, 7 February 2008. 15 WTO document, TN/TF/W/115/Rev.1, 20 October 2007. 16 WTO document, TN/TF/W/107, 6 June 2006.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein apply both no n-preferential and preferential rules of origin. They apply the same non-preferential rules of origin, which continue to be regulated by the Ordinance on attestation of the non-preferential origin of goods. 19 3.11. Preferential rules of origin are established under the Regional Convention on Pan-euro-Mediterranean Preferential Rules of Origin, free-trade agreements concluded with countries outside the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone, and pursuant to the GSP scheme.20 Exporters may benefit from tolerance rules and the various forms of cumulation permitted under the respective agreements. 3.12. The rules of origin under the EFTA FTAs with third countries are modelled closely on the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean rules of origin. Protocol 3 to the Free Trade Agreement between Switzerland and the European Union sets out the preferential rules of origin. The Pan-European Origin Cumulation System, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, allows the use of any material from any country within the zone (EFTA, EU, and Turkey) to produce a good, whilst retaining preferential origin. This diagonal cumulation system is being extended gradually to the Faroe Islands and to Mediterranean countries and territories participating in the euro-Mediterranean partnership (i.e. to Egypt, Is rael, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip). Pursuant to the Federal Ordinance on the revised rules of origin for the Swiss GSP, which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Switzerland's GSP rules of origin have been harmonized with the EU, including the rules contained in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1063/2010 of 18 November 2010. 3.1.3 Tariffs 3.1.3.1 General features 3.13. Under the 1923 Customs Union Treaty, Switze rland acts on behalf of Liechtenstein in customs matters; the Swiss tariff generally applies to imports to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. There have been no major changes in the Swiss tariff since 2008. The tariff comprises only specific rates and affords higher protection to agricultural products than to non-agricultural goods. Imports are taxed according to the federal Law on customs tariffs, generally on the basis of gross weight (section 3.2.2.1). 3.14. Under the Federal Customs Law on Tariffs 21, the Federal Council may modify tariffs for the customs union through an ordinance. The modifications are temporary until approved by the Federal Assembly. Any tariff increase would be ma de only after a case-by-case evaluation, which takes into account the needs of the Swiss economy. No such measures were taken during the period under review. 3.15. Seasonal tariffs apply to some 95 products and are levied mostly on fruits and vegetables produced domestically, most of which are also subject to tariff quotas. 17 Unpacked goods and those whose package is deemed not to provide \"sufficient\" protection against damage during transportation, are liable to an \"additional tare\", a supplement equal to the difference between the gross and net weights. The \"additional tare\" is ex pressed as a percentage of the net weight and is stipulated by HS tariff line in the Ordinance sur la tare (RO1987 2652), and varies from 100% for goods whose net weight is almost nil (petroleum gases and other ga seous hydrocarbons), to 5%. Goods may also be cleared on the basis of net weight if the import er so requests: in this case, if there is no set \"additional tare\" rate for the specific item, a statutory rate of 10% applies. 18 RS 632.10. 19 See RS 946.31. 20 See WTO document WT/TPR/S/208/Rev.1 for a detailed presentation of the preferential rules of origin in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. 21 Loi sur le tarif des douanes, RS 632.10. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 42 - 3.16. Tariff quotas apply to agricultural products (3.8% of all tariff lines) and cover, inter alia , live animals, eggs, bovine semen, cut flowers, pota toes, fresh and frozen vegetables, fresh fruits, wine, and certain cereals. Tariff quotas may be modi fied, mostly as a result of domestic shortages. Thus, imports above the specified quotas are in some instances allowed at the in-quota tariff rates (Chapter 4.2). The process of quota allocation varies according to product (A4.1). All of the preferential agreements concluded by Switzerland an d Liechtenstein also include preferential tariff quotas (Table 3.1). Allocation of MFN and preferen tial quotas is indistinguishable. An electronic application system (\"e-quota\") is used.

The Swiss/Liechtenstein tariff comprises only specific duties with ad valorem equivalents ranging from zero to 1,676%, up from 1,468.7% in 2008.22 Some 83.6% of all lines carry rates up 22 Despite the seeming simplicity of the administration of specific duties, their shortcomings include lack of transparency and predictability; and due to the disparate levels of protec tion afforded to similar goods, as the basis of the tariff is (in general) the weight of imported goods, its impa ct tends to be higher on relatively heavy and cheap goods than on expensive and light products within the same tariff line. In particular, over the review period (mainly 2011-12), the downward trend in the global prices of agricultural goods and the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc have led to high ad valorem equivalents of specific duties. For more on the shortcomings of specific du ties, see WTO (2001), Box III.1. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 43 - to 10% (Chart 3.2).23 Tariff protection varies substantially across and within sectors, averaging 31.9% for agricultural products and 2.3% fo r non-agricultural goods (WTO definitions). 3.18. Duty-free treatment applies to 18.7% of all tariff lines (18.3% of WTO agricultural lines and 18.8% of non-agricultural lines), including nuts, fr uits, tea, some cereals, seeds, cocoa, vanilla, live animals, fish and crustaceans, animal and vegetable fats, petroleum, certain chemicals, raw silk, wool, cotton and jute, base metals, and products granted duty-free treatment under the Pharmaceutical Initiative24, the Information Technology Agreement, and the Plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Another 38.8% of lines bear non-zero rates of less than 2% (nuisance rates). The maximum rate (on an AVE basis) of 1, 676% applies to frozen bovine offal, other than tongue and liver (HS 0206.2990). Chart 3.2 Breakdown of applied MFN tariffs, lines Cumulated percentage (right-hand scale) Note: Figures in parentheses indicate the share of total lines. Calculations exclude in-quota rates. They do not add to 100% since some AVEs were not available (4.3% of all lines). Source: WTO Secretariat calculations, based on data provided by the authorities. 3.19. The tariff structure has changed little since th e last Review of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The adoption of the HS2012 tariff nomenclature increased the total number of tariff lines to 8,299. As a result, and following the downward trend in th e global prices of agricultural products and the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc (with likely increases in the AVEs of specific duties), the overall simple average rate of the 2012 applied MFN rate tariff increased to 9.2%, up from 8.1% in 2008 (Table 3.2). The coefficient of variation of 5. 3 (4.8 in 2008) depicts high dispersion of the tariff rates (the ad valorem equivalents); the high dispersion is a consequence of specific tariffs (with highly dispersed AVEs), generally higher on agricultural products than on non-agricultural goods. However, some international tariff peaks al so apply to certain non-agricultural products, including textiles and clothing items (HS Chapters 54, 56, and 63). 25 23 The AVEs used in this analysis are calculated as th e ratio of specific duties to import unit values, estimated by the ratio of import values to import quan tities/volumes in 2011 (at the HS eight-digit level). If no import data were available for 201 1, 2010 import data were used. 24 The list of pharmaceutical prod ucts concerned includes items of HS chapter 30; HS headings 2936, 2947, 2939, and 2941. 25 There is a discrepancy between the actual number of lines in the tariff (8,299) and the number of lines used in the tariff analysis (7,942) due to the absence of trade data for the calculation of AVEs for certain tariff lines.

Note: All tariff calculations exclude in-quota lines. The 2012 tariff is based on HS2012 nomenclature, consisting of 8,299 tariff lines (at the 8-digit tariff line level). Ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) were estimated based on 2011 Swiss import data at the 8-digit tariff line level. If no import data were available for 2011, 2010 import data were used in calculations. However, some non- ad valorem equivalents could not be estimated since there were no imports in 2010 and 2011, hence around 4.3% for applied MFN and 5.2% for bound tariffs of total lines have been considered as empty (no rate). Source: WTO Secretariat calculations, based on da ta provided by the Swiss authorities. 3.20. In general, the tariff continues to depict negative escalation from the first stage of processing (raw materials), at an average tariff rate of 15.3%, to the second stage (semi-manufactured products), at an average tari ff rate of 3.2%. However, the tariff then shows positive escalation to fully processed products, wh ich have an average rate of 10.7% (Table 3.3). 3.21. In total, at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Switzerland and Liechtenstein bound 99% of their tariff lines using specific duties on agricultural products and alternate duties on other products; unbound tariff lines cover 86 lines for gas, petroleum, and related products.

Under the 1923 Customs Union Treaty between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, all goods are traded freely between the two countries. The bila teral agreements between the European Union and Switzerland, and the EEA Agreement (for Li echtenstein) provide for free trade in most non-agricultural products, subject to a valid certificate of origin. In contrast, in general, agricultural goods are not subject to preferential tariffs when they are imported into the customs union. For example, average tariff protection is 29.6% from the EU and 30% for goods originating in other EFTA members, compared with average MFN protection of 31.9% (Table 3.4). 3.23. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are parties to 24 free-trade agreements under the ambit of EFTA.26 Under these agreements, duty-free treatment is granted to 99.9% of all non-agricultural imports, while preferences are granted on a limited range of agricultural products. As a result, agricultural (WTO definition) preferential tariff averages range from 29.3% to 31.7% depending on the country, compared with an MFN tariff average of 31.9%. Under the 1923 Customs Union Treaty between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the provisions on trade in goods of the bilateral 26 Eight of the agreements have entered into force since Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 46 - Free Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement between Switzerland and Japan apply also to the territory of Liechtenstein. 3.24. Under their GSP scheme, Switzerland and Li echtenstein grant non-reciprocal preferential tariff treatment to eligible countries, as well as additional preferences to least developed countries (LDCs).27 LDCs benefit from substantial preferences, which have increased since 2008, from 99.6% to 100% of agricultural tariff lines28 (WTO definition); all LDC non-agricultural products are entitled to duty-free treatment. In contrast, pr eferences granted on agricultural goods under the GSP do not vary substantially from the prefer ences granted under agreements concluded under the EFTA. Average tariff protection under the GSP is 30% for agricultural goods compared with MFN protection of 31.9%; moreover, the average preferential tariff on non-agricultural goods under the GSP is higher (0.5%) than under the free-trade agreements (zero).

Source: WTO Secretariat calculations, based on da ta provided by the Swiss authorities. 3.1.4 Other charges affecting imports 3.25. Switzerland and Liechtenstein constitute a common area for the application of the VAT regime. Imported as well as domestically produced goods and services are subject to VAT. On imported services VAT is levied on the \"cost of services provided\", and on merchandise imports, it applies to the c.i.f. price plus the tariff paid . According to the authorities, if the Federal Administration has any doubts about the declared value, the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation apply. 3.26. Some changes were made to the legislat ion on the VAT during the review period. On 12 June 2009, Parliament approved the federal law governing the VAT (VAT Act, RS 641.20), to be implemented from 1 January 2010, replacing the law of 2 September 1999. On January 2011, the VAT rates increased slightly: the standard rate increased to 8% (from 7.6%), the special rate on hotel services to 3.8% (from 3.6%), and the reduced rate of 2.4% increased to 2.5%. This reduced rate is applied, inter alia , on tap water, beverages (excluding alcoholic drinks), food, cattle, grains, plants, seed, flowers, medication, newspapers, magazines, and books and other printed matter. VAT is zero rated on exports and on gold for investment purposes. 3.27. The Customs Administration collects a 4% tax on motor vehicles, levied on the customs- duty-inclusive c.i.f. value of imports, or on the invoice/catalogue price. Electric cars are exempted from the tax. 3.28. The consumption tax (excise tax) is applied on imported and domestically produced mineral oils and fuels. The tax rate varies according to the product and its final use; per litre, it ranges from SwF 0.759 on diesel and SwF 0.7312 on unleaded gasoline, to SwF 0.03 on extra-light heating oil. Reduced rates apply to fuels used in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and licensed WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 48 - transport companies. Aircraft may be exempt from this petroleum tax.29 In 2011, mineral oil tax generated 7.8% of federal receipts.30 3.29. The tax rates on natural gas and liquid gas used as fuel were reduced on 1 July 2008, and a partial or complete tax exemption from the mineral oil tax is granted for biofuels (e.g. biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, vegetable and animal oils) that comply with minimum ecological and social criteria31; this can amount up to SwF 0.72 per litre. 3.30. The CO 2 tax on fossil fuels is an incentive fee that supplements voluntary and other CO2-related measures. Its purpose is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and thus lower CO 2 emissions. The CO 2 tax has been levied since 1 January 2008 on fossil fuels (heating oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke, and other fossil combusti bles) that are used to generate heat, produce electricity in thermal plants or operate combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The tax rate has been SwF 36 per tonne of CO 2 since 1 January 2010. The tax on extra-light heating oil, for example, is SwF 95.50 per 1,000 litres at 15\u00b0C, and that on natural gas is SwF 92.10 per 1,000 kg. Energy-intensive companies may be exempted from the CO 2 tax if they commit to legally binding CO 2 reduction targets. The Customs Administration is responsible for enforcement of the CO 2 Ordinance, with the exception of the provisions on tax exemption and tax revenue distribution, for which the Federal Office for the Environment is responsible. In particular, the Customs Administration is charged with levying and reimbursing the CO 2 tax. 3.31. The tobacco tax is levied on imported and domestically produced cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products; it may be compound or ad valorem .32 The specific component of the compound tax on cigarettes (HS 2402.2010, HS 2402.2020, and HS 2402.9000) increased to SwF 114.94 per 1,000 units during the review period (from SwF 99.23 in 2006); the ad valorem component of 25% of the sale value at retail level remained unchanged. In addition, cigarettes are subject to a tax of SwF 1.30 per 1,000 units, for the domestic tobacco financing fund (SOTA), and a tax of SwF 1.30 per 1,000 units, for the Tobacco Control Fund. 33 The tax on cigarette paper was eliminated on 1 January 2010. Alcoholic beer and mi xed beer drinks are subject to the beer excise tax, levied in accordance with the Beer Tax Act (SR 641.411) and the associated implementing provisions. The beer excise tax is assessed according to the strength of the beer and it varies from SwF 16.88 per hl for light beer, to SwF 25.32 per hl for regular and special beer, to SwF 33.76 per hl for strong beer. 34 3.32. The incentive fee on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is levied at SwF 3/kg on imported and domestically produced VOCs either directly on the substances or on products containing VOCs.35 The fee is collected at the time of importation into Switzerland or domestic production. VOCs are exempt from this tax if used in such a way that they are not released into the environment or if they are exported.36 29 Pursuant to article 17, paragraph 2 (a) of the Petroleum Tax Act RS 641.61. 30 Swiss Federal Customs Administration online information, \"Petroleum Tax\".

The excise tax on salt, which replaces the monopoly fee on salt, is still applied in Liechtenstein.37 3.1.5 Import prohibitions and restrictions 3.34. Regulations on products subject to import prohibitions and restrictions have been adapted to EU regulations and global chemical convention s. Selected products are listed in Table 3.5, together with the underlying regulations and thei r purposes. Certain trade prohibitions (covering both imports and exports) are also maintained as a result of UN Security Council sanctions, or EU sanctions also implemented by Switzerland and Li echtenstein. Recently implemented UN sanctions include sanctions against Somalia (2009), Eritrea (2010), and Libya (2011). 38 Sanctions have been abolished for Sierra Leone in 2010. Based on EU decisions, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have adopted new sanctions against Guinea (2009) and Syria (2011), while abolishing the sanctions on Uzbekistan in 2009.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein continue to apply automatic and non-automatic licences. The legal basis for the licensing system for agricultural products is governed by the Federal Law on Agriculture of 29 April 1998 (RS 910.1) and the Ordina nce on imports of agricultural products of 26 October 2011 (RS 916.01), which entered into force on 1 January 2012. 39 Other recent changes resulted from the revision of the Harmonized System.40 3.36. An automatic licence, known as a general import permit (PGI) applies to all products subject to threshold prices or to compulsory reserve stocks. This licence is granted automatically and used for statistical purposes. The licence is also used to ensure collection of the portions of the customs duty that are not levied by the Federal Customs Administration, mainly for the compulsory holding of stocks. The licence is not transferable and is generally not limited in time. Traders liable to customs control must present their PGI number on their customs declaration. 37 The tax varies (per tonne) from SwF 175 on salt for direct human consumption, to SwF 50 on road salt, SwF 0.94 on salt for industrial use, and SwF 5 for other purposes (LGBl. 1995/98 and LGBl. 1995/135). 38 Based on the Law on the Implementation of In ternational Sanctions (RS 946.231), in force since 2003. In Liechtenstein, the relevant Government or dinances are based on the law of 10 December 2008 concerning the application of international sanctions (LGBl. 41/2009). 39 WTO document G/LIC/N/1/CHE/3, 20 January 2012. 40 WTO document G/AG/N/CHE/13/Add.14, 11 April 2012. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 50 - 3.37. Non-automatic licences are used mainly for tariff quota management purposes (Chapter 4.4.4). In general, non-automatic licences are allocated through auctions, based on previous imports, on a first-come first-served basis, on a pro-rata basis, and/or according to the amount produced or purchased domestically of similar local goods ( prise en charge ). Non-automatic licences are transferable, with the exception of licences granted for quota allocated on a pro-rata basis. Importers who meet the relevant legal requirements are authorized to carry out imports within the tariff quota, but are not required to produce this authorization at the border; controls are performed electronically wh en the customs declaration is processed. A fee ranging from SwF 3 to SwF 5 is charged for most licence applications; additional fees depend on the product and the method of tariff quota allocation. 3.38. Import licensing is also required for imports of a range of non-agricultural products, such as narcotic drugs, transplant materials, and synthetic ethanol. 41 3.39. A licence application may be refused because of failure to meet the specific criteria. Reasons for any refusal are communicated to the applicant, who has the right to appeal. Appeals against decisions relating to licensing are made to the Swiss Federal Administrative Court and, in the second instance, to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.42 3.1.7 Compulsory reserve stock 3.40. In accordance with Article 8 of the Fe deral Law on National Economic Supply (NESA, RS 531), the Federal Council may subject certai n goods of vital importance to compulsory stockpiling. Some goods subject to compulsory reserve stock require an automatic import licence. 3.41. Goods that are currently subject to compul sory stockpiling and that require an automatic import licence are liquid fuels, sugar, rice, edible oils and fats, coffee, and different kinds of cereal. The automatic licences for these products are gr anted by CARBURA (an association of importers under private law) in the case of liquid fuels and R\u00e9servesuisse Genossenschaft (a cooperative under private law of importers of foodstuffs and feedstuffs) for the other products mentioned above, subject to approval by the Federal Office for National Economic Supply. These goods may be imported from any country; they are not subject to any quantitative restrictions or to a time limit. The stockpiling scheme is supported by guarantee funds financed through import fees (included in the customs tariffs levied on these products) and ultimately consumers. In general, the level of compulsory reserves corresponds to four months of average consumption of each product (except, e.g. 4.5 months for liquid fuels, 3 months for kerosene and coffee, and 3-4 months for cereals). 3.42. Furthermore, nitrogen fertilizers and certain therapeutic products are subject to compulsory reserve stock requirements, which are managed by Agricura and Helvecura, respectively. The Swiss authorities do not envisage any reduction in the levels of compulsory reserves measured in months of average annual consumption. 3.1.8 Local-content and local-purchase requirements 3.43. The \" prise en charge \" system, which applies to some agricultural products subject to tariff quotas, requires traders to purchase or produce similar domestic products in order to import. Television broadcasters with a national or regional language programme service are still obliged to reserve at least 50% of their broadcasting time for Swiss or European productions and at least 10% of broadcasting time or 10% of production costs for works from independent Swiss or European producers. In addition, television broa dcasters with a national or regional language programme service, which broadcast films, must spend at least 4% of their gross revenue on purchasing Swiss films (productions or co-productions) or must pay a 4% fee on their gross revenue. 41 See WTO document G/LIC/N/3/CHE/8, 11 September 2012. 42 See WTO document WT/TPR/S/208/Rev.1 for a detailed presentation of the import licensing system in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 51 - 3.1.9 Contingency measures 3.44. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have no anti-dumping, countervailing or safeguard measures in place; and they do not have specific national anti-dumping, countervailing or safeguards legislation. Nevertheless, under Switzerland's legal system, the WTO Agreements (including those on anti-dumping, safeguards, and subsidies and countervailing measures) form an integral part of Swiss national law, and could therefore serve as a legal basis for future measures. 3.45. In the event of alleged dumping or subs idization, SECO is the competent authority in Switzerland. Liechtenstein does not have authority to introduce contingency measures. 3.46. Moreover, under the Swiss Customs Tariff Law 43, Article 7 allows modifications in tariffs, including increases, when the national interest is at stake, and Article 11 provides for temporary tariff increases on agricultural products in application of safeguard provisions under international trade agreements. Switzerland reserved its right to invoke the special safeguard clause for 1,193 tariff lines for agricultural products under Article 5 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. This measure has been used only once, in 1999. Under the Federal Law on External Economic Measures, Article 1 provides for non-tariff measures in emergency situations (subject to approval by Parliament within six months). 44 3.1.10 Government procurement 3.47. Switzerland's commitments under internationa l agreements on public procurement, i.e. the WTO plurilateral Government Procurement Agreem ent (GPA), the Bilateral Agreement between Switzerland and the EU of 21 June 199945, and the Free Trade Agreements concluded by Switzerland in the context of EFTA46, have been transposed into its national law at the federal level (central administration), and at the sub-federal level (cantonal and municipal). At the federal level, the GPA was integrated through the 1994 Federal Law on government procurement (in force since 1 January 2006) and its 1995 Ordinance, which se t detailed rules for all types of procurement below and above GPA thresholds. On 17 June 2009, the Confederation decided to revise the Ordinance of the Federal Law on government procurement, the result of which has been in force since January 2010. 3.48. At the sub-federal levels, the 26 Swiss cantons operate under the revised Inter-cantonal Concordat on government procurement of 2001, and its executive directives. 47 Switzerland's commitments under the GPA are not extended to procurement by the federal railways.48 Exclusions from coverage are also provided on security grounds, pursuant to Article III of the revised GPA.49 Switzerland made reservations on the application of the GPA to other signatories who had not extended comparable and effective access in certain activities to Swiss firms.50 In 2011, Switzerland made a final offe r to the Members of the GPA, wi th the final package adopted in March 2012, but not yet in force.51 3.49. According to the authorities, the cantonal and the federal laws have been harmonized to a large extent. The Confederation-Cantons Commi ssion on Government Procurement (CMCC) is 43 Loi sur le tarif des douanes , http://www.seco.admin.ch/themen/00513/00515/00516/index.html?lang=fr . Also see http://www.efta.int/legal-texts/free-trade-relations.as px. There are ongoing negotiations on government procurement with Russia, Belarus, Indonesia and some countries in Central America. 47 Accord inter-cantonal sur les march\u00e9s publics (AIMP), 25 November 1994/15 March 2001. Viewed at: 48 However, urban transport is covered, incl uding tramways. See WTO document GPA/113. 49 See Article XXIII of the GPA. 50 See for instance, Annex 7, General Notes 1, 2 and 3 of Switzerland, WTO document GPA/113. The reservations apply to, inter alia : Canada (regional bodies, entities in th e water, electricity, local transport, airports and ports subsectors, as well as certain services su bsectors); the United States (communal bodies and water, local transport, airports and ports entities, as well as certain services subsectors and challenge procedures); Japan (communal bodies, electricity and loca l transport entities, as well as challenge procedures); the Republic of Korea (communal bodies, airports an d local transport, and challenge procedures); Israel (communal bodies, local transport, certain services subsectors, and challenge procedures); and Singapore (communal bodies, water, and electricity entities). 51 See WTO document GPA/113. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 52 - responsible for coordinating the implementation of Switzerland's international commitments at the federal and sub-federal levels, and for ensuri ng that they are respected and implemented.52 In addition, the 1995 federal law on the internal market provides for non-discrimination in public procurement at cantonal and local levels. The Swiss legislation covers purchases of goods and services and projects related to construction and civil engineering. The law does not apply to, inter alia, the purchase of weapons and defence projects. 53 Nonetheless, such purchases are regulated by Section 3 of the Ordinance on government procurement of 11 December 1995.54 The Swiss legislation provides for, inter alia , periodic adjustments to definitions and threshold values under the relevant GPA provisions. 3.50. Special provisions (including on thresholds) are stipulated in the federal law on government procurement for public and private enterprises that have a dominant position in the Swiss market. The Federal Ordinance on government procurement also covers certain activities carried out by public entities under control or influence of the Swiss State (i.e. organizations in which the Federal Government holds the majority of shares or where more than half of the members of the management or supervisory boards are representatives of the Federal Government), or by private entities with special or exclusive rights to prov ide a service throughout the Swiss territory. These activities originally included the provision of public telecommunication services, the construction or operation of railway facilities by CFF, and genera tion, transmission, and distribution of electricity. 55 If conditions are met for free access by all suppliers to, and for international competition in, these markets (or segments thereof), the Federal Department for the Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications (DETEC) may partially or totally exempt the industry, sector or activity from the federal law on government procurement. 56 These exemptions are based on recommendations by the Federal Competition Commission, issued in light of an analysis of the prevailing conditions of competition in the sector. 57 3.51. For contracts below the thresholds, procuring entities may use limited tendering, tendering by invitation (of three potential suppliers), open tendering, or selective tendering.58 For contracts reaching the international agreed thresholds, the procuring entity must use open, selective or limited tendering.59 Contracts must be awarded to the supplier that has presented the most economically advantageous offer, closest to the criteria specified in the tender documentation. Neither the law nor the ordinance provide for preferential treatment for Swiss suppliers. Complaints against the federal entities, related to public procurement, may be lodged with the Federal Administrative Court (TFA), which replaced the Federal Commission of Appeal (CRM) in the field of public procurement on 1 January 2007. The TFA's decisions may be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court (FSC). At cantonal level, administrative tribunals may deal with complaints arising from tendering procedures, which can be appealed to the FSC. 3.52. The bilateral agreement on government pr ocurement between Switzerland and the EU filled the gap between the scopes of the GPA and the rele vant provisions under the EEA. It provides for extension of the GPA to purchases by communes, the railways, telecommunications utilities, and entities active in the field of energy other than el ectricity; and to private entities operating on the basis of special or exclusive rights in connection wi th drinking water, electricity, airports, ports, and urban and cable transport. 60 The telecommunication subsector was exempted from the scope of the agreement, by the Swiss authorities upon its entry into force, and by the EU Commission (for most Members) in July 2002. The exemption was formally implemented by the Ordinance of DETEC of 18 July 2002 (RS 172.056.111). In 2007, tran sportation of goods by rail on normal trace was also exempted. This exemption was formally im plemented by the adoption of the annex to the Ordinance of DETEC of 18 July 2002. A best-endeavour clause encourages purchasers not to discriminate against suppliers from other parties to the agreement for procurement below the relevant threshold values. 52 The CMCC comprises an equal number of repr esentatives from the Confederation and from the cantons. 53 Article 3 of RS 172.056.1. 54 Articles 32-36 of RS 172.056.11. 55 Articles 2 paragraph 2 of RS 172.056.1 and 2a of RS 172.056.11. 56 Article 2b of RS 172.056.11. 57 RS 172.056.111. 58 Article 36 of RS 172.056.11. 59 RS 172.056.1. 60 Federal Department of Economic Affairs online information, \"Public procurement market\".

Several of the EFTA free-trade agreements contain a chapter on government procurement based on the WTO GPA with market access concessions. This is the case for Chili, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ukraine, and the Gulf Co-operation Council. 3.54. In Switzerland, total public spending at all levels of government on goods, services, and construction amounted to about SwF 34 billion in 2007, representing 25% of total public spending. The total was shared between the Confederation (19%), cantons (38%), and communes (43%). No exact figures are available for the amounts spent in 2008 to 2010; 2011 is the first year for which statistical data were made available through the electronic procurement gate (simap.ch) for the purchases by the Confederation's procuring entities. In 2011, purchases at federal level totalled about SwF 6 billion. This comprised purc hases for SwF 3.8 billion above the thresholds. About SwF 3 billion were awarded under the open procedure; about SwF 400 million under the selective procedure; and about SwF 400 million under limited tendering according to the conditions of the GPA. In total Swiss procurement, the shar e of goods represents about 16%, while the share of services is 45% and construction services 39%. For the cantons, the electronic system is not yet mandatory for the collection of statistics. 3.55. A centralized portal was developed in 2011 for use by the Confederation, cantons and communes on all matters related to government procurement. 61 3.56. In Liechtenstein, in addition to the GPA, public procurement is governed by the relevant EEA rules (EU Directives and directly applicable EU regulations) and the EFTA Convention. The threshold values are those set by the EEA. The Department of Public Procurement, under the Office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for procurement. In 2008, two EU directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC) were incorporated in to national law and the legislation on public procurement was updated (Act on the Procurement of Utilities for public works contracts, and supply and services contracts in water, energy, transport, and postal services; Act on Public Procurement for all other public purchases). 62 These laws apply to public purchases, and to projects jointly undertaken by public and private entities when the financial contribution of the public contracting entity exceeds 50%. 3.57. Under the 2005 Public Procurement Act, open tenders are the rule to assign contracts. Contracts above the EEA thresholds are awarded according to international rules; they are announced in the EU electronic government procurement system (Table 3.6). Selective tenders are used for architectural services. For contracts below the EEA thresholds, public utilities usually use open or negotiated procedures; otherwise, relevant international rules apply. Since 2008, a contracting authority may also use a procedure termed the \"competitive dialogue\" and purchasing techniques such as the dynamic purchasing system and electronic auction. These methods have yet not been used in practice. Under the two laws mentioned above, contracts are awarded according to the most economically advantageous tender or to the tender with the lowest price. Additional criteria, such as quality, environmenta l characteristics, and cost-effectiveness, may also be taken into account. According to the Liechtenstei n authorities, there are no preferences for local suppliers. A joint declaration by Liechtenstein and certain neighbouring Swiss cantons enables suppliers from the latter to participate in tenders (on a reciprocal basis) for purchases below the EEA threshold values. Complaints related to public purchases may be lodged with the Complaints Commission in Administrative Matters, the Administrative Court, or with the EFTA Surveillance Authority if EEA provisions are involved. 3.58. In 2011, Liechtenstein made a final offer to the Members of the GPA; final package was adopted in March 2012 but is yet to enter into force. 63 This offer extended coverage to procurement by its Parliament and Courts64, bodies of public law at the national level65, and procurement by postal services acting under exclusive rights.66 In Annex 5, Liechtenstein dropped the exclusion of certain telecommunication services . The authorities expect that the Liechtenstein instrument of ratification will be deposited in the first half of 2013. 61 Viewed at: https://www.simap.ch . 62 Viewed at: http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?clearsvs=true&clearlrs=true . 63 WTO GPA/113, 2 April 2012. 64 WTO document GPA/113, Liechtenstein, Annex 1 (central government entities). 65 WTO document GPA/113, Annex 2. 66 WTO document GPA/113, Annex 3.

Customs procedures, registration, and documentation requirements for exports are similar to those for imports in both Switzerland and Liec htenstein. An export declaration is required (regardless of the type of product and its destination) for statistical and surveillance purposes. Goods must be exported within one day of submission of the customs declaration. Permits are required to export animals and animal products, as well as narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and certain articles containing gold. 3.2.2 Export taxes, charges, and levies 3.60. No export taxes, charges or levies are in force in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. 3.2.3 Export prohibitions, restrictions, and licensing 3.61. Switzerland and Liechtenstein maintain export controls (by means of licences) on certain products for safety, security, and environmental reasons, and to ensure compliance with international obligations under treaties and conventions to which they are signatories. 67 In addition, Switzerland and Liechtenstein maintain export controls on war material and dual-use goods that might be used in the production of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Exporters are required to obtain an export permit for these items from the SECO. 3.62. Trade restrictions, based on international sanctions, generally also apply to exports (for imports, see section 3.1.5). 3.2.4 Duty and tax concessions 3.63. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, goods may be exported temporarily, in line with the Kyoto Convention, for processing or repair, upon approval from the Customs Administration. Exported goods may be imported duty free. 68 According to the authorities, Switzerland has not imposed any export taxes in the last 20 years and does not intend to do so. Tourists and non-residents may apply for reimbursement of the VAT on goods boug ht for their own use, of a minimum value of SwF 300. 69 3.64. Alcohol taxes paid on alcohol products are refunded by the Swiss Alcohol Board when the goods are exported. Alcohol products that are not in tended for drinking purposes such as perfume, medicines, varnishes, detergents, as well as products with an alcohol content not exceeding 1.2% by volume (e.g. pastries and chocolate) may be imported free of alcohol taxes. Also tax-free are alcoholic beverages (spirits) brought into the country by travellers, but not exceeding: 2 litres of 67 For example, the Basel Convention on internat ional transport of hazardous waste, CITES, the Convention on Chemical Weapons, the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation. 68 RS 631.0. 69 RS 641.202.2. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 55 - beverages with alcohol content of up to 15% by volume, and 1 litre of those with over 15% of alcohol by volume.70 3.2.5 Export subsidies 3.65. As part of its ongoing agricultural reforms, Switzerland eliminated export subsidies on basic agricultural goods in 2009. Switzerland continues to compensate for higher prices of milk, dairy products, and flour, if these products are incorporated in processed agricultural goods. (Chapter 4.1.3). 3.66. Liechtenstein does not have an export subsidy regime in place; however, its food processors may benefit from Swiss export subsidies. 3.2.6 Export promotion 3.67. SECO is responsible for setting export promotion policy. The Swiss Office of Commercial Expansion (OSEC) is a non-profit organization mandated by the Swiss Government to support Swiss companies abroad. OSEC is in charge of ex port promotion, assisting Swiss and Liechtenstein companies involved in export activities. It coordinates a network of 19 representative offices or \"hubs\" worldwide, which deliver basic information, consulting, and marketing services. OSEC is subordinated to SECO. 3.68. In line with the Swiss Confederation's gene ral economic and location promotion policies, in 2011, the Federal Council approved a plan for econ omic promotion, including export promotion and tourism promotion for 2012-15. 71 For export promotion, the plan includes a budget of SwF 84 million to be managed by OSEC. The main aim is for OSEC to support Swiss small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in particular to undertake research, provide expert advice, and exploit export opportunities in international markets. 3.2.7 Export insurance and guarantees 3.69. Other assistance for Swiss exporters includes insurance and guarantees against political and economic risks when exporting goods and services. 72 The Swiss Export Risk Insurance, SERV, provides protection against non-payment, facilita tes the financing of exports, and helps companies to maintain their liquidity. 3.70. Due to uncertainty regarding the international economic and financial situation, SERV introduced new measures intended to improve competitiveness and provide exporters with liquidity problems better prospects in fulfilling export orders. In 2009, as part of stabilization measures, SERV introduced: counter guarantees, working capital insurance, letter of credit confirmation insurance, and refinancing guarantees; which were later extended by Parliament until the end of 2015. On 1 September 2011, SERV introduced a new premium schedule based on the new OECD Export Credit Arrangement. In October 2011, in view of the strength of the Swiss franc, the Federal Council raised the cover ratio for counter guarantees from 95% to 100%, and that for working capital insurance from 80% to 95%. SERV recorded its first net loss after four profitable years, posting a deficit of SwF 55.2 million in 2011. The Confederation's maximum guarantee exposure is SwF 12 billion; at end-Decemb er 2012, its exposure was SwF 10 billion. 3.3 Measures Affecting Production and Trade 3.3.1 Incentives and other assistance 3.71. The Swiss Subsidies Law stipulates the main eligibility criteria and procedures to follow when granting subsidies at the federal level. 73 Assistance is also granted at the sub-federal level. The main types of support consist of financia l transfers and tax exemptions. Under the Swiss 70 Swiss Alcohol Board online information.

The latest Federal Council Report on the examination of subsidies was published on 30 May 2008.75 The 2008 Report contained the results of the evaluation of some 230 subsidies (out of 360), and concluded that some 70 subsidies programmes needed to be discontinued or revised, either because they had become redundant due to structural changes, or had been found inefficient to achieve the programme's goals. The Federal Council reports regularly on the implementation of the report's conclusions. 76 As from 2014, a shift is planned toward continuous examination of federal subsidies. 3.72. According to Switzerland's latest notificati on to the WTO, under Article XVI:1 of the GATT 1994 and Article 25 of the Agreement on Subsid ies and Countervailing Measures, Switzerland distinguishes its subsidies at the federal level in two broad categories: agriculture (see Chapter 4.1.2) and industry.77 3.73. Under the industry pillar, there are several sub-categories, including: tax relief in application of the new regional policy, assistance for mountain and rural areas, and assistance for forestry activities. According to Switzerland's notification, the tax relief in application of the New Regional Policy has been in place since 1 January 2008 and will remain in force indefinitely. Under this programme, Switzerland provides subsidies in the form of federal tax relief (partial or full) to support private enterprise projects aimed at helping to reduce disparities in the development of regions. Areas considered economically less developed are those where there is a particular need for structural adaptation due to lower evolution of the population compared with the country as a whole; an income level below the national average; and a proportion of industrial activities higher than the average. Other considerations are areas where average unemployment exceeds the national average; the trend in the number of jo bs has been markedly less favourable than the national average; or, where there are clear indi cations that at least one of the situations mentioned above will occur shortly; in particular, that the prospects for the most important sectors of the economy and for the largest firms are unfav ourable. The loan guarantees granted under the former law (Federal Law of 6 October 1995, Offi cial Collection of Federal Law 2006 4301) for a maximal of eight years will expire in about 2015-16. The tax reliefs are granted for up to ten years to manufacturing companies, and to services companies with activities closely linked to the manufacturing process. In order to be considered, the project must be innovative: the product and the manufacturing process must be technologically up-to-date and increase the company's ability to compete through a national and international market presence. According to the Swiss authorities, the effect of the assistance programme on trade is negligible or non-existent. 78 3.74. The Swiss Federal Government has a range of instruments that can help companies to access credit. One of these is exclusively for sm all and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) operating in the arts and crafts subsectors. According to the Federal Act of 6 October 2006 on financial assistance for surety organizations acting on behalf of SMEs (SR 951.25), the Federal Government covers 65% of the exposure, and shares the admini stration costs of guarantee cooperatives that help promising small and medium-size enterprises ob tain bank loans. Three regional cooperatives cover the entire territory of Switzerland, and on e cooperative for women (SAFFA), operates at the national level. They offer loan guarantees of up to SwF 500,000. 3.75. Switzerland also provides assistance for mountain and rural areas under the \"Surety and contributions to interest-servicing in mountain and rural areas\" programme (Table 3.7). The objective of the subsidy is to provide long and medium-term capital loans to small and medium-size establishments situated in mountain and rural areas. In its application, the Confederation encourages the granting of sureti es by giving subsidies to the Swiss Guarantee Cooperative for Arts and Crafts, and by making interest-servicing contributions. The subsidy does not relate to a specific product or sector. It is provided to SMEs that are profitable or likely to develop, whether existing or to be created. Paym ents are made only to establishments that are not already supported by the Confederation in some other way. This assistance programme is to 74 Article 5, RS 616.1. 75 Federal Department of Finance (2008). 76 See Compte d'Etat 2011 (tome 3, no. 07) on the status of implementation of the subsidies review.

Accord ing to the Swiss authorities, the effect of the subsidy on trade is insignificant or non-existent.

Switzerland provides assistance for forestry activities under the Reorganisation of Financial Equalisation (NFA) programme. The subsidy is aimed to compensate forest owners for services rendered to the public. Assistance is allocated in the form of indemnities and/or four-year programmes and flat-rate budgets (2008-11) granted by the Confederation after cantonal proposals have been submitted. The subsidy to the defined products and services within the programmes goes fully to the cantons for implementation. According to the Swiss authorities, the effect of the assistance programme on trade is negligible, if not non-existent. 3.77. Swiss Post receives an annual subsidy for the delivery of newspapers on subscription. The subsidy was reduced from SwF 80 million and fixed at SwF 30 million in January 2008. It remained at SwF 30 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and was increased to SwF 50 million in 2012. 3.78. According to a notification by Switzerland 79, the Federal law of 20 March 2009 on Passenger Transportation, which entered into force on 1 January 2010, determines the basic rules and conditions for licensing and requirements for offers of transportation as well as the basic obligations for regular and professional passenger transportation. In addition, as from 1 January 2010, the Federal law of 20 March 2009 on Road Transport Companies (RS 744.10) 79 See WTO document S/C/N/568, 17 September 2010. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 58 - determines the criteria for authorization of road transport companies for passenger and freight. A lack of financial capacity or professional competence may result in denial of authorization.80 3.79. In the context of negotiations in the Wo rking Party on GATS Rules, Switzerland tabled a proposal for \"Disciplines on Subsidies Pursuant to Article XV of the GATS\".81 The proposal is for disciplines on export subsidies including on a defini tion of subsidies, listing and transitional periods (extensions and subsidies of unlimited periods), standstill, and progressive phase-out provisions, as well as remedies. 3.80. Under the law relating to volatile organic compounds 82, companies that have taken action on their stationary installations (installing purification plants) and thereby are reducing emissions significantly below the limit values stipulated in the Air Protection Ordinance 83 may already be exempted from the tax (Article 9). This time-limited tax exemption was to expire by the end of 2012 but the Federal Council decided in June 2012 to continue the tax exemption without time limitation but with additional requirements. Fr om January 2013, companies that wish to benefit from a tax exemption based on Article 9 must also reduce their VOCs emissions at every step of their production process, according to the best available technique, which will be updated every five years.84 Health insurance companies (chosen because it is mandatory for all people living in Switzerland to have health insurance) are used to redistribute an amount of approximately SwF 120 million annually to the population in equal amounts.85 3.81. The Confederation continues to provide financial support for work on sanitization of contaminated sites as identified by the Cantons. A maximum of SwF 40 million is available each year: SwF 22.3 million were spent in 2009, SwF 13.2 million in 2010 and SwF 8.9 million in 2011. 86 3.82. Government-financed or subsidized research and development programmes are also open to foreign companies with operations in Switzerland. In 2010, the Confederation spent SwF 225.7 million on research and development pr ogrammes and a total of SwF 1,812.6 million on government-financed and subsidized programmes, which includes intramural R&D expenditures, R&D contracts, and grants to fund R&D activities allocated to third parties. 3.83. Some cantons offer investment incentiv e programmes for domestic as well as foreign investors, in particular in rural areas. Priority is often given to foreign businesses that bring new high technology product lines. The most common incentives are: subsidies or loans by cantons for the development of industrial sites; grants for institutions conducting research and development projects; subsidies to defray start-up costs and to finance staff training; tax exemptions on profits and capital gains; and liberal depreciation allowances. Cantonal guarantees on bank loans and capital loans at below-market interest rates are still available but rarely used, according to the authorities. The Federal Government does not have specific information regarding these cantonal guarantees. There are also discrepancies in regard to the tax rates levied in the different cantons. For instance, in addition to the federal income tax of 8.5%, statutory corporate income tax ranges from 5.25% (canton of Lucerne) to 23.4% (canton of Geneva). These tax differentials and tax exemptions granted by the different cantons are a means for them to compete for investment. 87 3.84. Over the past four years, the Corporate Taxation Reform II introduced three main legislative amendments to the Swiss corporate tax system. Requirements regarding the participation exemption changed in 2011. Participation exemption (at federal, cantonal, and communal levels) in the form of reduced income tax is now granted to corporations holding at least 10% of the 80 See WTO document S/C/N/567, 17 September 2010. 81 See WTO document JOB/SERV/36, 2 December 2010. 82 Compos\u00e9s organiques 87 The Federal Tax Harmonization Law (LHID) of 2001 refers to the harmonization of the tax basis and some assessment principles amongst th e different cantons, but not to the ha rmonization of rates. According to the Federal Constitution (Article 129), the cantons remain free to set their own tax rates . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 59 - shares of another company, having a share of at least 10% in the profits and the capital surplus of another company, or with an investment of a ma rket value of at least SwF 1 million in another company. In the two former cases, the reduction also covers capital gains on investment if the investment has been held for at least one year. The tax reduction is proportional to the relationship between net income from qualifying participation and total earnings. 3.85. The capital contribution principle took effect 1 January 2011. Under the nominal value principle, which was in force until the end of 2010, only repayments of nominal share capital were exempt for Swiss income and withholding tax purposes. Now, repayments of all types of capital contributions made after 31 December 1996 by shareholders with equity rights are treated the same as repayments of nominal share capital. 3.86. Since 1 January 2009, cantons have had the option to provide in their legislation for the deduction of corporate income tax from the amount of the capital tax 3.87. According to authorities, Liechtenstein do es not have any assistance schemes. However, the Government of Liechtenstein and individual compan ies are members of OSEC. In order to facilitate the participation of its SMEs in OSEC activities, Liechtenstein granted 20 export cheques in the amount of SwF 7,500 each for the period 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2012, with which its SMEs may pay for OSEC services. In addition, as a member of the EEA, Liechtenstein companies are eligible for EU assistance programmes. 88 3.3.2 Standards and other technical requirements 3.3.2.1 Overview 3.88. In 2010, Switzerland unilaterally introduced the Cassis de Dijon principle for certain products from the EU or the EEA (Box 3.1). To gether with the mutual recognition agreement between Switzerland and the EU, the principle ensure s that products that are lawfully marketed in the EU or EEA can, in principle, be marketed in Switzerland without further checks regarding their technical requirements. This is a step towards reducing technical barriers to trade and enhancing import competition in the Swiss market. Exports from the broader WTO membership to Switzerland may also benefit, provided the produc ts meet EU/EEA technical requirements. Some of the potential trade benefits are lost because of exceptions to the Cassis de Dijon principle. 3.3.2.2 Standards 3.89. Approximately 95% of the 23,080 standards cu rrently in force in the customs territory are aligned with international or European standa rds, unchanged since 2008. National standards predominate for watches and road construction. 3.90. Standards development is carried out by private bodies under the umbrella of the Swiss Association for Standardization ( Association Suisse de normalisation , SNV). The SNV has over 600 members from all economic sectors and includes private associations, institutions, and representatives from the public sector. A few Liechtenstein companies are members. The SNV publishes Swiss and foreign draft standards on the internet (Swiss information centre for technical rules, switec). Comments on draft standards ar e conveyed to the relevant expert body or national/international standards body. Standards are reviewed every five years to assess their continued relevance. 88 Liechtenstein is a net-contributor of the programmes included in the 7th Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (2007-2013); the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP-Programme 2007 -2013); and may benefit from all programmes listed in Protocol 31 of the EEA Agreement. Liechtenstein's total contribution to the 7 th Framework and to the CIP-Programme amounted to SwF 19,93 million (\u20ac11,7 million) and SwF 1.36 million (\u20ac0.8 million), respectively. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 60 - Box 3.1 Switzerland introduces the Cassis de Dijon principle The Law on technical barriers to trade (LETC) introduced the Cassis de Dijon principle into Swiss law from July 2010.a The new regime enables the marketing of products in Switzerland even if they do not conform to Swiss technical regulations, provided they are lawfully marketed in the EU or EEA, and comply with the technical requirements of the EU/EEA or with those of an EU/EEA member State (in the case of partly or non- harmonized rules).b Switzerland thus implicitly recognizes the equivalence of technical requirements in the EU, where these differ from Swiss requ irements. Domestic producers are al so entitled to sell products in Switzerland that are in conformity with EU or EEA regulations, albeit not with Swiss technical requirements, so as not to discriminate against domestic products. The autonomous introduction of the Cassis de Dijon principle was part of the Government's strategy to counter the high prices prevailing in Switzerland (Growth Policy 2008-11) , by further dismantling technical barriers to imports from the EU and the EEA markets. This is the third pillar of a strategy initiated in the 1990s to reduce technical barriers to trade. The unilateral application of the Cassis de Dijon principle complements the autonomous harmonization with EU technical requirements, and the Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU, which entered into force in 2002. This MRA covers 20 product sectors and is expanding. The whole set of measures introduced with the application of the Cassis de Dijon principle is estimated to have a growth-enhancing effect on Switzerland's GDP of about 0.5% per year.c According to the authorities, imports of foodstuffs, textiles, cosmetics, and furniture are expected to benefit most from by the application of the Cassis de Dijon principle. There are exceptions to the Cassis de Dijon principle. It is not applicable to products that are subject to: (i) authorization; (ii) notification pursuant to the Swiss legislation concerning chemicals; (iii) import permit; (iv) import prohibition; or (v) an exemption gran ted by the Federal Council. The main criterion for maintaining exemptions were overriding public interests.d The Seco keeps an indicative list of exceptions (negative list) as a guide for operators.e Products concerned include pharmaceuticals (subject to authorization), chemicals subject to notification, dangerous substances, detergents, pesticides, certain measuring instruments, certain motor vehicles, animal feed, GMOs, and certain foodstuffs (see labelling section below).f Special arrangements are in place for food items that do not conform to Swiss technical requirements. Prior to first sale in Switzerland, these food items are subject to approval by the Federal O ffice of Public Health in the form of a general ruling (d\u00e9cision de port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ). A general ruling is valid for subsequent consignments and applies to similar food items (i.e. separate approval for marketing in Switzerland is not required).g Applications from food importers or manufactur ers must include evidence that the goods in question are lawfully in circulation in the respective EU/EAA member State or conform with EU/EAA technical regulations (in the case of partly or non-harmonized ru les). Moreover, public interests must not be at risk, including human, animal, and plant life and health. Prod ucts benefiting from these arrangements are mainly products for which labelling differenc es exist (e.g. 0% fat instead of fa t-free). Infringements of the general rulings carry penalties of prison sentences of up to three years or financial penalties. a The Cassis de Dijon principle refers to a 1979 decision by the European Court of Justice concerning Germany's ban of the sale of French Cassis de Dijon . b LETC Art. 16a, paragraph 1 (RS 946.51). c Message concernant la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les entraves techniques au commerce (LETC).

There have been no major changes to Swiss labelling requirements. Switzerland amended the Organic Farming Ordinances, with effect from January 2010, concerning the labelling rules for products and food derived from organic agricu lture, to align them with EU requirements.89 New 89 WTO document G/TBT/N/CHE/115, 1 October 2009.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 61 - labelling requirements apply for timber (and related products) for consumer information purposes, including a declaration of origin and the type of timber.90 3.92. Labelling requiremen ts are set in sector-specific techni cal regulations. Some Swiss labelling requirements are maintained (as an exception to the Cassis-de-Dijon principle) with the stated objective of allowing consumers to make an inform ed choice or to prevent deception. For example, imports of meat and eggs produced in a manner prohibited in Switzerland must be labelled as such. Banned production methods, which must be labelled, include the use of hormones, antibiotics, and other antimicrobial substances such as performance stimulators for meat, and eggs from hens reared in battery cages. 91 The labelling requirements apply from the point of sale to the final consumer, in retail trade, and in establishments where meals are prepared for the public, such as restaurants. Country of production labelling is mandatory for all imported and domestic foodstuffs and raw materials used in food. 92 According to the authorities, this is because the indication of the country of manufacture cannot be inferred from the origin of the product and provides relevant information for consumers to decide which product they wish to buy. The labelling requirements for GMOs remain unchanged. 93 3.3.2.4 Technical regulations 3.93. In most sectors, the federal authorities have exclusive authority for adopting technical regulations, while the cantons are mainly responsi ble for implementation and market surveillance. New regulations (ordinances), decrees, and guidelines are subject to regulatory impact analysis (RIA). 94 The Federal Law on technical barriers to trade (LETC) requires the alignment of technical regulations with those of Switzerland's main trading partners (Article 4, paragraph 2). Since its last TPR in 2008, Switzerland has further harmonized its technical requirements with the EU regime ( acquis communitaire ). 3.94. No specific trade concerns have been ra ised in the TBT Committee regarding Switzerland's or Liechtenstein measures since 2008.95 Switzerland has regularly notified its draft technical regulations, ordinances, and conformity assessment procedures to the TBT Committee.96 3.95. Under the Customs Treaty, Liechtenstein a pplies Swiss standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, including markin g, labelling, and packaging. The Liechtenstein 1995 Act on the marketability of goods, as amended in 2004, stipulates that goods produced either in conformity with Swiss or EEA regulation s may be sold in Liechtenstein. For example, EEA originating non-agricultural products that do not comply with the Swiss regulations, such as medical products, may be imported to Liechtenstein under the Market Control and Surveillance Mechanism (Box 2.1). 3.3.2.5 Conformity assessment procedures 3.96. There are no developments concerning conformity assessment procedures. Switzerland has mutual recognitions agreements (MRAs) with the EU (2002), EEA/EFTA, Canada, and Turkey. The MRA with the EU applies to 20 industrial sectors 97; construction products have been covered since March 2008, cable lifts since December 2011, and explosives since 2012. For selected agricultural products, Switzerland and the EU recognize the equivalence of laws in order to facilitate trade.98 The MRAs with the EEA/EFTA and Turkey mutually extend the commitments taken by all parties toward the EU. 90 G/TBT/N/CHE/120, 10 December 2009. 91 Labelling was introduced in 2010 for certain proh ibited rearing methods of rabbits (RS 916.51), see WTO document G/TBT/N/CHE/122, 28 January 2010. 92 Articles 15 and 16 of the Ordinance of the Federal Department of the Interior (DFI) on labelling and advertising of foodstuffs (RS 817.022.21). 93 Ordinance of the Federal Depa rtment of the Interior on ge netically modified foodstuffs (RS 817.022.51).

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 62 - 3.97. Various approaches are used to assess conf ormity with Swiss technical regulations. In the case of imports, it is primarily the responsibility of importers representing foreign manufacturers to meet Swiss technical regulations, such as proper labelling and safety standards (for example, machines). Random border controls to check compliance may be carried out. For some products, a manufacturer's declaration of conformity must be submitted by the manufacturer or the importer upon or prior to importation. Third-party certification or testing may be required as part of the manufacturer's declaration of conformity for prin ting machines, selected telecom products or medical devices. The Swiss Accreditation Service (SAS), which operates under the umbrella of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), is responsible for accreditation of laboratories, inspection, and certification bodies. 99 3.98. In Liechtenstein, conformity assessment bo dies have been accredited by the Liechtenstein Accreditation100: two for certification - the Liechtenstein Association for Quality Assurance Certificates Company (Management Systems), and SWISS LLOYD GmbH subsidiary Triesen (Products); one for inspection - Office of Food Inspection and Veterinary Affairs; and one for calibration - Negotia Messtechnik AG. Liechtenstein has MRAs on conformity assessment with the other EEA/EFTA countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States. Liechtenstein and Chinese Taipei have signed an exchange of letters regarding the mutual exchange of information for medical devices, nota bly requirements of quality systems and audits of quality systems (in force since May 2011). 3.3.3 Sanitary and phytosanitary measures 3.3.3.1 Overview 3.99. There have been no major changes to the SPS regime. The Swiss veterinary and phytosanitary regimes have been fully harmonized with the EU since 2008. A reform of the Swiss food safety regime is under way to further align the requirements with the EU. Under the Customs Treaty, Liechtenstein applies Switzerland's SPS measures. No specific trade concerns have been raised in the SPS Committee regarding Switzerland's or Liechtenstein's measures. 3.3.3.2 Food safety 3.100. Switzerland's food safety regime remains substantially unchanged. However, a revision of the food law is ongoing 101, with the aim of further aligning the Swiss food safety system with the EU acquis communitaire .102 The authorities expect the amended law to enter into force in 2015. 3.101. Switzerland is among the few countries in Europe that continue to apply the \"positive principle\" for foodstuffs, i.e. all foodstuffs and a dditives offered for sale must be approved by the competent federal authorities -otherwise they are prohibited.103 The Swiss authorities are aware that these approval procedures for food constitute an unnecessary barrier to trade that warrant reform.104 The legislative proposal lifts the positive principle. In the meantime, imports of foodstuffs from the EU/EEA are subject to special arrangements with respect to the Cassis-de- Dijon principle (Box 3.1). The draft bill also, inter alia , introduces the precautionary principle into Swiss law and adopts the EU system of \"max imum values\" for additives, contaminants, microorganisms, etc. (replacing the Swiss tolerances).105 However, in non-harmonized areas of the EU food safety regime, such as labelling, certain Swiss exceptions may remain in place, for 99 Ordonnance sur le syst\u00e8me suisse d'accr\u00e9ditation et la d'homologation (RS 946.512). 100 The legal framework is contained in a 1996 Act (LR 941.22). 101 Federal Law on foodstuffs and basic commodities (RS 817.0).

All food establishments are required to notify their activities in the area of food manufacturing, processing, storage, transport, import/export, and purchase to the competent cantonal food authorities (RS 817.02). In addition, all food establishments require a licence to manufacture, process, store or sell food of animal origin.107 3.103. Switzerland continues to apply a stringent regulatory regime for agricultural biotechnology products. The Gene Technology Law and related ordinances regulate genetically modified organisms for food and feed use.108 Commercialization and cultivation of biotechnology crops are subject to approval by the competent federal authorities. Approvals are valid for ten years but may be withdrawn in case of reasonable suspicion that they are hazardous to health or the environment. One GM soya variety, three GM maize varieties, two GM vitamins and two GM enzymes are currently authorized for food use. Another GMO product (the ice-structuring protein type III HPLC 12) is authorized for use as a processing aid in ice cream production (Decision of 18 October 2012). A number of GMO products are authorized for use as feedstuffs .109 Many applications are under review in the authorization procedure .110 The 2006-10 moratorium on approvals for the cultivation of biotechnology crops has been extended for three years until 27 November 2013.111 Within the framework of the 2014-2017 Agricultural Policy, both chambers of Parliament have adopted a second extension of the moratorium until the end of 2017 as an amendment to the Gene Technology Law. Final adoption of the agricultural policy is due in the spring 2013 session of the Parliament. All products from authorized GMOs may be imported into Switzerland. 3.3.3.3 Veterinary measures 3.104. Switzerland's veterinary requirements are fully aligned with those of the EU for imports, transit or exports of live animals and animal products from third countries. Veterinary controls between Switzerland and the EU on products of animal origin were removed on 1 January 2009 to establish a common veterinary area. Live animals and animal products that do not comply with the relevant regulations and/or do not originate from countries and (if applicable) premises accepted to export to the common veterinary area are not allowed entry into Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Imports from outside the veterinary area (non-EEA countries) require a veterinary certificate issued by the competent authorities in the country of origin. An import permit is only required for products covered by the Convention on Internatio nal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Non-EU consignments are normally subject to veterinary inspection at the border (for a minimum fee of SwF 88), with a lower frequency of controls from countries covered by a bilateral equivalence agreement. All importer s of live animals and animal products must be registered in TRACES (a European electronic information and traceability system) and with the Swiss cantonal Contr\u00f4le des denr\u00e9es alimentaires . 3.3.3.4 Phytosanitary measures 3.105. According the authorities, Swiss phytosanitary measures are based on IPPC rules and guidelines, to the extent available. The Swiss Pl ant Protection Ordinance (2001) has been subject to a complete revision, which entered into force on 1 January 2010. 112 The Plant Protection Ordinance is complemented by provisio ns for temporary (emergency) measures.113 According to the authorities, Swiss phytosanitary import requir ements are now fully harmonized with those of 106 Seco online information.

A \"plant passport\" is required for plant imports from EU member States that are potential carriers of pests hazardous for Switzerland (Article 8). A new requirement subjects products from a non-EU country that transit through an EU country to physical inspection by the Swiss competent authorities, unless such a control has already taken place upon first entry into the EU territory (Article 9.1). Phytosanitary import requirements from non-EU countries remain otherwise unchanged. Plants may be imported only from enterprises approved by the Swiss Federal Plant Protection Service. 114 Specific import requirements are applied to products with a high phytosanitary risk, which are subject to phytosanitary certificate with an additional declaration. 3.106. A revised ordinance on pesticides, which entered into force in May 2010, regulates the conditions for the authorization, packaging, labelling, and advertising of pesticides.115 A relevant international standard is not available, according to the Swiss SPS notification.116 The objective of the revision was harmonization with the EU requirements for pesticides.117 According to the authorities, mutual recognition of authorizations with EU member states and parallel trade with the EU is still not possible. 3.3.4 State-trading and state-owned enterprises 3.3.4.1 Overview 3.107. The Swiss Confederation continues to exercise a statutory monopoly over imports of alcohol. For bio-ethanol used as fuel, the exclusive import rights have been lifted since the last TPR in 2008. A complete overhaul of the legal and institutional framework governing the alcohol subsector is under way. Under the alcohol reform, the import regime will be liberalized by withdrawing the State's import monopoly, and nume rous restrictions on domestic production of alcohol and spirits will be phased out. 3.3.4.2 State trading 3.108. The Swiss Alcohol Board ( R\u00e9gie f\u00e9d\u00e9rale des alcohols ) remains the only state-trading enterprise that Switzerland has included in its WTO notifications. 118 The Alcohol Board operates on behalf of the Swiss Confederation with the aim of reducing the production and consumption of spirits according to Article 105 of the Federal Constitution. 3.109. Pursuant to the Alcohol Act of 1932, the Confederation is vested with exclusive rights (monopolies) for the production of spirits, production of alcohol, and imports of alcohol. The Alcohol Act is currently undergoing a complete revision involving the termination of all three federal monopolies. 119 The authorities expect the new legislation to enter into force by 1 July 2014. 3.110. Meanwhile, the alcohol import mo nopoly is still carried out through \" Alcosuisse \" (a profit center of the Swiss Alcohol Board) for ethanol containing at least 80% by volume of alcohol. Imports of high-grade alcohol by the private sector are subject to prior authorization by the Swiss Alcohol Board. Private-sector imports of ethanol and spirits containing no more than 80% by volume are allowed without restriction and permit. The State's import monopoly for bio-ethanol used as fuel was terminated on 1 July 2008.120 Alcosuisse imports about 38 million kg of ethanol annually (47 million litres of pure ethanol), and is required by law to sell at cost; reference prices are published. 121 Alcosuisse is to be privatized as part of the alcohol reform. 114 Article 9.4 of RS 916.20. 115 Ordonnance du 12 mai 2010 sur la mise en circulation des produits phytosanitaires (OPPh) (RS 916.161), revised with effect from 19 December 2011. 116 See WTO document G/SPS/N/CHE/71, 23 March 2010. 117 Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. 118 WTO document G/STR/N/14/CHE, 21 June 2012. The Alcohol Board is the Confederation's oldest institution (125 years). 119 Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le commerce des boissons alcooliques (LCal) (Projet). of bio-ethanol totalled 3.7 million litres in 2010; there is no domestic production. 121 Ordonnance du 29 janvier 1998 concernant les prix de vente l'eau-de-vie Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 65 - 3.111. Imports of ethanol containing at least 80% by volume of alcohol (HS 2207.1000) are subject to an MFN duty of SwF 35/100 kg. The consumption tax on alcoholic beverages or food ranges from zero to SwF 116/l of pure alcohol (\"alcopops\"), depending on the product and alcohol content. There is no consumption tax on wine (up to 18% alcohol content). Ethanol for industrial purposes (denatured) is exempt from tax. 122 3.112. The Confederation has traditionally confe rred its exclusive rights to produce ethanol and spirits to the private sector. Concessions by the Alcohol Board are granted restrictively in accordance with the Alcohol Act. Under the alcohol reform, the restrictive administrative regime (currently involving 43 types of authorization) will be replaced by a producer and importer registration requirement (\"ethanol register\"). 123 3.113. Imports and sales of various types of salt in Switzerland remain under cantonal monopoly (r\u00e9gale du sel ).124 The purpose of the monopoly is to ensu re security of supply. The monopoly is exercised by Saline de Bex SA (owned mainly by the canton of Vaud), and Salines Suisses du Rhin SA (owned by all except the of Liechtenstein). The cantons, through Salines Suisses du Rhin, also fix the price of salt, which includes a tax ( droits de r\u00e9gale ) on imported and domestically produced salt. The most widely used salt type (road salt) is subject to a tax of SwF 0.94/tonne (Chapter 3.1.4). Customs duties apply. Swiss salt imports are in the range of 50,000-70,000 tonnes annually. 3.114. As a consequence of the Swiss salt monopoly, imports of salt and salt by-products (with a sodium chloride content of at least 30% and salt solutions with a sodium chloride content of at least 18%) are subject to authorization by the saltworks. For imports into all cantons, except Vaud, import licences are granted only if salt, salt by-products or salt solutions are required and no appropriate products are available from Salines Suisses du Rhin. This non-tariff measure applies for example to products such as olives and other vegetables that are preserved in brine but unsuitable for immediate consumption (HS 0711.2000). 125 3.115. Liechtenstein, as a shareholder of Salines Suisses du Rhin, is partially supplied by the company. Because of its EEA membership, Liechtenstein no longer participates in the Swiss cantonal monopoly on salt and has replaced the monopoly with an excise duty. All products covered or affected by the Swiss salt monopoly (for example fish in br ine), are subject to the Market Control and Surveillance Mechanism (Box 2.1). 3.3.4.3 State-owned enterprises 3.116. There have been no major developments regarding Swiss state-owned enterprises since 2008. Swiss SOEs remain active in the energy and water sectors, and a number of service subsectors, some of them benefiting from exclusive rights and privileges (Table A3.1). The SOEs in federal ownership (CFF, Swisscom, Skyguide, and Sw iss Post) operate within the framework of the \"strategic objectives\", including on financial and personnel matters, which are fixed for four-year intervals by the Federal Council. 3.117. The legal and institutional framework for po stal services in Switzerland is undergoing a complete revision. The reform entails, inter alia , transforming Swiss Post ( la Poste Suisse ) into a public company, and eliminating fiscal privileges and State guarantees. Swiss Post's monopoly for the delivery of domestic and international in bound letters was reduced from 100 g to 50 g, effective 1 April 2009. As a result, about 25% of the volume of domestic letters (approximately 30% of the total revenues) is open to competition (Chapter 4.4.4.1). 3.118. There have been no changes regarding state-owned enterprises in Liechtenstein since its last TPR in 2008. State-owned or private enterprises continue to hold exclusive rights or exercise monopoly powers over the supply of energy, public passenger transport, and certain postal services (Table A3.1). 122 Partial denaturing, for tax purposes, is subj ect to authorization by the Alcohol Board. 123 Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur l'imposition des boissons spiritueuses et de l'\u00e9thanol (Limpspi) (Projet). For example, after a ban of more than 100 years, agricultural producers will again be allowed to distil potatoes. 124 Inter-Cantonal Convention on the sa le of salt in Switzerland (RS 691). 125 Federal Customs Administration online information, \"Tares\". Viewed at: www.tares.ch . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 66 - 3.3.5 Competition policy and price controls 3.3.5.1 Switzerland 3.3.5.1.1 Overview 3.119. In Switzerland, limited competition in various industries, for reasons such as legal and regulatory issues at the federal level, has resulted in higher prices of certain products and services than in comparable EU and U.S. markets. The co mpetition authorities are eager to achieve a high degree of competition effectiveness, not only by proposing long-term projects aiming at aligning the legal instruments with international best practices, but also by taking signal decisions in numerous enforcement actions. 3.120. Most of the developments in the competition regime during the review period resulted from the recommendations from the Synthesis Report by the Task Force Cartel Act presented to the Federal Council on 14 January 2009. 126 The Report found that the legal instruments adopted by the 2003 revision (leniency programme, opposition proceedings, and raids) had enabled the competition authority to prevent and uncover prac tices diminishing competition, and promoted the preventive effect of the Cartels Law (LCart) and its conformity with the competition regulations' standards. However, in certain areas, international best practices had not been achieved. Therefore, the Report concluded with a series of proposals intended for the consideration of Parliament and the executive authorities. For exam ple, it considered that the various authorities dealing with competition matters must be totally independent of political influences and business, and their current organization must be replaced with a system with a single level of authority. 3.121. The Report also noted that Switzerland does not maintain any agreements on cooperation in competition matters with other states. In view of the growing importance of globalization and the increasing frequency of cross-border antitrust practices, it deemed it appropriate to conclude cooperation agreements with its main trading partners in order to make possible the exchange of confidential information. 127 Due to certain deficiencies in the Swiss measures to effectively enhance competition, mergers that may have a strong negative effect on competition, and consequently on the economy and on consumer welfare in Switzerland, might be approved. According to the Report, the harmonization of th e Swiss merger control system with the EU's would eliminate these problems. For example, this harmonization would result in the introduction of the SIEC-test. 128 3.122. The Report also considered it necessary to amend the LCart and its current application in order to examine each vertical agreement in the light of its effect on the competition. 3.3.5.1.2 Legal and institutional framework 3.123. Legislation on competition has not changed substantially since 2004. Four main laws continue to regulate competition: the Federal Law on cartels and other impediments to competition of 6 October 1995 (Cartels Law, LCart, RS 251), amended in 2004; the Federal Law against unfair competition of 22 October 1992 (LCD, LR 24), amended in 2002; the Federal Law on the internal market of 6 October 1995 (LMI, RS 943.02), am ended in 2006; and the Law on price surveillance of 20 December 1985 (LSPr), which allows price investigations by the Price Controller when competition is deemed to be lacking. 3.124. The Swiss competition authority consists of a secretariat and the non-permanent Competition Commission (Comco) responsible for enforcing the legislation. Comco currently consists of 12 members, including the President and Vice-Presidents (who are nominated by the Federal Council), independent experts, and representatives of various interest groups (e.g. industry, retail, consumer, labour, and agricultural associations). Some members also hold 126 Synthesis Report. Viewed at: http://www.weko.admin.ch/dokumentation/00216/index.html?lang=en . 127 In its 2010 annual report, Comco showed that, in vari ous cartel cases, where the EU had also opened an investigation, the possibility of enhanced cooperatio n would have made for greater efficiency in identifying and eliminating the cartels concerned. 128 The significant impediment of effective competition (SIEC) test, introduced in 2004 in the European Union merger control, aims at eliminating enforcement gaps that may exist in the dominance test. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 67 - positions on company boards. The secretariat carries out investigations and submits the results to Comco for decision. 3.125. As a way of enhancing international cooperation, the Federal Council has initiated consultations with a view to introducing in the LCart a provision (through a new Article 41) for Comco to cooperate closely with foreign authorities, to communicate confidential information to them, including business secrets, and to coordinate cartel investigations with those authorities. However, the Federal Council decided not to address international cooperation in the legislation. It considers that another route for enhancing cooperation is the conclusion of second-generation cooperation agreements allowing the exchange of confidential information with Switzerland's main trading partners. An example is the Switzerland-EU agreement on cooperation and competition matters, which is near completion. 3.126. One important revision relates to the rules on rebutting the presumption that effective competition has been eliminated. The revised Vertical Notice on the competition law treatment of vertical agreements (the Vertical Notice), issued on 28 June 2010, takes into account the most recent case decisions made by Comco, as well as developments in EU competition law, and states that, in order to rebut the presumption, an overall consideration of the market, including economic efficiency, is decisive, even for clauses that are considered to be \"qualitatively serious agreements such as resale price maintenance and absolute terri torial protection\". This amendment to the rules on vertical restrictions has been criticized. Thus, during the consultation to which the reform gave rise, the Price Controller observed that \"the abandonment of the current presumption that effective competition has been eliminated under vertical (h ard core) agreements, as proposed in the draft, would send the wrong signal. It is absolutely nece ssary to avoid giving the impression of a return to a more permissive practice with regard to vertical agreements, inasmuch as resale price maintenance and agreements on absolute territorial protection are important reasons for the high level of prices in Switzerland\". 129 3.127. Furthermore, when assessing whether an agreement is justified for reasons of economic efficiency, the Vertical Notice takes into account not only the market share of the provider, which was already the case in the past, but also the customer's share in the supply market. This is because some buyers may also have market power with potentially negative effects on competition. 3.128. The Vertical Notice also makes it possible, in principle, for any dealer to use the Internet to sell its products. 3.129. A possible amendment to the communication of 21 October of 2005 130 on vertical agreements in the field of motor vehicle distribution is currently the subject of consultations in the industry. They revolve around whether the communication should be maintained in its present form, revoked or adapted with due regard to, inter alia , the revision of the European Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation.131 On 16 July 2012, the Comco decided to keep the current communication unchanged. The Comco will decide in the second half year of 2014 if the existing rules in the automotive industry have to be reconsidered. 3.130. The Federal Council has submitted to the Federal Chambers, for approval, a far-reaching revision of the LCart. The Parliament decided to enter into debate in June 2012. The draft text provides for the establishment of an independ ent competition authority, which will conduct enquiries and submit its proposals to an independent tribunal of first instance, which will have decision-making power. The specialized judges of this competition tribunal will have to meet high standards of independence with regard to possible economic and political interests. This new tribunal will be fully integrated into the Federal Administrative Tribunal. Its proceedings are also to be expedited through shortened time-frames for legal action. 3.131. The draft modifies the standard of pr oof for certain anti-competitive agreements (horizontal agreements on prices, quantities an d geographical distribution, certain vertical 129 Price Controller Annual Report 2010, p. 870. 130 Viewed at: http://www.weko.admin.ch/dokumen tation/01007/index.html?lang=fr . 131 On 27 May 2010, the European Commission adop ted Regulation No. 461/2010 and the guidelines relating thereto, introducing new competition rules for the motor vehicle industry. A decision will be taken by the end of 2012. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 68 - agreements on prices and territorial partitioning) by no longer requiring the provision of evidence that such agreements constitute a significant impairment of competition. 3.132. The revision also concerns civil proceedings under cartel law. Currently, locus standi is reserved to economic operators whose access to co mpetition or exercise thereof is impeded. The draft grants legal standing to the end customers. 3.133. The reform simplifies and strengthens control of the operations of concentrations, provides for consideration to be given to the establishment of conformity programmes at the sanction stage, and improves the opposition procedure. 3.134. All the same, various proposals made during the consultations on revision of the LCart were not taken up in the message addressed to the Federal Chambers. That is the case, in particular, for the introduction of criminal penalties against natural persons that have contributed to the violation of the law relating to cartels. Various groups that have been consulted have expressed their endorsement of the basic purpose of the LCart, namely that of a legal basis for corporate entities exclusively. 132 3.3.5.1.3 Enforcement 3.135. A significant part of the competition secret ariat's activities have been concentrated on the most harmful forms of horizontal restraints of competition, with a particular focus on bid rigging, a quite widespread behaviour in Switzerland. These activities followed three approaches: prevention and information, which involved measures intended to raise awareness; exposure, which comprised collection and evaluation of bid data; and prosecution. 3.136. Vertical restraints were another priority area. In a landmark ruling against a toothpaste manufacturer in 2009, Comco made its first ever decision relating to an absolute territorial protection agreement, by condemning the manufac turer's imposition of an export ban on its Austrian licensee. By condemning an anti-competitive obstacle to parallel importation, permitted under the principle of international exhaustion of ri ghts (see section 3.3.6), this decision illustrates how competition policy and intellectual property laws share the same basic objective of promoting consumer welfare and an efficient allocation of resources. More recently, Comco confirmed its determination to act against any restrictions of imports by means of vertical agreements that foreclose territory, by imposing heavy fines on producers of cameras (2011) and cars (2012), which had unlawfully restricted parallel imports. In all three cases (toothpaste, cameras, and cars), the Federal Administrative Court still has to rule on the appeals filed by the undertakings involved. Comco also ruled, in another landmark decision, that restrictions of online trading in principle contravene the LCart and that they are permitted only on very strict conditions. For example, it may be justified in a selective distri bution network to require online distributors to meet the same requirements as licensed specialist dealers and to operate a physical sales outlet. 3.137. The competition authorities have received numerous enquiries as to why, when the euro is weak, buyers or consumers of imported goods, with prices originally set in euros, do not profit or do not profit in full from the resultant lower prices in Swiss francs. A number of reasons, not necessarily specific to Switzerland, could explai n this phenomenon. For example, the cost-reducing effect of a stronger Swiss franc is felt in many sectors only after a certain time and only where there are lasting exchange rate benefits, because goods are often imported on long-term contractual arrangements based on a rate fixed in the past. In some cases, goods are also purchased abroad in Swiss francs. 133 List prices for durable goods may be fixed in advance, in Swiss francs, and not adjusted on a daily basis. Short-term cost reductions may however be passed on as discounts. For example, although Swiss car dealers did not reduce their list prices in 2010 as a result of the strong franc, they did react to provide a \"euro bonus\".134 A number of proceedings have also been opened where there was evidence of unlawful restraints of 132 See Feuille F\u00e9d\u00e9rale No. 10 of 6 March 2012, page 1635.

The heavy workload due to proceedings already opened, has resulted in new cases being placed on hold.135 3.3.5.1.4 Price supervision 3.138. The Price Supervision Act has not b een amended since 1 January 2007. The Price Supervisor observes price developments and prev ents abusive price increases and abusive price maintenance in any market, where the price level is not the consequence of effective competition, and informs the public about her/his activities. 3.139. Enterprises with market power may submit envisaged price increases to the Price Supervisor. In addition, anyone who believes that a price has been increased or maintained in an abusive manner may address a notice of abuse to the Price Supervisor. The latter will determine whether there are indications of abusive price fixing, and if so will attempt to reach a mutual agreement with the respective enterprise. If no agreement can be reached, the Price Supervisor will prohibit all or part of the increase or order a reduction in price. Anyone who intentionally fails to observe a price reduction order, or increases a price in spite of prohibition or exceeds a price fixed in a mutual agreement, is liable to a fine of up to SwF 100,000. The Price Supervisor must be informed in advance if prices are to be fixed or approved by other authorities (i.e. an executive or legislative authority of the Confederation, of a canton or commune, or another federal price regulator). In these cases, the Price Supervisor may make recommendations. 3.140. The Price Supervisor has launched enquiries on abusive prices in several sectors of the economy, including health care, gas, postal services, and public transport. 136 In the field of public health, the new financing scheme for health care in nursing homes for the elderly and home care, introduced on 1 January 2011, is also being monitored by the Price Supervisor since it has occasionally led to an illegal and substantial increase in the financial burden on residents of nursing homes. A study considering tariffs of 88 nursing homes revealed major disparities, which the Price Supervisor found to be hardly justifiable. In his view, the problem appears to lie in the lack of regulation to ensure that the residual financing for health care was carried out according to the law passed by the Federal Parliament. 3.141. The Price Supervisor, like Comco (see above), has also addressed the question of the strong Swiss franc. Due to an express request of the Federal Council, particular attention has been paid to the impact on national price levels in all current case files. The Price Supervisor also set up an internal unit to deal with the problem of import prices and the fact that exchange rate benefits resulting from the appreciation of the Swiss franc, vis-\u00e0-vis the euro in particular, were not entirely transmitted to Swiss consumers. 3.142. The Price Supervisor welcomed the implementation of the Cassis de Dijon principle in Switzerland on 1 July 2010, under which products legally placed on the market in the EU or the European Economic Area may, in principle, be so ld in Switzerland without any additional approval. According to the Price Supervisor, \"the lifting of technical barriers to trade resulting from this Cassis de Dijon principle facilitates international trade and promotes competition and therefore can be expected to bring down prices that are still above international price levels\". 137 3.3.5.2 Liechtenstein 3.143. Liechtenstein does not have national competition legislation. Competition issues are dealt with mainly under the EEA and EFTA treaties. Two EU acts have been implemented. 138 The Office of Economic Affairs has jurisdiction over competition issues unless the jurisdiction of the national court is relevant. 135 Comco (2011). 136 The Price Controller publishes an annual report on the main cases analysed.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 70 - 3.3.6 Trade-related intellectual property rights 3.3.6.1 Overview 3.144. Intellectual property (IP) occupies a central place in the domestic economy and the international trade profile of Switzerland. According to the 2012 Global Innovation Index , Switzerland retained its 2011 first-place ranking in innovation performance (innovation capabilities and results) out of 141 countries or economies. 139 The 2012-13 Global Competitiveness Report indicates that Switzerland again heads the overall rankings.140 The central role of innovation in Switzerland was also reported in the European Union's 2011 Innovation Union Scoreboard .141 3.145. Revision of Swiss IP legislation is on-going, mainly to keep pace with technological developments and, where the authorities deem a ppropriate, to harmonize with treaties and EU legislation. 3.146. The competent authorities for IP issues in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein are, respectively, the Swiss Federal Institute of Intell ectual Property (FIIP) of the Federal Department (Ministry) of Justice and Police142, and the Bureau of Intellectual Property of the Liechtenstein Office (Ministry) of Economic Affairs.143 Under the 1978 bilateral Treaty on the Protection Conferred by Patents for Inventions, concluded within the framework of the Customs Union Treaty, Liechtenstein and Switzerland form a unitary territory for the purposes of patent protection: a patent valid in one party's territory is also valid in the other's. 144 Patent applications made through the national, regional (i.e. under the European Patent Convention) or international (i.e. under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty) avenues must jointly designate the two countries. With the exception of patents for inventions, Liechtenstein has its own legislation for, inter alia , copyright, trademarks, industrial designs and topographies of integrated circuits. In addition, Liechtenstein implements EEA rules on intellectual property. 3.147. Switzerland and Liechtenstein are members of the WIPO and are parties to most of its treaties 145, as well as to other international conventions of relevance to intellectual property.146 Since the last TPR in 2008, Liechtenstein has not adhered to or ratified other WIPO treaties in force. Switzerland ratified the Singapore Tr eaty on the Law of Trademarks, effective 6 March 2009 147, and signed the WIPO's new Beijing Treaty on Audio-visual Performances on 26 June 2012.148 3.148. In the context of EFTA, Switzerland and Li echtenstein have concluded or are in the process of negotiating, with individual third countries, groups of countries or entities, free-trade agreements or trade and economic cooperation ag reements with an IP component that ranges from a general reference to IP protection to highly detailed provisions on certain IP sectors.149 139 INSEAD-WIPO (2012).

The Patent Law of 1954 and its Ordinance, as revised up to 2008, govern patent protection in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.151 In addition to the 20-year patent term for protection under the TRIPS Agreement, the revised Patent Law also provides for a supplementary (complementary) protection certificate (SPC) for patented inventions requiring federal authorization before being put on the market. This currently concerns pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The SPC is aimed at giving the patentee the possibility of recovering the time lost while awaiting market authorization. The maximum extension is five years. 3.152. On 19 December 2008, the Parliament adopted, with some significant amendments, the Federal Council's draft Article 9a of the Patent Law. 152 The amendments relate to the issue of exhaustion of patent rights, and constitute a notable change in the Swiss approach.153 The text adopted on 19 December 2008 (entered into force on 1 July 2009) relates to: as a unilateral decision by the Swiss Parliament, the EEA-wide exhaustion principle applies to patent inventions (products and processes) (Article 9a(1)). By virtue of the EEA exhaustion principle, patent owners cannot prev ent the parallel importation of their patented products put on the market of EEA members by themselves or with their consent. it is permitted to import products placed on the market outside the EEA by the patent owner if the patent protection is of a lesser degree of importance for the functional characteristics of the product. 154 151 See WTO (2009) for details on the revised legislation, and document WT/TPR/M/208/Add.1, for Switzerland's replies to the questions posed by th e delegations of Canada, Colombia, Mexico, and the United States during the TPR meeting. In the context of TRIPS Council meetings, Switzerland provided further information on the application of the revised Patent Law, notably with regard to the disclosure requirement in patent applications. See IP/C/M/69, para.86; and IP/C/M/66, paras. 79-86. 152 Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Modification du 2009 2615.

At the requests (\"motions\") of the two Chambers of the Parliament, the Federal Council su bmitted in 2007 a separate piece of law on exhaustion of patent rights. 154 Viewed at: https://www.ige.ch/e n/legal-info/legal-areas/pat ents/parallel-imports.html . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 73 - for products the prices of which are fixed by the State in Switzerland or abroad, the patent owners' consent for importation is necessary, in other words national exhaustion continues to apply in that situation. This specifically affects pharmaceutical products. for inventions regarding agricultural inputs and capital goods, international exhaustion continues to apply. 155 in the context of the Patent Law revision, the Parliament also abrogated Article 14, paragraph 3 of the Law on Therapeutic Products, prohibiting the importation of an original product authorized pursuant to a simplified procedure of market authorization as long as the product is patented. The ground for such an abrogation was to \"dissociate public tasks from the enforcement of patent rights by private parties\". 156 3.153. There are currently no publicly available fi gures reflecting the impact of these changes on the availability and affordability of the products concerned. 3.154. As a member of the EEA, Liechtenstein a pplies EEA-wide exhaustion. The shift to EEA-wide exhaustion by Switzerland may have the effect of bringing the concept of a unitary patent system for the two countries into consonance with Liechtenstein' participation in the EEA. 3.155. The Swiss Law on Patent Attorneys, which entered into force on 1 July 2011, regulates the use of the professional title \"patent attorney\".157 It also entails changes, mainly of a procedural nature (e.g. regarding domicile or residence requir ement), in other related pieces of legislation, including the Swiss Federal Patent Law, the Law on Trademarks, the Law on Designs, and the Swiss Federal Law on the Statute and Tasks of the Federal Institute for Intellectual Property. This amendment, aimed at bringing the Swiss patent framework into accord with other European legal frameworks, constitutes a more liberalized approach to the exceptions permitted under paragraph 2 of TRIPS Article 3 on national treatment. 3.156. The Swiss Law on the Federal Patent Court establishes a national special court competent for patent litigation at first instance, the Tribunal F\u00e9d\u00e9ral (Supreme Court) being the last instance. The Federal Patent Court replaces the 26 cantonal courts. It comprises both legally and technically trained judges. English may be used as the language of proceedings provided that the Court and the parties give their consent. This law entered in to force on 1 March 2010 (for organizational and institutional clauses) and has been fully operative since 1 January 2012. 158 3.157. In the area of patents, the share (in percentage) of patent applications by top fields of technology during 1997-2011 is, for Switzerland: pharmaceuticals (11.59), organic fine chemistry (9.24), medical technology (8.13), handling (6. 38), measurement (5.83), electrical machinery, apparatus, energy (4.37), basic materials chemistry (4.10), biotechnology (3.74), other special machines (3.51), food chemistry (3.42), and others (39.69). 159 For Liechtenstein, the share is: machine tools (21.75), mechanical elements (11), pharmaceuticals (9.36), medical technology (6.38), civil engineering (5.93), electrical machin ery, apparatus, energy (5.32), transport (4.55), other special machines (4.00), measurement (3.87), surface technology, coating (3.70), and others (24.14).160 3.3.6.3 Plant varieties 3.158. Information provided in the 2008 TPR of Sw itzerland and Liechtenstein on the protection of plant varieties in Switzerland remains valid.

For example, whoever wishes to use this title must possess the required professional qualifications, i.e. must have passed the patent attorn ey exam and hold a university degree in science or engineering as well as have professi onal experience. Before commencing pr acticing under this title, a patent attorney must prove through a federa l patent attorney examination that he or she possesses the required professional qualifications in order to be entered into a new patent attorney register. The register is maintained by the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property. As at end-November 2012, 417 patent attorneys were registered. 158 RS 173.41. 159 Viewed at: http://www.wipo.int/instats/statistics/country_profile/countries/ch.html WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 74 - the Convention on the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV Convention) was notified in February 2009. 3.159. The information provided by Liechtenst ein in the course of the TPR meeting of 2004 remains valid.161 3.3.6.4 Trade marks 3.160. There have been no major changes in the area of trademarks since 2008. Changes of a procedural nature include changes in the Federal Code of Civil Procedure162, and changes stemming from the adoption of the new Law on Patent Attorneys (requirement for a notification address in Switzerland in order to participate in an administrative procedure) (see section 3.3.6.2). 3.161. International exhaustion for trademarks applies in Switzerland163 and in Liechtenstein.164 3.3.6.5 Geographical indications 3.162. The information provided in the 2008 TPR report on the two-pronged system of protection of geographical indications in Switzerland remains valid: the protection of geographical indications under the Trademark Law for all products and serv ices, which does not require registration, and the protection of geographical indications for wines and spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs under several laws and ordinances. The geographical indication of \"Swiss Made\" for watches, as provided in the Trademark Law, is currently regu lated by a special ordinance on the use of the designation \"Swiss\" for watches. 165 3.163. An amendment to the Trademark Law and the Federal Law on the Protection of Swiss Armorial Bearings and Other Public Signs (Swissness Bill) is currently being examined in the Parliament. The purpose of the bill is to lay down the foundation for a \"sustainable preservation of the added value\" - i.e. marketing power - of th e term \"Swiss\" and the Swiss cross for trade of goods and services. The bill proposes that the pr otection of the term \"Swiss\" and of the Swiss cross (white cross on a red background) be strengthen ed at a national level as well as with a view to law enforcement abroad. The bill proposes a number of criteria for a product or service to be eligible for protection. 3.164. Several free-trade agreements with individual countries and group of countries contain provisions on geographical indications. Two bila teral agreements concluded by Switzerland contain provisions on the protection of geographical in dications with lists of names. The scope of the free-trade and economic partnership agreement with Japan is wider, i.e. covers other IPRs, whilst the bilateral agreement with Russia covers exclusively geographical indications. 3.165. In May 2011, Switzerland and Liechtenstein signed agreements with the EU on the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs. For Switzerland, the agreement was co ncluded under the umbrella of the Treaty of 21 June 1999 between Switzerland and the Euro pean Communities on trade of agricultural products. The agreement entered into force for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein on 1 December 2011 as Annex 12 of the treaty. 166 161 \"At present, plant varieties rights granted abroad would be recogniz ed in Liechtenstein due to the TRIPS obligation to protect plant varieties. No case of alleged infringement has been re ported so far. It is not yet possible to obtain protection for a plant variety by a national procedure.

Changes of procedural nature include changes in the Federal Code of Civil Procedure167, and changes due to the adoption of the new Law on Patent Attorney s (requirement for a notification address in Switzerland in order to participate in an administrative procedure). 3.167. There is no judicial precedent on the Sw iss regime of exhaustion of design rights. 3.168. Liechtenstein has its own law on industrial designs, very similar to the Swiss Federal Law. The Design Act stipulates the principle of international exhaustion of rights.168 3.3.6.7 Copyright and related rights 3.169. Changes made to the Copyright Law during the review period are of a procedural nature, e.g. changes to the Federal Code of Civil Procedure. 169 The Swiss Federal Tribunal upholds the principle of international exhaustion and authorizes parallel imports of products covered by copyright. However, the 2003 revision regulates imports of video cassettes or DVDs previously marketed in a third country, which require an authorization from the author or their legal successor to be distributed in Switzerland. Au dio-visual works in Switzerland are exploited according to the \"cascade principle\" during the first stage of exploitation, i.e. the work is first featured in cinemas, then on vi deo or DVD, and finally on television. 170 3.170. Switzerland has signed the WIPO Beijing Treaty on Audio-visual Works of 24 June 2012. 3.171. Issues linked to Internet and new technologi es affecting copyright are of a high priority in Switzerland. Various motions have been debated and rejected by the Federal Council. It has been suggested to make full use of the legal panoply of measures available, including actions against Internet access providers and operators of platform s and file sharing (\"peer-to-peer\"), and further explore other possibilities. Two parliamentary motions have been retained by the Federal Council: the Postulat Recordon 12.3326 171 for copyright protection that is equitable and compatible with Internet users' freedom, and the Postulat Gl\u00e4ttli 12.3173172 for fair compensation of artists while respecting the private sphere of Internet users.173 In response to these po stulates and following up its response to the Postulat Savary, the Federa l Department of Justice and Police established a special \"Working Group for the Optimization of Collective Management of Copyrights and Neighbouring Rights\" on 8 August 2012; the time line is the end of 2013.174 The USTR 2012 Special 301 Report cited a number of countries, including Switzerland, under the general heading of \"Piracy over the Internet and Digital Piracy\" - and not on the watch list - and stated that the United States will seek \"to work with them to strengthen legal regimes and enhance enforcement\". 175 3.172. Copyright protection in Liechtenstein is guaranteed by the Law of 19 May 1999 on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights. Information in the 2008 TPR report of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, including on resale rights introduced in accordance with the EU acquis communautaire , remains relevant.

Protection of confidential information co ntained in applications for protection and IP registers is provided for in particular in the resp ective IP laws. Moreover, protection against unfair competition practices as spelt out in footnote 10 of the TRIPS Agreement has been provided for by law since 1988 in Switzerland. 3.175. Article 14(3) of the Law on Therapeutic Products, which prohibited the importation of an original product authorized pursuant to a simplified procedure of market authorization as long as the product is patented, was abrogated by the Parliament on 19 December 2008 (see section 3.3.6.2). The ground for the abrogation was to \"dissociate public tasks from the enforcement of patent rights by private parties\". 177 3.3.6.10 Enforcement 3.176. As indicated in the 2008 TPR report and by the Swiss authorities, the laws on copyright, topographies of integrated circuits, trademarks, and designs, were amended to improve enforcement of IP rights, including border meas ures against counterfeiting and piracy. Trade in counterfeit and illegally copied goods is of great concern to Swiss producers and to the Swiss authorities. The Swiss FIIP and the Internationa l Chamber of Commerce, Switzerland, created the Swiss Anti-Counterfeiting and Piracy Platform, STOP PIRACY, according to which, \"the Swiss economy suffers losses of SwF 2 billion annually due to counterfeiting and piracy. Worldwide damages are estimated to be several hundred billion Swiss francs annually. However, more important than the numbers is that counterfeit ing and pirated copies undermine the incentive system behind intellectual property and inhibit investment in innovation - even in the countries that are the source of the counterfeiting.\" 178 STOP PIRACY has also undertaken campaigns to raise Swiss consumer awareness regarding counterfeit and pirated goods, including a relatively new feature of the amendments to the IP laws in 2008, namely sanctions against the importation of such goods for private use.179 Switzerland participated in the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) . It has not yet signed the agreement. 3.177. A 2011 report by the Federal Customs Administration (FCA)180 shows that the number of interventions increased from 1,622 in 2008 (value of seized consignments: SwF 14 million) to 3,180 (value of seized consignments: SwF 8.4 million), an increase of 96%. These figures relate to interventions under the IP laws, not under the Law on Therapeutic Products (pharmaceutical products) or the Law on Precious Metals Control (watches and jewellery). 3.178. On the issue of measures regarding transit goods, the Swiss FIIP has provided clarifications on the interpretation of the relevant Patent Law provisions: \"The transit of patent-infringing goods can only be prohibited when the patent owner can also prohibit the import into the country of destination. Assistance measures regarding goods in transit can only be provided by customs when direct evidence is pres ent concerning infringement of a patent in both Switzerland and in the country of destination.\" 181 176 RS 231.2 and RS 231.21. 177 Former Article 14, paragraph 3, Law on Therapeutic Products (RS 812.21). 178 Viewed at: http://www.stop-piracy .ch/en/candp/cap1.shtm . 179 De minimis imports are dealt with in Article 60 of the TRIPS Agreement. 180 IGE/IPI online information, \"Counterfeiting and Piracy: 2011 Intellectual Property Law from the and Liechtenstein - 77 - 4 TRADE POLICIES BY SECTOR 4.1 Agriculture 4.1. Swiss agriculture contributed about 1% to GDP and 3.8% to employment in 2011. 1 Most of the 58,000 farms are small family enterprises (ave raging 18 ha) with litt le hired labour. Only about 100 farms have more than 100 hectares. About half of the Swiss farms are located in hilly or mountainous regions. Within the framework of the direct payment scheme (averaging about SwF 50,000 per farm), farmers receive compensation for working on sloping terrain or delivering public goods, such as food security. 2 The main basic agricultural products are milk, bovine animals, and pigs. Switzerland is traditionally a net-importer of agricultural and food products (Chart 1.1). While imports are spread over all categories of agricultural products, exports are predominantly processed food products. On behalf of the Government, private organizations (R\u00e9servesuisse, Agricura) are managing compulsory reserve stock schemes for a range of fo od and feedstuffs, as well as nitrogen fertilizer (Chapter 3.1.7). 3 4.2. In Liechtenstein, agriculture's contribution to GDP is marginal. About two thirds of the territory of Liechtenstein are hilly and mountainous areas. There were 118 farms in 2010 with an average size of 31 hectares. Milk is the main basic agricultural product, followed by meat, grains, and vegetables. Switzerland acts on behalf of Liechtenstein on Customs Union matters, such as imports and exports of agricultural products. Liechtenstein has its own direct payment scheme. Liechtenstein farmers also benefit from some Swiss market support measures, such as the subsidy for milk processed into cheese, in return for an annual financial contribution by Liechtenstein. Some Liechtenstein companies participate in the Swiss auctions of the meat tariff quotas and the export subsidy scheme. 4.1.1 Border measures 4.3. The average applied MFN tariff on agricultural products (WTO definition) is estimated at 31.9% in 2012 (Table 3.2). Meat, dairy products, and vegetables are the most tariff-protected products. High or prohibitive MFN tariffs in import-competing sectors contrast with free trade in a range of products, such as cotton, where there is no or little domestic production (Table 3.3). Since its last TPR in 2008, Switzerland has carried out a few tariff reduction initiatives in the context of the Agricultural Policy 2011 or as a result of bilateral agreements with the EU (Table 4.1). Table 4.1 Agricultural tariff reduction initiatives, 2008-12 Product Description Reference Feed grains, oilseeds, and feedstuff mixtures The threshold price syst em applies. Import th reshold prices were reduced for grains (to SwF 360/t) and oilseeds (to SwF 500/t), aimed to reduce feed costs of livestock producers. Protection of the domestic feed in dustry through tariff escalation was phased-out. As of 1 July 2011, industrial protection elements incorporated in the tariffs for f eedstuff mixtures were removed. RS 916.01 RS 916.112.231 Bread cereals and flour The new reference price system applie s. On 1 July 2009, the reference price for bread cereals was reduced from SwF 600 to SwF 560/t. As of July 2008, the tariff for wheat flour is linked to the tariff on bread cereals (wheat), resulting in a reduction from SwF 1,430/t to a maximum of SwF 507/t since 1 July 2010. RS 916.01 Cut flowers MFN out-of-quota tariffs for cu t flowers are to be re duced in ten stages to the level of the MFN in-quota tariffs (2007-17).

Source: WTO Secretariat, based on informat ion provided by the Swiss authorities. 4.4. Switzerland has WTO tariff-quota commitments for 28 product categories. In practice, Switzerland implements 58 tariff quotas, since numerous WTO tariff quotas are divided into sub-quotas.4 Some tariff quotas are sub-divided up to th ree times. The bilateral preferential tariff quotas (about 80) are generally aggregated with WTO tariff quotas.5 Imports originating from the free zones of Haute-Savoie and Pays de Gex are not attributed to a tariff quota.6 The predominant allocation procedures are first-come-first-served, auctioning , past imports, and prise en charge under which the allocation of tariff quota is contingent upon local purchases (Table A4.1). Changes to the administration methods were notified regularly7, and the complex tariff quota management system (about 300 pages) can also be consulted online.8 For a number of WTO tariff quotas, Switzerland provides autonomously \"unlimited\" access at the bound in-quota tariff, e.g. for casein or durum wheat. When domestic supply is considered insufficient, the tariff quotas may also be increased autonomously, resulting in fill ratios greater than 100% (Table A4.2). 4.1.2 Domestic support 4.5. Switzerland's key domestic support instruments are: (i) subsidies and other government expenditures for market support measures; and (ii) direct payments. In its notifications to the WTO Committee on Agriculture, Switzerland has reported price support through applied administered prices for bovine meat, pig meat, milk, and 16 other basic agricultural products. 9 However, according to the authorities, Switzerland does not apply administered prices; \"observed\" prices are used to calculate the support. 4.6. Switzerland's current policy framework, the Agricultural Policy 2011 (AP 2011), runs from 2008 to 2013. The main thrust of the AP 2011 is a further shift from (product-specific) market support to direct payments. The objective is to cut budgetary expenditures for market support by more than half, and to phase-out agricultural export subsidies on basic agricultural products (Table 4.2). Direct payments increased significantly as from 2009, and expenditures for market support measures were reduced, albeit by less than 50%. 4.7. The AP 2011 leaves the basic structure of the Swiss direct payment scheme unchanged (Table 4.3). About 80% of expenditures are \"general\" direct payments (area payments, \"payments for roughage consuming animals\" and \"farming under difficult production conditions\"); the remainder are payments to achieve environmenta l and animal welfare objectives. The general eligibility criteria for direct payments include a set of ecological performance standards (proof of ecological performance), including a 7% set aside. The maximum direct payment is SwF 70,000 per annual work unit. Direct payments (DPs) are degressive by farm size, animal numbers, income, and assets. 10 When the DP scheme was introduced in 1992, the intent was to decouple the support from production, but this objective has not been expressly reflected in the legal framework. 11 By and large, the direct payments continue to be linked to land and/or livestock 4 The three tariff quotas for wine were merged. 5 The only exception is a preferential tariff quota for potatoes (HS 0701.9010) granted to Egypt, which is opened even if the MFN tariff quota is filled. 6 R\u00e8glement du 22 d\u00e9cembre 1933 concernant les importations en Suisse des produits des zones franches (RS 0.631.256.934.953). 7 WTO documents G/AG/CHE/13/ Add.10 to Add. 14. 8 Federal Department of Agricultur e online information.

Liechtenstein's new law on agriculture, in force since 1 July 2009, consolidates the former legislative acts on agriculture without introducing fundamental changes.15 The policy objective is to increase the competitiveness of Liechtenstein's agriculture sector and maintain market conditions similar to those in Switzerland. The law also puts more emphasis on marketing and image-building with a view to better promoting agricultural good s made in Liechtenstein. New elements are the definition of professional requirements for recognition as farmer, and promotion of entrepreneurship. While Liechtenstein has its own direct payment system (last modified in 2010 16), most measures are similar to the Swiss measures (Table 4.4). Box 4.1 Swiss Agricultural Policy 2014-17 The next stage of Switzerland's agricultural policy is scheduled to begin on 1 January 2014 (AP 2014-17). The Bill, which amends the Law on Agriculture and includes a four-year budgetary framework, is currently pending before the Swiss Parliament. The main policy objectives are: food security (maintain self-sufficiency at the current level of around 60%); comp etitiveness; efficient and sustainable use of natural resources; and innovation and entrepreneurship in agriculture. At the core of the AP 2014-17 is a re-arrangement and fine- tuning of the direct payment (DP) scheme, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the measures, and address conflicts with WTO Green Box criteria. Total DP ex penditures will be maintained at the current level of about SwF 2.8 billion per year. There will be some redist ribution of subsidies from livestock/dairy production to the arable sector. The revised DP scheme has seven categories, which are linke d to the achievement of specific policy objectives and the provision of public goods: payments for en suring food supplies (i.e. food-security payments); bio-diversity payments; producti on systems; resource-efficiency payments; and transitional payments. The system is complex. Each category has several measures, including payments . The budget for \"payments for roughage-consuming animals\", \" livestock payments under difficult production conditions\", and the \"payments for the open arable land and permanent cr ops\" will be moved to th e food-security category (\"payments for ensu ring food supplies\", about SwF 1 billion per ye ar). To reduce the ince ntives on production, the payments for livestock holders will no longer be tied to the number of animals, and are to be based on acreage with a minimum stocking density (Table 4.3). The DP eligibility criteria are left substantially unchanged, with two exceptions foreseen by the Govern ment: elimination of the income/asset limits for DPs (exception for transitional payments) and of the gradua tion of large farms; and land in building zones will become ineligible. 15 Law on Agriculture of 11 December 2008 (LR 910.0). 16 Agricultural Income Supplements Ordinance of 23 March 2010 (LR 910.023). WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 82 - Subsidies for individual commodities wi ll be maintained, albeit with some adjustments. Thus, the area-based crop premiums (Table 4.6) will be replaced by su bsidies aimed at ensuring an appropriate level of self-sufficiency in designated crops/products (proposed new Article 54 of the Law on Agriculture). The Government will have discretion to determine eligible crops and the ra tes of support for these explicitly production-stimulating subsidies. In total, about SwF 440 million will be made available annually for these and other production subsidies, quality, marketing, an d promotion measures. Key ma rket support programmes, such as the subsidy for milk processed into cheese, remain largely unchanged. There are few structural reform initiatives to strengthen the competitiveness of Swiss agriculture and to ensure that downstream industries remain internationally competitive. The AP 2014-17 prioritizes improvements in product quality, and additional financial support is prov ided to reduce farmers' costs through better terms and conditions for inve stment credits. Overall, the AP 2014-17 does not signal a change towards more market-orientation of Swiss agricultural policy. The high level of import protection wi ll be left virtually untouched. Despite modifications, most of the direct payments will continue to have a close li nk to production and livestock rearing.

Switzerland has export-subsidy reductio n commitments with respect to five product categories (dairy products; breeding cattle and horses; fruit; potatoes; processed products). Export subsidies with respect to the first four product groups were eliminated in 2009. Exports of cheese continue to receive indirect support through the subsidy for milk processed into cheese (section 4.1.5.1). Switzerland's last export subsidy notification covers 2009 and 2010. 17 4.11. Switzerland continues to apply a price compensation scheme, as described in previous TPRs, to compensate the domestic food manufacturing industry for the price handicap of using tariff-protected locally produced agricultural raw materials ( loi chocolati\u00e8re ). The measures with respect to industrial/agricultural tariff protection of processed products, and export subsidies were revised with effect from 1 February 2012. 18 4.12. Export refunds are provided to compensa te price gaps between the domestic market and the world market.19 Eligible for refunds are certain milk and dairy products, flour and other milled products that are incorporated/processed into f o o d p r o d u c t s u n d e r H S c h a p t e r s 1 5 - 2 2 . E x p o r t refunds were suspended on 1 February 2012 for sugar/molasses and egg products, while maintaining the possibility to resume them in the future. For skimmed milk incorporated into processed products, export refunds were abolished on 1 December 2012. Export refunds are subject to an annual budget (SwF 70 million in 2012). They are granted on the basis of the net content of the beneficiary raw materials incorporated in the final products. Export refunds for milk and milk products incorporated into processed ag ricultural products are being granted depending on the fat and protein content, as well as the ratio between milk fat and milk protein. 20 17 WTO document G/AG/N/CHE/59, 20 November 2012. 18 Ordonnance r\u00e9glant les de produits agricoles transform\u00e9s (RS 632.111.722). 19 EU markets in the case of exports to the EU. 20 Ordonnance du DFF du 9 janvier 2012 sur les taux des contributions \u00e0 l'exportation de produits agricoles de base (RS 632.111.723.1).

Within the framework of the Customs Union, Liechtenstein companies are eligible for export refunds to third countries under the Swiss price compensation scheme. 4.1.4 Evolution of support 4.13. According to OECD estimates, Switzerl and's support to agricultural producers (PSE) decreased from an annual average of SwF 7.2 billion in 1995-97 to SwF 5.7 billion in 2009-11. 21 The decline was mainly due to higher world market prices for agricultural commodities. The percentage PSE (i.e. the support as a share of gross farm revenues) decreased from 67% to 56% in the same period, meaning that over half of farmers' revenues in 2009-11 were due to support policies (mainly tariff protection and direct payments). 22 Despite the decline, Switzerland's support (a PSE of 56%) was almost three times the OECD average (a PSE of 20%) (Chart 4.1). Swiss producer prices were on average 57% higher than world market prices in 2009-11. Switzerland is in line with the OECD trend in making reforms towards less trade-and-production-distorting measures. The share of market price support that is potentially most trade-distorting was reduced from 66.4% to 45.4% between 1997-99 and 2009- 11. Market price support, as defined by the OECD, comprises all policy measures that raise the domestic price relative to the border price of the commodity concerned, including border measur es (tariffs, tariff quotas, and other import restrictions), administered prices, and export subsidies.

The arrows in Chart 4.1 suggest that Switzerland's agricultural policy has been heading generally in the right direction, but the process of market-oriented reforms needs to be faster in order to catch up with its OECD peers.23 The level of support to Swiss agricultural producers (SwF 5.7 billion) also compares unfavourably with agriculture's value-added or contribution to GDP (3.9 billion in 2010), which gives rise to questions regarding the efficiency (costs versus benefits) of Swiss agricultural policy. 21 OECD (2012). 22 PSE: total annual monetary transfers to farmers in dividually (not agriculture generally) from market price support, mainly through border me asures but also food aid, export su bsidies (calculated by the price gap between domestic and border price), payments to farm ers, and tax/fee reductions (revenue forgone). The percentage PSE is a useful indicator for co mparisons over time and among countries, inter alia , because it eliminates the effect of inflation. 23 All except Norway. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 84 - 4.1.5 Developments in sele cted agricultural markets 4.1.5.1 Milk and dairy products 4.15. There have been few changes regarding market access for dairy products. Tariffs on most dairy products remain high, averaging an estimated 101.5% and reaching approximately 1,295% (Table 3.3). Trade in cheese between Switzerland and the EU has been fully liberalized since June 2007; only a certificate of origin is required. Switzerland's aggregate tariff-quota commitment for dairy products (527,000 tonne milk equivalent) is divided into six sub-quotas with very small allocations for butter (100 tonnes) and whole milk powder (300 tonnes), which are in surplus. The butter and milk powder quotas are auctioned and no longer subject to prise en charge as an allocation method (Table A4.1). According to the authorities, the change aims to increase the competition between importers because under the prise en charge system only a few importers qualified for allocations. 4.16. Almost half of Swiss farms produce milk for sale. The key internal support instrument is a subsidy of SwF 0.15/kg for milk processed into cheese (Table 4.2). 24 Since cheese production accounts for over 40% of milk deliveries, the subsidy provides support to the broader domestic raw milk market. According to the authorities, given that milk production is traditionally the only income possibility to farmers in mountainous regions, the subsidy for cheese production has important socio-economic effects and helps to achieve the aim of a decentralized population. Exports of cheese also benefit from this subsidy, although the subsidy is not contingent on exports. WTO Members have questioned the Green Box compatibility of the subsidy for milk processed into cheese. 25 The subsidy for \"feeding without silage\" is aimed at assisting the production of non-pasteurized specialty cheeses (SwF 0.03/kg milk, SwF 33 million in 2011). In addition, dairy farmers benefit from direct payments (Table 4.3). The subsidies for dairy cows (payments for roughage-consuming animals) were increased in 2009 from SwF 200 to SwF 450 per livestock unit, raising the relative competitiveness of milk production. 4.17. Following a three-year transition period, the compulsory milk quota system was abolished on 1 May 2009. 26 Milk production has increased since 2008, aggravating surplus problems with butter and skimmed-milk powder. According to the Law on Agriculture (Article 8), industry and producer organizations are responsible for the ma rketing of their products. IP LAIT (the Swiss dairy inter-branch organization) has been implementing two measures for its members: a. Milk pricing policy (\"recommended\" prices) based on market segmentation: (i) the \"A segment\" comprises domestic sales of milk products (SwF 0.66/kg milk in 2012); (ii) the \"B segment\" includes world mark et exports of skimmed-milk powder (milk protein) and domestic sales of butter (milk fat) (SwF 0.58/kg milk in November 2012); (iii) the \"unsupported C segment\" comprise s world market exports of butter and SMP (SwF 0.33/kg in November 2012). The milk buyers have committed to buy at least 60% of their raw milk in the A-segment. b. Compulsory levy: on 31 August 2011, the Fede ral Council approved a request by IP LAIT to implement a compulsory levy of SwF 0.01/kg on milk deliveries by non-members of IP LAIT for market relief measures in the milk-fat market (effective until 30 April 2013). The rationale is to prevent free-riders from undermining the IP LAIT initiative to stabilize the market; non-members of IP LAIT represent about 5% of processed milk in Switzerland. Funds from members and non-me mbers of IP LAIT, estimated at about SwF 34 million per year, are used to support sa les of surplus butter and SMP to the world market (supported C segment). 27 In regard to the mandatory milk levy, WTO Members have questioned Switzerland's compliance with its export subsidy commitments. In Switzerland's view, the scheme does not constitute an export subsidy under Article 9.1(c) of the Agreement on Agriculture, since IP LAIT is a private association and 24 Ordinance on supplementary payments and aid in relation to milk (RS 916.350.2). 25 \"Allowance for milk processed into cheese\", notified in terms of a regional assistance programme, see WTO document G/AG/CHE/55/Rev.1, 23 July 2012. Switzerlan d responded that the support is also included in the price support for milk. 26 Ordonnance sur l'exemption du contingentement laitier (RS http://www.ip-lait.ch/site/fr.html . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 85 - the State neither provides nor collects any funds nor prescribes how the funds are to be used.28 4.18. In Liechtenstein, milk production (14,800 tonnes in 2011) is subject to farm-level production quotas.29 To enable Liechtenstein to compete on the common milk market with Switzerland, the Government is implementing the strategy \"forward integration of the Liechtenstein dairy industry\", supported with SwF 4.5 million during 2009-12, with the aim of domestic processing of a maximum share of raw milk into high-added value products. 4.1.5.2 Meat and livestock 4.19. Over 80% of Swiss farms rear livestock. Li vestock producers benefit from by far the highest level of tariff protection; meat tariffs average an estimated 177.4% (Table 3.3). As a result, Switzerland is about 80% self-sufficient in me at (pig meat, 95%; bovine meat, 84%; poultry meat, 51%). Switzerland's meat\" (54,500 t) are administered through 12 sub-quotas for different categories of meat and meat products. By 2007, the change towards auctioning of the sub-quotas had been fully phased in. 30 A reversal, towards the discriminatory prise en charge system for 40% of the red meat quota, is currently under consideration by the Swiss Parliament.31 The fill rates of the WTO tariff quotas exceeded 100% in 2010-11 (Table A4.2). 4.20. Expenditures for market support declined to SwF 10.3 million in 2010 (Table 4.2), as export subsidies for breeding cattle were eliminated during 2009. Subsidies for temporary intervention purchases (implemented by Proviande on the calf markets), and discounted sales to stabilize the domestic livestock markets are limited at SwF 4 million per year. The Swiss veterinary requirements have been harmonized with the EU to facilitate trade in live animals (Chapter 3.3.3). 4.21. Switzerland provides five types of livestock -related direct payments (Table 4.3). The main schemes are \"payments for roughage-consuming animals\" and \"livestock payments under difficult production conditions\", which were increased in 2009 to cushion the expected income losses following the phase-out of the milk quota sy stem. Payments under the two schemes may be cumulative. The subsidies were notified in terms of decoupled income support, prompting questions from WTO Members regarding consistency with Green Box criteria (Box 4.1). 4.1.5.3 Grains and oilseeds 4.22. Switzerland maintains a complex scheme of variable tariffs to protect its farmers of feed grains and oilseeds (Table 4.5). The basic struct ure of the scheme remains unchanged. Tariffs are adjusted periodically so that the duty-inclusive prices 32 are raised to the level of minimum import prices (threshold prices or indicative import va lues). On the basis of the threshold prices for 11 groups of products, the Federal Department of Economic Affairs determines indicative import values for \"similar\" products. The statutory threshold prices are reviewed from time to time (Table 4.1). The variable tariffs may not exceed the Uruguay Round bindings. There are no tariff quotas for the products covered the scheme. Since 2008, there is a legal requirement that tariffs for feedstuffs must not include elements of industrial protection. 33 For compound feeds, standard formulas are used to calculate tariffs to ensure that there is no tariff escalation. 4.23. Since its last TPR, Switzerland has introd uced a new variable tariff regime for cereals of bread-making quality (e.g. wheat). This complements the tariff quota for bread cereals.34 The reference price system covers the same tariff lines as the bread-wheat tariff quota. The new system is similar to the feedstuffs regime (Table 4.5). Tariffs are reviewed on a quarterly basis and 28 WTO document G/AG/W/92/Rev.1, 25 May 2012. 29 Milk Quota Ordinance of 7 July 2009 (LR 910.012). 30 Except 10% of the \"red meat\" tariff quota (allocation by prise en charge). See WTO document G/AG/N/CHE/13/Add.14, 11 April 2012. The auction proceeds totalled SwF 181 million in 2009 (averaging SwF 2.3/kg of meat) 31 Viewed at: http://www.news.admin.ch/message /index.html?lang=fr&msg-id=35451 . 32 Including guarantee fund contributions. 33 Law on Agriculture (RS 910.1), Article 20, paragraph 7. 34 The reference price system covers the same tariff lines as the bread wheat tariff Liechtenstein - 86 - adjusted, as appropriate (increased or decreased), to stabilize the duty-inclusive price for bread cereals around a minimum import price (reference price). The reference price is reviewed periodically. Tariffs are based on the world market price for cereals, i.e. the c.i.f. price as determined by the Federal Office for Agriculture. The reference price was reduced from SwF 600/tonne to SwF 560/tonne in July 2009 (Table 4.1). Since 2010, the variable tariffs amount to 100% (up from 60%) of the diff erence between the world market and the reference price. This change provides better protection from world market price volatility but also makes producers less responsive to world market trends.

Crop premiums are aimed at ensuring adequate production of \"important\" crops, whose protection at the frontier is not sufficient for economic production. The area payments and crop premiums are cumulative: for example, a rapeseed producer may receive up to SwF 2,660/ha 35; additional direct payments may be applicable, e.g. for \"extensive rapeseed farming\" (up to SwF 400/ha).

Border protection remains the key trade policy instrument in the fruit and vegetables subsector. Tariffs on most domestically produced products are set on a seasonal basis. The \"out of season\" period for some products is very short (two weeks). Operators that hold stocks of fruit and vegetables at the beginning of the harvest season (\"managed period\"), which were imported 35 Subject to graduation of payments, see footnote a to Table 4.3. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 87 - during the \"out-of-season\" period, are required to file a new customs declaration and pay the difference between in-quota and out-of-quota tariffs.36 4.26. Switzerland administers eight fruit and vegetable tariff quotas (including potatoes); most of them were over-filled in 2010-11 (Table A4.2). This is because, for certain products, the authorities may release additional autonomous tariff quotas during the full supply period at WTO in-quota rates. Tariff-quota administration me thods remain unchanged. Depending on the tariff quota, the methods include auctioning, prise en charge , and past import performance. For 15 fresh vegetables, the import regime has been partially liberalized in accordance with the Agricultural Policy 2011 (Table 4.1). 4.27. As a result of the elimination of export subsidies on 31 December 2009 (mainly for frozen cherries and apple juice concentrates), financial support for fruit and vegetables dropped from SwF 19.4 million in 2009 to SwF 2.9 million in 2010.37 The main domestic support measures are storage aids for manufacturers of fruit juice concentrates (apples and pears), to cover part of the storage costs. The subsidies are aimed at re ducing economic risks caused by the annual fluctuation of the apple and pear harvests. Addition ally, aids are provided for uprooting traditional and planting \"innovative\" tree cultures. 38 4.1.5.5 Potatoes 4.28. Switzerland is over 90% self-sufficient in potatoes. Import access is provided mainly through a Uruguay Round minimum access quota (22,250 tonnes potato equivalents). The WTO tariff quota is opened at the beginning of the year . In case of a shortage on a domestic market, Swisspatat (the potato industry association) submits a request to the Government to increase the quota on a temporary basis. However, the stated marketing strategy of Swisspatat is to limit the necessary imports and have imported potatoes available at retail level only until domestic potatoes can supply the market. 39 The tariff-quota allocation is complex, comprising sub-quotas (potatoes, seed potatoes, potato products, and potatoes for further processing), seasonal allocations, the prise en charge system, and auctioning. The sub-quota for fresh potatoes is granted to importers in proportion to the quantity of domestic potatoes purchased; the sub-quota for potato products is auctioned. Annual imports at out-of-quota tari ffs have been in the range of 680-1,835 tonnes since 2008. The out-of-quota tariff for fresh potatoes is estimated at 97%.40 4.29. Production of seed potatoes is subsidized (Table 4.6). There is no market price support, according to the authorities. Producer prices are fixed by the various stakeholders within Swisspatat (producers, industry, and wholesalers). The level of Swiss producer prices has been more than twice the level of their neighbours in Austria.41 As a consequence of the high tariff protection, amongst other factors, the Swiss potato market shows symptoms of a wasteful allocation of resources: until 2009, about one thir d of the domestic potato harvest ended up as animal feed, partly with public funds. In July 2009, the Government stopped export subsidies for potatoes and its subsidies for disposal campaigns, and the disposal rate dropped to 14% in 2010 (421,000 tonnes total production).42 However, in 2011 the disposal rate increased again, with 29% of production (515,000 tonnes) being fed to animals.43 36 Article 15 of the Customs law (RS 631.0). 37 Federal Office for Agriculture (2011), Rapport agricole 2011 .

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 88 - 4.1.5.6 Sugar 4.30. Switzerland's bilateral agreement with the EU on processed agricultural products (2005) involves bilateral free trade in sugar-containing products.44 Import duties for sugar used in processed products, and export subsidies between the parties have been phased out (double zero solution). In effect, this agreement involves sugar price levels in Switzerland that are comparable to those of the EU, in order not to compromise the competitiveness of the Swiss food industry.45 To achieve approximate price parity with the EU , Switzerland has introduced a variable tariff mechanism for MFN sugar imports. MFN tariffs are adjusted, normally every three months, so that duty-inclusive prices are aligned with EU sugar market prices (with a tolerance band of +/- SwF 30/tonne). 4.31. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, sugar qu otas are agreed on a private basis between the sugar refineries and the sugar beet producers. According to the 2012/13 industry agreement, the Switzerland-Liechtenstein quota is 232,000 tonnes equivalent to 1,650,000 tonnes (\"A beets\") at 16% sugar content. The total quota is divided into farm quotas, which are transferable. Over-quota production is subject to financial penalties. 46 The financial assistance to the Swiss sugar refineries (Zuckerfabriken Aarberg and Frauenfeld), in return for a minimum production commitment, ended in October 2009 (AP 2011) and was replaced by crop premiums for sugar beet producers, in order to better target the support to the producers (Table 4.6). The payments (SwF 1,900/ha) are also intended to partially compensate farmers for income losses spilling over from the EU sugar market reform. 4.2 Energy 4.2.1 Overview 4.32. The Federal Government has recently propos ed a major change of direction of Swiss energy policy (Energy Strategy 2050). The security of supply is to be achieved without nuclear energy in the medium-term. Switzerland's five nuclear power plants will not be replaced at the end of their operational lifetime. To accommodate the growing electricity demand and fill the gap arising from the planned nuclear phase-out, the new strategy establishes the following priorities: (i) conservation and increased efficiency; (ii) increased generating capacity based mainly on renewable energy but also fossil fuels; (iii) maintaining imports of electricity; and (iv) expansion and modernization of the electricity network (smart grids). 47 4.33. Switzerland has embarked on a process of transition from a monopolistic electricity supply system towards a more competitive regime. As of 2009, large end-users may purchase electricity on the free market. During the second stage of liberalization, scheduled to begin in 2015, the electricity market will be liberalized for the remaining customers, including households. To make competition work, the transmission and distribution networks have been opened for non-discriminatory third-party access. The Swiss gas market has also been partially opened to competition, allowing large customers to make di rect imports. The gas industry has voluntarily agreed to create a level playing-field for third-party access to the pipeline network. In Liechtenstein, liberalization of the energy market s is under way, to align the electricity and gas regimes with the latest EU directives. 4.2.2 Electricity 4.2.2.1 Switzerland 4.34. Switzerland's electricity generation is mainly from hydropower (54% in 2011) and nuclear power (41%). Traditionally, Switzerland is a net-exporter of electricity and important transit country, with about a quarter of European cross- border transmission capacity. Supply is ensured by about 730 network operators, generally local or regional monopolies. Most utilities/operators are in (direct or indirect) majority ownership of the cantons and municipalities. The three largest 44 Protocol 2 of the FTA with the EU (Bilaterals II). 45 Approximately 80% of Swiss sugar pr oduction and imports are used as inputs by food manufacturers. 46 Producer price: A beets - SwF beets) - SwF 30/tonne. 47 Swiss Federal Office of Energy online information.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 14, and BKW) contribute about 80% to electricity generation48, and are vertically integrated into distribution and trade. The Confed eration has no ownership stake in the electricity sector. 4.35. The Federal Electricity Commission (ElCom) was established in 2008 as independent regulator to oversee the Swiss electricity market and ensure compliance with the Electricity Supply Act. The law provides for a two-stage opening of the market to competition.49 From 2009 to 2013, utilities and large end-users (with annual consumption over 100 MWh) have the freedom to choose their electricity supplier.50 From 2015, small-scale end-users and households will be able to choose their supplier, based on a federal resolution, whic h is subject to an optional referendum. Large electricity consumers (over 100 MWh) may choose between two pricing/supply regimes (energy component): the free wholesale market 51, and the \"basic supply\" regime. The basic supply regime is subject to price control by the ElCom. For end-users that opt to buy electricity on the free market and thus request grid access, the \"once free, always free\" principle applies, i.e. they permanently lose their entitlement to basic su pply from the distribution system operator. 52 Under the basic supply regime, the tariff component for energy must be based on costs; if costs exceed market prices, the energy tariff component must be based on the latter.53 ElCom may intervene to prohibit unjustified tariff increases for the energy component or order tariff reductions.54 Electricity tariffs for large industrial users averaged SwF 0.14/kWh in 2010 (without VAT).55 4.36. According to the authorities, the objective of the first stage of liberalization, which is to establish a competitive wholesale electricity market with transparent pricing, has not yet been achieved. The large consumers with a right to choose (about 5,500) account for about 50% of the total electricity supply, but in the first three ye ars (2009-11) only about 5% was sourced from the free market, mainly because free market prices have been unattractive compared to regulated tariffs (energy component) under the \"basic supply\" regime. 56 According to the authorities, with the low wholesale electricity prices in Europe and the high value of the Swiss franc against the euro, this situation has changed somewhat and more companies have switched to the free market. 4.37. A key factor for functioning competition is fair access to the high-voltage power supply network (a natural monopoly). To this end, the tr ansmission networks of the electricity companies were separated from their other commercial activities and transferred to the national transmission system operator Swissgrid. The unbundling proce ss of the transmission network was implemented in three stages under the supervision of ElCom: (i) separation of the accounts of the network owners/operators from other activities (accounting unbundling); (ii) legal unbundling of transmission activities no later than 1 January 2009; and (iii) transfer of network ownership to Swissgrid no later than 1 January 2013 (ownership unbundling). 57 The three phases have been completed. Swissgrid is henceforth responsible fo r the operation, maintenance, and extension of the transmission network. Swissgrid is co ntrolled by the former network operators58, which are under cantonal and municipal majority ownership. The national grid operator must by law remain in majority public ownership and ensure its independence from any interests or activities in energy production, distribution, and trade.59 Swissgrid, as well as the distribution system operators, is 48 The Axpo Group is wholly owned by the cantons of north-eastern Switzerland. BKW is majority-owned by the canton of Bern. Switzerland's largest electric ity company Alpiq is majority-owned by a consortium consisting of the cantons and municipalities in western Switzerland. Alpiq has significant private and foreign ownership. 49 Electricity Supply Act (RS 734.7), in force since 1 January 2008; Ordonnance du 14 mars 2008 sur l'approvisionnement en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (RS 734.71), phased implementation starting on 1 April 2008. 50 Electricity Supply Act, Article 13. 51 In Switzerland, wholesale trade in electricity is mainly over-the-counter, the rest is exchange-traded (e.g. on the European Electricity Exchange or Swissix). 52 RS 734.71, Article 11, paragraph 2. 53 Ordonnance du 14 mars 2008 sur l'approvisionnement en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (RS 734.71), Article 4. 54 Since 2009, electricity customers benefit from better cost transparency (accounting unbundling), i.e. utility bills must show tariff components separately (ene rgy component, network tariff , fees and charges of the public authorities, and charges for funding of renewable energy). 55 Federal Department of the Environment, Transp ort, Energy and Communications (2011), p. 8. 56 Federal Electricity Commission (2012). 57 Electricity Supply Act, Article 10 and Article 33, paragraph 4. 58 Alpiq AG, Alpiq Suisse SA, Axpo sur l'approvisionnement en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (RS 734.7), Article 18, paragraphs 3 and 6.

The network tariffs are subject to price control by the ElCom.61 4.38. With the introduction of remuneration at co st for input into the grid (feed-in tariffs), one of the goals of Switzerland's energy policy is to incr ease the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy by 5.4 TWh by 2030, a 10% incr ease over electricity consumption of 54 TWh in 2002. Under the Energy Strategy 2050, which is currently subject public consultation, about 22 TWh of additional renewable electricity are to be generated by 2050, in order to replace the existing nuclear power plants. Currently, less than 1 TWh is generated under the feed-in tariff system. 4.39. The key support instrument for the generation of renewable energy is the \"cost-reflective feed-in tariff\", i.e. a guaranteed electricity tariff that includes a subsidy to cover the difference between the \"cost-recovering remuneration\" and the market price. The market price is determined by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) based on the volume-weighted exchange-traded electricity price (Swissix Base) as well as the currency exchange rate. Hydropower (up to 10 MW), photovoltaic (PV), wind, geothermal, biomass, and wa ste projects are eligible for the feed-in tariff. The feed-in tariffs vary by technology, output volu me (based on reference facilities) and start of operation. Once a project is approved, the feed-in tariff is guaranteed for 20-25 years. The feed-in tariff scheme is implemented by the SFOE and Swi ssgrid. The SFOE deals with complex cases and Swissgrid with standard projects. The subsidy for renewable projects is financed by all end-users through a levy of SwF 0.35/kWh (2012), which is a component of their electricity bills. Electricity- intensive companies may apply to SFOE for a reduced rate; currently about 20 companies benefit from a reduced rate. Total funds from the levy amount to about SwF 210 million a year. These funds are allocated on a first-come first-served basis as well as technology caps (quotas), which has led to a waiting list of almost 20,000 PV projects. This system will be modified under the Energy Strategy 2050. 4.2.2.2 Liechtenstein 4.40. The state-owned Liechtensteinische Kraftw erke (LKW) is a producer and importer of electricity, mainly from Switzerland, for distributi on in Liechtenstein (Table A3.1). Liechtenstein's energy needs are largely met through imports (87%). Liberalization of the electricity market, based on EEA law 62, started with the adoption of a new Electricity Law in 2002, which opened the market for large customers. Large end-users (w ith an annual consumption of more than 1 GWh) may import directly. LKW's transmission tariffs are subject to approval by the regulator, the Energy Market Commission. The current Electricity Market Law transposes EC Directives 2003/54 and 2005/89. According to the authorities, EC Di rective 2009/72 (third energy package) will be implemented by the end of 2013, once it has been included in the EEA acquis . However, ownership unbundling is not planned. 4.41. As of 2005, independent power producers (IPPs) may sell electricity to any customer. The first IPPs started to enter the market in 2011. There are a number of small-scale hydro-electric power producers besides LKW and the contribution of independent solar power producers has been increasing. According to the Government's Energy Strategy 2020, adopted in 2012, the objective is to increase the share of renewable energi es from 8.2% in 2008 to 20% by 2020, through subsidies for improved insulation, sun-collectors, and tighter energy standards in construction. Liechtenstein has implemented a feed-in tariff scheme, which ends in May 2013. 4.2.3 Natural gas 4.2.3.1 Switzerland 4.42. There is no domestic production of natural gas. 63 Imports are covered through long-term supply contracts with EU countries. Natural gas (HS 2711.2190) is duty free and exempt from VAT (since 1 January 2010) but subject to mineral oil tax and CO 2 tax (Chapter 3.1.4). 60 RS 734.7, Article 13, paragraph 1. 61 In 2009-12, the ELCom disallowed the increases of the network tariffs announced by Swissgrid. 62 Annex IV of the EEA Agreement. 63 Prospecting for oil and gas is ongoing at Lake Geneva. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 91 - 4.43. The Swiss gas network infrastructure is oper ated and maintained by utilities that are wholly owned (except transit) by the cantons and municipalities.64 The Confederation has no ownership stake in the gas sector, and does not provide an y special incentives. There are currently 86 local and cantonal gas utilities that are vertically integrated in distribution, transmission, transit, and trade. The gas utilities handle the distribution to the consumer (local monopolies) and control four purchasing companies (regional monopolies)65, which also operate their own regional transmission pipelines. The purchasing companies control Switze rland's largest gas company, Swissgas, which is responsible for about 75% of gas imports. Swissg as is the majority shareholder of Transit Gas (51%)66, which owns and operates the transit pipeline through Switzerland that runs from the Netherlands to Italy. Ownership separation of transmission from trading activities is not yet on the agenda in the gas sector. 4.44. Since 1 July 2007, the Swiss gas market has been partially opened to competition by giving large (non-household) consumers of natural gas fr ee choice of supplier. Natural gas prices in Switzerland exceed those in other OECD countries, mostly because of monopolistic structures, which make imports attractive. 67 Some large industrial users have started to make direct imports. Third-party access to the high-pressure (i.e. transmission and transit) gas network is ensured by the Pipeline Law of 1963 (Article 13) and the Law on cartels (Article 7) 68, but overall the Government has opted for light-touch regulation.69 The Federal Office of Energy has authority to decide in case of third-party access disputes but, in practice, the gas sector is largely industry-regulated. Following a number of disputes, the Go vernment requested the main actors to negotiate a new industry standard to ensure non-discriminatory third-party access to gas transit, transmission, and distribution services. 70 From 1 October 2012, access to the transport capacities is first-come-first-served; transmission and distribution tariffs must be separated from other costs (accounting unbundling); cross-subsidization is prohibited; and transport tariffs must be published on the internet. All access matters are overseen by the Co-ordination Centre for Gas Transport (KSDL). 4.2.3.2 Liechtenstein 4.45. Ownership of the pipeline and distribution system for natural gas is in the hands of the state-owned Liechtensteinische Gasversorgung (LGV). LGV is de facto the only supplier, although large customers (with an annual consumption of more than 1 GWh) may import directly. Transmission prices are subject to approval by the Energy Market Commission. The legal framework (Gas Market Law 71) is based on EEA legislation, especially EC Directive 2003/55 on common rules for the internal market in natural gas. Liechtenstein is in the process of implementing EC Directive 2009/73. 4.2.4 Oil and refined products 4.46. About 20% of Switzerland's supplies of re fined oil products come from the refinery at Collombey in the canton of Valais (via the Ol\u00e9oduc du Rh\u00f4ne pipeline from Genoa, Italy). 72 The rest is imported. Geneva is an important terminal for imports of refined oil products (via the SAPPRO pipeline73). Oil imports are well diversified between road and rail transport. SEAG holds exclusive exploration and production rights for oil and gas in ten cantons but no economically viable resources have been found. 64 The Federal Pipeline Inspectorate of the Swiss Association for Technical Inspections has supervisory functions regarding technical aspects of pipe lines in Switzerland an d Liechtenstein. owned by Flux Swiss, and 3% by E.ON Ruhrgas. 67 IEA (2012). 68 Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les installations de transport par co nduites de combustibles ou carburants liquides ou Cressier in the ca nton of Neuch\u00e2tel was shut down in early 2012. 73 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Pipeline \u00e0 Produits p\u00e9troliers sur territoire Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 92 - 4.47. There is a stockpiling obligation under the Federal Law on national economic supply (RS 531). There are no public stockpiles. The sch eme is operated by the private sector and administered by the association of importers of petroleum products CARBURA. Minimum reserves are 4.5 months of consumption for gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, and 3 months for kerosene; bio-diesel is exempt from compulsory stockholdi ng. Imports are subject to a levy to fund the scheme (guarantee fund contributions) (Chapter 3.1.7). 74 Swiss compulsory stockpiling of petroleum products exceeds the Internationa l Energy Agency minimum stock obligation. 4.48. Fuels are subject to consumption tax (VAT, mineral oil tax) and combustibles to the CO 2 tax (Chapter 3.1.4). In order to reduce CO 2 emissions, biofuels (e.g. bio-ethanol, bio-diesel, etc.) are partially or fully exempt from the mineral oil ta x (since July 2008) if they comply with certain ecological and social criteria. 4.3 Manufacturing 4.3.1 Features 4.49. Manufacturing is important for both Swit zerland and Liechtenstein. In 2010, 61.4% of the production value in the manufacturing sector in Switzerland was exported (2007: 63.2%) and the sector employs a workforce of over 633,700 (2010) 75; most businesses are small or medium-sized. According to the 2008 business census, more than 99% of enterprises had fewer than 250 full-time workers, employing about two thirds of the total work force. The largest company is Nestl\u00e9, the biggest food company in the world. It has around 278,000 employees, about 97% of them outside Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, manufacturing accounts for around 41% of total employment with about 580 enterprises operating in the sector. 4.50. In a competitive global marketplace, manuf acturing in both Switzerland and Liechtenstein has become more specialized, with the development of more advanced manufacturing techniques involving innovative research and design, su pported by a highly skilled workforce. These specialized industries include electronics, metal manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food products, precision instruments, optical instruments, and de ntal products. According to the World Economic Forum, Switzerland retained its position as the world's most competitive country in 2012 76 (Chapter 1). 4.51. Export-oriented sectors have suffered the most from the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc in 2011, despite the limited price elasticity of demand for their products (Chapter 1). The sectors mostly affected were the mechanical and electrical engineering and metalworking industries; textiles and clothing; and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The impact on the watch- making industry on the other hand was not perceptible due to high demand from Asian countries. 4.52. In general, there are no specific incentive schemes for the manufacturing sector, with the exception of the production of processed agricu ltural goods, which benefits from the Price Compensation Scheme (see section 4.1). Swiss and Liechtenstein exporting companies may benefit from export promotion programmes; and Swiss exporting companies may benefit from guarantees, and insurance measures (sections 3.2.6 and 3.2.7). Switzerland has a policy to support research and improve framework conditions for all economic sectors but it does not adhere to a policy of \"national champions\". No cash subsidies are in place for specific manufacturing industries other than measures open to all comp anies (such as the Commission for Technology and Innovation funds). 4.53. The introduction of the Cassis de Dijon principle by Switzerland has further aligned its technical regulations on specified products with the EU/EEA's (section 3.3.2.1 and Box 3.1). However, exceptions to this principle include key products of interest to Switzerland, such as pharmaceuticals/pesticides (subject to authorization), chemicals (subject to notification), certain measuring instruments, certain motor vehicles, an imal feed, and certain measures relating to foodstuffs, which require conformity with Swiss te chnical requirements. Liechtenstein applies Swiss 74 Currently, the guarantee fund contribution (including an administration fee) is: SwF 3.3 for gasoline, SwF 3.00 for kerosene, and SwF 14.30 for diesel per cubic metre. The fee for heating oil is SwF 0.30. 75 Swiss Statistics online information, . Viewed World Economic Forum (2012). WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 93 - standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures under the Market Control and Surveillance Mechanism. 4.3.2 Key subsectors 4.3.2.1 Textiles and clothing 4.54. The Swiss textiles and clothing industry suffers from structural problems. Due to the high labour intensity of the sector and high wage costs in Switzerland, the production process has largely been transferred abroad. Five out of every six employees of Swiss textile and clothing companies currently work abroad. Operations that tend to remain in Switzerland include services such as design, distribution, marketing, logi stics, and support. Swiss companies focus on innovative products and niche solutions, for example technical textiles for medical applications or high quality fabrics in haute couture. 4.55. In 2010, the textile and clothing indust ry employed 15,500 people (down from 17,800 in 2007). In 2011, Switzerland exported around US$3.1 billion of textiles and clothing (ISIC 321 and 322), whereas it imported around US$8.3 billion. The average MFN import tariff for textiles and clothing is 6%, with a range from zero to 71%. 4.3.2.2 Chemical and pharmaceutical products 4.56. Switzerland has a significant chemical an d pharmaceuticals industry, employing 32,700 and 37,400 people respectively in 2010 (2007: chemical industry 34,700; pharma 33,700). The pharmaceutical industry is heavily capital-intensive and concentrated; it involves high investment in the development of innovative products. The largest pharmaceutical companies are Roche and Novartis (formed by the 1996 merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz). The pharmaceutical industry is being adversely affected as a result of expiring patents and healthcare reforms in large Swiss export markets. 4.57. The chemicals industry includes the ma nufacture of basic chemicals along with the production of various intermediate and end products, such as pesticides, plant protection agents and disinfectants, paints and mastics, soaps, dete rgents, and cosmetics. Strong global competition in this industry has prompted Swiss companies to undergo a process of concentration and structural reform. 4.58. The chemical and pharmaceutical industri es export 85% of their output. Switzerland's exports of chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals (ISIC code 35) amounted to US$89 billion in 2011, whereas imports were US$55.5 billion. The average MFN import tariff for this subsector is low, at 1.4%. 4.3.2.3 Machinery and equipment 4.59. Switzerland is the world's eleventh most important machinery exporter. While the industry has become highly competitive, Swiss machinery pr oducers have focused on quality as a means of retaining a competitive edge. The key products include machine tools, lifting equipment, conveyors, and plastics machinery. 4.60. Liechtenstein is a leader in the development and production of dental products (Ivoclar AG) professional entertainment connector products (N eutrik AG), steering shafts for the automotive industry (ThyssenKrupp Presta AG), and products for professional customers in the construction and building maintenance industries (Hilti AG). 4.61. In 2010, the machinery and equipment in dustry employed 85,400 people (2007: 94,100). Switzerland is a net-exporter of machinery and equipment (ISIC code 38); in 2011, exports amounted to US$93.6 billion, whereas imports were US$73.3 billion. Import tariffs for the subsector are low, at 1.1%. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 94 - 4.4 Services 4.4.1 Banking, finance, and insurance 4.4.1.1 Switzerland 4.62. Due to its political, economic, and social stability, prudent monetary management, liberal regime on capital movements, tradition of bank secrecy, and historic specialization, Switzerland is one of the most important financial centres in the world, attracting high volumes of foreign business (Box 4.2).

In regulatory terms, there have been no changes regarding market access for financial services except for the signature and entry into force of four regional trade agreements containing preferential financial services commitments by Switzerland (EFTA-Colombia, signed on 25 November 2008 and entered into force on 1 July 2011; Switzerland-Japan, signed on 19 February 2009 and entered into force on 1 September 2011; EFTA-Ukraine, signed on 24 June 2010 and entered into force on 1 June 2012; and EFTA-Hong Kong, China, signed on 21 June 2011 and entered into force on 1 October 2012). The EFTA-Gulf Cooperation Council agreement, signed on 22 June 2009, also contains preferential commitments on financial services from Switzerland but has not yet entered into force (see Table A4.3). 4.64. The main regulatory changes on non-market access issues since 2008 concern essentially the reinforcement of prudential regulations following the adoption of Basel III principles; the international fiscal policy of Switzerland, which is directly linked to the attractiveness of its financial centre; and the implementation of international standards in the areas of derivatives traded over the counter (OTC-derivatives) and fi nancial market infrastructure. Furthermore, the federal law on collective investment schemes has been partially amended to correspond to the new EU regulation, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). The amended version will enter into force in 2013. 4.65. Regarding OTC derivatives trading and financial market infrastructure, the financial crisis highlighted that the lack of transparency on the markets for OTC derivatives can threaten the stability of the entire financial system. International efforts have been made to improve transparency and stability in the OTC derivatives market and to work out standards for important financial market infrastructure. The Swiss financial authorities are carrying out exploratory work so as to propose the necessary legal reforms to implement these international standards once they have been adopted. In order to ensure the comp etitiveness of Swiss market players and market access in the EU, regulation equivalent to that of the EU is to be sought. The Swiss Government assigned the Federal Department of Finance to elaborate a draft consultation paper by spring 2013. 4.66. Concerning prudential regulations, the Fe deral Council adopted the total revision of the Capital Adequacy Ordinance in June 2012. It entered into force on 1 January 2013. This revision addresses the \"too big to fail\" issue. By 2018, systemically important banks should build up more capital, meet more stringent liquidity requirements, and improve their risk diversification. They should be organized in such a way that national economy's systemically important functions can be maintained even in the event of threatened in solvency. The proposed package of measures is designed to prevent the State from having to use tax revenues in the future in order to bail out systemically important banks (Box 4.3). WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 96 - Box 4.3 Switzerland's regulatory framework for banking Regulatory framework Recent or planned regulatory changes: None. However, significant reform s in prudential regulations have taken place (see below) Supervisory authorities Ministry/agency responsible for the coor dination and strategic management of international financial, monetary and tax matters: State Secretariat for Internat ional Financial Matters, SIF (www.sif.admin.ch). Sector supervisor (monitoring bank liquidity, overse eing payment and settlement systems, etc.): Financial supervision and issuance of banking regulations are under the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA (www.finma.ch). The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is responsible for maintaining financial stability (www.snb.ch). The SNB oversees Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) and keeps the participants' accounts in this system. SIC is the major payment system in Switzerl and, processing almost all interbank clearings from large-value transactions to mass-market transfers. Responsibility for competition policy issues: Competition Commission (www.weko.admin.ch). Preferential and bilateral policies Preferential arrangements affecting banking services: none Bilateral agreements and MOUs (notably on prudential regulation and supervision): FINMA has concluded MoUs with supervisory authorities of 39 countries, whose banks have significant presence in Switzerland. Most MoUs are not sector specific but cover banking, insurance, and securities exchange (if counterparty of MoU is an integrated supervisor). The largest Swiss banks under fo reign control (assets >10 billion in 2011) are British, French, US-American, Italian, and Dutch/Brazilian. An agreement has been established with Greece, an MoU with Brazil is pending. These MoUs go vern the coordination of supervisory ac tivities as well as the exchange of information relevant for supervision. Recognition of prudential measures of other countrie s through international agre ements or unilaterally: in general, FINMA recognizes the consolidated supervision of foreign authorities if the countries adhere to the relevant Basel Core Principles (BCP). For the banking sector, due to the lack of a multilateral framework, such agreements are concluded bilaterally. In the area of securities and markets supervision (which involves the broker-dealer activities of banks), FINMA is signatory to the IOSCO multilateral MoU. Licensing General criteria: clear scope of business; adequate organization; creation of separate bodies for the management on the one hand and for the direction, supe rvision, and control on the other, if the scope or importance of business activities is significant, for all operators except small private bankers and securities traders; disclosure of the minimal fully paid-in share capital; good reputation of the persons in charge of administration and management of the bank; guarantee by the natural persons or legal entities with a \"qualified participation\" (i.e. which directly or in directly participate in at least 10% of the capital or the voting rights of a bank or whose business activities are such that they may influence the bank in a significant manner) that their influence will not have a negative impact on a pruden t and solid business activity; obligation for the persons entrusted with the management to have their domicile in a place where they may exercise the management in a factual and responsible manner (i.e. generally on Swiss territory with exceptions for larger internationally active banks e.g. head of Asia-Division and member of group executive board may have domicile in Asia) (Banking Act, Article 3). Cantonal banks do not benefit anymore from preferential capital requirements. Their tax treatment is subject to cantonal regulations. Additional criteria for foreign banks: requirements ar e the same for Swiss and foreign banks; access remains subject to reciprocity, except when covered by internat ional obligations such as the WTO agreements. However, for Swiss branches of foreign banks, FINMA wi ll grant the foreign banks a licence only if; a) the foreign bank is appropriately organized an d possesses adequate qual ified staff and financial resources to operate a branch in Switzerland; b) the foreign bank is subject to adequate supervision, which includes the branch; c) the responsible foreign supervisory authorities make no objection to the establishment of a branch; d) the responsible foreign supervis ory authorities state that they will immediately inform FINMA if circumstances arise that may seriously jeopardize the interests of bank creditors; e) the responsible foreign supervis ory authorities are able to prov ide FINMA with official support; f) the conditions governing the granting of a licence, as stated in Arti cle 3bis Paragraph 1 of the Banking Act are met; g) the branch meets the conditions for the granting of a licence within the meaning of Article 3, Paragraph 2c and d of the Banking Ac t and has a regulation that precisely defines its business activities and provides adequate organization; and h) the foreign bank provides evidence that the comp any name of the branch qualifies for entry in the Commercial Register. Special provisions may apply to foreign banks such as: FBO-FINMA Article 3 para. 2 (complete subjection to Swiss regulation if foreign regulation is not equivalent); Article 4 para. 2 (adequate consolidated supervision by foreign supervisor), Article 7 (requirement of collateral if this is necessary for depositor protection). These are set out in the Ordinance of 21 October 1996 of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority on Foreign Banks in Switzerland (FINMA Foreign Banks Ordinance, FBO-FINMA).a According to the FBO-FINMA, the remaining part of the banking regulation, i.e. the Banking Act and the Banking Ordi nance are applicable in the same way as for Swiss banks (Article 3, para 1). Relief may be given on capital adequacy and risk distribution aspects for subsidiaries (Article 3, para.2). WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 97 - Licencing organ: FINMA (Banking regulation and supervision take place on federal level, i.e. there are no licensing requirements or regulations on cantonal level). Limitation of numbers of licences: none by policy Statutory maximum delay to pr ocess licences applications: none Validity of a licence: unlimited Restrictions on banks selling or disposing of licences: li cences are specific to the licensed institution and may not be sold or transferred. A significant change of the structure of a bank or its ownership may require a reapplication, which is subject to su pervisory review and will be accepted if the licensing criteria are met Minimum capital requirements to obtain a licence: SwF 10 million, usually more in practice, depending on the business plan Prudential regulations Administrative allocation of financial resources: fi nancial resources are not al located administratively Determination of interest rates and fees: bank s may determine interest rates and fees freely Measures to ensure compliance with the Basel Committee's Core Principles for Effect ive Banking Supervision: in order to implement the international rules of the Ba sel Committee on Banking Su pervision (Basel III), the Federal Council adopted the total revision of the Capital Adequacy Ordinance in June 2012. It should enter into force on 1 January 2013. This package provides for four core measur es: strengthening of the capital base, more stringent liquidity requirements, better risk diversification to reduce the degree of inter-connectedness within the banking sector, and preparatory organizational measures to ensure the maintenance of systemically important functions (e.g. payment transactions) in the case of threatened insolvency . In the area of capital, mandatory convertible bonds (con tingent convertible bonds, or CoCos) should also be used in the future. CoCos are considered debt capital and are converted into shares or participation certificates as soon as common equity falls below a defined ratio, thereby automatically making equity capital available. In order to promote the issue of new reserve and convertible capital in Switzerland, the issue tax on debt capital was abolished as of 1 March 2012. Capital that arises from the conversion of CoCos has been exempt from the issue tax on capital since then. The Federal Assembly decided during the 2012 summer session that interest payments on CoCos and bonds with a waiver of claims should be exempt from withholding tax in the future. Under Basel III, the total risk-weighted capital ratio is 10.5% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio (common shares and retained earnings) is 7%. Switzerland has set higher standards: by 2018 banks should hold total capital equivalent to 19% of their risk-weighted assets. 10% of this should be in the form of common equity, while the remaining 9% may be built using CoCos. Alon gside the risk-based capital requirements, the capital must also meet the leverage ratio requirements. As a result, the capital may not fall below 4.56% of total (non-risk weighted) exposure. The Federal Council also adopted two measures in June 2012 to be implemented imme diately. A countercyclical buffer is to boost banks' resilience in the event of exce ssively strong credit growth . In addition, in order to ensure banks are immediately more cautious when granti ng mortgage loans, they must hold more capital for underpinning residential mortgage lending if the borrowe r does not contribute a minimum of 10% own funds. This minimum sum may not come from occupational benefits provision (second pillar). Specific provisions against money laundering the Anti-Money Laundering Act imposes special due diligence obligations on financial intermediaries (banks, securities dealers, casinos, and (subject to certain conditions set out in AML-Act Article 2) fund managers, certain invest ment companies, and asset managers under the Capital Investments Act, as well as insurance schemes). These include verification of the identity of the contracting party, establishment of the identity of the beneficial owne r, special clarification duties, the duty to keep records, and the duty to implement organizational measures to prevent money laundering. The financial intermediary must notify the Money Laundering Repo rting Office Switzerland (MROS) in th e Federal Office of Police if it suspects money laundering. In the non-banking financial sector (asset managers, fidu ciaries, and bureaux de chan ge, as well as lawyers and notaries providing financial services), the Anti-Money Laundering Act is based on the principle of self-regulation. Self-regulation organizations (SROs) further specify the due diligence obligations contained in the Anti-Money Laundering Act and supervise compliance by their members. Financial intermediaries may either join an SRO or submit to direct supervision by FINMA. FINMA recognizes and supervises the SROs. In February 2012, the FATF (Financial Action Task forc e) approved a partial revision of its standards. The Federal Council has therefore appointed an interdepartmen tal working group under the leadership of the Federal Department of Finance to draw up a consultation draft by the start of 2013 with a view to revising the system in Switzerland. Bank deposit insurance scheme in December 2008, it was decided to increase depositor protection from SwF 30,000 to SwF 100,000, to extend it to employee pension accounts, and to raise the upper limit for overall secured assets from SwF 4 billion to SwF 6 billion. The provisions were to remain in force until the end of 2010 and be replaced by a Federal Act on Deposit Protection. Following ne gative reactions during a 2009 consultation, the Federal Council decided at the start of 2010 to write the temporary solution into permanent law. The provisions that were positively received during the consultation were incorporated in a revision of the Banking Act, approved on 18 March 2011 and in force from 1 September 2011. a For a non-authoritat ive translation see: http://www.kpmg.com/CH/de /Library/Legislative- Texts/Documents/pub_20090101-FBO_FINMA.pdf . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 98 - 4.67. As a general policy, the Swiss authorities advocate tax competition within Switzerland as well as internationally. As a consequence of this internal fiscal competition, the Federal Council adopted on 4 July 2012 a mandate for dialogue with the EU on corporate tax regimes. According to the European Union (EU), the company tax practices in certain cantons are discriminatory because the revenues generated abroad are sometimes taxed differently from those generated in Switzerland. It claims that this unequal treatment could distort competition. According to the Swiss authorities, the aim of this dialogue is to find a solution that preserves Switzerland's competitiveness as a business location, takes the budgetary interests of the Confederation and the cantons into account, and gains international acceptance. 77 4.68. While the legislation on banking secrecy (Article 47 of the Banking Act) has remained unchanged, the policy regarding international legal and administrative assistance in tax matters is in flux. The main development during the review period was a March 2009 decision by the Federal Council to withdraw the Swiss reservation to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital. 78 This decision paves the way for further exchange of information on tax matters with the signatories of the OECD convention. 4.69. On 1 October 2010, an ordinance was implemented on executing administrative assistance in accordance with double taxation agreements. This allows Switzerland to expand information exchange with other countries in individual cases upon \"specific and justified request\". Implementation is by way of bilateral double taxation agreements, which are being revised.79 4.70. Within the framework of the Federal Council's financial integrity strategy, Switzerland is aiming to conclude bilateral agreements that make provision for a final withholding tax and tax- related regularization for the past, for foreign bank clients, so as to protect the privacy of clients while fulfilling tax obligations in the countries co ncerned. According to the Swiss authorities the long-term effect of this system is equivalent to the automatic exchange of information in the area of investment income. The agreements also offer market access opportunities to financial services providers. On the basis of reciprocity for non-WTO Members, and in line with the applicable laws, the agreements establish a clear framework, facilitating the service provision of Swiss financial institutions in the respective countries and vice versa. 4.71. Regarding anti-money-laundering measures, the FATF (Financial Action Task force) approved a partial revision of its standards in February 2012. The revised standards require modifications of the existing sy stem in Switzerland (Box 4.3). 4.72.

Box 4.5 Switzerland's regulatory framework for pension funds, 2012 Pension fund structure occupational benefit plans, also called the 2nd pillar, complete the basic 1st pillar AVS/AI/APG system (old age, invalidity, income compensa tion allowances in case of illness and for maternity). Together, they should ensure that retired people to a large extent maintain their former standard of living. The LPP (Federal Law on Occupational Benefit Plans) defines minimum benefits in the event of old age, death, and invalidity. But pension funds are free to provide higher benefits. In principle, the law lets pension funds freely choose the form of organization they prefer, thei r design of benefits, and wa ys of financing them. The 2nd pillar is mandatory for salaried persons and for th e unemployed (against invalidity and death under more restrictive conditions) already subject to the AVS (1st pillar), with an annual income of at least SwF 20,880 (2012). This is the threshold of the obligatory pension fund scheme. Pension funds that are providing the statutory minimum need to be registered. The 2nd pillar, when provided by priv ate entities, falls within the scope of the GATS but is subject to specific reservat ions in the Swiss GATS and FTAs financial services commitments. Recent reforms The most important recent pension fund reform wa s the structural reform.a In January 2012, an independent centralized supervision commission was set up to accomplish uniform supervision standards (cantonal supervision authorities will remain responsible for direct supervision). The commission will also implement standards in terms of the over all stability of the system (e.g. investment policy or reserves); it will be able to issue binding instructions. In terms of tran sparency and loyalty, there are new rules for persons or institutions managing pension funds, as a whole or in part (especially for asset-managers). A special issue will be avoidance of conflicts of interest. To emphas ize governance rules, the penalty-catalogue was supplemented. Governance and loyalty rules have been in effect since August 2011.

However, there is no legal obligation for investments undertakings and asset management companies to domiciliate assets in a local bank. 4.75. Boxes 4.9 and 4.10 below describe in more detail Liechtenstein's regulatory framework for banking services, investment undertakings, asset management companies, and payment devices providers. Box 4.9 Liechtenstein's regulatory fr amework for banking services, 2012 Main regulations Banking Act of 1992 (LLG 1992, No. 108, as amended) and the corresponding Banking Ordinance, as (LLG 1994, No. 22, as amended) ( http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?LGBlm=1992108 ) Supervisory authority Financial Market Authority (FMA), established in January 2005, is responsible for supervising banks, investment firms, investment undertakings, trustees, lawyers, accountants, and auditors. Preferential and bilateral policies Preferential arrangements affecting banking services: as a result of Liechtenstein's participation in the EEA, all of its banking, securities, insurance, and accounting legislation is based on EC legislation, although the national accounting standards for financial institutions (mainly banks) are also similar to the accounting rules of the Swiss FINMA. Banks in Liechtenstein and Switzerl and have the same principles of accountancy, and the structure of the balance sheet and the profit/losses stat ement are practically identical. Both countries apply the same valuation provisions (i.e. true and fair view etc.). Generally the comp any may choose the national accounting standard or the IFRS standard. Licensing General criteria: banks and investment firms (i.e. an asset management company in the sense of the EU Market in Financial Instrument Directive 2004/39a) require a licence from the FMA in order to commence operations, and may only take the legal form of limited companies (Aktiengesellschaft).b The head offices and the principal management must be domiciled in Liecht enstein. The minimum required fully paid-up initial capital is SwF 20 million for banks and SwF 3 million (or th e equivalent in euros or U.S. dollars) for investment firms. After commencing business activity, the minimum capital must not drop below SwF 10 million, or the equivalent amount in euros or U.S. dollars. The memb ers of the board of directors may have their domicile outside of Liechtenstein as long as they fulfil the obligati ons of their functions; they must be authorized to fully represent their company.c Additional criteria for foreign banks : Establishment of a branch or subsidiary of a non-EEA bank or investment firm requires a licence. Additional requirements are: the institution must be subject to home consolidated supervision comparable to Liechtenstein supervision, and the home authorities must raise no objections. To establish a representation in Liechtenstein a foreign institution requires a licence issued by the FMA; this is granted if it is supervised in its home country (consolidated supervision in the case of a group) in a manner comp arable to Liechtenstein supervision, the home supervisory authorities do not obje ct to the presence of the bank in Liechtenstein, and the managers of the representation \"guarantee irreproach able business activities\". No reciprocity requirements exist. However, according to the authorities, so far no non-EEA bank has requested to establish a branch in Liechtenstein. The FMA grants the licence if the written application indicates, inter alia , the name of the company in the third State and the name of the appointe d branch in Liechtenstein; an up-to-date prospectus, and the most recent yearly and half-yearly reports of the investment undertaking must also be submitted. Certification is required from home state authority that the undertaking is subject to consolidated supervision equivalent to Liechtenstein supervision. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 103 - Investment firms and banks domiciled in an EEA member-state have free movement of services rights for the activities covered by their home licences; they do not require a Liechtenstein licence. However, their operations in Liechtenstein must be supervised by their home authorities. The same applies to the establishment of branches of EEA financial institutions in Liechtenstein. Prudential regulations Administrative allocation of financial resources: fi nancial resources are not al located administratively Determination of interest rates and fees: bank s may determine interest rates and fees freely Specific provisions ag ainst money laundering the core legal basis for the AML/CFT preventive measures in Liechtenstein is the Liechtenstein Due Diligence Act, No. 47/2009, and the Liechtenstein Due Diligence Ordinance, No. 98/2009. As a result of the EEA membersh ip, Liechtenstein had to implement the Third EU Anti Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and the related implementing measures, which have been incorporated into the above-mentioned acts. The Liechtenstein Due Diligence Act imposes special due diligence obligations on financial institutions (banks and investment firms, e-money institutions, payment institutions, insurance companies, asset management companies, etc.) as well as designated non-financial business professions (DNFBPs) (professional trustees, auditors, lawyers, dealers in good s, real estate agents, etc.). Obligations include the requirement to identify and verify the identity of the customer and the beneficial owner, ongoing monitoring of the business relationship (including scrutiny of transactions), and preparation of a business profile (information on the source of fund s and the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship). The Due Diligence Act also provides for record keeping obligations and the duty to implement organizational measures to prevent mone y laundering and terrorism financing. Where suspicion of money laundering, a predicate offens e of money laundering, organized crime, or terrorist financing exists, all financial institutions and DNFBPs are required to report immediately to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Likewise, all offices of the national administration and the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority are subject to the obligation to report to the FIU. The Liechtenstein AML/CFT framework was assessed by the International Monetary Fund in 2002 and 2007 for its compliance with the FATF Recommendations. The IMF certified as high the Principality of Liechtenstein's standards in its fight against money laundering and financ ing of terrorism. The IMF will assess Liechtenstein's AML/CFT system again in 2013.

Box 4.10 Regulatory framework for invest ment undertakings, asset management companies, and paymen t services providers Investment undertakings Main regulations: the Law on investment undertakings (IUA, LLG 2005, No. 156), and Act on Certain Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITSA LLG 2011, No. 295). http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?LGBl= 2005156.xml&Searchstring=IUG&showLGBl=true http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?LGBl=2011295 .xml&Searchstring=UCITSG&showLGBl=true Recent or planned regulatory changes: On 6 March 2012, the Government adopted the consultation report for the creation of a law on alternative investment fund managers and approved the amendment of further laws. The new draft legislation is designed to implement the Directive of the European Parliament and the European Council from 8 June 2011 on alternative investment fund managers (AIFM Directive). The UCITS IV Directive has already been implemented through the Law on Unde rtakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities, which came into force on 1 August 2011. The new AIFM law is planned to come into force on 1 April 2013 and will be fully applicable towards Europe from 22 July 2013. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 104 - Licencing: Any investment undertaking requires a licence from the FMA. Investment undertakings are divided into investment funds on a contractual basis (which ha ve the legal form of a tr usteeship), an d investment companies (which have the legal form of a limited company). The minimum required fully paid-up capital is SwF 1 million. Investment companies must be incorporated as limited liability companies, with fixed or variable capital. Regardless of form, investment undertakings are obliged to have both a board of directors and a custodian bank, which must be registered in Liechtenstein. Furthermore, the principal administration of an investment undertaking must be domiciled in Liechtenstein. Business scope: mutual funds may be marketed only by banks, fund management companies, or trustees with commercial presence in Liechtenstein. There are no secondary markets or underwritings in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein banks may participate in secondary mark ets through their Swiss oper ations. Units of foreign investment undertakings may be sold in Liechtenstein und er licence or, if reciprocit y exists, after notification. Asset management companies Relevant legislation: Law on asset management (Asset Management Act, AMA) entered into force on 1 January 2006. This Act lays the foundation for asse t management companies as new, internationally recognized, financial intermediaries ( http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?LGBl=2005278.xml&Searchstring =VVG&showLGBl=true ) Supervisory authority: the fully paid-up capital requirement of SwF 100,000 Payment services providers Relevant legislation: Law on Payment Services (Payment Service Act, PSA) entered into force on 1 November 2009. It transposes the European Payment Service Direct ive into national law and regulates the establishment of payment service providers as new financial intermediaries as well as the requirements and obligations for the provision of payment services ( http://www.gesetze.li/Seite1.jsp?LGBlm=2009271 ) Supervisory of 12 March 200981, the Liechtenstein Government publicly expressed its commitment to implement glob al standards of transparency and exchange of information as developed by the OECD. Liechtenstein confirmed its readiness to speed up the negotiation of tax information exchange and other agreements with a view to having a network of such arrangements in place as soon as possible in order to address the global issue of tax fraud and tax evasion as well as the legitimate needs of its industrial sector to avoid double taxation. 4.77. Since the publication of the declaration Liechtenstein has negotiated and concluded 20 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) and 5 double tax agreements (DTAs), and has revised its national legislation for the implementation of these agreements. All TIEA and DTA are in accordance with the OECD-model conventions. Liechtenstein is also participating actively in the peer review mechanism of the OECD Global Foru m on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. 82 4.78. Liechtenstein was removed from the OECD List of Uncooperative Tax Havens on 11 November 2009. 4.79.

The FMA also joined the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (E IOPA), currently as an observer. 81 Viewed at: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/21/42340216.pdf Viewed at: http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/ . WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 105 - On the basis of a bilateral agreement ( Direktversicherungsabkommen ) in force since 1998, insurance undertakings domiciled in Sw itzerland or Liechtenstein are granted freedom of establishment and operation in the other country. This agreement was extended in 2007 to allow insurance intermediaries to engage in cross-border activities. Since October 2012, the FMA is also a signatory to the IAIS multilateral MoU. Licensing A licence is required for each insurance branch. Undertakings must adopt the legal form of a limited company, Societas Europeas, a cooperative, or European Cooperative (SCE). Aside from minimum capital requirements (\u20ac2.3 million to \u20ac3.5 million for non-life, \u20ac3.5 million for life, \u20ac 3.2 million for reinsurance companies, and \u20ac1.1 millio n for captives), an organizational fund is required for formation costs or exceptional bu siness expansion, amounting to 20- 50% of the minimum capital. Exact minimum capital requirements depend on the company's business plan. The main administration of the company (including accounting) must be situated in Liechtenstein. Undertakings domiciled and licens ed in an EEA country may conduct direct insurance business in Liechtenstein without a Liechtenstein licence: the single-licence principle applies since accession to the EEA. Insurance companies are prohibited from undertaking non-insu rance activities. A company may offer either life or non-life insurance; insurance undertakings engaged in life insurance may not be active in any other branches of in surance apart from supplementary insurance against accidental death, sickness, and invalidity. Cross-border provision of insurance services by EEA companies is possible, provided the insurance undertakings have the necessary solvency margin. Non-EEA-country insurance undertakings (except Switzerland, see above) require authorization in order to operate in Liechtenstein; they must establish an agen cy or a branch office and have assets available in Liechtenstein equivalent to at least half the guarantee fund. Insurance undertakings with their head office in a foreign country and engaged solely in reinsuranc e activities are exempt from Liechtenstein supervision. Box 4.12 Liechtenstein's regulatory framewor k for pension funds and health insurance 2012 Basic health insu rance structure Basic health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing and/or working in Liechtenstein (i ncluding foreigners). It may only be provided by authorized non-profit health insurance companies and covers sickness, maternity, and accident risks (if not covered by compul sory workplace accident insurance) through benefits in cash and in kind, as defined by law. All benefits in kind are required to be \"effective, appropriate and efficient\". Each insured person may choose any of presently three recognized health insurers; these do not have the option to refuse insurance, regard less of age or state of health. Under the Health Insurance Act, in surance companies must offer a unif orm premium for ad ults, which must be accepted by the Office of Publ ic Health, and a reduced premium (hal f) for young peop le (17-20 years); the companies may not ask for a premium for children (0-16 years). Under the Act, the state subsidizes insurance premiums in variou s direct and indirect ways, e.g. by contributions to the costs of medical care. Optional insurance may be purchased outside the scope of the compulsory scheme. Compulsory accident insurance system All employees are covered by an insurance contract th at must be concluded by every employer against the risks of accidents at work, leisure accidents, and occupational sickness. The premiums are imposed by the Government according to different risk classifications depending on the type of activity. The scope for competition among insurers is limited to administration costs. All compulsory accident insurers are registered. Pension system There are three pillars of old age and widower's pension and disability insurance: compulsory scheme for all persons living or working in Liechtenstein; occupation al pension scheme that is compulsory for employed persons earning more than SwF 19,890 per year, and desi gned to enable the insured person to maintain his/her living standards after retireme nt; and individual saving measures. The first pillar is operated by a public establishmen t; the second and the third pillars are operated by private insurers. Supervisory authorities the Office of Public health for heal th insurance, compulsory accident in surance and the first pillar of the pension system; and the FMA for the second and third pillars of the pension system. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 106 - 4.4.2 Telecommunications 4.4.2.1 Switzerland 4.80. In regulatory terms, the only changes to market access for telecommunications services relate to the signature and entry into force of four regional trade agreements containing preferential telecommunications services co mmitments by Switzerland (EFTA-Colombia, Switzerland-Japan, EFTA-Ukraine, and EFTA-H ong Kong, China) (see Chapter 2.2.2). The EFTA-Gulf Cooperation Council agreement also contains preferential commitments on telecommunications services from Switzerland but has not yet entered into force. 4.81. The main regulatory changes on non-market access issues since 2008 concern essentially the universal services obligations and the protection of data. In parallel the national regulatory authority, the Federal Communication Commission (ComCom), the Federal Administrative Court, and in one instance the Federal Court, have also taken a series of decisions regarding all forms of access obligations for the dominant provider foreseen by the law. 4.82. The 9 March 2007 telecommunications services ordinance 83 was modified on 24 November 200984, to reinforce the protection and information of consumers when they use their mobile phone abroad or consume value-a dded services. A second modification of the ordinance, on 9 December 201185, raised the minimum guaranteed broadband output from 600 to 1,000 k/bits, and lowered the ceiling price for a br oadband connection offering such an output from SwF 69 to SwF 55. It also reinforced the protection of minors against erotic or pornographic value-added telecom services. 4.83. Regarding interconnection obligations, the incumbent Swisscom contested its dominant market position status in several procedures (Box 4.13). Box 4.13 Market structure and regulatory framework of Switzerland's telecommunications sector, 2012 Economic data Penetration rates (2010) Total telephone subscribers (per 100 inhabitants): 182 Mobile phone subscribers (% of total subscribers): 67.9 Internet users (per 100 inhabitants): 83.9 Broadband internet subscribers (per 100 inhabitants): 38.2 Secure Internet servers (no.): 14,614 Main actors Number of companies providing value-added Of which, providing value-added pl atform services: 19; providing SMS, MMS, and premium rates services: 61 Names and market shares of the leading companies for fixed telecom services: Total: 93 companies Market leaders (by duration of connections, 2010 ): Swisscom: 70%, Sunrise: 9.8%; Cablecom: 7.1% Name and market shares the leading co mpanies for mobile telephones services: Total: 12 companies Market 59.4%; Sunrise: 20.7%; Orange: 15.5%.

WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 107 - Establishment of new companies, mergers or closures during the review period: none Regulatory framework Interconnection and competition issues Fixed interconnection regime: telecommunication services providers with a dominant market position (including suppliers of part of the universal services) must provide interconnection to other suppliers without discrimination and in accordance with transparent and cost-related principles. Interconnection prices of a market-dominant provider are regulated on the basis of the \"long-run incremental costs\" (LRIC) method applied by most European countries. Dominant providers must publish a basic offer every year, interconnection prices must be cost-oriented only in the presence of market dominance; in the absence of m a r k e t d o m i n a n c e , t h e y m u s t f o l l o w m a r k e t s t a n d a r d s . I n t h e l a t t e r c a s e , a p p e a l t o C o m C o m i s o n l y possible to ensure interoperability of services forming part of the universal service. In interconnection disputes, ComCom has to check if an operator is in a dominant position. In such cases, ComCo must provide an opinion to ComCom. The dominance of a provider is analysed according to th e rules set by the Cartels Law. Recent or planned changes: within the last four years ComCom has made decisions on all forms of access obligations for the dominant provider foreseen by th e law (see Article 11 of the Telecommunications Act). Most of these decisions were the subject of an appeal at the Federal Administrative Court. In some of the procedures there was an existing dominant market position of the incumbent in question. Number of complaints filed or resolutions effected of interconnection disputes among operators: The incumbent contested its dominant market position in several procedures concerning the following forms of providing access: bitstream access, access rebilling (only primary rate access (PRA)) ducts, and leased lines. However, ComCo assumed in all its relating decisions a dominant market position of the incumbent. The decisions were based on market analysis by the general competition authority and the appeals towards the Federal Administrative Court were rejected. Therefore, the incumbent Swisscom (Schweiz) AG is generally deemed to be the dominant supplier and oblige d to grant regulated access to the services stated in Article 11 of the Telecommunications Act. Other regulatory aspects Regulatory supervision: ComCom, an independent extra-parliamentar y commission, is responsible for regulating the telecoms market, including allocation of spectrum licences (e.g. GSM or UMTS) through open tendering, the designation of a universal service provider (by issuing a licence for supply of universal services), dispute settlement on interconnection and lo cal-loop unbundling; and for the approval of national numbering plans. Facility sharing: for reasons of pu blic interest, the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM) may require providers of telecommunication services to allow joint use of their installations for an appropriate compensation. This is particularly relevant for mobile operators. Mobile-concessions include a clause on site sharing. Local-loop unbundling: unbundling is achieved by offeri ng competing suppliers two options to have access to the last mile: (i) the supplier may operate his own fa cilities for broadband an d other services on the premises of the dominant supplier. The copper cable between the customer and the connection centre of the dominant supplier is simply switched to the new supplier, who provides his/her services exclusively to the customer (full unbundling); or (ii) the competing supplier may offer broadband services using a regulated bitstream product (i.e. the data line and not the voic e line) for a maximum of four years, with Swisscom providing all other services. During the four-year period, the competing supplier must install the necessary equipment to be able to offer the other services (bitst ream access). Under both options, prices between the competing and the dominant suppliers are freely negotiated.a In case of disagreement, the ComCom determines a price based on cost. In the case of a full y unbundled loop, the subscription fee is billed by the alternative operator. The subscription fee is billed by Swisscom only in the case of preselection. To avoid this, there's the regulated product of \"rebilling of the connection\", which allows the alternative operator to bill the subscription in representation of Swisscom. Two thirds of the Swiss territory (essentially urban areas) is unbundled. The decision to unbundle an area is take n by the operator on purely commercial criteria. The most popular option is full unbundling. Number portability: Providers must ensure portability of numbers and freedom of choice in the selection of suppliers of national and international connections. Spectrum management: auction of all mobile frequencies (including the \"digital dividend\" in the 800 Mhz band as well as the 2600 Mhz band). Orange, Sunrise, and Swisscom were assigned mobile telephony frequencies in the auction which took place in early 2012. The assignment concerned frequencies that were already free or that would soon become free, and all those granted to operators in the past (all in all 620 Mhz were offered, of which 575 Mhz were allocated). The auction covered the spectrum bands 800, 900, 1,800, 2,100 and 2,600 Mhz. All three companies won 20 Mhz in the 800 Mhz band (digital dividend). The frequencies may be used on a technology-neutral basis, which means, all mobile radi o technologies (including LTE/4G) can be used in all these bands. While fully open the auction did not attract any new entrants or MVNOs. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 108 - Transparency: on 1 January 2010, a new Article 10a of the Telecommunications Services Ordinance (SR 784.101.1) brought into effect amendments aimed to improve transparency on the cost of roaming services. Thus, on concluding a contract, mobile oper ators must inform their customers how and where to find information on current rates or tariff options for price reductions. As from 1 July 2010, when customers change to a foreign mobile radio network, mobile operators must inform them without delay and free of charge of the maximum costs (including VAT) for calls to Switzerland, incoming calls, local calls, sending SMS messages or transmitting data (cost per unit of measurement). It must be possible to deactivate or reactivate reception of this notification at any time, and free of charge. Mobile operators must inform their customers of this option on concluding the co ntract and at least once a year thereafter. Accounting rates: not used Licensing: Switzerland applies a re gistration (\"announcement\" regime for telecommunications network and service providers. Licensing is only used for the ri ght of use of frequencies and the universal service obligation. Universal service (beneficiaries, contributors, services covered, level, expenditures, method of calculation and management): In order to guarantee the universal service (US) in Sw itzerland, ComCom awards a licence based on a public invitation to tender, obliging a telecommunication servic es provider to offer the services making up the US. On 21 June 2007, ComCom designated Swisscom as th e universal licensee for 10 years. To date, the US licensee has not applied for any financial compensation. An eventual compensation would be provided from a universal service fund (USF). The decisive factor in calc ulating a provider's fee is its turnover in the services provided in the country minus the costs of the teleco mmunications services it has purchased wholesale from third-party providers or billed for third parties. The content of the US, which is examined periodically by the Federal Council, consists of public telephone services (voice, telefax, and internet access at a fixe d location), emergency call services, public payphones and specific services for disabled persons. Mobile telephony is not part of the universal service. However, the US provider may provide US in the form of mobile te lephony, such cases do effectively occur in mountain areas. All these services are tagged with a ceiling price. The US licensee must measure, and report yearly, on the quality of the services. The latest modificati ons, which concern the broa dband data rate and its monthly fee adaptations, entered into force on 1 March 2012. There are no specific regulations on universal service and cross-subsidization. a While the amendment to the LTC is largely based on the EC's legal framework, this provision giving primacy to negotiations is in contrast to EC legislation. 4.84. A decision of 5 February 2007 by the Swiss Competition Commission (Comco) stated that Swisscom Mobile was found dominant for the mobile voice termination segment. With its termination charge of SwF 0.335 per minute it imposed unfairly high prices, to the detriment of consumers. For this violation of the Act on Cartels, Comco imposed a fine of SwF 333,365,685 on Swisscom Mobile. In a decision dated 24 February 2010, the Federal Administrative Court revised Comco's decision to \"abusive conduct\" by Swisscom, and cancelled the fine. Both the Federal Department of Economic Affairs and Swisscom have filed appeals against the decision. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court stated a dominant position of Swisscom but no abuse of this dominant position, as competitors always had the possibility to ask the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for a price decision. 86 4.85. From an economic perspective, the telecom landscape of Switzerland seems largely stabilized, with three main providers in each of the main segments (mobile, fixed, and broadband). The incumbent Swisscom, 57% owned by the Confederation remains the dominant provider, while its competitors are all 100% foreign owned (Box 4.13). 4.86. In line with generally observed trends, tari ffs have continued to fall, albeit at a relatively slow pace, for the consumer in all three segments (Table 4.7).

Regulatory framework Recent or planned regulatory changes Since the EU telecommunications regulatory framework applies th rough the EEA, Liechtenstein has transposed, inter alia , various EC directives on telecommunications (the Access Directive (2002/19/EC); the Authorization Directive (2002/20/EC); the Framework Directive (2002/21/EC); the Universal Service Directive (2002/22/EC); and the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC). As a result, a new Communication Act entered into force in June 2006. In 2007, the corresponding ordinances of the Co mmunication Act entered into force (Ordinance concerning the Responsibilities and Powers of the Regulatory Authority in the field of Electronic Communication of 3 April 2007, Ordinance concerning Electronic Communications Networks and Services of 3 April 2007, Ordinance concerning Means of Identifi cation and Frequencies in the field of Electronic Communication of 8 may 2007, Ordinance about Levy of Usage and Administration Fees by the Communication Act of 13 April 2004 (Revision), the Liechtenstein Numbering Plan referred to ITU-T E.164 of 3 April 2007 and Ordinance concerning Radio Equi pment and Communications Terminal Equipment of 3 April 2007). The Communication Act was revised in 2010 due to ch anges in the legal field as well as technical advancement in electronic communication. Other reasons for the revision were, inter alia , the protection of users and the fight against the abuse of call numbers. In the same year, the main part of the corresponding ordinances was also revised. Another revision of the Communication Act began in 2012, inter alia , in order to transpose amendments of the new telecom package directives 2009/140/EC and 2009/136/EC into national law. Interconnection Telecom Liechtenstein AG and Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke are obliged to make their infrastructure and services available to other enterprises in a neut ral, non-discriminatory, and cost-based manner. Interconnection regulations are based on the releva nt EC principles. Neither Telecom Liechtenstein AG nor Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke enjoy any exclusive rights. Competition policy Market analysis/enquiries: In 2009-12, the Office for Communications conducted several market analyses on the markets for access to public telephone network at fixed locations (\"M1\"), call origination and termination on fixed networks (\"M2\" and \"M3\"), network infrastructure access at fixed locations (\"M4\"), broadband (\"M5\"), terminating segments of leased lines (wholesale market; \"M6\"), trunk segments of leased lines (wholesale market) and mobile termination (\"M7\"). The Office for Communication finalized the market analysis for M6 as defined by the EFTA surveillance authority in the recommendation of 5 November 2008, concluding that there was no dominant position in M6. Dominant suppliers: the Office for Communications identified Telecom Liechtenstein AG (in M1, M2, M3, M5, M7), Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke (in M4) as well as the mobile phone operators (M7) as carriers with significant market power, and applied specific regulatory remedies under the new Communication Act of June 2006. In the wholesale market of leased lines, comprising trunk as well as terminating segments, effective competition prevails and no measures of spec ial regulation are required in the sense of an ex ante regulation. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 111 - Other regulatory aspects Regulatory supervision: the Office for Communications ( http://www.llv.li/amtsstellen/llv-ak- are offered by Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke registered telecom service providers at transparen t, cost-oriented, non-discriminatory conditions, according to the reference unbundling offer, which was authorized by th e Office for Communications in the framework of the M4 market analysis. Number portability: Not implemented. A consultati on conducted by the Offi ce for Communication in June 2012 resulted in low interest from the alternative providers in Liechtenstein. Spectrum management: Liechtenstein Frequency Allocation Plan (FAP) consists of several parts including the radio spectrum strategy. Integral components of the plan are: frequency ra nges and radio interface requirements, as well as ot her rules and restrictions for the use of the appropriate frequency range. The technical and operational requirements of the frequency use in Liechtenstein create a transparent and comprehensive picture which reflects the components of the R&TTE directive of the European Union. This is important for the users themselves, but above a ll for the manufacturers and distributors of radio devices. The FAP complies fully with the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the CEPT (European Conference of Postal and Telecommunicati on administrations) recommendations ( http://www.llv.li/pdf-llv- ak-frequenzzuweisungsplan.pdf ). Mobile mobile operators rconnected to Telecom Liechtenstein AG only. Mobile interconnection charges are agreed between operators. The mobile termination fees are regulated as a result of the M7 market analysis, by a phased reduction of price caps ending at SwF/min 0.0765 as of 1 January 2013. Mobile roaming rates (wholesale and retail): Regulation No. 531/2012 was approved in October 2012 by the Liechtenstein Parliament, and the Communication Act is to be revised for the implementation of sanctions. Accounting rates: not used Licensing: The 2006 Communication Act eliminated the licence system. All activities in the area of electronic communication are licence-free; a notificati on to the Liechtenstein Office for Communications, the national regulatory authority, is required. Universal service: provided by Telecom Liechtenstein AG 4.4.3 Transport 4.4.3.1 Switzerland 4.4.3.1.1 Air transport 4.88. Switzerland is a relatively important market for aviation services due to its high per capita income, the importance of its inbound and outbound tourism, and the size of business market. 4.89. The market access regime is liberal for the selling and marketing of air transport services, computer reservations services, and aircraft repair and maintenance (the three sectors explicitly covered by the air transport annex of the GATS), as reflected in the GATS revised offer, and as bound by the commitments contained in the free-trade agreements schedules. 4.90. The situation is similar for ground handling services, where the EU rules apply through the bilateral air transport agreement of 1999 (see Ta ble A4.4) and where third-party handling is allowed, opened to foreign firms, and indeed ex ercised by some of them. Bilateral air transport agreements may, in addition, allow self-handling and mutual handling in certain instances. Major airports are concessioned but public authorities may retain a majority of the shares if they so wish. In general aviation, taxi flights are covered by the general regime of commercial air transport. Aerial work is considered a non-air-transport oper ation, hence it is covered by the general regime of services (technical and operational rules specific to aviation are applicable). This is illustrated by the fact that the reciprocal opening of the market (for 90 effective days of operation between the EU and Switzerland), which covers aerial work, is based upon the chapter on services of the bilateral agreement on the free movement of persons. Box 4.15 below details further the main economic indicators and the regulatory regime of these various air transport services. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 112 - Box 4.15 Switzerland's market and regulatory regime for air transport subsectors, 2012 Computer reservation services General regulatory framework: there is no regulation granting a monopoly or prescribing the compulsory use of a CRS supplier. Switzerland applies EC Regulation 80/2009a Economic characteristics: all CRS providers may operate as long as they comply with EU Regulation 80/2009. This does not imply that they ha ve a local branch established. Selling and marketing of air transport services General regulatory framework: there are no specific regulations (including fo reign exchange controls) preventing or limiting the sale by foreign airlines of their own tickets through whatever channel (online, airports counters, city offi ces). This is not affected by individu al provisions of bilateral agreements. Aircraft repair and maintenance General regulatory framework: no specific limita tions on the establishment of foreign providers Number of certified repair stations: 9 repair stations certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and 78 by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Ground handling services General regulatory framework: Switze rland applies EC Regulation 97/67b Bilateral agreements may contain clauses granting specif ic rights to the carriers of the countries concerned Main providers: Zurich: Swissport, Dnata, and Airline Assistance Switzerland for passenger handling; Dnata and Cargologic for cargo handling (all Swiss compan ies or branches), Geneva: Swissport, Dnata for passenger handling; Customer Ground Services and Air Cargo Logistic for cargo handling (all Swiss companies or branches) Airport management services General regulatory framework: concessi oned airports are managed by publ ic or private entities (even for private entities, the majority of the capital may be in public hands) Economic characteristics: international airports (with line and charter traffic) are: Zurich domestic traffic 662,886 passengers (start from departure airport and arrival at destination airport count as 1 passenger).c Commercial aviation General regulatory framework: National establishment rules: in line with EU regulation 1008/2008d Cargo: no specific policy Charter: Switzerland applies EC Regulation 1008/2008e, thus charter traffic is not discriminated and is based on the principle of reciprocity. Low-cost carriers do operate from Switzerland. Domestic traffic: Domestic traffic is limited in principle to Swiss operators unless it has been agreed otherwise in the bilateral ASA: Such an opening has been negotiated but not finalized between Switzerland and EU. Slot allocation: in line with EU regulation 96/97f a Http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:035:0047:0055:EN:PDF . b Http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0067:en:NOT . c All figures 2011, general aviation not included.

Source: Information provided by the Swiss authorities. 4.91. Regarding commercial aviation Switzerland is in the relatively rare situation where its national carrier, Swiss, is majority owned by a non-Swiss national. In such cases, Switzerland has nevertheless managed to preserve the traffic rights either by negotiating the replacement of a substantial ownership and effective (SOE) control clause by a \"principal place of business\" clause in its bilateral agreements, or by negotiating waivers to the SOE clause. This is reflected in Table 4.9, which describes the new agreements or amendments to existing bilateral air services agreements since 2005. Detailed data on Switzerland's aeropolicy until 2005 are contained in the WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 113 - \"QUASAR profile\" of Switzerland.88 In 2005, Switzerland's air liberalization index (ALI), weighted by passenger traffic (WALI), stood at 9.8. The ALI of the agreements covered by QUASAR ranged between 0 and 41. 89 4.92. Since 2005, around 40 agreements have been either amended, initialled, concluded or have entered into force between Switzerland and its partners. About half of the new agreements have been concluded with countries other than thos e listed in the 2005 QUASAR profile, primarily Eastern European economies and former Soviet republics. 4.93. Switzerland's recent bilateral agreements are notably more liberal than those in its 2005 QUASAR profile. Except for one, they all have an ALI value equal to or above 18, and around. Half of the agreements have an ALI of 24 or higher; one third have an ALI of 35 or higher.

Essentially, openness levels have increased because of the inclusion in Switzerland's ASAs of clauses on cooperation and code-share, which are typical of modern agreements (present in two thirds of new ASAs), and of principal place of business withholding provisions (34 cases). In addition, liberalizing the tariff clause from the restrictive \"double approval\" system to \"dual disapproval\" pricing, and the \"free determination of capacity\" clauses are goals of all new air services negotiations. Differently from the 20 05 QUASAR profile, nearly all new agreements contain a \"multiple designation\" clause. As in 2005, 5th freedom rights are found in the majority of the new agreements. 4.4.3.1.2 Inland transport 4.95. Box 4.16 describes the main economic indicato rs of inland surface transport in Switzerland.

Box 4.17 describes the main economic indicators of road transport in Switzerland. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 118 - Box 4.17 Main economic indicators of road transport Road transport Road freight transport Fleet (2010): 348,553 vans 4.97. Road transport accounts for 63% of inland freight transportation while railways represent 37% of freight transportation.90 At the geographical centre of Europe and as a transit country, notably between Germany and Italy, Switzerland confronts large inflows of international transit traffic, with potential infrastructural bottlenecks due to its mountainous terrain. Therefore, over the last 30 years it has developed a voluntarist policy of transferring road traffic to rail traffic, through incentives and infrastructural rail spending, and through regulations and taxation. 4.98. The objective of this modal transfer is to reduce the number of cross-alpine road trips to 650,000: in 2011, there were 1.258 million cross-alpine heavy vehicles (i.e over 3.5 tonnes) trips. The domestic conditions of establishment and operation are liberal, as are the bilateral agreements with third countries outside EU, relatively speaki ng (i.e. compared to average European bilateral agreements following the ECMT model agreement). 4.99. The main recent regulatory change regarding road transport was the 20 March 2009 federal law on road transport companies (LEnTR; RS 744.10), which entered into force on 1 January 2010. This law regulates the licencing of road freight and passenger transport companies and carries over the provisions on licensing that existed in the 18 June 1993 law on passenger transport. Box 4.18 below details further the main economic indicators as well as the regulatory framework of the sector. Box 4.18 Switzerland's road transport framework Regulatory framework Establishment/domestic regulatory frameworka: Licensing requirement: operators require a licence (other than a driving licence) in order to establish a national road freight business (for transporting dangerous goods or goods for which sanitary assurances are required). Licensing criteria: no other criteria than technical, prof essional, and financial fitness and compliance with public safety requirements. Capacity regulation: the regulator does not have any power to limit industry capacity through licences or otherwise. Pricing: professional bodies or representatives of trade and commercial interests are not involved in specifying or enforcing pricing guid elines or regulations. The retail prices of road freight services are not in any way regulated by the Government nor does the government provide pricing guidelin es to road freight companies. International regulatory framework : Bilateral agreements: 50 bilateral agreements, with provisions significantly more liberal than average European bilateral agreements following the ECMT model agreement.b For a full list and the text of these agreements see http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/tran sport_e/transport_land_e.htm, lines 735 to 784c 90 However for purely cross-alpine traffic, the figures are virtually inverted: 64% for rail and 36% for road. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 119 - Switzerland-EU agreement: the agreement between the EU and Switzerland entered into force on 1 June 2002. Its core provision is the commitment by Switzerland to raise erga omnes - not only for the sole benefit of the European Union - the maximum permis sible weight of vehicles from 28 to 40 tonnes, in exchange for EU recognition of the legality of a fee on heavy vehicles that is non-discriminatory, a function of the distance travelled, the weight and emission class of the vehicle, and intended to encourage the transfer of traffic (particularly transit traffic) to the railways and to co ntribute to the financing of the cross-Switzerland rail infrastructure. The agreement also liberalizes road transport between the EU member states and Switzerland, and opens up the market for transport between EU member states ( grand cabotage ) to Swiss carriers. At the same time, cabotage in the strict sense of the word (i .e. road transport within Switzerland or within an EU member state) was not liberalized. Th e agreement provides for mutual reco gnition of the licences needed to gain admission to the occupation, general harmonization of technical standards, and coordination of transport policies, in particular on combined rail-road transport. The EU-Switzerland agreement does not affect triangular quotas for freight or existing cabota ge rights for passenger transport. a OECD Survey of Indicators of Regulation in Energy, Transport and Comm unications.

Switzerland has a very developed railway network connected internationally, including to high speed lines (Table 4.11). In addition to passenger traffic there is significant international transit of goods traffic through the Alps, notably between Germany and Italy. The importance of railway transport is reinforced by the voluntarist po licy of transfer of a large part of cross-alpine road transport goods traffic to rail. 4.102. The interurban rail network comprises: Track: 5,697 km (2010) which tonnes (2009), tonne/km (2011). 4.103. Unlike many European countries, Switzerl and has never had a regime of public monopoly but rather a regime of coexistence between a large public company, SBB-CFF-FFS, and of several private companies whose number has diminished over time through mergers. Switzerland has developed a mutual access to network policy comparable mutatis mutandis to that of Japan and the United States. More recently, Switzerland has largely transposed into its legislation the first two packages of EU railway liberalization, and has opened its network to EU companies for the operation of freight trains. In addition to the three Swiss network-owning companies, several foreign railway freight companies, mainly of German nationality (DB Schenker, Transalpin WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 120 - Eisenbahn AG, and TX Logistik) have created subsidiaries in Switzerland, obtained authorization to access to Swiss network, and the relevant safety certificate. 4.104.

Source: Compiled by the Secretariat from inform ation on railway co mpanies' websites. 4.105. In regulatory terms, the sector has b een undergoing reform since the end of the 1990s. The first reform, which entered into force in Janua ry 1999, transformed SBB-CFF-FFS into a limited company still owned by the State; formalized the right of access for any railway company by instituting an arbitration commission; and separated the transport activities of railway companies from their infrastructure activities, from an accounting and an operational point of view. 4.106. A second package of reform was divided into two parts: the first, essentially of a technical nature (general regulation of public transport and safety rules and supervisory authority), was adopted in March 2009 and the second on 16 March 2012. Parts of this package entered into force on 1 December 2012 and the rest in summer 2013. The provisions of the new law deal with interoperability and safety; reinforcement of the role of the arbitration commission; the financing of protection services; and tendering procedures for concessioning regional passenger traffic. 4.107. These new provisions are aligning the Swiss law on the provisions of the first and second EU package of liberalization, except for the institution of a body independent from the infrastructure manager to allocate the paths. For now, paths for most of the Swiss network are allocated by Trasse Schweiz AG, a company co-o wned by SBB, BLS, SOB, and UTP (Union des Transports Publics). However a commission of experts has been created to identify options regarding the independent allocation of paths. Thes e options will be submitted to Parliament by a special message of the Federal Council. Transposition of the third EU railways package is also envisaged. It foresees the opening to international competition of international passenger transport, improves passengers rights, and create s a uniform railway driver permit, and the Swiss Government is observing how individual EU member states are implementing the directives of the three packages. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 121 - 4.108. The main recent regulatory changes in the sector are recapitulated in Table 4.12 below. Table 4.12 Railway law Law/ordinance Description Federal law of 14 December 1990 on direct federal tax (LIFD, RS 64211) Extends the fiscal exemption of SBB-CFF-FFS to all private railways companies Federal law of 19 December 2008 on the transfer from road to rail of heavy freight transport through the Alps (LTTM; RS 740.1) Sets the date of the objective of 650,000 maximum road trips to two years after the entry into service of the Saint Gothard base tunnel, and allows the Federal Council to conclude international agreement to institute a transit stock exchange where the right to cross the Alps would be auctioned Ordinance of 25 November 1998 on access to railways network (OARF; RS 742.122) Creates the possibility to auction the paths when offers are equivalent and se ts the parameters of the pricing of the paths including environmental bonuses Federal law of 20 March 2009 on passenger transport (LTV; RS745.1) Foresees that the Confederation and the cantons may conclude with the railway companies pluri-annual conventions with a bonus-malus system based on the quality of services and on financial indexes. It also sets the conditions of the Confederation guarantee in case of investments in the transport sector by the railways companies and foresees the corresponding budgetary allotment Ordinance of 4 November 2009 on passenger transport (OTV; RS 745.1) Sets the principle and the parameters of the concessioning system for passenger transport 4.4.3.2 Liechtenstein 4.109. The Office for Economic Affairs is responsible for regulating the transport subsector and applies the relevant EEA law.91 4.4.3.2.1 Road freight and passenger transport services 4.110. Liechtenstein does not have any highways but has 108 km of main roads and 253 km of side roads. International road transport services for goods and passengers are supplied by private companies. 4.111. Liechtenstein also applies the Swiss Heavy Vehicle Fee. Road freight and passenger transport carriers require a permit issued by the Office for Economic Affairs: specific criteria must be met on, inter alia , reliability, financial standing, qualification, and business establishment. In addition, carriers need a special licence issued by the Office for Economic Affairs for international transport in the EEA. Liechtenstein is included in most bilateral transport agreements concluded by Switzerland. The agreements normally contain a \"Liechtenstein clause\" extending the provisions to Liechtenstein. 4.112. Public transport throughout the country is offered by the government-owned Verkehrsbetrieb LIECHTENSTEINmobil, which receives subsidies for its services. 4.113. As part of a comprehensive strategy to increase the public offer for passenger transport, the Liechtenstein Government transformed the Liecht enstein Bus Anstalt (LBA) into a public entity with an enlarged mandate. Besides the planning, organization, and marketing of public transport by bus, the new mandate includes responsibilities for local cross-border passenger transport by train. This new transport company, Verkehrsbetr ieb LIECHTENSTEINmobil, has the competence to conclude contracts with service providers in these different fields and to enter into cooperation agreements with transport networks from neighbouring regions. 4.4.3.2.2 Rail transport services 4.114. Liechtenstein has a network of 9 km of railways. It has no rail company; the railway track is owned and operated by Austrian Federal Railways. 91 See Annex XIII to the EEA Agreement. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 122 - 4.115. With the aim of increasing the use of the railway track through Liechtenstein for local cross-border passenger transport, and to promot e such use as part of a comprehensive public transport policy, Liechtenstein amended its Railway Act in order to transpose the relevant EEA legislation into national law. In accordance with EU directive 91/440/EWG, the new law provides for the separation of the management of railway op eration and infrastructure from the provision of railway transport services, coupled with the principle of free access to the infrastructure by different railway undertakings. It also fully implements EU directive 2007/58/EG. 4.4.3.2.3 Air transport services 4.116. Liechtenstein does not have an airport, but has a privately owned heliport. It applies the EEA rules on civil aviation, which entered into force in 2003. Under an agreement concluded in 1950, the Swiss regulations on civil aviation also apply to Liechtenstein; this agreement was amended in 2003 to avoid conflict with EEA ru les. Liechtenstein became a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in June 2006. 4.4.4 Other 4.4.4.1 Postal services 4.117. The Swiss postal sector is undergoing stru ctural reforms, partially aimed at maintaining \"euro-compatibility\". Several modifications were ma de to the legislation during the review period. On 22 April 2009, the scope of the reserved area was reduced to letters weighing less than 50 g (modification of the 26 November 2003 postal or dinance, RO 2009 1665). The Postal Ordinance was fully re-organized on 29 August 2012 (RO 2012 5009) (Box 4.19). Box 4.19 Market structure and regulatory framework of Switzerland's postal subsector, 2012 Economic indicators Turnover: Swiss Post: SwF 8.6 billion (SwF 7.5 billion in Switzerland), rest the subsector: SwF 196.6 million Employment: equivalents (in Switzerland: 37,700), rest of the subsector: 3,100 (expressed in full-time equivalents) Regulatory framework Governmental authority: Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). At the federal level, the DETEC is responsibl e for the basic provision of infrastructure, goods, and services, which should be of good quality and available at affordable prices, on th e same terms and conditions throughout Switzerland, to its entire population and all its regions. The General Secretariat of the DETEC on behalf of the Federal Council represents the shareholder interests of Swiss Post, together with the Federal Department of Finance (www.uvek.admin.ch) Regulatory authorities: Postal Services Commission (PostCom) The new postal legislation (2010), established PostCo m as the new independent regulatory authority from 1 October 2012, replacing the Postal Regulatory Auth ority (PostReg) and the Post Office Commission (http://www.postcom.admin.ch/en/index.htm) Designated operator: Swiss Post is the sole operator responsible fo r universal service, in accordance with the Posta l Law (PL) of 30 April 1997 . Swiss Post is an autonomous federal enterprise under public law with its own legal identity (RS 783.1 www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/7/783.1.fr.pdf) . Its corporate name appears in the commercial register and is therefore protected throughout the country (www.post.ch). Restructuring/postal reform: the PL was amended in 2003 (effective 1 January 2004, OPO; RS. 783.01 www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/7/783.01.fr.pdf ); in particular it introduced a mandate for Swiss Post regarding infrastructure. Also in 2004, the revised postal ordinance reduced the extent of the monopoly (full liberalization of the parcels market), introduced a concession (licence ) system, improved the quality control of and access to the universal service, enhanced accounting transparen cy, particularly for avoi ding cross subsidies and establishing better control over the universal service, and set up PostReg. In 2006, the scope of the reserved area was reduced to letters weighing less than 100 g and in 2009 to 50 g (22 April 2009, RO 2009 1665 www.admin.ch/ch/f/as/2009/1665.pdf). A 9 November 2011 mo dification of the Postal Ordinance (RO 2011 5227 www.admin.ch/ch/f/as/2011/5227.pdf), foresees that the Independent Extra-parliamentary Commission in charge of assessing access to universal service in a region concerned by a transfer or a closure of a post office shall be convoked by the Fede ral Council, and no longer by the Fe deral Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). In May 2009, the Federal Council submitted to Parliament a draft of a complete revision of the Postal Law and of the Law on Postal Organization. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 123 - The Swiss Parliament adopted a new Federal Law on Postal Services on 17 December 2010 (FF 2010 8241 www.admin.ch/ch/f/ff/2010/8241.pdf as well as a new Federal Law on Postal Organization FF 2010 8257 www.admin.ch/ch/f/ff/2010/8257.pdf). The new legislation (including the respective ordinance) entered into force on 1 October 2012. The new provisions deal notably with: (1) definition and financing of postal services and payment servic es belonging to universal service (2) transformation of Swiss Post into a public law limited company (3) suppression of the fisc al advantages of Swiss Post and of its state guarantee (4) unbundling of the financial services unit, which is to be transformed into a private law limited company and whose activity will be subject to the supervision of the financial market authority (FINMA) (5) regulation of the market of postal services (6) replacement of the concession regime by a notification obligation imposed on all postal services providers (7) inter-operability rules among postal services providers (postal box access and exchange of data) (8) definition of criteria giving access to reductions granted for the delivery of certain press products (9) organization of the supervisory authorities for postal regulation The draft ordinance (www.admin.ch/ch/f/gg/pc/doc uments/2092/OPO_Projet_2012-01-18_fr.pdf) has been the object of consultation with interested stakeholders (c antons, political parties, associations, etc. To a great extent, the draft ordinance was welcomed by the particip ants in the consultation. Critical remarks were made by economic circles, mainly about provisions in the areas of postal services and payment services within the universal service, the procedure of no tification for postal services provid ers, the working conditions that are customary in the sector, the inter-operability rules and the prohibition of cross-subsidization. Universal service: universal service comprises: reserved services and non-reserved se rvices: reserv ed services are exclusively provided by Swiss Post (monopoly). They include the delivery of letters posted in Switzerland or originating from abroad and whose weig ht does not exceed 50 g; non-reserved services are services where Swiss Post is in competition with private providers. Th ese services, which are subject to a concession regime when delivered by private operators, include (a) postal deliveries of letters posted in Switzerland or originating from abroad and whose weight is above 50 g, (b) postal delivery destined for abroad, (c) transport of parcels up to 20 kg, (d) transport of periodicals and newspapers, (e) payment services. Free services are services that Swiss Post may provide in addition to universal service in competition with private operators from Switzerland and abroad for instance EMS and Mail Exchange Services Services: t he Federal Council determines the scope of postal services. Rates: f or the reserved services, Swiss Post sets the prices according to the legal requirements. The Federal Council fixes ceiling prices. For the other services, Swiss Post sets the prices of its services itself; these prices are subject to the control of Monsieur Prix, but only if Swiss Post still has a dominant market position. Financing methods: Swiss Post has to finance its own services. There is no access to the financial markets. The Federal Council assigns Swiss Post strategic objectives fo r a four-year period. In parallel with the management report, Swiss Post's management board reports to the Federal Council on the implem entation of its objectives. Status of personnel: t he status of Swiss Post staff is governed by the Law on Confederation Staff, which entered into force on 1 January 2002. This law is supplemented by a collective labour agreement signed between Swiss Post and the trade unions. The new Federal Law on Postal Organiza tion stipulates that 2 years after transformation into a public law limited company (foreseen in mid-2013), the staff's contracts will be converted into contracts und er private labour law. Establishment and level of remuneration: Swiss Post sets its own policy. Source: UPU; and information provided by the Swiss authorities 4.4.4.2 Distribution 4.118. Distribution services account for 15.9% of Switzerland's GDP. They are an important component of Switzerland's services economy, and are characterized by two features: the importance of wholesale trade, which accounts for nearly twice the value added of the retail sector, partially due to the historic specialization of Switzerland in trading activities; and the high concentration of the retail sector, specially of supermarkets and department stores, which is also a feature in high level income/comparatively less populated countries of Europe (e.g. Nordic countries). Due to the difference of income per capita with neighbouring countries, the strong the Swiss franc, and comparatively high domestic prices notably for food products, the Swiss retail sector is suffering strong competition from neighbouring countries' distributors (so called \"purchasing tourism\"), valued at SwF 4 billion to SwF 5 billion in 2011 (roughly 5% of the turnover of the sector). Still, discounters only hold a marginal part of the retail food market (10% versus 44% in Germany and 50% in Norway). Electronic trade, both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer segments, is progressing rapidly, including on a cross-border basis. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 124 - 4.119. In terms of access, many foreign distributors are present in Switzerland, notably in the form of franchises. Access is not subject to economic needs tests but to relatively stringent environmental and zoning requirements at a local level; the average processing time for applications and related construction permits tend s to be longer than the European average. Due to the high concentration of the sector, the Competition Commission (Comco) monitors it closely including the electronic trade subsector. There are no recent or planned regulatory changes for this sector. Box 4.20 details the main market indicators of the sector and its regulatory framework. Box 4.20 Switzerland's market and regulatory framework for distribution services, 2012 Economic data Main economic indicators Number of employees 7,454 billion Share in which wholesale: 9.9%; retail: 4.7%; wholesale and total employment (2011): wholesale: 5.3%, retail: Concentration in the supermarket sector: top 2: around 80%, fourth highest degree of concentration in Europe (after Norway, Denmark, and Finland) with an Herfindahl-Hirschman index of 0.06 in 2005. Average size of hypermarkets: 3,400 m2 (European average 4,400 m2); average size of supermarkets: 639 m2 (European average 700 m2); share of the discounters: 10% of the turnover of the segment Total number of retail outlets: 49,000 \"Traditional\" versus \"modern\" retail sector: chain stores accounted for 55% of employment in the subsector in 2012 Density of outlets: (in 2005) 1.2 outlets per km2 and 6.4 per 1,000 inhabitants E-commerce: 1.8% of total annual household spendi ng in 2009, i.e. a turnover of SwF 4 billion In 2008, 75% of all companies in Sw itzerland used electronic commerce for purchase of merchandise and services, whereas 31% sold their products over the Internet. In 2001, 2.9% of the procurement expenses of companies using the Internet were spent online (electronic commerce intensity); in 2008, 15.1% of the procurement expenses were made online. Considering all companies in Switzerland, the intensit y of electronic commerce rose from 1.9% in 2001 to 7.2% in 2008. In 2010, there were 1,873 secure webserve rs (with SSL certificate) per million inhabitants, compared with only 21 in 1998, an increase of almost 9,000% in 12 years. Main foreign distributors present on the Swiss market: 200 franchise networks mostly foreign (primarily from the US, the UK, and Germany). Regulatory framework Legislation on exclusive rights or on limitations of number of suppliers: the distribution sector is open, excluding services related to goods subject to import authorization, to pharmaceutical products (RS 812.21), toxics (RS 813.1), explosives (RS 941.41), weapons and ammunition (RS 514.54), and precious metals (RS 941.31). Wholesale trade of alcohols is also subjec t to a licensing system based on good reputation (RS 680, Article 40.III). Legislation on franchising: there is no relevant law applicable. The Code of Obligations (http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/22.html), especially the gene ral rules on contract law, applies, but it does not specifically concern franchise contra cts. All forms of franchise contract s are allowed (single franchise from a foreign-owned Swiss subsidiary, single franc hise from abroad, master franchise, etc.). Competition legislation: like for other sectors, me rgers of retailers are examin ed by ComCo/WEKO from the point of view of competition, e.g. the conditions atta ched to the absorption of Denner by Migros or to the takeover of former Carrefour hypermarkets by Coop. Th e cartel law applies to the distribution sector and ComCo/WEKO conducts numerous investigations in the distribution sector, e.g. the 2011 Nikon case on attempts to prevent parallel imports, the ASCOPA case o n c a r t e l i n t h e l u x u r y c o s m e t i c b r a n c h , a n d t h e investigation on online trading restrictions (Electrolux - VZug case) WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 125 - Zoning/urbanism legislation: there is no limitation to market a ccess, as such (for instance: two new retailers, i.e. Aldi and Lidl from Germany have opened large numbers of shops in recent years, while others, like Carrefour from France, have left). Distribution services are mainly regulated at the cantonal and communal level. These regulations deal primarily with land use and environmental aspects (such as the size of parking areas next to the stores, to limit the motorized traffic, including the obligation to receive parking taxes above a certain level of traffic) or in some cases also requ irements to locate next to public transportation. An environmental impact study is required for any project above 5,000 m2 or 500 parking spaces. On average, the processing time for construction perm its is longer than in many European countries and hence inferred higher costs. Authorization procedure and thresholds applic able to the opening of new supermarkets: cantonal and/or municipal enactments provide an authorization procedure for large-scale distribution facilities that may lead to rejection of an authorizatio n, on a case-by-case basis, based on environmental, zoning, and urban criteria such as traffic, parking spaces, and proximity of bus stops. No economic needs tests or other market access/national treatment restrictions, apply (in the GATS sense) or authorization criteria based on commercial or competitors considerations. Thresholds may vary; there is no overview of cantonal and municipal authorization criteria. The cantonal restrictions on sales areas mentioned in the GATS commitments no longer exist as limitations have been reduced to the abov e-mentioned authorization procedures for large-scale distributions outlets.

In 2010, the sector employed some 144,000 people (full time equivalent), amount ing for 4.1% of total employment; the share of tourism in GDP was 2.8%; and Swiss hotels accounted for 35.5 million overnight stays. However the strength of the Swiss franc and comparatively high costs and prices have had a negative impact on the number of foreign, and notably European, arrivals in recent years. Nevertheless, tourism to Switzerland remains very popular in international markets, with arrivals in hotels reaching 8.6 million in 2010, the highest on record. The five leading origin markets of Germany, UK, France, the United States, and Italy together accounted for 4.9 million arrivals or 56% of total arrivals. Germany alone accounts for over a quarter of all arrivals and is by far the largest origin market. Tourism is regulated at the federal, cantonal, and municipal level. In June 2010, the Swiss Federal Council approved a new growth strategy for tourism, which sets out the major lines of development for the medium- and long-term. Implementation began in 2012. The new national tourism policy and its guiding principles are designed to portray Switzerland as an attractive and successful tourism destination with a specia l emphasis on sustainability. From 2012, implementation of the growth stra tegy will be based on four-yearly programmes. The first of these was established in early 2012. Box 4.21 details the main market indicators of the sector and its regulatory framework. Box 4.21 Switzerland's market indicators and regulatory framework for tourism Tourism in general Economic data Share of tourism services in GDP: 2.8% Number of inbound tourists: 8.6 million,; 29th rank worldwide (2010) Inbound tourism expenditures: US$17.8 billion, 16th rank worldwide (2010) Number of outbound tourists: 16.5 million (2009) Outbound tourism expenditures: US$13.3 billion (2010) Numbers of full time employees (2010): 144,351 (4.1% of total employment) Regulatory framework Level of regulation: federal, cantonal, and municipal Legislation on Swiss tourism: Federal Law on the Swiss National Tourism Office of 21 December 1955 (RS 935.21; http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/c935_21.html ), no recent or planned changes, and ordinance on Swiss Tourism of 22 November 1963 (RS 935.211), modified twice since 2008 to transpose the new rules on state-owned enterprises governance and in 2010 to include the staff rule s.

Tourist arrivals and nights spent by touris ts in hotels in Liechtenstein had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2004. About 63,000 nights were spent in hotels in Liechtenstein in summer 2011 and 54,900 nights in winter 2010/11. The majority of tourists arrive from Germany and Switzerland. Nights spent in all types of accommodation in Liechtenstein declined from 267,800 in 1980 to 166,800 in 2010. 4.122. Liechtenstein's marketing regulations are similar to those of Switzerland, except for rules governing the acquisition of real estate. Liechtenstein Marketing, a state institution established by the law of 20 October 2011 on the promotion of Liechtenstein as a business and a tourism destination, is the main promotional agency responsible for marketing tourism in Liechtenstein. Its activities in business destination, tourism destination, and participation in major events are initially financed with a public support of SwF 2,500,000. Additional revenue is derived from the accommodation tax. Certain promotional activities are coordinated with Switzerland. Tourism activities are also marketed by local tourism initiatives and the municipalities. 4.123. The acquisition of holiday apartments (s econdary residence) above 1,000 m altitude is limited to households that are resident in Liechtenstein and have Liechtenstein, EEA or Swiss nationality. No more than one secondary residence is allowed per household. WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 127 - REFERENCES Comco (2011), Annual Report, 2010 .

To obtain an authoriz ation for regular cross-border and certain international shuttle transport by road, the newly introduced transport services must not compete in any way with p ublic or other existing transport services and an enterprise of Sw itzerland must have a substantial share in the business. Such an authorization does n ot allow the supply of transport services between points within the territory of Switzerland (cabotage). To obtain an authorization for the transport of passengers between airports and tourist regions, the conditions for obtaining a concession must be met (SR 744.11, Articles 6, 37, 38, 39 b, 40 and 47 a). Authorization is required for enterprises undertaking regular passenger transport or freight transport by road (SR 744.10, Article 8). CANTONAL LEVEL : Authorization issued by cantons is required for regular passen ger transport as defined in the Federal Ordinance on concession s for passenger transport (SR 744.11, Article 6). To obtain such authorization, the newly introduced service must not compete in any way with public transport (SR 744.10, Article 4; SR 744.11, Articles 13 and 32).\" WT/TPR/S/280/Rev.1 Switzerland and Liechtenstein - 158 - (B) Alps traffic shall not exceed 650,000 rides per year (SR 740. 1, Article 1).

Switzerland reserves the right to accord less favourable treatment to services or se rvice suppliers of Japan for transport of goods and/or passenger s by vehicles registered in countries other than Switzerland in, into, out of, or in transit through Swiss territory than that accorded to like service sup pliers of any other country, normally pursuant to bilateral road transport agreements (SR 741.01, Article 106; SR 0.741). Vehicles must carry a Swiss vehicl e document and a Swiss licence plate if they transport passengers or freight between points within the territo ry of Switzerland (prohibition of cabota ge) on a commercial basis (SR 741.51, Article 115).
