They are all around us and are marketed as quick, tasty, foods, from snacks and drinks to full meals. While the odd treat is OK for most people, consuming these foods regularly has been shown to carry significant health risks; from weight gain to increased risk of heart problems and type 2 diabetes. BBC panorama covered some of these risks in detail, which you can read about in our previous article, [here](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/news/2023/08/health-versus-convenience-the-risks-of-ultra-processed-foods/). How to spot ultra-processed foods - A long ingredients list, containing items that you would not normally find at home - like casein, whey protein, hydrogenated oils, and maltodextrin - is one telltale sign. - Another indicator is a long use-by or best-before date - ultra-processed foods contain additives to make them last much longer than is natural. - Look out for anything that looks significantly different from its natural form - for example, fresh packaged raw chicken breasts or freshly frozen peas are minimally processed, whereas chicken nuggets and a tin of mushy peas indicate a high level of processing. Reducing dependence on ultra-processed foods The best strategy is to try and prepare meals from fresh ingredients where possible. If you are limited for time, plan to batch cook and freeze meals in smaller portions that can simply be reheated. The microwave is not the enemy - it is the processing that occurs during food manufacturing that is the issue. Some establishments offer freshly prepared frozen meals that are made by local people from fresh ingredients, which avoids industrial processing techniques. Recipe boxes can also be useful for those with limited cookery knowledge, as fresh ingredients and clear instructions are provided. 10 healthy swaps you can make today! - Commercial breakfast cereals can be replaced with simple rolled oats - just soak for an hour or so in your preferred milk or water and add honey to taste. - Instead of commercial fruit yogurt, use plain or Greek yoghurt.
