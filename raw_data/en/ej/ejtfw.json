There are simple things we can all do to support our bodies to better process all of that heavy food and drink intake over the Christmas period. Herbal medicine can certainly play a big role in this process. Beyond the context of holiday excess, promoting optimal detoxification is a good idea all year round! Unfortunately, over the past couple of centuries, our exposure to toxins has significantly increased - from synthetic pesticides, fertilisers and pesticides in our food to endocrine disruptors in the household and skincare products we use, to microplastics in our bloodstream as a result of growing plastic pollution. Our high-stress lifestyles also lead to an increase in the production of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which set off a \"fight and flight\" response. Excess hormones in the body need to be metabolised by the liver, which also has a central role in processing and eliminating toxins and metabolic waste from the body more generally. When we are busy our diets may also not provide the levels of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and antioxidants that we need to keep our body's systems thriving. In this context, we can all benefit from a little support in stimulating the body's natural channels of elimination. In this blog, we will be exploring: Simple things you can do to help your body to detox Herbs that can help to support the body's natural processing and clearing of metabolic waste and toxins Our Detox Collection of products, which have been specially developed to support optimal performance of the liver, the bowels and the kidneys Five Simple Steps to Support your Body's Detoxification Processes They can be easy to forget, and easier said than done, but there are several simple things our that can significantly help our bodies to better detox. These include: Drinking plenty of fluids and stay hydrated (water! and/or herbal teas, without caffeine) Doing some regular, gentle physical exercise Ensuring you have restful sleep Easing stress levels - for example with support from meditation and breathwork exercises Adopting a healthy diet including a colourful (and organic, as much as possible) range of fresh, leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, providing plenty of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals and essential fatty acids (particularly omega-3 from flax seeds, chia seeds or oily fish for example) Herbs can help, but if any of the areas above are out of balance, you will be fighting a constant battle against your body, which is never an effective way to go. Herbs to Support Liver Function and Wider Detoxification Systems There are many ways in which your body naturally clears metabolic waste and toxins. The liver is the body's master detoxifier - and there are many herbs that do support healthy liver function, protecting the liver from damage and even promoting its regeneration where damage may have occurred. But the body also processes and eliminates toxins via the digestive system more widely, the kidneys, the lungs, the lymphatic system and the skin. It is important to provide holistic support to all of these key systems when supporting better detoxification in the body - so that we do not end up over-burdening any of them in the process. In this section, we will briefly explore some of the ways in which certain herbs can support all of these systems. All of the herbs below are in our 360\u00b0 Detox Powder Mix and in our Detox Supplements. Many of them are in our Detox Tea as well. Milk thistle: For liver regeneration Milk thistle seeds have highly supportive, protective and even regenerative effects on the liver. Extensive scientific evidence has accumulated over recent decades demonstrating these properties. Milk thistle supports liver function, prevents damage from toxins and even helps restore liver tissue, including in serious scenarios (always under medical supervision in such cases, of course). It increases the resilience of liver cells by preventing toxins from entering the liver, and by stimulating the repair of cells damaged by infection, alcohol, chemical exposure and drugs, such as chemotherapy. Burdock: A mild laxative that balances blood sugar Burdock is cleansing, detoxifying, antiseptic and digestive - a perfect addition to a detox mix. It has a mild laxative effect, and with its natural antimicrobial actions, it helps to clear toxins from the gut and regulate the gut flora. It promotes the detoxifying work of the liver and helps balance blood sugar levels. Its moistening fibres absorb toxins from the gut and support their elimination from the bowel. Burdock also acts as a mild diuretic, aiding the elimination of toxins via the urine. Liquorice: Soothes the stomach and digestive tract Liquorice gently supports digestion and soothes the stomach and digestive tract, lowering any acidity and relieving heartburn and indigestion. It is a mild laxative. It also increases bile flow from the liver, lowers cholesterol levels and protects the liver from damage from toxins and infection. It is also a strengthening tonic - by supporting the adrenal glands, it improves resistance to physical and mental stress and helps address nervous exhaustion and fatigue. Nettle leaf: Enhances toxin excretion Nettle leaves are highly nutritious - they are rich in vitamins A and C and minerals, particularly iron, calcium, silica and potassium. Nettle protects the gut lining from irritation and infection, stimulates liver and kidney function, relieves fluid retention and enhances the excretion of toxins in the urine. It has a well-rounded action to support natural detoxification processes, including benefits to digestion, liver function and kidney function. It also reduces blood sugar levels and is anti-inflammatory. It assists with clearing the skin in eczema, psoriasis, acne, urticaria and other chronic skin problems. Cleavers: Supports the lymphatic system A gently detoxifying and vivifying spring tonic, cleavers provides excellent support to the lymphatic system, aiding the body in its cleansing and immune work and purifying the blood. As a diuretic, it also enhances the elimination of fluid toxins via the kidneys. It clears heat and resolves inflammation. It also gently supports digestion and liver function, although the main focus of its action is on the lymphatic system. Marshmallow root: Soothes inflammation Marshmallow root is a powerful and soothing medicinal plant that cools irritation and inflammation. It is a mild expectorant and immune enhancer, helping to clear catarrh and modulating inflammation. It is excellent for treating inflammatory gut problems, for soothing heartburn, constipation from dryness and the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It is also a soothing diuretic. Barberry: Supports healthy gut flora A very cleansing herb, barberry has been traditionally used for infections, liver and stomach ailments, and as a general tonic during convalescence. It helps maintain normal gut flora, supports digestion and decreases inflammation. It stimulates bile flow from the liver and helps support the body's natural detoxification pathways. Zen Maitri's Detox Collection to the Rescue Our 360\u00b0 Detox Mix for example is a powder that gently stimulates and supports the digestive system, the liver and the lymphatic and urinary systems. It enhances the function of all of these interconnected systems and effectively promotes the elimination of toxins and metabolic waste. It supports liver function and protects the liver from damage from toxins; it improves digestion, regulates the gut flora and soothes the stomach and digestive tract; it stimulates kidney function, helping to relieve fluid retention and enhance the excretion of toxins in the urine; it supports the lymphatic system's cleansing and immune work, and it also nourishes the body with a range of vitamins and minerals. It is perfect for a two-week cleanse and easy to incorporate into your daily routine. We also carry the same formula in plant-based capsules in our Detox Supplements, as another handy way to integrate the potency of the blend into your day-to-day without any concerns about taste. Our Detox Tea contains a similar blend that can be enjoyed as an infusion (another benefit in itself, as increasing fluid intake is also key to supporting better natural detoxification), to enhance liver function, support the lymphatic system, promote healthy digestion and replenish the system with vitamins and minerals. It provides delicious and all-natural detoxification support. It contains burdock, barberry, dandelion, sarsaparilla and nettle leaf.
