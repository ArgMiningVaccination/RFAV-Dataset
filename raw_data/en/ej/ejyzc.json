HHWC recently welcomed vaccine expert Dr. Sherri Tenpenny as a guest on \" [Health & Wellness Solutions](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhotze.com%2FResource-Library%2FRadio.aspx&esheet=6827738&lan=en-US&anchor=Health+%26+Wellness+Solutions&index=3&md5=77a9c9294cd4ddf3e744f4ebde97538f)\" radio program to discuss the misconceptions of vaccines, their toxic ingredients and side effects. Dr. Tenpenny along with host of \"Health & Wellness Solutions\" and physician at HHWC Dr. Donald Ellsworth explain the dangers of vaccinations in simplistic terms so that people outside the medical community can easily understand. Dr. Ellsworth explains his intentions are to ensure Americans are educated about the risks associated with conventional medicine's approach to immune health through immunization and present natural options as alternatives. In particular, he advises how to [boost the immune system](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotzehwc.com%2FResource-Center%2FDrHotze-com-Blog%2FNovember-2010%2FShoo%21-Flu%2C-Don-t-Bother-Me--Five-Tips-for-Flu-Prev.aspx&esheet=6827738&lan=en-US&anchor=boost+the+immune+system&index=4&md5=05235ea982a9577eb4d439e5dc83af16) so that people can protect themselves from the seasonal flu.

As parents, we all need to stop fighting for the right to vaccinate and educate ourselves about what we are injecting into our youth instead of blindly believing what's being forced upon us particularly by 'Big Pharma' and the vaccine industry.\" The following list highlights a few key points discussed by Dr. Ellsworth and Dr. Tenpenny during their radio segment on vaccine dangers: 1. Public Misconceptions: a. Case Examples: i. Polio Vaccine - For more information on this particular case study, please listen to the [complete podcast](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotzehwc.com%2FResource-Center%2FAudio%2FDr--Sherri-Tenpenny-on-Dangers-of-Vaccines.aspx&esheet=6827738&lan=en-US&anchor=complete+podcast&index=6&md5=58cb0de67dc92c06bfddab084f71951f). ii. Prevnar Vaccine - Additional information is also available on podcast. b. If mercury isn't present in vaccine, there is no need to be concerned over safety, which is simply not true. c. Most states enforce immunization for children to be allowed into the public school system. Not the case. Research your rights. Here is the [state vaccine exemption form](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwebds.dshs.state.tx.us%2Fimmco%2Faffidavit.shtm&esheet=6827738&lan=en-US&anchor=state+vaccine+exemption+form&index=7&md5=7929c62b688b30d374a5909636cccf11) for Texas. 2. Toxic Ingredients: Even if mercury isn't present in the vaccine, there are still trace amounts of toxic chemicals such as gelatin, aluminum and formaldehyde. In particular, the Food and Drug Administration recently placed formaldehyde on the official known carcinogen list, yet it's still used to manufacture a number of vaccines such as polio, and in some cases, even the flu vaccine. 3. Effectiveness: The real question is: is the vaccine is protective? Even in two related \"success stories\" involving vaccines the incidence of disease either viral or bacterial declined, but what has been the tradeoff? In both cases, a more aggressive, resistant strain was created when the other was eliminated. There is no 'win-win' situation with any vaccine. 4. Educate yourself beyond the basics.
