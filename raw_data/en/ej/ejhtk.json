Inside the very unique world of world No 1 Novak Djokovic after he said he did not want to be immunised against coronavirus - Novak Djokovic is an unorthodox character compared to rivals in the ATP Tour - After an experiment with white bread, he changed to a disciplined diet - He is a devout Christian and fundamentally is against surgery and medicine - Djokovic revealed in 2018 he 'cried for three days' after he went under the knife - The world No 1 recently reinforced his standpoint that he is against vaccinations [Here's how to help people impacted by Covid-19](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/covid-help) [Novak Djokovic](/sport/novak_djokovic/index.html) is many things. He is a devout Christian, a meditator, a yoga-enthusiast, a father, a husband, president of the ATP Player Council, speaks five languages and he's incredibly spiritual. And so the one thing the world No 1 could not be called is orthodox. His latest head-turning comments came regarding vaccinations and namely immunising professional players to speed up the return to action. To many, that would seem totally logical and rational, once a vaccination is developed and distributed. But not Djokovic. For many years he has been anti-medicine, anti-surgery and anti-vaccination and even a global pandemic has not altered his stance. Novak Djokovic takes an unorthodox approach to life off the tennis court in order to be the best He once overlooked the massive weight difference as he tried his hand at sumo wrestling Both he and wife Jelena (left) have been criticised this week for views on vaccinations and 5G When it was put to him that a failure to compromise on his beliefs could place his immediate future in the sport in doubt as tennis plots how it will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, he was unmoved. 'Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,' Djokovic said in a live Facebook chat with several fellow Serbian athletes on Sunday. 'But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.' That stance left some in the tennis community stunned, others less so. Djokovic, while not deliberately trying to pose as a preacher, has often been vocal about his unorthodox beliefs, despite the criticism that invariably follows each of them. In a statement to the Associated Press on Tuesday, Djokovic, unsurprisingly to those who have tracked his career, doubled down on his vaccination comments. 'Personally I am opposed to the vaccination against COVID-19 in order to be able to travel,' the statement reiterated. 'But if it becomes compulsory, I will have to make a decision whether to do it or not. This is my current feeling, and I don't know if it will change, but it really influences my profession.' He is a 17-time Grand Slam winner but his vaccination stance could threaten his place in tennis The wording was almost identical, but the second statement has left room for a change of heart if it does become 'compulsory' for players across the ATP and WTA tours. Eventually, one would imagine, he will fall in line. It would not be the first time Djokovic's moralist stance has been compromised, either. Take his beliefs around surgery and medicine. Fundamentally he does not agree with either. In fact, so strong was his desire to allow his troublesome right elbow to heal naturally, he split with former coach Andre Agassi over his desire to take a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation. 'I only knew him with a hurt elbow, so it was always plasters and big problems,' [Agassi told the Guardian in 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/03/andre-agassi-novak-djokovic-listen-advice-elbow-injury). 'I think there was a real hope his elbow could heal naturally, holistically. I personally wasn't a fan of that choice. You can't force someone when it comes to their own body, you have to understand their hesitations, but health is a function of taking care of your body, making the hard decisions, giving yourself the time and then moving forward methodically. Rest wasn't going to do it in my estimation.' It took a dramatic decline to world No 22 before his stance on surgery subsided - somewhat - and he went under the knife. Yoga and meditation has become a key part of Djokovic's routine in a bid to remain on top But instead of, like many of his peers do, feeling relieved that he was fit and healthy again, Djokovic felt cheated. He felt like he had taken on nature and somehow lost, even though he would go on to dominate once more at the top of one of the most physically intense sports. 'I just cried for two or three days,' Djokovic [later told the Telegraph](https://au.sports.yahoo.com/novak-djokovic-exclusive-apos-cried-090000235.html). 'I cried after I had the surgery on my elbow. Every time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself.' EXAMPLE DAILY MENU FOR NOVAK DJOKOVIC Breakfast - Water first thing out of bed; two tablespoons of honey; muesli (including organic gluten-free rolled oats, cranberries, raisins, pumpkin or sunflower seeds and almonds) Mid-morning snack (if needed): Gluten-free bread or crackers with avocado and tuna Lunch - Mixed-greens salad, gluten-free pasta primavera (including rice pasta, summer squash, courgettes, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes and optional vegan cheese) Mid-afternoon snack - Apple with cashew butter; melon Dinner - Kale caesar salad (kale, fennel, quinoa and pine nuts) plus dressing (including anchovies or sardines); minestrone soup; salmon fillets (skin on) with roasted tomatoes and marinade Example menu appeared in his book ' [Serve to Win](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Serve-Win-Gluten-free-Physical-Excellence/dp/0552170534)' One of the most defining moments in Djokovic's career came in the player's bathroom at the 2010 Australian Open. Leading his quarter-final against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga two sets to one, Djokovic broke down physically to the point where he was a shadow of what had gone before in the eyes of the Melbourne crowd. He went to the toilet in a break and was reported to have 'vomited violently'. He won a pitiful four games on his return as his breathing issues continued and he was out. Tsonga had turned it around. Djokovic later met with Serbian nutritionist Dr Igor Cetojevic - who had actually watched the match - and a resistance exercise was arranged. The player was tasked with placing a piece of white bread on his stomach and stretching out his right arm. As Cetojevic pushed, it highlighted an intolerance to gluten, and that was the day Djokovic's diet became the cleanest and healthiest in tennis. Gone were the days of the indulging in his [parents' pizzeria back in Serbia](/sport/tennis/article-2163439/Novak-Djokovic-How-pizzeria-war-torn-Serbia-served-Wimbledon-champion.html), as further blood tests showed further difficulties with digesting wheat and dairy. And so Djokovic went strict with his diet, promoting smoothies, drinking water, avoiding all confectionary products - there was once a story where Djokovic, after not having chocolate for 18 months, had one singular cube melt on his tongue before he was satisfied. A year after his diet shift he had what many have tabbed up as one of the greatest single seasons of any player in the Open era. Since committing to his super-clean diet, Djokovic has been fiercely disciplined Djokovic won 10 titles, three Grand Slams and 43 consecutive matches. Unorthodox and extreme in his new diet, yes. Was it generating results? Freakish ones. His dedication has never faltered in the decade that has followed. He went from a vomiting player in the toilets in Melbourne to perhaps the most impressive physical specimen in recent tennis history. While Djokovic - on 17 Grand Slams - is in pole position to surpass both Rafael Nadal (19) and Roger Federer (20), he has found it difficult to connect to tennis fans like his two fiercest rivals have. His personality has proven divisive. Djokovic has become famed on the circuit for player impressions but for all the joviality of his behaviour at times, his ruthlessness to the sport and his often controversial opinions, have painted him as the third man in the 'two is company, three is a crowd' metaphor often used to describe the 'Big Three'. Djokovic's relationship with former world and British No 1 Andy Murray has always been particularly strong. Having met in their pre-teenage years at a tournament in France, their rapport has grown since with Djokovic recently undertaking the Scot's social media challenge. It was a rare public showing of his personality compared to the more serious side of Djokovic that many have come to expect. Djokovic has a strong relationship with Andy Murray having met in their pre-teenage years They both became stars of their age group and never seem to tire about telling stories from when they were first introduced. 'In our first match, Andy destroyed me,' Djokovic once said. 'He had a lot of hair, a lot of curly hair. He was also quite pale.' It was in 2016 when Maria Sharapova was handed a drugs ban that the pair found themselves on differing sides of the argument. Djokovic, who is president of the ATP Player Council, dismissed all talk that tennis had a doping problem while Murray raised concerns that the sport needed to take a closer look. 'As long as there is no proof that somebody is doping, the sport is clean,' Djokovic said at the time. The public disagreement between two old friends only went further to ostracise Djokovic with criticism from all corners after Sharapova's suspension was upheld for consumption of meldonium. Djokovic is now 32 and has tried to showcase more of his personality on social media in recent times, whether that be playing in the house with his kids, doting over his dogs, or bizarrely trying his hand at sumo wrestling while out in Japan at a tournament. Djokovic (pictured with his son, Stefan) is a Christian and part of the Serbian Orthodox Church Jelena Djokovic, the wife of world No 1 tennis player Novak, has been given a 'false information' label by Instagram after sharing a conspiracy theory that 5G has helped cause coronavirus A husband to Jelena and father to two children, son Stefan, aged five, and daughter Tara, aged two, Djokovic is a member of Serbian Orthodox Church and is often seen sporting a cross around his neck in matches. Along with his incredibly strict diet, the world No 1 undertakes a lot of yoga and meditation - increasing his spirituality - with a key focus on pranayama exercises (breathing exercises). [EssentiallySports went on to report](https://www.essentiallysports.com/religious-beliefs-and-spiritual-inclination-of-novak-djokovic/) that he has used the Buddhist Buddhapadipa Temple in Wimbledon around the SW19 Grand Slam each summer. And so his lifestyle choices are not orthodox, his views are often extreme, moralistic and difficult to comprehend but that is his nature. His wife even got in on the act this month after sharing a video that suggested 5G technology causes coronavirus. It ended up with her shamed by Instagram and handed a 'False Information' warning label on the post. So, from the white bread experiment and crying after surgery to opposing vaccination and his wife wanting to learn more about 5G conspiracy theories, nothing about the Djokovic family can be filed under 'normal'.
