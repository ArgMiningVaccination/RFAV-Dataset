Globally, as of 13 July 2021, there have been approximately 186 million confirmed cases of people infected by COVID-19 with more than 4 million deaths since the first identified case of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Chi - na in December 2019 [2,3]. Among Southeast Asia countries, Indonesia has been re - ported the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the second highest in mortality rate following the Philippines [4].

However, vaccine safety is a top priority to limit the occur - rence of adverse events. Henceforth, this study aims to recognize and perceive COVID-19 vaccine safety in Indonesia during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study and was conducted in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey of demographic information and a qual - itative questionnaire. Responses were recorded and the association between demographic characteristics from survey questions was tested using chi-square with a risk estimate and 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 311 participants from 33 out of 34 provinces in Indonesia participated in this study. Recorded responses showed multiple side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine both short- and long-term experienced by the participants. Significant associations were found between demographic factors and COVID-19 vaccine side effects such as female gender with short- term puncture site (odds ratio [OR], 0.463; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.263-0.816) and (OR, 0.463; 95% CI, 0.263-0.816), domicile outside Java island with long- term puncture site (OR, 4.219; 95% CI, 1.401-12.701) and immune reactions (OR, 3.375; 95% CI, 1.356-8.398), also between married marital status and long-term vagal reaction (OR, 4.655; 95% CI, 1.321-16.409). Conclusion: Gender, domicile and marital status factors were associated with COVID-19 vac - cine side effects in Indonesian people.

As chaos rises due to deaths caused by COV - ID-19 and no certain definitive treatment yet to be discov - ered, the importance of herd immunity through an effective and secured vaccination is crucial to break the virus trans - mission and improve social and economic burdens caused by COVID-19 [6]. As of now, about 3.4 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally with approximately 29 mil - lion doses being administered each day [7]. With the benefits of the vaccine, which is to help protect from the virus, vaccines may also have some side effects which is a normal sign for the human body of building immune protection [8]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short-term side effects, for instance, low-grade fever, pain on the body, redness at the injection site, and oth - er rare side effects [9]. Alongside the various amount of vac - cine side effects, vaccine safety is a top priority to ensure the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine [10]. Although COV - ID-19 vaccine side effects are quite common, COVID-19 vac - cines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect adverse events and apply approaches to ensure their occurrence limitation [9]. Several studies reported adverse events caused by the CO - VID-19 vaccine to establish the safety of the vaccine, yet there are very few studies regarding the investigation of COVID-19 side effects in Indonesia [11]. Henceforth, this study was con - ducted to recognize and perceive the COVID-19 vaccine safe - ty in Indonesia during the pandemic. Materials and Methods Study sampling and procedure This cross-sectional study was conducted from early Febru - ary to May in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey made with Google Forms was distributed through on - line platforms and social media. Particularly all Indonesian citizens across the country who already get vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines were eligible to participate in this study. Screening instruments Sociodemographic information such as age, gender (male or female), domicile (within or outside Java Island), marital sta - tus (single or married), education levels, occupation (health - care workers or non-healthcare workers), and previous vac - cination status (unvaccinated, unsure, partial, or completed) were asked in this survey. Questions about the COVID-19 vaccine including dosage (first or second) and type of COV - ID-19 vaccine that were administered ( Sinovac or other than Sinovac ) were also in this survey. COVID-19 vaccine side ef - fects (short-term and long-term) questions were put together with multiple choice answers in this study. Other questions made up of COVID-19 screening, comorbidity, disease histo - ry, treatment of symptoms appearance, and health protocol after getting vaccinated were also compiled in this survey. Data analysis Recorded data were analyzed using IBM SPSS ver. 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The sociodemographic data were presented descriptively and variables were tested using chi- square with a risk estimate and 95% confidence interval. Ethical consideration The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pelita Ha - rapan University has approved the protocol for this study. The approval letter was issued with the number 085/K-LJK/ ETIK/II/2021. This study was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Decla - ration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. All of the informed consent were obtained from the participants of this study. Results A total of 311 participants from 33 out of 34 provinces in In - donesia were included in this study. Table 1 shows the demo - graphic characteristics of all the participants who have filled the questionnaire. The median age was 25 years (participant age between 19-71 years) and 69.7% were 24 years old. The majority of the participants were female (67.5%), marital sta - tus was single (89.4%), educational level as undergraduates (94.9%), previously fully vaccinated (84%), work as health work - ers (89.4%), and live within Java Island (92.0%). Participants' responses showed mostly have been admin - istered with Sinovac (98.7%) as their COVID-19 vaccine with the majority having received the first dose (60.8%). Responses were shown with particularly few who had disease history (4.2%) and comorbidity (2.9%); moreover, participants were mostly got vaccinated in hospitals (84.2%). Healthcare work - ers who participated were taking rapid and swab COVID-19 antigen test (54.7%) as their usual screening test, and merely a few had a positive result (1.3%). Johan Wibowo et al COVID-19 vaccine side effects association factors 91 https://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2022.11.1.89 Survey results showed participants experienced the short- term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine (42.4%) more than the long-term (29.3%). The short-term side effects of the vac - cine were furthermore categorized, 15.4% showed puncture site reaction (pain, redness, and swelling), 17.0% gave immune reaction (mild fever and pain on the muscles and joints), about 3.2% showed vagal reaction (confusion, shortness of breath, and syncope) and as much as 29.9% felt otherwise (drowsi - ness, headache, polyphagia, numbness, and nausea). Addi - tionally, the long-term side effects were also further catego - rized and the results showed 6.8% experienced puncture site reaction, 13.8% felt immune reaction, 3.9% showed a vagal reaction, and about 18.0% for the other reactions. There were no data results regarding the allergic reaction to the vaccine as there were no participants who experienced both short-term and long-term side effects. Data results regarding the side ef - fects of the COVID-19 vaccine are shown in Fig. 1. Bivariate analysis of the short-term COVID-19 vaccine side effects was done with the demographic characteristics of the participants (Table 2). There were significant relationships between gender factor with both puncture site reaction (odds ratio [OR], 0.366; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.164-0.814) Fig. 1.

Furthermore, bivariate analysis of the long- term COVID-19 vaccine side effects was also done (Table 3). Association was found between domicile factor with punc - ture site reaction (OR, 4.219; 95% CI, 1.401-12.701) im - mune reaction (OR, 3.375; 95% CI, 1.356-8.398) of COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects. Additionally, there was also an asso - ciation between marital status and vagal reaction (OR, 4.655; 95% CI, 1.321-16.409) side effects. There were no results re - garding allergic reactions from COVID-19 vaccine side effects as there were no samples of it in the population. Further results of the survey showed that approximately 18.0% of participants who experienced side effects have taken action (went to healthcare workers or bought drugs) while the rest have done nothing to take care of the side effects. Most participants (94.5%) continued to do a complete health pro - tocol (keep distance, wear a mask, and hand hygiene) after getting vaccinated. Additionally, there were no participants diagnosed COVID-19 positive after being vaccinated. Discussion The core of this study is to determine factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine side effects among Indonesian people. The result data obtained from this study indicated several factors regarding COVID-19 vaccine side effects such as gen - der, domicile, and marital status. The female gender was more likely to experience short-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, such as puncture site reaction (19.0%) and other re - actions (34.8%). Results also showed that Indonesian who lived outside Java Island were more likely to get puncture site reaction (20.0%) and immune reaction (32.0%) as their COV - ID-19 vaccine side effects after getting vaccinated. Addition - ally, married marital status was also associated with vagal re - action (12.1%) side effects. In addition to factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine side ef - fects, data results showed most participants experienced oth - er reaction side effects (drowsiness, headache, polyphagia, numbness, and nausea) more commonly than others. In con - trast, the vagal reaction was the least type of side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine that has been experienced by the partici - pants in both the short- and long-term. Furthermore, the re - sults showed short-term COVID-19 vaccine side effects were more common than long-term side effects. Based on the data samples, many healthcare workers were still taking rapid and swab COVID-19 antigen test as their screening test after getting vaccinated; however, WHO still recommends polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2. This finding may explain the complementation and acceleration of overall testing capaci - ty, although it is preferred to use PCR rather than rapid tests [12]. Adella Halim et al. [13] found that young people of Indone - sia are aware of the COVID-19 pandemic yet have inadequate knowledge about preventive measures. However, the oppo - site was found in this study where it is shown that overall the participants continued to follow a complete health protocol despite after getting vaccinated (94.5%) where it is also con - sistently what the federal government requires [14]. These con - trast findings may be due to the majority of healthcare work - ers as an occupation in the population sample. This finding was also supported by a study conducted by Rizki et al. [15] where it is stated that most Indonesian healthcare workers have a good understanding of preventing COVID-19 trans - mission. The strength of this study is that it was conducted in early February 2021 when the initial phase of COVID-19 vaccina - tion was administered on priority groups such as healthcare workers and government officers. Throughout the time, there were minimal studies discussing factors associated with CO - VID-19 vaccine side effects. However, we acknowledge sever - al limitations in this study, such as potential selection bias cau- sed by online surveys resulting in failure to round up exten - sive data on the various social level and populations in the rural area. Furthermore, the population in this study tends to be greater for the female sex, 24 years old age group, educa - tion of university or college graduates, domicile in Java Island, single marital status, healthcare workers as occupation, and complete previous vaccination status. Small population sam - ples were also a lack of this study where it is not sufficient to represent the Indonesian population adequately. However, there are minimum studies discussing COVID-19 vaccine side effects especially in Indonesia; therefore, this study may benefit in monitoring and understanding further COVID-19 vaccine safety. In conclusion, there were demographic factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine side effects such as gender, domicile, and marital status in the population of Indonesian people. Further research is needed to continue monitoring COVID-19 vaccine side effects to ensure its safety.
