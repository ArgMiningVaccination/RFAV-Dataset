The sense of relaxation and devotion to the Sadhguru's words could be seen in the faces of each pilgrim. As they were passing through many spectacular mountains, meeting lovely people, they faced many challenges of the journey as well, but together with Sadhguru, they overcame those obstacles and challenges and made it to the pilgrimage. The journey was organized in 2021 it was amid the time when COVID was still looming around. But it was incredible to see how safely this pilgrimage was organized and none of the pilgrims were affected throughout the journey. Who is Sadhguru? Sadhguru, one of the most renowned spiritual leaders of this generation was born as Jagadish Vasudev in Mysore, India. Sadhguru has helped people change their lives through the different initiatives of Isha Foundation. Not only a famous yogi and public speaker, he is also an active environment activist. From very childhood he had displayed his incredible concentration power. He practiced yoga from childhood. At one point of his youth he realized he needed to travel to understand the realities of life, he started traveling across India. With a quest of finding the answers of life, he started practicing yoga and started helping others to learn yoga to others as well.

The spiritual aspect indicates spiritual energy working at a deep level on our spiritual being. The healing is about the transfer of energy. Spiritual healing is the process of maintaining the balance & harmony between the body, mind, and spirit. It is a practice of well-being through spiritual means. How Spiritual Healing was Connected with this Journey to Mount Kailash Beholding the Kailash mountain would give you the sense of a living reality, the gigantic mountain will help you realize your nothingness as compared to this mighty universe. Walking through completely untouched trails of mountains, experiencing different phases of weathers, talking about Tibetan culture of Buddhism and yogic practices, every moment of this journey possessed some healing phenomenon. Traveling through the pristine and pure nature and setting the camp beneath the shade of Mount Kailash, and watching the mighty peak in the morning, practicing meditation in the morning facing towards the peak of Kailash, this would definitely take your spirit to next heights. In a Nutshell: Journey of Mindfulness and Meditation After reaching the altitude of 17000 feet (5100m), chanting 'OM' in front of mighty Kailash Mountain, keeping calm with some meditative moment, this journey definitely had brought these pilgrims to a level of spiritual fulfillment. In this mystic land many cried or screamed while chanting OM, many were in tears, but eventually they were breathing in life, they were healing their spirits.
