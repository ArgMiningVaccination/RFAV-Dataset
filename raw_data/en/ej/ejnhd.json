Background. A global pandemic has recently been observed due to the new coronavirus disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Since there are currently no antiviral medicines to combat the highly contagious and lethal COVID-19 infection, identifying natural sources that can either be viricidal or boost the immune system and aid in the fght against the disease can be an essential therapeuticsupport. Methods.TisreviewwasconductedbasedonpublishedpapersrelatedtotheherbaltherapyofCOVID-19by search on databases including PubMed and Scopus with herbal, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and therapy keywords. Results. To combat this condition, people may beneft from the therapeutic properties of medicinal plants, such as increasing their immune system or providing an antiviral impact. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 infection death rates can be reduced. Various traditional medicinal plants and their bioactive components, such as COVID-19, are summarized in this article to assist in gathering and debatingtechniquesforcombatingmicrobialdiseasesingeneralandboostingourimmunesysteminparticular.

Tere are several ways that COVID-19 canspread but coughing or sneezing droplets is the mostcommon [2]. Some preventive measures, such as socialdistancing and lockdown of cities, have been adopted tocontrol the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. SARS-CoV-2 hasbecome a global public health hazard despite concertedmeasures to maintain the virus's high transmissibility in specifc places [4, 5]. At a minimum, an optimal therapy shouldspeedsymptomaticrecovery,limitviraltransmissionin the population through early viral clearance from theinfected individuals, and reduce mortality [6]. We havea long way to go before we have a medication for severeCOVID-19 patients that is successful though. New viral-born infectious diseases have challenged the life of humans and other living creatures. Usually, viraldiseases are difcult to control and have a more compre-hensive public health impact, so viral pathogens haveHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2023, Article ID 5525165, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/5525165 received more attention and have threatened modern healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. Preventive andsupportive treatments are now used to avoid future prob-lems and organdamage from COVID-19.Due tothepublichealth issue produced by COVID-19, researchers haveconcentrated on identifying medicines with therapeutic or preventive potential for the treatment and control of this viral illness [7-9]. Four principal viral structural proteins are spike (S), envelope(E),membrane(M),andnucleocapsid(N)[10,11].SARS-CoV-2 (ACE-2) receptors, RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRP), and spike proteins are critical sectionsofnoveltherapeutictargetsbasedonthecurrentknowledge[12,13].Teantiviralmechanismforplantextractsdifersasper the structure and the replication process of the viruses;some plants can help boost our body's natural antiviralimmunity [14, 15]. Peptides and proteins of medicinal signifcance can be synthesized from plant extracts, leading to vaccinations and protein/peptide-based treatments[16, 17]. Meanwhile, testing new therapeutic items will takealongtime,andmanyethnicgroupshavealreadyexaminedmedicinal plants since ancient times. Nearly 80% of theworld's population relies on medicinal plants as their majorsource of healthcare [18]. Moreover, plant- and microbial-based natural compounds make up more than 40% of thesyntheticdrugsonthemarket[19].Researchersshouldfocuson the screening of hundreds of natural products to locatethe powerful antiviral medicine for COVID-19. As a result,the focus of this study is on medicinal plants and herbs that display antiviral activities and might be valuable in drug discovery eforts. 2.Medicinal Plant Candidates High costs and adverse efects of synthetic drugs and thearrival of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have requiredharmless and unique antiviral drugs [20]. Herbal essenceshave become an outstanding choice for the formulation ofantiviral medicines that can hinder multiple steps of thevirus replication cycle [21]. According to the features of theSARS-CoV-2, a molecular mechanism of the host is asso-ciated with the immune response [22]. In this situation, in which the preventive and therapeutic representatives have not been developed and advised for patient administration,herbalmedicinesarefrequentlyusedbymanyindividualsinthe community (Table 1). 2.1. Salvia miltiorrhiza. Te underlying antiviral mecha- nisms can be divided into two categories: the direct in- hibition of viruses and the indirect antiviral efect. Salvia miltiorrhiza worksthroughasecondprocessthatinhibitsthe infammatoryresponsemediatedbythevirusbymodulatingthefunctionoftheimmunesystem[48].Ontheotherhand,some main protease enzymes protease efective PLproinhibiting compounds is tanshinone, a diterpene with the structure of abietane.Moreover, this inhibitor can also act against selective (Figure 1). Te inhibitory efect of diferent PL seven SARS-CoV PL infammation and disruption of the infammatory signaling cascade in both the mice cardiactissue and H9c2 cells is caused by pretreatment of TanIIA through the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factorerythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2), triggering on Nrf2/HO-1signaling[51-53].ActivitiesofSOD(superoxidedismutase),catalase(CAT),andGSH-Pxinserumcanbeincreased,andthe generation of ROS in doxorubicin(DOX) can inducecardiotixicity in animals.. Efective chemicals can decrease hyperlipidemia in rats in Salvia a triterpenoid saponin Glycyrrhizae Radix (GLR) obtained mainly from Gly- cyrrhiza glabra plant antiviral, anti-parasite, and anticancer capabilities, have been intensively explored in biology and medicine [55-57]. Glycyrrhizin is a multitarget substance whose potential undiscovered tar-gets are revealed over time. It has been disclosed that dia-mmonium glycyrrhizin treatment helped severeCOVID-19 [58]. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a moiety, can be glycosylatedtoGLRandthetwoglucuronicacids[26].GLRis administered both orally and intravenously in humans.Oral administration of GLR is metabolized to GA by in-testinal bacteria and absorbed through the intestine, and itcanthenbefoundinhumanplasma[59].GLR's impactson various human viruses have been examined over several years.Glycyrrhiza glabra (Leguminosae family) exhibits an antiviral activity against several viruses, including cyto-megalovirus, herpes simplex type-1, hepatitis A, B, C,varicella-zoster, and HIV [60-62]. GLR inhibited virus replication estimated by drug- induced nitrous oxide synthase production and adsorp-tionandpenetrationofthevirusintocells[63].GLRactsbyinhibiting virus plasma membrane penetration (membraneefect) and suppression of viral antigen secretion2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicineTable1: Review of antiviral medication candidates from natural products.

It has been suggested to evaluate for SARStreatment [63]. Inaddition,rod-likemicelleandfbrilformationofGLR is due to its amphiphilic and anisotropic structure and self- assembling into the fbrillary network [65]. GLR possesses two advantages: frst, it can boost the solubility of poorlysoluble drugs; and second, it can raise these drugs' passivedifusion through cell membranes. Diferent drug deliverysystems are embedded for certain diseases, including he-patocellular carcinoma by GLR [66]. Cholesterol is an essential compound in lipid mem- branes. One of the interactions of GLR is with membranecholesterol which can cause membrane disorganization anddisturbanceandactbyimprovingionsandsmallmolecules'permeability to the membrane [58]. In the raft monolayermodel, GA can perform even better than GLR. Tis dis-organization is a critical point in surface attachment by the ganglioside-binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory cells. Additionally, it hasbeen presented that GLR can reduce the quantity of cho-lesterolinlipidraftsandpreventthetranslocationofTLR-4to lipid rafts [67]. Combining of some antiviral drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with GLR can weaken virus entryto the host cell [68, 69]. Lately, it has been suggested thatSARS-CoV-2infectioncanbereducedbyinhibitingthevirallipid-dependent attachment of the novel coronavirus to thehostcell'splasmamembranebynaturalproductslikesterols andcyclodextrin[70].Furthermore,lipidraftsarecrucialin SARS-coronavirus infection because they can be an entryport for the abovementioned virus. Due to decreased viralparticle formation, cholesterol depletion with methyl-cyclodextrin can diminish coronavirus infection [69, 71].Hence, impediments of lipid rafts and cellular cholesterolmetabolismsthatplayanessentialroleintheentryofvirusesand their infectivity can be considered a principle. GLR has anti-infammatory and immune modulator features through several pathways such as toll-like receptor SARS-COV 2 Viral RNA Honey Te viral proteins and genome RNA are assembled in the ER and Golgi apparatus compartment and then insertedinto the vesicles.Vesicles containing thevirus, transported to on coronavirus pathogenicity are indicated by a red arrow. Te virus may also leave the cell by budding. Te fgure is provided by BioRender.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5signaling and MAPK. Strong binding of GLR to HMGB1 distributed the protein interactions such as advanced gly-cation end products (RAGE), TLR2, and TLR4. Te anti-infammatory efects of GLR via TLR4/HMGB1-dependentare well proven [30]. Te reduced TLR activity is associatedwith the diminished infammatory cytokine and in- mediator activity, such as the TLR4 ligand nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase. It has been demon-strated that GLR can bind to more proteins like serum al-bumin and bind to nucleic acids, DNA, and RNA evenweakly[29].GLRhasbeenrevealedtodisturbtheautophagyprocess in infected host cells, so this point can be benefcial[72]. A study suggested that GLR could be used alongsidesome drugs such as chloroquine to promote solubilizationandbioavailabilityofdrugs,virusreplicationinhibition,andcomplement the drug activity, which can have synergisticefects in some circumstances [73]. Among the other 44 compounds, glycyrrhizic acid de- rived from Glycyrrhiza (ACE2) interaction bybinding to S1 protein could be a potential target of gly-cyrrhizic acid even at low concentrations (IC50 22M). According to the molecular docking results, two stronghydrogen interactions with Asp405 and Arg408 in thecarboxyl of ring E, a strong hydrogen interaction withARg403 in the carbonyl of ring C, plus a strong hydrogeninteraction with Tyr453 in glycosyl, show that glycyrrhizic acid could be a multitarget inhibitor and a potential can- didate for SARS-CoV-2 transfected cells,mouse aorta smooth muscle cells (MASMCs) even at highconcentrations (100 M), and also human lung cells [28]. 2.3.Vitisvinifera. Grapes like Vitis vinifera have long been known for their nutritional and therapeutic benefts. Glu- cose, organic acids, and polyphenols such as and stilbenes and viniferins) [74]. Resveratrolrepresents a the inhibition of in-fection and a decrease MERS-CoV replication [42]. Tismeans that resveratrol's anti-MERS and anti-SARS-CoV2properties can It has been revealed thatthe antioxidant polyphenol resveratrol protects against free radical damage in disorders such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disease, and microbial infection[76, 77]. Resveratrol antiviral agent, resveratrol is efective against a viruses, including the herpes simplex virus, en-terovirus71,theEpstein-Barrvirus,therespiratorysyncytialvirus, infuenza, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, a relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causesMERS [42, 79]. SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytokinestorms may be reduced copper and resveratrol are ad-ministered together [43]. 2.4. Zingiber. Ginger is the root of the Zingiber ofcinale plant, which is a member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is one of the most widely used spices with therapeutic char-acteristics [80]. Zingiber contains a group of polyphenols properties [81]. It can facilitate the im-mune response and is benefcial for COVID-19 prevention.TerearesomeinstancesinwhichtheseverityofCOVID-19is attributed to macrophage hyperinfammation, eventhough COVID-19 is not a disease of infammation by itself [44]. In certain circumstances, ginger's anti-infammatory properties could help reduce symptoms and illness sever- ity. As a result, ginger has been demonstrated to havetherapeutic efects on metabolic illnesses such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease in animal models [82]. Diabetesand cardiovascular disease have a higher death rate inpersonswhotestpositiveforCOVID-19;therefore,thisisanimportant consideration [83]. As a result, ginger's antiviralpropertiesalsohaveantioxidative,immunomodulatory,andanti-infammatoryproperties[84].Tepresenceofallicinin ginger is reported to have anti-infuenza cytokines, an ef- fectivetraditionalremedyagainstcommoncoldviruses[85].COVID-19 virus has been demonstrated to be an efcientantiviral because 6-gingerol has a high afnity for variousbinding sites on viral protein molecules [86]. Tus, ginger,with its long history of use in traditional medicine for thetreatment of infectious diseases, has become a promisingsource of antimicrobial agents. 2.5. Curcuma. For many years, Curcuma has been a com- monly used yellow spice with medicinal properties like ginger. Curcumin is also a source of diarylheptanoidpolyphenols, as previously indicated [87, 88]. Curcumin isone of the diarylheptanoids from Curcuma that represents a good inhibitory activity against PL proand has various therapeutic properties like antihyperlipidemic, anti-infammatory, and antimicrobial activities [45]. In combatagainst COVID-19, nutritional supplementation is recom-mended to bolster the immune system, and curcumin maybe a good choice for this purpose [89]. Curcumin's thera-peutic efects have been studied extensively. Its antiviral activity has been observed against a variety of viruses, in- cluding emerging arboviruses like Zika virus agent, curcumin can exert its efects in various ways, including via disrupting viral pathways orcellularprocessesordirectlyonvirus-encodedproteins[91].One recent study found that curcumin-derived antiviral 71 pathways [92]. Te entry receptor of HCoV-229E was discovered to be inhibited by carbon quantum dotsalone, making them efcient against the human coronasvirus (HCoV) [93]. Various intracellular small oxidativecompounds may curcumin's ability to transport electrons [94]. Anaerobic fermentation is exac- erbated, and the energy supply is reduced in severeCOVID-19 cases because of pneumonia, which interfereswith cell metabolism [95]. Curcumin, a powerful antioxi-dant, has been found to enhance the production of anti-oxidant enzymes and neutralize free radicals [96]. Acutesepsis-induced lung damage in rats is accompanied by anincreaseintheactivityofsuperoxidasedismutase(SOD)andrecovery of the levels of xanthine oxidase (XO) dant, anti-SARS-CoV-2, and perhaps immune-enhancing properties. Tere is a possibility that curcumin could playa role in the prevention and control of COVID-19. 2.6. Honey. For many years, honey has been used for me- dicinal purposes such as wound healing, antimicrobial, antiviral, immune booster, anti-infammatory, antifungal,antioxidant, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective,antimutagenic,andantitumoral[98].Honeyhasbeenshownto cure various viral respiratory disorders, like pneumonia,throat infection, and bronchitis; thus, it might relievepneumonia caused by coronavirus [99]. Hydrogen peroxide(H 2O2) is an antibacterial component found in honey [31]. Combining honey with some nutrients such as cinnamon,garlic, and ginger increases its antimicrobial and immunebooster efect [100]. As abovementioned, honey possessesantiviral activities that can act against some viruses such asHIV, result of low pH, osmotic efect, andsome natural compounds such as lysozyme, favonoids,hydrogen peroxide, and phenolic acids [98]. Terearetwofundamentalwaysthathoneycanshowits antiviralefect.Onewayisthenitricoxide(NO)pathwayby raising NO as a principal cellular neurotransmitter in multiple physiological procedures [101]. Te second wayalso has two parts. First, it is attributed to honey's fatty acid10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HAD). In this way, it hasbeen suggested that honey acts by eradicating the virus byleukocyte adhesion to the virus via 10-HAD induction.Second, strength in antiviral immunity is due to promotingthematurationofdendriticcells(DCs)derivedfromhumanmonocytes and the capability of T helper cell type-1 (T1)polarization by 10-HAD [32]. Medicinal efects rutin) through the critical en-zyme,3-chymotrypsin-likecysteineprotease(3C-likepro)ofSARS-CoV inhibition, as a promising target in coronavi-ruses [103]. A potential action of honey against 3C-like proof SARS-CoV-2 is attributed to six compounds, 3-phenyllactic presentsmore efcacies with antibiotics. Honey the in-nate immune system and stimulates the adaptive immunesystem, especially in upper respiratory tract infections, withits polyphenolic compounds [34]. Some studies have sug-gestedthatacomponentof honeycalledmethylglyoxal mayhave an antimicrobial activity, but this has not beenexplained in detail [104]. In honey, the richest phenolic acids are vanillic acid, p- hydroxybenzoic acid, cafeic acid, honey and propolis, onCOVID-19 RdRp and Mpro [107]. Among them, quercetinis the most active one on the Mpro in micromolar doses. Ithas been proven against 3CLpro and PL proof SARS-CoV and respiratory syn- drome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [108]. As an immune booster, honey can be used as a sup- portive treatment for patients infected with novel corona- virusandaspreventivewaysinhealthypeople[109].Hence,taken from the reports, three efects from honey, inducinglymphocyte proliferation and activation, inhibiting theproduction of proinfammatory cytokines, and inducingautophagy machinery, have been expected. It should benotedthatlymphocytopeniaisoneoftheimmuneproblemscaused by COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 causes excessive in-fammatory responses by fusing the membrane through the S protein and infecting T-lymphocytes. Tis process is at- tributed to COVID-19 mortality due to lymphocytopenia;nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate infected Tlymphocytes. 2.7. Nigella sativa. Nigella sativa is a tiny black seed taken from a fower in the Ranunculaceae family and utilized as a medicinal substance for many years for various diseases.Tis plant is commonly grown in the Middle East, Europe,andAsia.Itisalsoknownasblackcuminorblackseed[110].Antiviral, antibacterial, anti-infammatory, antidiarrheal,and antitussive properties and many other medicinal properties have been found in N. sativa. N. Sativa has also been an antioxidant, immunomodulatory, diuretic, tonic, and digestive stimulant [111]. It is efective againsta wide range of infectious and chronic noninfectious dis-eases dysentery[40,112].Itsantioxidantactivitymayhelpreducetheoxidativedamageoforganscausedbythevirus[113].Inaddition,someothercomponentssuchasminerals(sodium,potassium, iron, calcium, and phos-phorus) and vitamins (vitamin E, ribofavin, niacin, folic acid, pyridoxine, and thiamine), essential amino acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats can be found in N. sativa [35, 114]. N. sativa can be used as an adjuvant in patients infected with novel coronavirus at 40-80mg/kg/day doses as oil incombination with drugs used to treat coronavirus withoutany side efects to ameliorate patients [36]. Moreover, insome studies, it has been suggested that N. sativa shows not only antihistaminic results due to inhibiting the release ofhistamines and leukotrienes and blocking histamine re-ceptors but also represents an anti-infammatory activity by the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) [38, 40, 115]. Te immunomodulatory property of N. sativa is related to some of its bioactive compounds, which boostimmunity by increasing T lymphocytes and natural infammation and phytochemical screening[37]. Elevated serum interferon-gamma [117]. Ontheotherhand, N.sativapossessessomecomponents that bind to specifc andpathways such as A represent its protection activity [118]. N. sativa seeds contain a wide range of immune-stimulating, antibacterial,and anti-infammatory compounds, including unsaturatedfattyacids,saponins(melanin),fxedoilclasses,essentialoil,alkaloids,andproteins[119].Inaclinicaltrial,oral N.sativa oil in doses of up to 5g per day for 12weeks has shown saferesults [120]. Te inhibition property of SARS-CoV-2 is related to its active constituents, including -hederin and nigellidine [121]. A-hederin is a signifcant alkaloid that [122]. Nigellidinerepresents 2, N-terminus-protenase, nucleo-capsid, and 6LU7 [41]. Moreover, it in the seeds ofN. sativa [39]. In addition, other compounds such stearic acids, hydroxychloroquine [124].Tey may provide similar ionophore functions to enhanceZn entry to pneumocytes to boost host immune response (proliferation and activation of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and T and B cells as well as cytokine pro-duction by the immune cells) against SARS-CoV-2 bystopping the recombinant SARS-Co-RdRp activity by theinhibitionofelongationandtemplatebinding.Ontheotherhand, binding onthe pneumocytes [39]. SARS-CoV-2 may use human ACE2 as an attachment target to enter the host cell [41]. Te RdRp in these blackseeds might also stop the spread of the virus [116]. TepharmacologicalefectsofTQ,amajorbioactivecomponentofN. sativa, have been suggested in some studies for nu- merousdisorderssuchasrespiratorydistresses[40].Kinases,heat shock proteins, and oxidorectases are targets of thy-moquinone 4-dione) and had combined afnity ACE2,and heat shock protein A5 active sites It has beenreported that thymoquinone can show chemosensitizer andapoptotic activity through the downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, in which an overexpression of PI3K/Akt/mTORcanbeseeninpatientsinfectedwithSARS-CoV-2 [126]. used prophylactically, as mentioned in Ayurvedic/Unanimedicine [128]. Tymohydroquinone is one of the com-ponents of the black seed which can show diferent prop-erties such as regulation of blood pressure, negativeregulation of cell death, oxidative stress, regulation of im-mune response, and positive regulation of kinase activity[110]. spike protein, andhuman ACE2 [129]. Te anti-infammatory activity sativa is due to the inhibition of oxidative products of arachidonic acid calledthromboxane B2, and through blocking theactivity of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes [36].Tus, is essential to manage the overexpression of8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinecytokinesinpatientsinfectedwithSARS-CoV-2.Increasingthe expressionofCD-Tcellsandinterferon(INF)gammabyblackseed oil has been demonstrated to reduce certain viral loads insome studies [112]. N. sativa presents benefcial and carvacrol in human preadipocytes and pretreatment of some retinal epithelial cells may be damaged by oxidative stresses [130]. Te anticoagulant activity of thymoquinone of N. sativa has been tested, and it has been shown that this ingredientmodifes cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) and tempo-rarilyprolongsthecoagulationtimeofthrombintime(TT),prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thrombo-plastin time (aPTT) in vitro.

Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi). As a family member, Lam- iaceae is known as holy basil or tulsi. Ocimum sanctum is a fragrant perennial plant. Scientifc research defnes its benefcial efects. Essential oils like eugenol, extracted fromtulsi leaves, have been shown to have antiviral properties[137].O. sanctum is a medicinal herb possesses dihy-drodieuginol B and tulsinol A, B, C, D, E, F, and G that caninhibit the main protease and papain-like protease of SARScoronavirus [47]. Like other medicinal O. possesses phytochemicals diagnosed by molecular docking,whichcanbindwithM proofnovelcoronavirus.SARS-CoV- 2 Mprocan be considered a promising target in virus rep- lication inhibition. Mprois the main stimulator in viruses to produce functional proteins such as endoribonuclease,exoribonuclease,and RNApolymerase, whichimpedehostsintrinsic immune system function [46]. Tulsi can be usedsafely against SARS-CoV-2 since it has no side efects. 2.9. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Baicalein is a medic- inal plant time,a virus-induced storm is the leading cause ofconsequences such as infammation, septic shock, and multipleorganfailure[139].Baicalinhadbeenconfrmedto inhibit SARS-CoVin vitro, and scutellarin could interactwith ACE2. Molecular docking and network pharmacologyare the mainstays of pharmacological research for thetreatmentofCOVID-19[140].ACE2and2019-nCoV-Mprobind to baicalein and oroxylin A, indicating that they maydirectly afect the virus and host cells. Hence, this preventsvirus proliferation, avoids the body's immunity, and blocksvirusattacks.Naringeninandbeta-sitosterolcanregulatetheexpression of critical genes (CCL2, IL-1, and IL-6) in thetreatment Anti-infammatory actions expected be the of SB compounds' the COVID-19 study.

Human of thisold medication are among its many therapeutic properties[150]. Recent studies have found alliin, allyl thiosulfnate, and s-allyl cysteine (SAC) interesting possibilities for boosting the immune system. [151]. Natural killer cells (NKcells),macrophages,lymphocytes,eosinophils,anddendriticcells (DCs) are among the most impressive immune systemboosters thanks to garlic's ability to modulate andmacrophage activation [152]. After short-term treatmentwith the garlic extract, there are considerable increases in Tlymphocytes, notably CD4+ and CD8+T cells [153]. Pa-tients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been found to haveEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9decreased levels of these immunological markers, which have been linked to death in nearly all cases [153-155]. Garlic's antiviral and immunomodulatory properties have been demonstrated in clinical trials for viral cold andfu, acute respiratory viral infections, and recalcitrantmultiple common warts (RMCWs) [156]. In addition, preclinical data showed that garlic and its organosulfur compounds(OSCs)haveapotentialantiviralactivityagainstvarious human, animal, and plant pathogenic viruses byblocking viral entry into the host cells, inhibiting viral RNApolymerase, reverse transcriptase, DNA synthesis, andtranscription of the immediate-early the ERK/mitogen protease activity [157]. 3.Future Perspectives Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can hardly be treated with synthetic medications; thus, herbal remedies that possess important properties such as anti-infammatory,antiviral, antioxidant, and similar have emerged as a viablealternative. Plant-based medicines that have been in-vestigated for safety and efcacy and are widely available topatients due to the worldwide burden of COVID-19 can beon the frontlines of combating the ongoing tragedy causedby COVID-19. To employ bioactive secondary metabolitesas medication, the issues of solubility, stability, and bio-availability must be addressed [158, 159]. For this purpose,the most efective medicinal plants were investigated to achieve the desired results and appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. But besides all these, a diferent way tolearnaboutthepotencyofthesesecond-metabolitesistouseartifcial intelligence techniques like molecular dockingstudies, toxicology analyses, and pharmaceutical in-vestigations[114].However,themutationsthatoccurinthetargetsshouldbeconsidered.Newmedicineresearchtacticsbased on plant extracts are urgently needed to protecthumans on our planet against pandemics like COVID-19,both now and in the future. Indeed, using herbs with highefciencysuchasgarlic, Zingiber,andcurcumawillledusto develop more efcient antiviral therapies based on theirefective components. 4.Conclusion Medicinalplantscanoferaviableplatformforsearchingformedication prospects to be tested against COVID-19. Tesecondary metabolism of several plants functions as a trea-sure of phytochemicals, which have shown potential in thecombat against human viruses. Tese herbal medicines might have the capabilities to control the synthesis and release of proinfammatory cytokines, interfere with thevirus's development in host cells, and alter some RAA-related molecular pathways. Medicinal plants might bebenefcialastreatmentstoeliminateCOVID-19.Hence,itisnot recommended for patients to use supplements con-tainingoneofthesecompoundstopreventCOVID-19ortohealthediseasewithoutparticularadviceorunderthedirectguidance of a medical professional. A suggestion for theclinician is that the management of these medicinal plantsmust be ofered carefully to the patients, even if they arehealthy. Tere has been a lot of contradicting informationregarding these plants. Consequently, there is a risk thatthese therapies are related to the induction of undesirablesideefects.Furthermore,preclinicalandclinicaltrialtestsofthese herbal agents for COVID-19 have not been done, so more research is required.
