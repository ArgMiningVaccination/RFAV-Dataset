ERIC ANTHONY NEPUTE , individually, and as Owner of Quickwork LLC ; and QUICKWORK LLC , a limited liability company, also d/b/a WELLNESS WARRIOR, Defendants. Case No.: ____________ COMPLAINT FOR CIVIL PENALTIES, PERMANENT INJUNCTION, AND OTHER RELIEF Plaintiff, the United States of America, acting upon notification and authorization to the Attorney General by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), pursuant to Section 16(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 56(a)(1), for its Complaint alleges: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. Defendants sell nutritional supplements containing V itamin D and z inc, among other products. Recently, Defendants have been advertising their Vitamin D and zinc products \u2014 including \"Wellness Warrior Vita D\", \"Wellness Warrior Zinc\", and others \u2014on social media and the internet as drugs capable of treat ing, or prevent ing COVID -19. Defendants even claim that their products are more effective than the available COVID -19 vaccines. Defendants lack valid factual or scientific bases for these claims , which are frequently accompanied by equally unsupported assertions regarding th e applicable science. In short, Defendants are selling their Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. #: 1 Filed: 04/15/21 Page: 1 of 27 PageID #: 12 products by disseminating misinformation, exploiting fears in the midst of a pandemic , and posing a significant risk to public health and safety. 2. Although the government has notified Defendants that their deceptive advertising and misrepresentations violate the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), as well as the COVID -19 Consumer Protection Act that was enacted in December 2020, Defendants have refused to stop. The United States therefore f iles this suit to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties, and other remedies in order to prevent the harms caused by Defendants' ongoing misrepresentations. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because it arises under the law of the United States.

Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. 27 PageID #: 23 Pursuant to Local Rule 2.07, venue is proper in the E astern D ivision because all defendants reside in this D ivision and because the claim for relief arose in the E astern D ivision. PARTIES 7. Plaintiff is the United States of America . 8. Defendant Eric Anthony Nepute (\"Nepute\") is a chiropractor and the owner of Defendant Quickwork LLC (\"Quickwork\") . He resides in this District and , in connection with the matters alleged herein, transacts or has transacted business in this District and throughout the United States. Nepute is also the owner of Nepute Wellness Center , which is located in St. Louis , Missouri . Until February 2021, Nepute maintained a Facebook page, www.facebook.com/ drericnepute, which designate d him as a \"public figure\" and include d a \"verified badge' indicating that Facebook has confirmed that the page belongs to him . From at least 2015 until February 2021, he frequently posted videos on his Facebook page that featured him talking about various health and wellness topics. 9. Quickwork, formed by Nepute i n January 2020, is a Missouri limited liability company w ith its principal office or place of business at 1 Firs t Missouri Center, Suite 214, St. Louis, Missouri 63141. In June 2020, Quickwork began doing business under the trade name \"Wellness Warrior. \" Wellness Warrior maintains a Facebook page, www.facebook.com/Wellnesswarrior.club, and several additional websites through which interested customers can obtain Wellness Warrior products , including but not #: 34 teamwarrior.com, and neputewellnesscenter.com. Defendants may also maintain additional websites and may have previously maintain ed other websites that are now defunct . 10. Both Nepute and Quickwork ha ve transacted business in this District and throughout the United States. Since its formation , Quickwork has advertised, marketed, distributed, or sold products containing V itamin D and zinc , including Wellness Warrior Vita D , Wellness Warrior Zinc , Wellness Warrior Immune Pack, Wellness Warrior Boost Pack, and Wellness Warrior Kids' Multivitamin ( together, the \"Wellness Warrior Products\") to consumers throughout the United States. Nepute has formulated, directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices set forth in this complaint , including the advertising, marketing, distribution , and sale of Wellness Warrior Products .

Defendants Use Misrepresentations to Advertise Their Vitamin D and Zinc Products 18. In early April 2020, Defendants began advertising and selling Wellness Warrior Products to the public . 19. No later than May 2020, Defendant s began to advertise Wellness Warrior Products as protect ing against, prevent ing, or treat ing COVID -19. Such advertising has consisted mainly of lengthy videos featuring monologues by Nepute and posted on Nepute's public figure Facebook page or the Wellness Warrior Facebook page, both of which were available to the public. Both of the Facebook pages and videos included hyperlinks that consumers could click on to visit one of Defendants' many websites and buy Wellness Warrior P roducts. Nepute's Facebook page also featured an \"offers\" section promising free bottles of Vitamin D and z inc. 20. Defendants prepared dozens of videos that had an outsized impact , because they amplified their reach by posting and reposting them hundreds of times on N epute's and the Wellness Warrior Facebook pages, as well as on the multiple Wellness Warrior websites. For example, an August 5, 2020 video, originally posted with the title \"Eric Nepute's Video\", was reposted on his various websites no fewer than 59 and possibly as many as 176 time s. Defendant s often post ed videos multiple times a day, and some of the posts play ed the same video two to six consecutive times. Collectively, Defendants' marketing videos have been viewed millions of times. 21. In February 2021, Facebook removed Nepute's public figure Facebook page from its website. In response, on February 19, 2021, Nepute created a new Facebook page, Common Sense Health Nation , https://www.facebook.com/commonsensehealthnation/ . The Common Sense Health Nation page is also publicly availab le and includes links to Wellness Warrior websites where consumers can buy Wellness Warrior P roducts. Nepute has reposted to the Case: 4:21-cv-00437 04/15/21 Page: 6 of 27 PageID #: 67 Common Sense Health Nation Facebook page videos that previously appeared on his public figure Facebook page. He has also continued to post lengthy videos advertising his products. 22. In March 2021, Defendants created a new website, Common Sense Health Live, https://www.commonsensehealth.live/ . The Common Sense Health Live website is publicly available to anyone who creates an account , which requires only a name and an email address. It includes links to Wellness Warrior websites where consumers can buy Wellness Warrior Products. Nepute has described the Common Sense Health Live website as \"like Facebook, except for the censorship.\" The Common Sense Health Facebook page includes a link to the Common Sense Health Live website . 23. Defendants ha ve also market ed Vitamin D and z inc through posts on Nepute's Facebook page, the Wellness W arrior Facebook page , the Common Sense Health Nation Facebook page, the Common Sense Health Live website , and email advertisements sent to consumers who have purchased Wellness Warrior -branded p roducts. 24. Starting no later than June 2 020, Defendants began advertising a protocol that customers should follow in order to protect against, prevent, or treat COVID -19. This protocol, which has varied over time, advises consumers to take, on a daily basis, substantial quantities of emulsified Vitamin D3 (\"Vitamin D\") and zinc, which are found in the Wellness Warrior Products . A. Vitamin D: The Truth v. Defendants' Misrepresentations 25. Wellness Warrior Vita D is an ingestible product sold in softgel capsule form. Each softgel of Wellness Warrior Vita D contains 5,000 I U Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and unspecified amounts of \"[o]rganic, extra virgin olive oil and softgel (bovine gelatin, vegetable glycerin, and purified water).\" The Wellness Warrior Vita D product label directs users \"Take Case: 4:21-cv-00437 PageID #: 78 one softgel daily, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.\" Wellness Warrior Kids' Multivitamin also contains Vitamin D. No Studies Prove That Vitamin D Prevents or Treats COVID -19 26. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that Vit amin D protects against, treats, or prevents COVID -19. 27. There are no published studies that prove that Vitamin D protects against, treats, or prevents COVID -19. The few completed randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of Vitamin D in treat ing or prevent ing COVID -19 either (i) showed no benefits to patients taking Vitamin D; or (ii) had flawed study designs and failed to conform to FDA guidelines for scientific studies investigating the efficacy of treatments for COVID -19. 28. Defendants have made numerous claim s that explicitly or implicitly state that daily doses of Vitamin D are effective in treating or preventing COVID -19. For example: a. Vitamin D protects people from COVID -19: \"So what can we do? You got to protect yourself and protect the others [from COVID -19]. . . . How do we do that? Number one, we got to take the right vitamins . . . I talked about V itamin D. It's so important to do that. Go on that link below, click it . . . . But get some D3 .\" Ex. A 1 at 21:11- 23:4. b. Vitamin D prevents COVID -19: \"I'm going to tell you something that you need to be doing at home from a preventative standpoint . . . . [It's] very, very, as in dog, D3.\" Ex. B at 6:12- 9:9. 1 Exhibits are identified in the Appendix to . Case: 4:21-cv-00437 will prevent [CO VID-19] from infecting your body.\" Ex. C at 11:14- 18. d. A daily dose of Vitamin D can effectively serve as a \"treatment for COVID -19\" by \"boosting\" the immune system. Ex. D at 11:2- 11:17. e. A \"high -dose\" of Vitamin D would help to turn COVID -19 into a \"mild illness.\" Ex. E at 14:14- 15:1. f. \"Vitamin D3 is the only chemical that's out there and that's shown to reduce the spread . . . to minimize the chances of getting infected .\" Ex. F at 16:1- 4. g. \"Vitamin D blocks the virus . That's a fact. Nobody can argue that.\" Ex. F at 16:21- 22. 29. Defendants lacked any reasonable bases for the foregoing statements, as well as many other similar statements they have made. 30. Defendants have also made deceptive statements regarding the results of certain scientific studies to claim that Vitamin D was an effective preventative or treatment for COVID - 19. 31. Again , there are no randomized clinical trials that establish increased V itamin D supplementation cause positive health outcomes in connection with COVID -19. Although t here are observational studies that have explored correlation s between low V itamin D levels and an elevated risk of infection or severe illness from the corona virus , such observational studies are not designed, and cannot be used, to prove causation, i.e., to establish that Vitamin D supplementation cause positive health outcomes in connection with COVID -19. Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. 32. Defendants ignore these studi es' conclusions and limitations and instead rely on them for the basis for specific, deceptive claims about the quantitative efficacy of Vitamin D in treating and/or preventing COVID -19. For example , Nepute made the following statements : a. \"Journal of Nature Magazine 2020, in April and May, showed that if you have the adequate amounts of V itamin D3 in your system, then you have a 77 percent less chance of getting infected in the first place. Vitamin D3 equals 77 percent less chance of getting infected in the first place.\" Ex. G at 13:23- 14:5. Holick found . that people who have enough [ V]itamin D are 54 percent less likely to catch coronavirus in the first place.\" Ex. H . c. According to the work performed by Dr. Holick, \" COVID -19 Patients who get enough [ V]itamin D are 52% less likely to die \" and \"are at a 52 percent lower risk of dying of COVID -19 than people who are deficient .\" Ex. H . d. \"[Vitamin ] D3 has shown, in many studies, to cut the infection rate by sometimes up to 52 percent.\" Ex. E at 10:15- 10:17. 33. In fact, the cited studies do not support Defendants' claims. Both of Dr. Holick's studies explored correlations between low Vitamin D levels and adverse COVID -19 outcomes . One stud y concluded only that its findings \"provide further rationale to explore \" the putative therapeutic benefit of Vitamin D and acknowledged that the implications could be significant only \"[i]f controlled trials find this relationship to be causative\" \u2014i.e. , only if controlled trials found that low Vitamin D levels caused adverse COVID -19 outcom es. Dr. Holick's other study observed that , because of the study design, the authors could not \"explain the ca use and effect relationship of V itamin D sufficiency and the reduced risk of severity from a COVID -19 Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. PageID #: 1011 infection ,\" concluding that \" large -scale studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) \" were necessary to evaluate any interaction between them. 34. To support the claim that people with adequate Vitamin D have a 77 percent less chance of getting infected in the first place, Defendants may be rel ying on a September 2020 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) . To the extent that Defendants are relying on this study, they are mischaracterizing its results . This study expressly stated that: \"S ince [ V]itamin D deficiency may be increased by many factors that could be associated with COVID -19 risk, including age, obesity, diabetes, and chronic illness more generally, observed associations of [ V]itamin D with outcomes in almost any observational study may fail to accurately reflect any potential causal effects of [ V]itamin D on outcomes .\" Defendants Have No Bases for Their Claim That Vitamin D Prevents or Treats COVID -19 Through Particular Biological Mechanisms 35. In addition to their claims regarding Vitamin D's efficacy, Defendants have, without any reasonable bases, made mis representations about the specific biological mechanisms through which Vitamin D supposedly helps prevent or treat COVID -19. 36. SARS -CoV -2, the virus that causes COVID -19, infiltrates the cells by using a \"spike protein\" on the surface of its coat to bind to the \"ACE2 receptor\", a protein that naturally appears on the walls of human cells. This binding allows the virus's genetic material (its RNA) to infiltrate the cell, hijack its machinery, and replicate itself. If the virus cannot bind to the ACE2 receptor, however, it cannot invade the cell, cannot replicate, and cannot cause harm. In fact, t he recently approved vaccines work by teaching the body's immune system to recognize the spike protein as a foreign invader and a ct to it. Case: 4:21-cv-00437 PageID #: 1112 37. There are no published scientific studies establishing that Vitamin D interferes with the SARS -CoV -2 virus's ability to bind with the ACE2 receptor when Vitamin D is intro duced into the human body. 38. Nonetheless, w ithout any competent and reliable scientif ic evidence, Defendants have claimed , for example , that Vitamin D \"blocks the spike protein from the ACE -2 receptor,\" thereby preventing people from \"get[ting] infected in the first place.\" Ex. G at 24:20- 22. Defendants have further claimed that, t hrough this mechanism, Vitamin D purportedly \"stops the virus from attaching\" to human cells . Ex. G at 17:23- 18:2. 39. Defendants have also asserted that Vitamin D prevents \"cytokine storms,\" which may be provoked in certain patients by t he virus that causes COVID -19. A cytokine storm is an overactive, harm -causing response by the human immune system to the infection. Specifically, when the body is infected, it releases cytokines to signal the immune system to begin its defense work. Excessive quantities of cytokines, however, can cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue, resulting in severe injury or death. 40. There are no published scientific studies demonstrati ng that Vitamin D can prevent a cytokine storm i n COVID -19 patients . 41. Again, without any competent and reliable scientific evidence, Defendants have claimed that Vitamin D can prevent cytokine storms from occurring, thereby reducing the severity of a COVID -19 infection: \"If you have enough [ V]itamin D3 in your system, you don't have a cytokine storm.\" Ex. G at 35:15- 25. Defendants Deceptively Imply That Scientific Research Supports Their Claims 42. To convey the impression that there is scientific evidence to support their deceptive claims, Defendants p repared and publicly posted on one of the Wellness Warrior Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. #: a \"Research Page\" that contained hyperlinks to some of their videos, as well as various articles discussing Vitamin D and COVID -19. Th is Research P age linked to retrospective observational studies, news articles, blog posts, and PowerPoint presentations, none of which constituted competent or reliable scientific evidence that Vitamin D treats or prevents COVID -19. 43. Upon information and belief, Defendants actually knew , or had knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances , that the materials cited on the Research Page did not demonstrate that Vitamin D protects against, treats, or prevents COVID -19. B. Zinc: The Truth v. Defendants' Misrepresentations 44. Wellness Warrior Zinc is an ingestible product sold in t ablet form. Each tablet contains 25 milligrams of zinc (as zinc gluconate) and unspecified amounts of microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, and croscarmellose sodium. The Wellness Warr ior Zinc product label directs users to \"Take one tablet daily, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.\" Wellness Warrior Kids' Multivitamin, Wellness Warrior Boost Pack, and Wellness Warrior Immune Pack also contain zinc. No Studies Prove That Zinc Prevents or Treats COVID -19 45. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that z inc protects against, treats, or prevents COVID -19. There are no published studies that prove that z inc protects against, treats, or prevents COVID -19. In fact, the sole completed randomized clinical trial investigating the efficacy of zinc as a preventative or treatment for COVID -19 found no therapeutic benefit. Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. PageID #: 1314 46. Notwithstanding this absence of supporting scientific evidence, Defendants have disseminated advertisements representing that zinc treats or prevents COVID -19. Examples of Defendants' statements include: a. Zinc is an effective treatment for COVID -19 because it \"doesn't allow the virus to continue to proliferate\" inside the body and that it \"stops the cells from regenerating viruses,\" which in turns \"stops viral proliferation.\" Ex. F at 17:4- 5; Ex. D at 11:24- 12:19; Ex. E at 9:2 -9:12. b. Zinc should be taken as a prophylactic: \"We should be preventatively loading up on zinc at c. \"Tak[ing] z inc every day\" serves as a treatment for COVID -19 by \"boosting the immune system.\" . . . say[s] boosting the immune system is the answer. Y ou're damn right it is . . . I'm going to tell you how and I'm going to give you a solution . . . buy a damn bottle of zinc.\" Ex. D at 11:24- 12:19. 47. Although Defendants claim to have identified \"over fifteen\" studies relating to Zinc, they have not published a \"research page\" analogous to the page publis hed relating to Vitamin D. T he government has been able to find only two studies identified by Defendants as support for their claims . Neither study even relates to COVID -19, much less establishes that zinc treats or prevents COVID -19: one is an in vitro (petri dish) study that was not conducted on the virus that causes COVID -19, and the other is a discussion of observational studies done investigating the relationship between zinc and pneumonia , not COVID -19. Indeed, both studies were conducted years befo re the pandemic began. Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. PageID #: 1415 48. Nonetheless, Defendants deceptively claim that the in vitro study shows precisely how zinc purportedly prevents COVID -19: An \" [i]ncrease in intercellular zinc concentrations . . . can effectively impair the replication of . . . SARS coronavirus. . . . SARS CoV -2 is what this is.\" Ex. I at 14:14- 14:22. C. The Vaccines : The Truth v. Defendants' Misrepresentations 49. To induce customers to purcha se their V itamin D and zinc products , Defendants have also disseminated advertisements that claim , without any reasonable basis, that Wellness Warrior P roducts were more effective at preventing or treating COVID -19 than the available vaccines or other available treatments . 50. It is well known that several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration because they have been proven effective to prevent infection by COVID -19 and to reduce the severity of such infections. These vaccines received emergency use authorization only after their sponsors conducted large, double -blind, randomized clinical trials that demonstrated their efficacy. 51. Unlike the rigorous clinical trial process that led to these vaccines , no such studies have been performed for Vitamin D and z inc, either administered independently or administered together. There is no competent and reliable scientific evid ence showing that Vitamin D or z inc, administered independently or in combination, i s a better option for prevention of treatment of COVID -19 than the available vaccines. 52. However, Defendants have explicitly and implicitly represented that Vitamin D and zinc provide equal or better protection against COVID -19 than do currently available vaccines . Case: 4:21-cv-00437 PageID #: 53. For example, Defendants have claimed that \"Vitamin D3 is the only chemical that's out there and that's shown to reduce the spread\" of COVID -19. Ex. F at 16:1- 4. 54. According to Defendants , \"[t]here hasn't been one damn thing else that's shown the benefits of . . . preventing COVID -19 except for [ V]itamin D3.\" Ex. C at 10:9- 13. 55. Defendants have also advertised , without a reasonable basis, that \"vaccines do not stop the spread of the virus.\" Ex. G at 13:13- 15. 56. Defendants also assert that: \"it's been proven by NIH, World Health Organization, CDC, the list goes on and on, that \"vaccines do not stop the spread of the virus.\" Ex. G at 13:13- 15. According to Defendants , \"the NIH, the World Health Organization, the CDC . . . [have] clearly said this vaccine is not going to stop the spread of infection. Ex. J at 12:1- 18. However, t he National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\"), the World Health Organization (\"WHO\"), the Federal Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") , and the Surgeon General have never stated, much less proven, that vaccines do not stop the spread of COVID -19. 57. Defendants have further stated , without any reasonable basis, that Nepute's protocol, including Vitamin D and z inc, \"actually works better than . . . any vaccine,\" and, therefore, customers did not \"really need a vaccine.\" Ex. F at 17:6- 8. 58. Defendants have provided no scientific proof or studies to support these claims, just as they have provided no scientific proof or studies to back up their advertising about the efficacy of Vitamin D and z inc for preventing and treating COVID -19. II. Defendants' Deceptive Marketing Has Already Misled Reasonable Consumers A. Defendants Have Been Selling Their Vitamin D and Zinc Products for Months 59. Each bottle of Wellness Warrior Vita D contains 30 softgels, which Defendants have sold for $24.95 per bottle plus $9.95 shipping and handling. Defendants also have offered Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. #: PageID #: 1617 several Vitamin D subscription plans, in most instances including one free bottle of Vitamin D with subscription enrollment. 60. Defendants first featured Vitamin D in an April 2020 vi deo on the Nepute Facebook page and began promoting their free Vitamin D bottle offer in July 2020, again through the Nepute Facebook page videos. 61. Each bottle of Wellness Warrior Zinc contains 60 tablets. Defendants have advertised an offer for a free bottle of z inc without a subscription and charge consumers $9.95 for shipping and handling. They also have advertised various subscription plans for z inc, which do not include a free bottle of the product. Subscription plans start at $24 per month for one bottle of z inc. 62. Defendants' advertising has proven to be popular. Together, the Wellness Warrior and Common Sense Health Nation Facebook pages have over 100,000 followers. 63. Upon information and belief, Defendants have earned a substantial amount of money from selling these and other Wellness Warrior Products . B. Consumers Believe Defendants' Deceptive Advertising 64. Dozens of posts on Defendants' own Facebook pages show that consumers have been buying Defendants' Vitamin D and zinc products with the belief that they prevent COVID - 19 better than available vaccines. Nepute's videos have generated millions of consumer views. Examples of recent customer comments on the Wellness Warrior Facebook page, http://www.facebook.com/Wellnesswarrior.club/ , include: a. February 27, 2021 at 2:44 am, K.F. : \"Been taking Wellness Warrior duo at least 7 months. No sickness here and living life without fear. Thank you so much Dr. Eric. Keep getting the truth out.\" Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. . . . I take 25 mg of zinc and upped that to 50 mg a day as my husband got covid and I got him to take it as well. But he didn't take it before he got sick. I never got sick living in the same house and breathing the same air. . . . NO gene therapy/fake vaccine.\" at 1:47 pm, C.J.V. : \"Just Ordered min e today. Dr. Eric thank you so much. I have been following you for a while and really appreciate all you do to inform us all.\" C. Defendants' Deceptive Health Claims About Their Products are Material 65. Defendants deceptively advertise their Vitamin D and z inc products as treating or preventing COVID -19, and as superior to the current vaccines. 66. Such baseless claims of health benefits are material because, as indicated by the sample comments above, consumers believe Defendants' claims, and appear to be taki ng Defendants' products in lieu of other measures to prevent COVID -19, such as getting vaccinated, social distancing, and wearing a mask. III. Defendants' Ongoing Conduct Threatens Imminent Harm to Consumers 67. Defendants' advertising of their Vitamin D and zinc products pose significant risks to consumers who may believe or rely on these misrepresentations and deceptive claims. As noted above, Nepute's videos alone have been viewed millions of times, and Defendants amplify their deceptive advertising by pos ting videos and comments on multiple websites. 68. Ingesting massive amounts of Vitamin D and zinc, rather than foregoing the social distancing, masks, and vaccination recommended by public health experts, places consumers who rely on Defendants' claims at ris k of contracting COVID -19. Case: 4:21-cv-00437 Doc. 27 PageID #: 1819 IV. Defendants Refuse To Cease Their Deceptive Advertising Despite Being on Notice 69. In May 2020, FTC staff sent Defendant Nepute a letter warning that his COVID - 19 efficacy claims for another Vitamin C -based product were unsubstantiated and must cease. Ex. K . The warning letter also advised him to review claims for all his other products and to cease any claims not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.
