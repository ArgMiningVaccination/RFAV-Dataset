They were very attentive and ensured that all my needs were being taken care of and that I would enjoy the retreat. They care about the well-being of their clients and wants them to have a great experience which is greatly appreciated. - Peaceful Ayurveda experience in MadeiraRating: 5.0 / 5 Sandra at Longevity Escapes organised a wonderful detox holiday for me in Madeira. After an initial free consultation I was able to confirm that this was the ideal choice for my needs and I felt very comfortable that it would meet my expectations, as the experience and location in Madeira were carefully hand-picked. It was also helpful to have a nutritional consultation before I left in order to discuss my current situation and learn helpful information on what improvements can be made. The booking process was very simple, arrangements were made for the Airport pickup and I arrived at the hotel to an enticing treatment schedule. My room at Alpino Atlantico was very spacious and had a balcony less than a stone's throw from the sea. The treatments, facilities and food were first class - the yoga and chill out room had panoramic views of the sea and there was nothing better than to sink into the super comfy relaxation chairs, listen to the sounds of the sea and feel the detoxifying effects of the treatment oils sinking into the muscles. The hotel garden was equally a peaceful experience, lying on the outdoor beds breathing in the fresh air next to the tropical plants. The food was always an interesting experience to discover an array of unique and powerful flavours of the Ayurveda culture; I had 3 meals a day, all very nutritious and all very unique - it was filling yet the health benefits were obvious. Throughout the holiday I was able to learn a lot about the Ayurveda philosophy in terms of the cooking, yoga style and overall detox. The use of the neighbouring hotels were a big plus, allowing the use of Galo Resort with an infinity pool, a sauna with stunning glass overlooking the sea, and facilities built into the dark cliff edges making for a dramatic sight whilst sea swimming, there was also a substantial gym and pool facilities available for use. When I returned to the UK, I was able to go through a tailor made nutritional plan with detailed emails from Sandra, discuss the experience with her and how the principles can be incorporated into my routine. I will keep an eye on future offerings from Longevity and I love the idea that a lot of the stress and hassle of finding a suitable health based holiday is removed by taking this route - there are a number of 'yoga retreats' on the market, which from some experience can be a real gamble, I was looking for a relaxing and upmarket 'reset' and my expectations were exceeded. - WONDERFUL AYURVEDIC EXPERIENCERating: 5.0 / 5 The Galo Alpino Resort in Madeira is an authentic Ayurvedic experience, with wonderful daily oil massages that are individually tailored for you through an appointment with an Indian Ayurvedic trained doctor. The surroundings are lovely, overlooking the ocean with flowering gardens and lawn loungers to relax. Food is vegetarian with a touch of Indian flavours. Great place to de-stress. It is not cheap but for what you get and compare to other spa weeks it is a great deal. Also you get to use their other 5 star hotel properties about a 5-10 min walk away at no extra cost - pretty pools overlooking the ocean, "}
