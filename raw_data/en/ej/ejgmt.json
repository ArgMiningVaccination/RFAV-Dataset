Can the vaccine affect our spiritual side? Who knows how the vaccine can affect our psyche, and our ability to reach the realm of the gods. What if the goal isn't to kill us in the physical being, but instead to kill our higher self? You know, the ability to connect with the realm of the gods? I stumbled upon this phrase on a forum yesterday: \"The current vaccine is chakra deactivation\" -and this is what helped me connect the dots: this vaccine is first and foremost meant to sterilization our body, physically (Children of Men style) and spiritually. See the leaked video of the Pentagon in 2005 about how they conceived a vaccine that hindered the ability for religious extremist to connect with \"god\" (aka their spiritual side). Read this [thread on Stolen History ](https://archive.is/q55p5)in its entirety. If you are too lazy, here's the best part: \"I have heard from someone who notices that people vaccinated with the covid vaccine no longer react to some natural treatments: Anke Evertz says she has met vaccinated people whose bodies no longer respond to naturopathic and energetic work. What does that mean? Nothing more than that fine energies can no longer find access to the people. They are cut off from the light! The people, even without vaccination, are already so far degenerated and led astray that hardly any light comes through, or it needs specialists, such as healers, etc. to bring the system back into contact with the light. It needs mediators, bridges, which can still pass something through with great effort. After the vaccination obviously no longer works even this circuitous way. People can no longer be reached and are lost. For me, this also means that such people, when they go into nature, can no longer be touched by it, because the healing power of nature is also essentially energetic. And it further means that if they pray, for example, the subsequent help can hardly reach them or not at all. These are all things that are so devilish that most people simply do not want to or cannot admit it. Only from a certain vibration height, all this begins to lose influence. Unfortunately, however, most of us are probably still far away from it.\" We need to research and investigate into this direction. Ask spiritual people that got the vaccine if they can still meditate and connect with their higher self! We might be on something. "}
