However, the underlying molecular processes affecting immune response after vaccination remain poorly understood, while there is significant heterogeneity in the immune response among individuals. Metabolomics have often been used to provide a deeper understanding of immune cell responses, but in the context of COVID-19 vaccination such data are scarce. Mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics were used to provide insights based on the baseline metabolic profile and metabolic alterations induced after mRNA vaccination in paired blood plasma samples collected and analysed before the first and second vaccination and at 3 months post first dose. Based on the level of NAbs just before the second dose, two groups, \"low\" and \"high\" responders, were defined. Distinct plasma metabolic profiles were observed in relation to the level of immune response, highlighting the role of amino acid metabolism and the lipid profile as predictive markers of response to vaccination. Furthermore, levels of plasma ceramides along with certain amino acids could emerge as predictive biomarkers of response and severity of inflammation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-06", "cleaned_text": "Plasma Metabolomic Alterations Induced by COVID-19 Vaccination Reveal Putative Biomarkers Reflecting accessed on 12 February 2022). These numbers are increasing rapidly every day and have caused an unprecedented global health crisis. Vaccination is probably the most effective strategy to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Several vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent life-threatening COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) ( [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html), accessed on 12 February 2022). Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology has only recently become available for public use, even though scientists have been studying mRNA vaccines for decades [ [1](#B1-cells-11-01241)]. Currently the two approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines code the production of the \"spike\" protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter cells. This protein triggers the immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells [ [2](#B2-cells-11-01241)]. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two 21-day interval doses of mRNA vaccines are required in order to achieve immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the fact that the vaccine effectiveness declines, a third booster dose is also required in order to maintain the immunity. [3](#B3-cells-11-01241)]. It appears that the highest NAbs production reaches a maximum level 14 days after the second vaccination, with a slow decline in NAbs levels thereafter. In the same study, it was observed that the level of NAbs titers vary significantly from approximately 1 to 100% (median 53.8%) 21 days after the first shot and before the second vaccine dose. Among the factors that were shown to affect the immunization efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 with the BTN162b2 vaccine were age and gender; aged people were more likely to exhibit a reduced response, while female subjects had higher response [ [4](#B4-cells-11-01241)]. However, the underlying molecular processes that affect immune response after mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. The innate and adaptive immune response to vaccines, such as activation of immune cells and antibody formation, often require a metabolic reprogramming and can affect central metabolic processes [ [5](#B5-cells-11-01241)]. For this scope, use of metabolomics was deemed indispensable. Metabolomics\u2014the systematic analysis of small molecules (50 to 1500 Da) e.g., carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids produced by regulatory mechanisms and during cellular processes or from exogenous sources (e.g., diet and drugs)\u2014is a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, prediction of therapy response and investigation of the biochemical mechanisms concerning several human diseases, aiming to improve their diagnosis and prevention, and to design better therapeutic strategies [ [6](#B6-cells-11-01241), [7](#B7-cells-11-01241), [8](#B8-cells-11-01241), [9](#B9-cells-11-01241)]. The two most frequently used analytical techniques in metabolomics are mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [ [10](#B10-cells-11-01241)]. These techniques are complementary and each one brings both advantages and limitations [ [11](#B11-cells-11-01241)]. The combination of information from these complementary analytical platforms facilitates the detection and identification of metabolites that could not be discovered by a single technique thereof. [12](#B12-cells-11-01241)]. Thus, an LC-MS based metabolomics study showed perturbations in the amino acid and the kynurenine pathway in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, while these alterations also correlated with concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ [13](#B13-cells-11-01241)]. However, metabolomic studies associated with the immunity induced by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study in this field that highlighted the metabolic networks associated with the immune responses induced by the CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine against COVID-19, showing that metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and amino acid metabolism were associated with immunity [ [14](#B14-cells-11-01241)]. Nevertheless, there is still no evidence for the metabolic profiles associated with the novel mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plasma Samples 2.2. Chemicals and Reagents [Supplementary Materials S2 (Section S1.1)](#app1-cells-11-01241). 2.3. NAbs [Sections S1.2.1 and S1.2.2](#app1-cells-11-01241)for (Section S1.3.1)](#app1-cells-11-01241). [Supplementary Materials S2 S2 (Sections S1.4.1 and S1.4.2, respectively)](#app1-cells-11-01241). Detailed description of the \"SMolESY\" (Small Molecule Enhancement SpectroscopY) algorithm is provided in [ [15](#B15-cells-11-01241)]. 2.7. Study Approval 3. Results 3.1. Cohort Characteristics [Table 1](#cells-11-01241-t001). At Day 1, the NAbs were low for all participants as expected, while they reach a high level for all participants in the third month. Relatively high levels of NAbs (>30%) were observed in two participants at Day 1, putatively due to previous infection. However, the \"high responders\" group exhibits higher levels of NAbs (mean, median, 1st and 2nd quantiles) at all time points. Detailed NAbs measurements of all individuals are provided in [Table S1](#app1-cells-11-01241). 3.2. NMR Results 3.2.1. Metabolite Identification [Figure S1](#app1-cells-11-01241). 3.2.2. Correlation [Table 2](#cells-11-01241-t002)). [Figure 1](#cells-11-01241-f001)A(i,ii), blue dotted line). Detailed results of all the associated spectral bins at FDR 95%, along with assignment, correlation coefficients and p-values are provided in [Table S3](#app1-cells-11-01241). Other amino acids also showed a strong association with response but did not reach the level of statistical significance after correction for multiple hypothesis testing; a positive association was observed for glycine (p-value = 0.0012) and l-lysine (p-value = 8.9 \u00d7 104), while a negative association was observed for l-valine (p-value = 0.0013). [Figure S2](#app1-cells-11-01241)shows the strength and direction of effect of the annotated metabolites on the examined outcome (i.e., the response to vaccination). Glutamic acid showed an inverse association with glutamine levels S2](#app1-cells-11-01241), 1](#cells-11-01241-f001)B). All four metabolites were positively associated with the response to vaccination. l-phenylalanine and 3-MH levels were significantly increased in high responders compared to low responders at all time points, although for l-phenylalanine the difference was slightly decreased at 3 months. Moreover, although l-phenylalanine levels increased in both groups at Day 22, they declined at 3 months. l-Histidine and l-glutamine were significantly increased in the high responders compared to the low responders only at Day 1. l-histidine levels were also changing across the 3 time points in the high responders, while no significant alterations were observed in the low responders ( [Figure 1](#cells-11-01241-f001)C). On the other hand, l-glutamine levels were significantly increased in the low responders' group at Day 22 and 3 months compared to Day 1. 3.2.3. NMR Targeted Metabolite Quantification [Figure 2](#cells-11-01241-f002), the fold changes between high vs. low responders' group at Day 1 for each of the 400 traits are provided in a table format, where columns depict the numerator and rows the denominator of each ratio. Metabolites that emerged as significant included l-glutamine, glycine, acetic acid, l-histidine, and l-lysine. Significant ratios with amino acids in the numerator were increased in the high responders' group (FC > 1), in accordance with the findings from the untargeted correlation of NMR spectral bins with NAb levels. Four metabolic ratios of glutamine remained significant using FDR correction (p-value < 4.62 \u00d7 104), highlighting again the role of glutamine in immune responses. These ratios included increased glutamine/valine (p-value = 5.29 (p-value = 3.48 \u00d7 104) ratios in the high responders, indicating elevated glutamine levels in this group. Other metabolites that were significant as ratios with the aforementioned metabolites included d-glucose, l-lactic acid, dimethyl sulfone and l-tyrosine. The l-phenylalanine to l-valine ratio was also increased in the high responders. The respective metabolic alterations in Day 22 and 3 months are shown in [Figure S3](#app1-cells-11-01241). At 3 months, metabolic ratios of l-histidine, l-glutamine and l-lysine in the numerator were significantly increased in the high responders' group. At Day 22, l-histidine emerged again as an important metabolite (8 out of the 19 ratios of l-histidine were significant), while the strongest increase was observed for acetone. 3.2.4. Multivariate Analysis [Figure S4](#app1-cells-11-01241)showed a trend for discrimination between the two groups at Day 1 and to a lesser extent at Day 22, while this trend was not observed after three months. PCA offered an unbiased way to detect clusters of samples that share common variation. However, due to large inter-group variation observed in human studies (introduced by diverse lifestyle, dietary habits, smoking status, health and medication etc.), supervised methods were needed for optimized separations to be obtained. OPLS-DA analysis, which also eliminates the variation in the metabolomics data unrelated to the examined outcome, showed clear discrimination of low and high responders at all the examined time points, as shown in the cross-validated score plots ( [Figure 3](#cells-11-01241-f003)A). The quality parameters and prediction power at the three time points were the following: Day 1: R2Y (cum) = 0.663 and Q2 (cum) 0.384], Day [R2Y R2Y (cum) = [0.368 and Q2 (cum) = 0.104]. Interestingly, the obtained separation at Day 1 showed stronger statistical significance compared to the other time points, indicating that the response to the vaccine after the second dose could have already been predicted from the plasma metabolic fingerprint of the individual at Day 1. Poor quality parameters were obtained in the 3 Months model. Permutation testing (n = 100 permutations) provided in [Figure S5](#app1-cells-11-01241)(Permutations) also proved the validity of the Day 1 and Day 22 models. On the other hand, permutation testing on the 3 Months model indicates low quality parameters of the model, highlighting that the observed metabolic differences were diminished after the second dose. [Figure 3](#cells-11-01241-f003)B). Spectral variables on the upper right corner (blue) were considered significantly increased in the \"High responders\" group and on the lower left corner (red) in the \"Low responders\" group. Assignment of these spectral features showed increased levels of lipid chain signals in the \"Low responders\" group. The high responders exhibited increased levels of several amino acids, including l-histidine, l-tyrosine, l-alanine, and l-glutamine; l-glycine and succinic acid and l-lactic acid, creatinine, as well as increased intensities of certain fatty acyl lipid chains. Detailed information about the spectral variables contributing the most to separation and respective assignments are provided in [Table S4](#app1-cells-11-01241). Information on lipid annotation [Figure S6A](#app1-cells-11-01241)). The fatty acyl lipid chains and amino acids exhibited again the highest impact in the discrimination, based on the edges of the S-plot ( [Figure S6B](#app1-cells-11-01241)). On the other hand, d-glucose emerged as strongly significant in this analysis, highlighting a gender-dependent impact for this metabolite. The model was validated through permutation testing ( [Figure S6C](#app1-cells-11-01241)). Similar results were obtained in the male cohort ( [Figure S7](#app1-cells-11-01241)). However, quality parameters of the model were poorer, putatively due to smaller sample size. [Figure 4](#cells-11-01241-f004). Spectral annotation of lipid chemical moieties is provided in [Figure 4](#cells-11-01241-f004)A, as well as in [Table S5](#app1-cells-11-01241). Low and high responders exhibited differences corresponding to lipoproteins and lipid moiety signals at Day 1, as shown in the scores plot of the OPLS-DA analysis ( [Figure 4](#cells-11-01241-f004)B). Permutation testing using 100 random changes proved the validity of the model ( [Figure S8](#app1-cells-11-01241)). T-testing of these spectral features revealed statistical significance for 11 out of the 16 examined macromolecule regions ( [Figure 4](#cells-11-01241-f004)C). Information regarding signal assignment to each lipid class is provided in [Figure S9](#app1-cells-11-01241)and is based on statistical spectroscopy and previous literature [ [16](#B16-cells-11-01241)]. [Figure S9B](#app1-cells-11-01241)). On the other hand, signals from cholesterol (L1 and L11) (free or from cholesterol esters) were increased in the high responders. The signal of the choline head group from sphingomyelins, lysophosphocholines and phosphocholines was elevated in the high responder's group but was excluded from analysis due to overlapping with EDTA region ( [Figure S9A](#app1-cells-11-01241)). The peaks of the methyl (L2 L3), the methylene groups (L4 vs. L5) and methylene groups next to double bonds (L6 vs. L7) in the different fatty acyl chains and lipids could not be resolved. Statistical spectroscopy and direction of effect between low and high responders showed that peaks L2, L4 and L6 correlate with cholesterol levels (L1) and are increased in the high responders (resembling the HDL spectrum), while peaks L3, L5 and L7, respectively, correlate with glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols are increased in the low responders. ( [Figure S9](#app1-cells-11-01241)). Overall, these results indicate alterations in the lipid profile of high vs. low responders. However, the NMR peaks from different chains cannot be resolved and assigned to a distinct lipid or lipoprotein; thus, it is difficult to conclude to a single lipid biomarker. 3.3. LC-MS Results 3.3.1. Multivariate Analysis [Figure 5](#cells-11-01241-f005). Taking into consideration the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and the S-plot, 15 features were selected as the most influential variables. Further efforts for the identification of features that contribute to the differentiation of the data at Day 1 between \"low\" and \"high\" responders were undertaken. 3.3.2. Annotation of the Selected Variables [Table 3](#cells-11-01241-t003). The ROC curves of the annotated [Figure investigate the levels of those ceramides after the vaccination, further data analysis was undertaken. The levels of the four ceramides were identified in the LC-MS data after 3 months. Our study revealed that 22 days after the first dose, the levels of ceramides were again lower in high responders, presenting almost the same trend as at Day 1 ( [Figure 6](#cells-11-01241-f006)B). Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups 3 months after the vaccination, implying alteration of plasma ceramides levels over time. The p-values were equal to 0.216, 0.075, 0.685 and 0.104 and Cer (D18:1/25:0), respectively. [Figure 7](#cells-11-01241-f007). It should be noted that all the studied ceramides followed the same trend. 4. Discussion [17](#B17-cells-11-01241)], employing a similar approach concerning the instrumental arrangement. A small number of lipidomic studies have shown that alterations in the lipid metabolism, including upregulated levels of triglycerides [ [18](#B18-cells-11-01241), [19](#B19-cells-11-01241)] and ceramides [ [20](#B20-cells-11-01241)], also predispose to severe COVID-19 infection. However, in the current study we have focused on healthy, non-infected subjects who developed differential immune responses to vaccination. [8](#B8-cells-11-01241)]. In this study, we evaluated the plasma metabolic alterations and differences observed between high and low responders in 58 healthy individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed and response to vaccination was associated with alterations in the amino acid and lipid metabolism, highlighting putative biomarkers of response. Importantly, the results were consistent between the NMR and MS approaches. Interestingly, the strongest discrimination was observed on Day 1 (prior to first dose) compared to Day 22. This indicates that there are inherent metabolic differences in the plasma of low responders, already detected before the first dose of vaccination, that have the potential to predict immune response to the specific vaccine. After the 3-month period, when most of the participants had reached a high level of immune response, these differences tend to diminish, and no significant discrimination of individuals could be observed. This indicates that the identified metabolic differences may reflect the state of immune status of the individual, and the immune system's adaptation and response. Moreover, after vaccination an intense metabolism stage (e.g., generalized inflammation) is observed, which potentially equalizes their metabolic status. These results pave the way to more personalized vaccination protocols (i.e., people with disturbed amino acid and lipid metabolisms may be at higher need of response monitoring). 4.1. Amino Acid Metabolism in Immune Response [21](#B21-cells-11-01241)]. Several amino acids also pose a regulatory role in inflammation through the activation of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immune responses [ [22](#B22-cells-11-01241)]. [23](#B23-cells-11-01241)]. Involvement of l-histidine in immune response is also mediated through the production of histamine. In fact, free histidine can be catabolized to urocanic acid to form glutamate, and histidine observed in the plasma of high responders indicates an altered histidine metabolism and a decrease in histamine supply [ [24](#B24-cells-11-01241)]. A histamine-1 receptor antagonist, for COVID-19 prophylaxis [ [25](#B25-cells-11-01241)]. Histidine-rich glycoprotein, a protein dependent on the sufficiency of dietary histidine, is involved in immune responses [ [26](#B26-cells-11-01241)] and was elevated in survivors of severe COVID-19 infection [ [27](#B27-cells-11-01241)]. [28](#B28-cells-11-01241), [29](#B29-cells-11-01241)]. Increased serum l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine levels were observed in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls [ [13](#B13-cells-11-01241), [30](#B30-cells-11-01241)] and were altered along the different phases of disease [ [31](#B31-cells-11-01241)]. l-Phenylalanine was also proposed as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity [ [32](#B32-cells-11-01241)]. Increased phenylalanine levels in both severe COVID-19 and high response to vaccination may reflect the common immune signatures between vaccine immunization and SARS-CoV2 infection, including humoral immune response and complement activation. Moreover, vaccination with a viral vector-based vaccine against COVID-19 led to alterations in l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine metabolism [ [14](#B14-cells-11-01241)]. [33](#B33-cells-11-01241)], and to do so they use glutamine as a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of nucleotides and energy production [ [34](#B34-cells-11-01241)]. Glutamine also affects the production of cytokines by monocytes and macrophages [ [35](#B35-cells-11-01241)] and is essential for the production of antibodies. When subjected to an inflammatory stimulus, immune cells increase the utilization and uptake of glutamine. Due to the beneficial effects of glutamine in immune responses, interventions with glutamine supplements have been examined in relation to COVID-19. Glutamine supplementation reduced the hospitalization period of COVID-19 patients [ [36](#B36-cells-11-01241)], reduced serum levels of interleukin-1 , hs-CRP and tumor necrosis factor-, and increased appetite [ [37](#B37-cells-11-01241)]. Inclusion of glutamine as an adjuvant in the treatment of COVID-19 patients showed a putative synergistic effect on immune defense [ [37](#B37-cells-11-01241)]. Glutamine deficiency and increased hyaluran in the lungs have emerged as central metabolic characteristics that prompt COVID-19 patients to severe pathophysiology [ [38](#B38-cells-11-01241)]. Metabolomic studies have also shown a reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio in COVID-19 patients, indicating a metabolic rewiring of energy metabolism and systematic implications during infection that could be clinically valuable [ [17](#B17-cells-11-01241), [39](#B39-cells-11-01241)]. However, since glutamine is also utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for replication, caution should be given in glutamine supplementation during infection [ [40](#B40-cells-11-01241)]. 4.2. Lipoproteins and Lipids [41](#B41-cells-11-01241)], macrophage differentiation [ [42](#B42-cells-11-01241)] and immune cell activation [ [43](#B43-cells-11-01241)]. On the other hand, they can induce the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as promote viral entry into cells [ [12](#B12-cells-11-01241)]. Dyslipidemia has been described as a risk factor for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [ [44](#B44-cells-11-01241), [45](#B45-cells-11-01241)], while perturbed lipoprotein levels in relation to COVID-19 were reported by several researchers since its outbreak. Decreased total cholesterol, LDL and HDL correlated with disease severity and were proposed as predictors for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients [ [46](#B46-cells-11-01241), [47](#B47-cells-11-01241), [48](#B48-cells-11-01241), [49](#B49-cells-11-01241)]. Low apolipoprotein-1 and high triglyceride levels were also associated with disease severity [ [48](#B48-cells-11-01241), [50](#B50-cells-11-01241)]. Using an NMR metabolomics approach, COVID-19 patients were characterized by alterations in several lipoproteins (decreased total and HDL apolipoprotein A1, low HDL triglycerides, and increased LDL and VLDL triglycerides) using quantitative measurements of lipoprotein subfractions [ [17](#B17-cells-11-01241)]. Cholesterol was shown to promote the interaction of spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and facilitate the entry of the virus into cells [ [51](#B51-cells-11-01241), [52](#B52-cells-11-01241)]. In this study, NMR resonances attributed to polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols from lipoproteins discriminated between low and high responders already before the first vaccine dose. Thus, apart from promoting viral infectivity during SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipids and lipoproteins could affect and predict vaccine-induced immune responses. 4.3. Role of Ceramides in SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Production [53](#B53-cells-11-01241)]. Ceramide levels in human dendritic cells (DCs) are tightly regulated and their accumulation, due to inhibition of their catabolism, sensitizes DCs to ceramide-induced cell professional antigen-presenting cells [ [55](#B55-cells-11-01241), [56](#B56-cells-11-01241)] and key players in innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections; as expected, their involvement in development of immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical [ [57](#B57-cells-11-01241)]. After vaccination, the mRNA contained in the vaccine enters DCs at the injection site or within lymph nodes and high levels of the viral S protein are produced. The DCs are activated and present the antigen (S protein) to S protein-specific naive T cells, which are differentiated and form cytotoxic T lymphocytes or helper T cells. Subsequently, B cells are differentiated into antibody-secreting plasma cells and high affinity anti-S protein antibodies are produced. After the mRNA vaccination, S protein-specific memory T and B cells as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulate, preventing a subsequent infection [ [58](#B58-cells-11-01241), [59](#B59-cells-11-01241)]. Thus, DCs have a key role in SARS-CoV-2 antibody production and their levels and functional capacity could be critical to the level of immune activation and response. Accumulation of ceramides leads to DC death, and inhibits the antigen-capturing ability and presentation of DCs [ [60](#B60-cells-11-01241)]; thus in individuals with high levels of ceramides, a \"blunted\" DC response could partially explain the lower levels of antibodies 22 days after the first vaccine dose. 4.4.

It is observed that a trend for discrimination is already observed from Day 1, while this trend is diminished at 3 months.; Figure S5: Permutation testing results from the OPLS-DA of NMR CPMG spectra from plasma samples of high vs. low responders at (A) Day 1, (B) Day 22 and (C) 3 Months. In order to assess the validity of the generated classifications, 100 random permutations were performed, and the quality parameters are plotted (on the left) along/together with R2X and Q2 of the original model (on the right). Validity of the Day 1 and Day 22 models was proven (\"random\" values lower than model parameters); Figure S6: OPLS-DA of NMR CPMG from plasma samples of female high vs. low responders at Day 1. (A) Scores plot. The two groups are discriminated. (B) S-plot. Spectral variables on the top right corner (blue) are considered significantly increased in the high responders, while those on the bottom left corner (red) are increased in the low responders. Metabolites with p and p(corr)~0 (coloured in grey) do not significantly impact the separation. Significant spectral variables and their assigned metabolites are shown. (C) Permutation testing results (100 random permutations); Figure S7: OPLS-DA of NMR CPMG from plasmasamples of male high vs. low responders at Day 1. (A) Scores plot. The two groups are discriminated. (B) S-plot. Spectral variables on the up- right corner (blue) are considered significantly increased in the high responders, while those on the down-left corner (red) are increased in the low responders. Metabolites with p and p(corr)~0 (coloured in grey) do not significantly impact the separation. Significant spectral variables and their assigned metabolites are shown. (C) Permutation testing results (100 random permutations); Figure S8: Permutation testing results (100 random permutations) from the OPLS-DA of NMR LED spectra; Figure S9: STOCSY plot using (A) = 0.68 (increased in the high responders) and (B) = 5.21 (increased in the low responders) as \"driver peaks\" [shown with an arrow]. Signal assignments were based on the fact that spectral features exhibiting high correlation belong on the same molecule or lipid class. Numbering of lipids is the same as in [Figure 4](#cells-11-01241-f004)A. (C) Loadings plot (in line format) from the OPLS-DA of NMR LED spectra from plasma samples of high vs. low responders after first dose. Spectral variables increased in the high responders (red) and increased in the low responders group (blue). Coloring based on the correlation p(corr). The pq1 value refers to the weight that combines the X and Y loadings (p and q); Figure S10: ROC curves of the annotated features; Figure S11: Box and whiskers plots of the detected ceramides for male vs. female at Day 1. The differences were not statistically significant; p-values > 0.05. ns: not significant.
