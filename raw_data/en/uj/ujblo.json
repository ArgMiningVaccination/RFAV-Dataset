With the sun shining longer, our motivation levels naturally rise, paving the way for what we know as a \"good Spring clean\". However, in the age of self-improvement, Spring cleaning can embody far more than cluttered cupboards in desperate need of reorganising\u2014it can also have an internal and holistic meaning. Externals Reflect Internal There is an old adage that says \"a cluttered environment equals a cluttered mind\", a case of external elements reflecting the internal and vice versa. Spring cleaning our environment then is just the start\u2014our bodies are intricate systems that also need maintenance. Where to begin? Let's make a start on the inside and work our way out. As the saying goes, \"You are what you eat\" and not to forget what you drink! Unfortunately many foods today are highly processed, calorie dense and nutrient shy. The best start to cleansing our bodies is to take a close look at what passes our lips. It may seem daunting at first, but the positives will infinitely outweigh the negatives. A stronger immune system, increased energy levels, improved complexion and an overall boost to your health and vitality are just some of the benefits. Getting back to basics is the key to great inner health. To get your inner Spring clean on its way, start each day by drinking a cup of warm water with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Lemon water has excellent digestive properties and cleanses and stimulates the liver and kidneys. This will help to clean out toxins from your body. Eat a wholesome breakfast every day. If you don't already, start small with a piece of wholemeal toast or a smoothie - that way you don't even have to chew! Eat three nutrient rich meals a day with a snack of nuts, yogurt or fruit mid-morning and afternoon. Steer clear of high sugar, salt and fatty processed foods that don't actually give your system any vitamins and minerals. Detox, 'Way to go' Using a detoxification plan is like cleaning the inside of your body. Food additives, pollution, cigarette smoke and chemicals found in household products can over time create a toxic effect on your body. When planning a detox, it's important to find the most suitable one for you. Detox plans vary from raw foods and juice diets to supplement and vitamin based plans. Check with you GP or Naturopath for the best advice on the most appropriate detox for your body. Here are a few detoxes available and some of the benefits. Juice Detox Combine vegetable and fruit juices to promote the cleansing process and enhance the rejuvenation of the body. Raw Food Detox Diet Eating a raw food diet eliminates processed foods thereby avoiding preservatives and additives. Additionally, no nutrients are lost as it removes the cooking process and preserves vitamins and mineral content to the highest degree. This enables the body to benefit from the entire nutrient quantity in the food. Herbal Detox Programme Using a combination of herbal remedies and natural supplements, the body can then flush unwanted toxins from the lymphatic system, liver and kidneys. It is recommended a few weeks before detoxing to start cutting out caffeine, alcohol and excess sugar so that your body will not react too dramatically to your new, cleaner consumption. Importantly, inform your family members and colleagues, their support will play an important part in keeping you on track during the early stages. It is also important to remember that a detox is only short term. In the first few days you may experience headaches, diarrhoea and lethargy due to the changes in diet. Getting passed this is the biggest hurdle, stick to your plan and your body will thank you! Also note that detoxing can also be done periodically to keep the body functioning optimally. So when it comes around to Spring each year, add to the top of your spring cleaning list ... YOURSELF!!! Spring cleaning from the inside out will ensure you are getting the most out of your body and your life. Spring flowers will bloom\u2014and so will "}
