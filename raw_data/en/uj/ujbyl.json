A journalist discovers the local health authority recently covered up information about a severe ESAVI. As a communications professional, do you encourage the authority to: A. Apologize. B. Say nothing and hope it blows over. C. Blame the mistake on someone else.1. Un periodista descubre la culpa a otra persona. 18#UniversalHealthA. Apologize Apologize for past mistakes and be clear about what the organization will do differently moving forward. A heartfelt apology from a high-level figure can show the audience that the organization recognizes its errors and is committed to improving in the future. 19#UniversalHealthQuiz 1: Trust 2.

Send many different people to different media outlets and hope the audience sees someone they trust. B. A bombastic politician who is loved by their political party but reviled by others. C. A neutral, consistent expert within the MOH. 202. La en quien confie. B. Un pol\u00edtico, pero los cosistente dentro del Ministerio de Salud.#UniversalHealthC. Neutral, consistent expert Choose neutral and consistent spokespeople when immunization has been highly politicized. Spokespeople must have the audience's attention and trust, which is harder to achieve if that individual is also heavily pushing party lines or delivering inflammatory remarks that alienate individuals in different political parties. Also, having only one spokesperson ensures that the message is delivered consistently across platforms and forums. 21#UniversalHealthQuiz 1: Trust 3. Which message would you not include in the apology talking points? A. Experts around the world agree that vaccines are safe and effective. B. We promise this will never happen again. C. We understand this situation caused concern for the public and are deeply sorry. 223. \u00bfQu\u00e9 mensaje no incluir\u00edas en los puntos de discusi\u00f3n disculpa? A. Expertos de todo el mundo coinciden en que vacunas seguras eficaces. lo lamentamos profundamente.#UniversalHealthB. We promise this will never happen again. Making promises you can't keep only sets you up for broken trust in the future. Respond empathetically and emphasize expert consensus on vaccine safety and effectiveness, so that even if individuals are still learning to trust an organization, they see how it's aligned with other known experts. 23#UniversalHealthQuiz 1: Trust 4. To demonstrate good will toward the effected public, the health authority holds a series of conversations with local leaders. What do you suggest is done with the concerns brought forth by these leaders? A. Nothing. They're not experts on this topic and don't know what they're talking about. B. Develop a highly technical brief explaining why there's no need for those concerns and share it with them. C. Adapt your messaging and approach to address the concerns in simple language. 244. Para demostrar las A. son expertos este tema y no saben preocupaciones en un lenguaje sencillo.#UniversalHealthC. Adapt messages, simple language By ignoring feedback from members of the public and making information inaccessible, you risk looking like all your efforts were just for show. This could easily land your organization in a worse situation than where it started. 25#UniversalHealthAgenda Why talk about vaccination-related risks? Overview of the publication Factors that influence vaccination-related decisions Applying RCCE principles to vaccination Practical guidance 26#UniversalHealthMake a (crisis) plan See what data and info you already have available, and what gaps exist Identify partners and hold regular meetings Identify and train the spokesperson Engage in social listening for different key groups (especially those at highest risk of infection and/or severe disease, or most likely to have concerns) Identify channelsHave a set of validated messages on vaccine safety on hand. Update them as new information becomes available.

Include both oral and written messagesExplain technical terms that keep coming up 28 #UniversalHealthMessaging Adapt the message according to audiences' needsSimplify numbers when talking about ESAVI Talk about \"1 in every X persons\" rather than \"XX thousand persons\" Fewer than 1 in 10 million COVID- 19 vaccinations linked to a serious ESAVI Use concrete numbers when possible, instead of \"high\" or \"low\" or percentages. Clearly label images with your logo 29 #UniversalHealthMessaging Culturally and linguistically accessible Check translations with native speakers Reflect your audience 30 #UniversalHealthMessaging Be transparent Use storytelling and emotions 31 #UniversalHealthRisk perceptions Emphasize health benefits of vaccination (individual and population) Don't minimize risks of vaccination, but put them in perspective with risks of inaction: illness, death 32 #UniversalHealthRisk perceptions Highlight the history of success of vaccines 33 Mention benefits beyond health #UniversalHealthPharmacovigilance Emphasize that public safety is a constant, ongoing activity! ALL vaccines are continuously monitored after they're introduced. 34Continuous monitoring of ALL vaccines has been standard procedure in ALL countries for DECADES!#UniversalHealthPharmacovigilance New vaccine - be ready to talk about ESAVI If an ESAVI occurs, remind people it was picked up because surveillance system works! Trialsmeasure different things, take place in different contexts with different people Stay informed (intl. news, vaccine profiles) 35#UniversalHealthWhy is false info everywhere? 36 Rumors are invented quickly. Researching to refute takes more time. Limited content oversight on social media platforms. Sensational, emotion-inducing content goes viral more easily. Echo chambers reinforce misconceptions. Rumors shift and meld as they spread.#UniversalHealthPrebunking Happens before people are exposed to false information. Serves as a warning about false information. \"Vaccination\" against false info (watered down version of a myth is presented & refuted). Offers trustworthy sources of information. Encourages rational thinking. Teaches individuals how to spot false info & what manipulation tactics are used and why: Cherry picking data. Inventing quotes and \"experts.\" Preying on emotions. Creating false dichotomies/two incorrect answers. Red herrings. Think about who benefits from false information. Social listening strategies and tools can help refine the prebunking messages by targeting them against specific pieces of false information. 37#UniversalHealth 38 Prebunking examples#UniversalHealthDebunking Happens afterpeople are exposed to false information. Seeks to refute myth with facts; myth is clearly labeled. Timing is key. Even after debunked, it's easy for false information to stay in people's memories.
