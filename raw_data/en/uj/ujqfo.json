CHRISTIAN, NATHAN T. DEICHERT, JEAN-PHILIPPE GOUIN, JENNIFER E. GRAHAM, AND JANICE K. KIECOLT-GLASERChapter 64 Over the past 25 years, substantial evidence has established that psychological factors atTect clinically relevant itnmune and neuroendocrine outcomes. In particular, psychosocial stress reliably causes immunological changes that are not only measurable, but also meaningful in terms of health' Moreover, alterations in neuroendocrine function are pri- mary mediators of immune changes seen in response to StTESS. This chapter focuses on work linking psychosocial fac- tors with immune function among humans in three out- come areas. We first review substantial evidence linking the psychological states of stress and depression to inflam- mation, a key outcome because of its clinical relevance to serious health conditions. Next, we summarize research linking stress and wound healing, a clinically vital process in which inflammation plays an important role' Finally, we review effects of stress on susceptibility to infectious ill- ness including studies of vaccination' exposure to infec- tious agents, and immune control of latent viruses' This chapter focuses primarily on the immune effects of stress, although other specific psychosocial f'actors (including depression, hostility, and anxiety) are also dis- cussed. Although we emphasize human studies, we also describe key animal studies, primarily those elucidating physiological mechanisms underlying links between psy- chosocial factors and immune outcomes. Throughout, the role of neuroendocrine mediators is highlighted' We also describe the positive effects of social support and promis- ing interventions that target the effects of stress' Funding: Work on this chapter was suppofied by training grant T32AI55411 (L.M.C., N.T.D.), a Doctoral Research Training Aw:nd from de la recherche en sant6 I 3 1 029' M01-RR-0034, and CAl6058 from the National Institutes of Health'OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The protective physical barrier formed by the skin provides the body's first line of def'ense against foreign invaders' The second line of defense is the innate immune system, which responds very rapidly (within minutes to hours) but in a nonspecific manner when exogenous antigens such as bacteria and viruses are detected. The key elements of the innate immune system are neutrophils, macrophages, natu- ral killer (NK) cells, and complement proteitls' When the innate immune system cannot eff'ectively eliminate or control the antigen in question, the adap- tive immune system provides the third line of defense' Although the adaptive immune system may take severel days to mount an optimal response, its action is highly targeted. The main cell type of the adaptive immune sys- tem is the lymphocyte, which includes T-cells and B-celis' Importantly, after the adaptive immune system is exposed to a particular antigen, certain T-cells and B-cells retain memory of that antigen, which allows a stronger and more rapid response on subsequent exposure; the ability of the adaptive immune system to form memory in this way pro- vides the basis for vaccination (see Figure 64'1)' Cytokines are soluble proteins that are involved in communication between immune cells. Cytokines also have more far-reaching effects (e.g., effects of cytokines on the brain are key to behavioral changes related to i11- ness). Cytokines are produced by cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as well as several other non- lymphoid cells in the body' such as adipocytes (fat cells)' Among their multiple functions. cytokines play a key role in inflammatory immune responses, which involve the recruitment of key proteins and immune cells to an affected area. Inflammation is a critical response to infec- tion or injury; however, chronic or excessive intlammation is linked to negative health outcomes. Thus, an adequate' r?,6aSkin Key Features: system. but not exaggerated inflarnntatory response to itnmune challer.rge is optimal.

EFFECTS OF HEAIXH BEHAVIORS ON IMMUNE OUTCOMES Although this chapter fbcr-rses on neuroendocrine path- ways linking psycholo-sical stress and immLlne behavioral pathways are another impoltant area of investi- gation. In particular. heightened clistress is associated with less aclaptive health behavior, including more smoking and alcohol use, poorer diet, and less sleep (Steptoe, Wardle, Pollard, Canaan. & Davies, 1996; Vitaliano. Scanlan, Zhang, Savage, & Hirsch. 2002). In turn, health behaviors aff'ect neuroendocrine function. immune function, and related health outcomes. including wound healing and response to inf'ectious agents (Figure 64.2). For each of the outcomes discussed in this chapter, efl'ects of stress remain after accounting fbr effects of health behaviors, indicilting that more direct physiological pathways exist between psychological tactors and immune outcomes. However, because health behaviors n-iay partly explain or exacerbate the ef-fbcts of stress, assessing and appropriately controllin-9 fbr health behaviors is an impor- tant component of research aimed at identifying and sepa- rating physiological versus behavioral pathways linking stress and immune function. Moreover, because health behaviors are modifiable, they represent a key target for interventions. One pathway by which behavioral interven- tions can benefit immune firnction is by irnproving physi- ological responses to stress.Stress, Depression, and Inflammation 126l STRESS, DEPRESSION, AND INFLAMM,dTION lnflammation is an essential immune response to infec- healing. As descfibed. the production of cytokines. which are soluble proteins involved in communication between immune and other cells, is an important component of the inflammatory response. Cytokines can be classified as pro- or anti-inflam- rnatory, although some cytokines demonstrate both pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics. As the name implies, pro-inflarnrratory cytokines-including interleukin (IL)-6, lL- 1. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- l0 (IL- 10) act as important regulators of the immune response, in parl by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Opal & DePalo, 2000; involves increased vas- cular perneability and the recruitment of key proteins and immune cells to the afl'ected area. It can be characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and f'ever (Rabin, 1999). In the case of infection or injury, inflammation is beneficial. as it aids lecovery. ln f'act. pro-inflammatory cytokines are administered therapeutically and some cancers (Capuron & Miller,2004; Dantzer & Kelley, 2007). However. exaggerated or chronic inflammation is detrimen- tal to health. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in serious medical conditions including cardiovascular dis- ease. arthrit:is, diabetes. inflarnmatory bowel disease. peri- odontal disease, age-related lunctional decline (Black & Garbutt, 2002; Bruunsgaard, Pedersen, & Pedersen, 200 I ; Ershler & Keller, 2000; Hamerman, Berman, Albers, Brown. & Silver, 1999; lshihara & Hirano, 2002). An insufficient anti-inflammatory response can con- tribute to excessive inflarnmation. Relatedly, the adminis- tration of anti-inflammatory cytokines has been implicated as a useful therapeutic strategy for diseases marked by inflarnmation, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (Opal & DePalo, 2000). Excessive anti-inflelmmatory controi can overly inhibit inflammation, resulting in increased risk for inf'ection and illness (Opal & DePalo, 2000). Thus, an appropriate bal ance of inflammatory and anti-inflarnrnatory function is necessary for optimal health.

Stress can be defined and meii- sured in many ways. Objective definitions generally focus on characteristics of the stressor experienced' Completing a l0-minute speech task can be defined as a mild acute stressor. In contrast, subjective measures of stress reflect an individual's perceptions of stress in their lives as well as their perceived ability to cope with that stress' In this subjective measures can capture important individual ferences in how people react to the samc stressor' Common depressive symptoms inciude negative mood' loss of interest or pleasure, diflicuity concentrating' changes in appetite, sleep disturbance, and thoughts of death' Imporlantiy, psychological stress is a frequent precursor of clinical clepression (Kendler, Karkowski, & Prescott, 1999)' Moreover, as will be reviewed briefly, stress-associated overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis may play a causal role in the developrnent of depres- sion (also see Chapters 6 and 7, Volume 1; and Chapters 5-5 and 62, this volume). Stress and Inflammation Using various stressors, both animal and human models have demonstrated etTects of stress on int-lammation' In terms of animal studies, acute stress in the forn.r of expo- sure to a novel environment or foot/tailshock induces increases in plasma IL-6 rr.roclifiable and can moder'ite p1t1si- ological responses to stress (C). hellth Kusnecov, Shurin, & footshock exhibited heightenecl plasma IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 rose as an increas- ing nurnber of fotltshocks were administered (Zhou et rl\" 1993). Notably, this physiological response to stress can be conclitioned; afier repeated shocking, exposure to stimuli (e.g., auditory tones) that were present when shocks were erdministered also elicitecl increases in IL-6 (Johnson et a1 ' 2002,Zhou et a1., 1993). Pro-inflammatory cytokines also rise in response to acute stressors such as public speaking and mental arith- metic (Bryclon, Edwar-ds, Mohamed-Ali' of Stroop and mrnor{rac- ing tasks. while control parlicipants did not change (Steptoe et al., 2001). This tirne lag between acute stressors and cytokine responses in humans has been reporled in other studies Some null findings (e.g., Heesen et a1., 2002; Lutgendor{ Logan' Costanzo. & Lubaroff, 2004) may be explained by the fact that samples were taken at time points that were too close to the stressor. lt is also notable that the magnitude of inflam- mation seen in response to tlbjective stress()rs is not necessiu- ily predicted by perceived stress (e.g., Bryclon et al\" 2004)' This is consistent with evidence that sub.iective evuluations iue often poor predicttlrs of cardiovascular reactivity to acute stressors (e.g.. Christian & Stoney, 2006)'Importantly, repeated exposure to a stressor may not lead to habituation of inflammatory responses. A sample of 21 healthy middle-aged men completed the Trier Social Stress Test (a combined speech and mental arithmetic task; see Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhiimmer, 1993) three times with l-week intervals between sessions. As expected, the stressor resulted in increases in plasma IL-6. Notably, although participants demonstrated habituation of cortisol and systolic blood pressure reactivity to the task between weeks i and 3, they demonstrated similar stress-induced elevations in IL-6 across visits (von Kanel, Kudielka, Preckel, Hanebuth, & Fischer, 2005). If such lack of habit- uation also occurs in naturalistic settings, inflammatory responses to relatively minor but recurrent stress in daily life may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Given the eIl'ects demonstrated in response to acute stress, it would be expected that chronic stress could have an even greater impact on inflammation. Caregiving provides an excellent model for assessing the eff'ects of chronic stress on health; individuals who provide care fbr loved ones with chronic medical conditions, such as a spouse with demen- tia, commonly experience ongoing stress. significant life change, and social isolation. Relatedly, caregivers experi- ence heightened risk of negative mental and physical health outcomes, including depressive symptoms, inf'ectious ill- ness, and poorer response to vaccination 2003). Notably, Schulz and Beach ( I 999) found that strained caregivers experienced 63qo greater risk of mortality over a 4-year time frame com- pared with noncaregiving control participants. Inflammation from chronic stress may contribute to morbidity and mortality among caregivers. Older women caregivers had higher levels of IL-6 compared with older women undergoing moderate stress (housing relocation) and low stress (Lutgendorf et al., 1999). Additional research with caregivers has demonstrated that caregiving exacerbates typical age-related increases in IL-6; caregiv- ers experienced fourfbld greater increases in IL-6 over a 6-year follow-up period compared with controls (Kiecolt- Glaser et al., 2003). These data suggest that the experi- ence of chronic stress can accelerate the aging process. Notably, although caregivers reported greater perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and loneliness than controls, the effects of caregiver status on inflammation were not accounted for by these factors. Thus, effects of chronic stress on inflammation were not simply a reflection of greater stress, depression, or loneliness. Depression and Inflammation Relationships between depression and inllammation are seen across the life span. Among young adults who wereStress, Depression, and Inflammation 1263 30 years old on average, those experiencing major depres- sion had significantly higher circulating levels of inflam- matory markers than controls with no psychiatric history (Maes et al., 1995). These markers included IL-6 and the soluble receptor of lL-6 (IL-6sR), which can widen the action of IL-6 (Jones, Horiuchi, Topley, Yamamoto, & Fuller, 2001). Similarly, among middle-aged adults, those with major depression had elevated serum levels of IL-6, IL-6sr, as well as the receptor antagonist for IL-1 (L-lra); IL-1ra is often elevated in individuals with diseases marked by inflammation (Maes et al., 1991). These effects are also seen in older adults. In a sample of adults over 60 years of age compared with individuals with no prior history of psychiatric disorder, those who met criteria for clinical depression had 1 7 1 7o higher serum lev- els of ll--lB (Thomas et al., 2005). Moreover, among the depressed individuals, depression severity was positively correlated with IL-lB levels. Along with other proinflam- matory cytokines, IL-18 is implicated in sickness behav- ior. Similarly, in a study of 1,686 participants over 70 years of age, those who exceeded a clinical cutoff on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) had higher levels of IL-6 compared with individuals reporting fewer depressive symptoms, a relationship that held after controlling for age, race, and gender (Dentino et al., 1999). In addition, in a sample of 3,024 adults ages 70 to 79 years, those who exceeded a clinical cutoff on the CES-D had higher levels of IL-6 as well as TNF-cr and C-reactive pro- tein (CRP; Penninx et al., 2003). CRP is an inllammatory marker that is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Hackam & Anand, 2003). These studies dem- onstrate associations between depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers across the lif'e span. In the preceding studies that examined depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers, perceived stress was not measured or statistically controlled. This may be an important consideration, however, because perceived stress tends to covary with depressive symptoms. McDade, Hawkley, and Cacioppo (2006) found that perceived stress was a more robust predictor of CRP than depressive symp- toms in a population-based study of middle-aged and older adults. Moreover, the association between depressive symptoms and CRP was attenuated after controlling for perceived stress. Future research should aim to clarify the predictive value of perceived stress versus depressive symptoms in the context of clinical depression as well as milder depressive symptomatology. Relatedly, depres- sive symptomatology may be an important moderator of physiological responses to objective stressors (e.g., Miller, Freedland, & Carney, 2005). Thus, the specific and interactive effects of objective stressors, perceived stress, and depressive symptomatology warrant further investigation.1264 Psychological Influences on Neuroendocrine and Immune Disorders Physiological Mechanisms Linking Stress' Depression, and Inflammation The experience of liie stress is a c()mmon precursor of depression and inflammatory responses to stressors may play a causal role in this relationship. Stress-induced acti- vation of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and HPA axes provokes the release of stress hormones (e'g', epinephrine and norephinephrine) that stimulate the release of inflammatory markers, including cytokines, that aff'ect the CNS. It is well documented that cytokines elicit sick- ness behaviors (e.g., lethargy and withdrawal) that parallel symptoms of depression (Dantzer & Kelley, 2007)' Cytokines can aff'ect the brain by entering from the periphery or via neural pathways that induce cytokine pro- duction within the brain' Although transfer of cytokines from peripheral circulation to the brain is largely prevented by the blood-brain barier, cytokines can enter the brain via weaker areas of the blood-brain bau:rier as well as through active cytokine transporters (Raison, Capuron, & Miller, 2006). In acldition, a key proposed route by which periph- eral inf'lammation can affect the brain is via stimulation of peripheral aft-erent vagal nerves that innervate organs of the abdominal cavity (Konsman, Parnet, & Dantzer, 2002)' Notably, cytokine receptors, including those for IL- 1, IL-6, and TNF, are located throughout the brain. In particular, IL-1 has significant effects on the hypothalamus and hip- pocampus, which are key regulators of sickness behaviors (Bailey, Engler, Hunzeker, & Sheridan, 2003; Konsman et al.. 2002). In adclition to direct action via cytokine receptors in the brain, cytokines also aff'ect mood and behavior by altering function of neurotransmitters including dopamine. norepi- nephrine, and serotonin, which are known to afTect depres- sive symptomatology. In particular, a clear causal pathway linking inflammation to decreased serotonin (5-HT) avail- ability has been described. Specifically, heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines reduce the availability of try- tophan of 5-HT synthesis (Sohiepers' Wichers, & Maes,2005). For healthy individuals, mechanisms exist that help to self-limit stress responses. Normally, cortisol, akey hormone for the regulation of inf'lammation and stress responses, ls released by the HPA axis during stress responses and then signals back to the HPA axis, eliciting termination of HPA stress responses (Figure 64.3). In addition, cortisol has robust anti-inflammatory effects on cytokine-producing cells. However, extended exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GC), such as that seen in conditions of repeated or chronic stress, may produce GC insensitiv- ity at the level of both cytokine-producing cells and the HPA axis (Sapolsky & N.rr?: Stress induced activation of the HPA axis results in the release of cortisol which signals back to the hypothalamus zrnd pituitary (A)' elicit' ing termination of HPA stress Cortisol also has powerful anti inflammaLory effects on cytokine-producing cells (B)' Hower insensitivity in the HPA axis tl.re brain via transter across the blood-brain barrier from peripheral circulation as well as ria stimulation of atTerent vagtrl nerves. In addition, inflammation can affect moocl by reclucing the availability of tryptophan' a precursor of sert)tonin (5-Hl Corticotlopin-releasing hormone Dashed lines : An inhibitory relationshtp. a diminished ability of the HPA axis and cytokine produc- ing cells to respond to cortisol, resulting in more sustained HPA axis responses and greater production of inflamma- tory markers. Thus, the development of GC resistance and resulting elevations in inflamrnatory markers has been proposed as an important pathway by which stress can con- tribute to depressive symptomatology (Raison & Miller, 2003). Clinical depression is frequently characterized by GC resistance, as evidenced by a reduced capacity to sup- press HPA axis secretion of glucocorticoid (Modell' Yassouridis. Huber, & Holsboer, 1997). In humans, the best evidence that inflammation can play a causal role in the development of depression comes from studies in which cytokines are administered therapeutically In particular, the proinflammatory cytokine interferon- alpha is used with some cancers as well as some infectious illnesses (e.g., hepatitis). This treatment produces signifi- cant depressive symptomatology in a high percentage ol_-rF-individuals (Capuron & Milter, 2004; Dantzer & Kelley, 2007). Interferon treatment can also increase circulating IL-6 and TNF-cr, alter in HPA axis function, serotonin metabolism (Capuron & Milleq 2004; Dantzer & Kelley, 2007). Thus, studies of interferon treat- ment suppofi the proposition that inflammation can play a causal role in the development ofdepression.

Interventions Targeting Stress, Depression, and Inflammation Certain interventions may help to break the negative cycle of stress, depression, and inflammation. For one, interven- tions targeting social support may be helpful. Among female cancer patients, greater social support has predicted lower levels of inflammatory markers in circulating blood and ascitic fluid (Costanzo et aI., 2002). Relatedly, religious participation, a key source of social support for many people, has predicted lower levels of IL-6 among community-based samples (Koenig et al., 19971' Lltgendorf, Russell, Ullrich, Harris, & Wallace, 2004). Interventions aimed at improving the availability and utilization of social support warrant investigation, particularly for individuals experiencing both significant stress and lack of support. Other interventions targeting stess include yog4 tai chi, and meditation. Participation in both tai chi and yoga is associ- ated with improved mood (Waelde, Thompson, Woolery Myers, Srernlieb, & Z.eltzer, 2004); however, limited research has attempted to link such activities with changes in inflammatory activiry. One study examined effects of mindfulness-based sffess reduction, which included elements of meditation and gentle yoga among breast cancer patients. Results demonsfrated improvements in mood, reductions in perceived sfess, and beneficial immuno_ logical changes including decreased production of interferon (IFN)-1 and increased production of IL-4, an anti-inflamma_ tory cytokine, by stimulated T:cells (Carlson, Speca, patel, & Goodey, 2003). Notably, regular physical activity is associated with reductions in circulating inflammatory markers (e.g., Ford, 2002). Therefore, further investigation of activities such as tai chi and yoga that involve elements of both meditation and physical activity holds promise. In terms of clinical depression, both antidepressant med- ication and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been associ_ ated with reductions in inflammatory markers (Basterzi et al., 2005; Doering, Cross, Vredevoe, Wound Healing 1265 Vardar, & Abay, 2003). Such anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to the efficacy of these treatments. Indeed, the depressive symptoms induced by interferon treatment can largely be prevented or reversed by treatment with anti_ depressant medications (Hauser et al., 2002: Musselman et al., 2001). Accumulating research also speaks to the importance of omega-3 (n -3) polyunsarurated fany acids (pUFAs) for both mental health and inflammatory processes. Specifically, Iow plasma levels of n-3 PUFA as well as high omega_6 (n-6) ton-3 ratios have been associated with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in several studies (e.g., Frasure-Smith, Lesperance, including IL-6, IL-1P, and TNF-cr (Logan, 2003). Consisrent with this evidence, higher circulating levels of n-3 pUFAs are related to lower levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (Femrcci et a1., 2006 ; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2007 ). Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated, that n-3 PTIFA supplementation decreases depressive symptoms (for review, see Parker et al., 2006), supporting the argument that interventions targeting inflammation are a promising direction for depression treatment. STRESS AND WOUND HEALING Psychological stress and psychosocial factors have also been linked with wound healing (Christian, Graham, Padgett, Glaser, & Kiecolt-Glaser,2007), a clinically criti_ cal outcome. The skin is the body's largest organ and pri_ mary immune defense, preventing bacteria, viruses, and other exogenous antigens from entering (Elias, 2005) and limiting the movement of water in and out of the body (Marks, 2004). As such, the skin's ability to heal wounds effectively is essential to good health. The effects of stress on healing have important implications in the context of surgery and naturally occurring wounds, particularly among at-risk and chronically ill populations. The Wound-Healing Process When tissue damage occurs in healthy individuals, healing progresses sequentially through three overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (see Baum & Arpey, 2005, figure 2; Singer & Clark, 1999). Success in later phases is highly dependent on preceding phases. The inflammatory phase, which typically lasts 5 to 7 days, is marked by vasoconstriction, blood coagulation, platelet activation, and the release of substances that attract cells to cleanthe area, thatis, removebacteria (Sin ger &Clark,1999;1266 Psychological Influences on Neuroendocrine and Immune Disorders Van De Kerkhoi Van Bergen, Spruijt, & Kuiper, 1994). The proliferative phase is characterized by recruitment and rep- lication of cells necessary for tissue regeneration and capi- llary regrowth. The final stage, which may continue for weeks or months, involves contraction and tissue remod- eling (see Figure 64.4). The sequence and mechanisms described here apply best to acute wounds: The molecular mechanisms by which stress affects chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, are less well understood and are complicated by other factors (Vileikyte, 2007). A key pathway by which stress affects healing is via inflammatory processes at the site of the wound. Although prolonged or exaggerated inflammation is detrimental to health, inflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the heal- ing cascade and a robust localized inflammatory response is ideal. Inflammatory cytokines help prevent infection, prepare injured tissue for repair, enhance recruitment and activation of additional phagocytic cells, and regu- late the ability of cells to remodel damaged tissue (Lowry, 1993). Stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoids can transiently suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production in humans (DeRijk et aL, 1991). Moreover, mice treated with glucocorticoids showed impairment in the inductionof IL- 1 and TNF, as well as deficient wound repair (Hiibner et al., 1996). Although other mechanisms are implicated in the link between stress and healing, the interactive roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid hormones are the best delineated to date. Further evidence of their role is demonstrated in the studies described in the follow- ing subsection. Effects of Stress on Wound Healing The lrst human study to demonstrate the effects of stress on healing examined women experiencing the chronic stress of caregiving for a loved one with dementia. In this study, care- givers took 247o longer to heal a small standardized punch biopsy wound than did well-matched controls (Kiecolt-Glasel Marucha, Malarkey, Mercado, & Glaser, 1995). Healing rate was determined using photographs to compare wound size to a standard dot. The same study revealed that circulating peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from caregivers expressed less IL-IB in messenger RNA (mRNA) in response to lipo- polysaccharide (LPS) stimulation than did cells from controls (KiecolrGlaser et al., 1995). As described earlier, a strong IL- 1 B response is desirable in the context of healing.

These (PDGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). For a broader review of physiological mechanisms relevant to wound healing, see Werner and Grose (2003). From \"Stress and Wound Healing,\" by L. M. Christian. J. E. Graham, D. A. Padgett, R. Glaser, and J. K. KiecolrGlaser, 2007, Neuroimmunomodulation, 13, p. 338. Reprinted with permission.-Subsequent research demonstrated that milder stress also impairs healing. In a sample of 1l dental students, mucosal punch biopsy wounds placed in the hard palate healed an average of 407o more slowly during an exami- nation period than during a vacation period, which was rated as less stressful by participants (Marucha, Kiecolt- Glaser, & Favagehi, 1998). This effect was remarkably reliable: Every student in the study healed more slowly during exams than during vacation. Moreover, in concor- dance with studies on caregiving stress, production of IL- 1B mRNA by LPS-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was reduced in every student during the examina- tion period compared with the vacation period. Further research has examined cytokine production at the local wound site. In a study of 36 women, blister wounds were created using a suction blister device that produced 8 sterile 8 mm blister wounds (Glaser, Kiecolt-Glaser, et al., 1999). A plastic template with 8 wells was placed over the blister wounds and each well was filled with the woman's serum and a salt solution, allowing cells to migrate into the blister chambers. Women reporring greater stress had signifi- cantly lower levels of two key cytokines (IL-1c and IL-S) at the wound site (Glaser, Kiecolt-Glaser, et a1., 1999). By dem- onstrating an association between stress and local cytokine production, this study significantly extended previous data linking stress and mechanisms associated with healing. Dramatically, even a single 30-minute marital conflict discussion in a laboratory setting can slow wound healing: Manied couples healed standardized blister wounds more slowly after a conflictive interaction than after a supporlive interaction (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2005). Decreased produc- tion of three key cytokines-Il-6, lL- 1 B, and TNF-a-was observed at the wound site following conflict compared with a supportive interaction. Furthermore, couples who demonstrated consistently high levels of hostile behavior during both conflictive and supportive interactions healed wounds at 607o of the rate of low-hostile couples. Other research has examined relationships between wound healing and subjective stress. Among healthy males, greater perceived stress predicted slower healing of a punch biopsy wound from 7 to 21 days postwounding (Ebrecht et a\\., 2004). Healing was also significantly related ro cor- tisol levels: Greater morning increases in cortisol predicted slower healing. Healing in this study was assessed with ultrasound biomicroscopy, a relatively new imaging tech- nique that uses high-resolution ultrasound scanning to mea- sure wound depth as well as circumference. This approach provides an assessment ofhealing in deep tissue layers and enables measurement of wound circumference that is not impeded by scab formation (Dyson et a1., 2003). Stress also has measurable effects on healing outside a controlled laboratory setting. Depression and anxiety wereStress and Wound Healing 1267 associated with healing among elderly men and women with chronic leg ulcers: Those reporting greater than aver- age symptoms of depression or anxiety were four times more likely to be categorized as slow healers compared with those reporting less distress (Cole-King & Harding, 2001). Similarly, in a sample of adults undergoing hernia surgery, self-reporled worry about surgery predicted slower heal- ing time, even after controlling for age, gender, and type of anesthetic (Broadbent, Petrie, Alley, & Booth, 2003). Moreover, greater preoperative stress predicted lower levels of IL-l in the wound fluid, while greater worry about surgery was related to lower matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the wound fluid (Broadbenr et al., 2003). MMp-9, which is regulated by cytokines IL-l and IL-6, facilitates cellular migration within the wound area, and thus aids in tissue remodeling (Pajulo et al., 1999). Animal models support and extend findings related to causal mechanisms linking stress and healing. Mice exposed to periods of restraint stress for 3 days before and 5 days following wounding healed punch biopsy wounds 2J7o more slowly than did nonstressed controls (Padgett, Marucha, & Sheridan, 1998). Restraint-stressed mice also had reduced cellularity in the margins of their punch biopsy wounds, particularly early in the healing process and sig- nificantly higher levels of serum cofticosterone compared with unstressed controls. Notably, when the stressed ani- mals were treated with the glucocorticoid receptor antag- onist RU40555, their healing rates were equivalent to nonstressed animals (Padgett et al., 1998). Thus, results from animal models confirm that the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on inflammatory activity play an important role in stress-induced delays in healing. Thus, the effects of stless on glucocorlicoid functioning and subsequent effects on decreases in localized inflamma- toryresponses to injuryrepresent aprimarypathway by which stress impairs wound healing (Figure 64.5). Glucocorticoids have multiple effects that can disrupt the inflammatory stage ofhealing, particularly early on. These effects include (a) suppression of immune cell differentiation and prolifera- tion, (b) reduced expression of cell adhesion molecules that play an important role in trafficking cells to the site of the wound, (c) decreases in nuclear factor kappa B (NFrc-B) activity, which results in decreased pro-inflammatory gene expression (for review, see Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 20051 Godbout & Glaser, 2006; Padgen & Glaser, 2003). In addi- tion, disruption of inflammatory processes can prevent the proper cleaning and clearance ofbacteria from a wound site, resulting in greater risk for infection, which is also associated with delayed healing. Dysregulation of the inflammatory stage of healing is imporlant because the stages of healing are overlapping and interdependent. Therefore, delay in the early inflammatory1268 Psychological Influences on Neuroendocrine and Immune Disorders HPA Axis Activation . Suppression ofimmune cell proliferation and differentiatron.

Delays in the inflammatory stage of healing causes dysregulation of later stages, resulting in delayed healing. stage disrupts progression of subsequent stages ofhealing, ultimately resulting in increased time to healing. This, in turn, can have important clinical implications for recovery from surgery and naturally occulring wounds. Interventions for Enhancing Wound Healing Exercise and social contact are two interventions that have been used to target stress or the effects of stress with the goal of improving healing. First, recent data demon- strate that regular physical activity can speed healing. Older adults who completed a 4-week exercise interven- tion healed standard punch biopsy wounds 25Vo more quickly than did their less active countelparts (Emery, Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Malarkey, & Frid, 2005). These effects were notable because ofthe low self-reported stress across the sample; effects may be even greater among indi- viduals reporting more distress. In this study, exercise didnot result in changes in resting cortisol levels or perceived stress over time. Furlher research is needed to examine mechanistic pathways by which exercise may benefit healing. Animal work suggests that social contact may mitigate effects of stress on healing. Among hamsters subjected to restraint stress, those who were individually housed (isolated) showed significant impairment of cutaneous wound healing, whereas those who were pair-housed did not (Detillion, Craft, Glasper, Prendergast, & DeVries, 2004). The adverse effect on healing observed in isolated hamsters was driven by stress-induced increases in serum cortisol; socially housed hamsters had significantly lower semm cortisol concentrations than their isolated counter- parts. The protective effects of social housing in this study appeared to be at least partly mediated by oxytocin, a hor- mone that is released during social contact and that may facilitate social bonding. The administration of an oxyto- cin antagonist to socially housed animals delayed healing and treatment of isolated animals with oxytocin, attenuated their stress-induced cortisol increases, and speeded healing (Detillion et a1.,2004). Thus, these data support the notion that cortisol plays a key role in the stress-healing link. STRESS AND INFECTIOUS AGENTS Turning to other models used to study effects of stress on immune-relevant outcomes, stress has been linked to impaired response to infectious illness in three related areas: vaccination, experimental exposure to infectious illness, and latent viruses. Each of these models has its own strengths, and each provides clinically relevant infor- mation about immune function in a unique manner (see Figure 64.6). These models are useful, in part, because there is unexplained variability in immune responses to each type of challenge. Individuals demonstrate varying degrees of susceptibility to infection on exposure to the same infectious agent. In addition, among those who do become infected, there is a significant range of severity and duration of illness experienced. Stress contributes to such variability in response to infectious agents. Vaccination Measuring Immune Responses to Vaccination Studies of immune responses to vaccination provide clini- cally relevant information in at least two ways. First, an adequate immune response to vaccination is required for the vaccine to provide protection against the antigen in question. Second, immune responses to vaccination serve as a proxy measure of how well an individual's immune systemT TFigure 64.6 Models for studying immune responses to infectious agents would respond if he or she were exposed to the actual infectious agent (Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Gravenstein, Malarkey, & Sheridan, 1996). Consistent with this notion, poorer immune responses to vaccination are predictive of greater likelihood of experiencing clinical illness (Plotkin, 2001). A notable strength of this methodology is that vac- cination is beneficial to people, with some vaccines being highly recommended for at-risk populations (e.g., influ- enza vaccination among the elderly). Therefore, vaccina- tion provides a highly ethical methodology for studying clinically relevant immune outcomes in humans. As described, the immune system can be broadly divided into two arms: the innate immune system (the rapid nonspe- cific defense against an antigen), and the adaptive immune system, which mounts a slower, antigen-specific response. Studies of vaccine response examine the ability of the adap- tive immunity to form and maintain immunological mem- ory alter exposure to an antigen. Effective responses to vaccination involve activation of both the humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system. The humoral immune response is governed by B- cells and marked by antibody production. Antigen-specific antibodies, produced by B-lymphocytes, can opsonize the antigen (tag it for destruction by other immune cells), and neutralize it by preventing it from further interacting with the host's cells. Therefore, it is beneficial for an individual to demonstrate a robust antibody response to vaccination that is maintained well over time. Parameters for a suf- ficient antibody response, referred to as seroconversion, depend on the vaccine in question. A fourfold increase in antibody titers is considered to be the standard for a sufficient response to influenza vaccine.Stress and lnfectious Agents 1269 The cellular immune response is governed by T-cells. Cellular immune responses to vaccination are commonly quantified in terms of production of certain cytokines (e.9., IL-2, IFN-1), that promote cell-mediated immune responses. context of vaccination, higher IL-2 and IFN-r7 cytokine production to in vitro virus exposure is desirable because these cytokines activate virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells as well as natural killer cells. Effects of Psychological Factors on Vaccine Response As described above, the chronic stress of caring for a rela- tive with dementia promotes systemic inflammation and slows wound healing. In addition, exposure to this chronic stressor impairs immune responses to vaccination. Three studies to date have demonstrated that caregivers are less likely to seroconveft following influenza vaccination com- pared with well-matched control subjects (Glaser, Kiecolt- et al., 1996; Vedhara et al., 1999). For example, in a study of 32 caregivers and 32 demographically matched controls, caregivers were significantly less likely to achieve a four- fold increase in influenza-specific antibody levels I month after vaccination; this effect was more pronounced among older subjects (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996). In addition, caregivers' peripheral blood lymphocytes produced less IL-2 in response to in vitro influenza stimulation, evidenc- ing a poorer cellular response to vaccination. In a similar study, caregivers showed impaired mainte- nance ofthe response to pneumoccocal pneumonia vaccina- tion. Although caregiver and control groups demonstrated equivalent responses to the vaccine initially (at 2 weeks.

Notably' the immune response to influenza is largely mediated by T-lymphocytes while the immune response to pneummo- coccal pneumonia is not dependent on T:lymphocytes. Therefore, studies of caregivers indicate that chronic stress affects responses to both classes of vaccine. Greater self-reported stress also predicts impaired vac- cine responses among younger populations. For example, in a study of 31 college students who received influenza vaccination, those who reported less perceived stress and fewer stressful life events in the period fbllowing vacci- nation demonstrated significantly better maintenance of antibody levels compared with students reporting greater stress (Burns, Carroll, Drayson, Whitham, & Ring' 2003). Similarly, among 260 healthy college students, a greater number of negative life events in the previous year pre- dicted lower hepatitis B antibody levels only among those who hacl been vaccinated more than 1 year prior; number of negative life events was not associated with antibody level among those who were vaccinated within the past year (Burns, Carroll, Ring, Harrison, & Drayson,2002). These data indicate that stress affected long-term mainte- nance of immunological memory fbr the antigen. Additional research has examined the effects of stress among college students on both T-cell dependent (inf1u- enza) and Tcell independent (meningococcal C) vaccina- tions. Those who reported a greater number of stressful life events in the year prior to vaccination had lower antibody responses to one strain of the influenza vaccine at both 5 weeks and 5 months. Moreover, although the final anti- body response levels were similar at 5 months, students who reported greater stress mounted a slower antibody response to the meningococcal C vaccination (Phillips, Burns, Carroll, Ring, & Drayson, 2005). It is important to consider perceived stress in the context of objectively stressful experiences. A sample of 48 medi- cal students underwent a series of 3 hepatitis B inocula- tions schecluled to coincide with three major examination periods. Those who seroconverted after the first vaccina- tion reported significantly less stress and anxiety across the three exam periods. Moreover, following the third exam period, students who reported lower anxiety and stress across exam periods demonstrated higher antibody responses to the vaccine and a stronger T-cell response to a hepatitis B challenge in vitro (Glaser et a1., 1992). A study addressed the question of which time points are most critical in terms of stress affecting immune responses to vaccination. A sample of 83 healthy young adults received influenza vaccination, and their subjective stress levels weremeasured for 2 days prior to vaccination, the day of vac- cination, and the l0 days following vaccination. Although stress prior to or on the day of vaccination did not predict antibody responses, greater stress levels in the 10 days fol- lowing vaccination were associated with poorer antibody response (Miller et al., 2004). The studies reviewed thus far focus on chronic stress, perceived stress, and brief naturalistic stressors (e.g.. exam stress). Some evidence suggests that acute stress (e'9.' 2-hour restraint stress in mice; mentai arithmetic or exer- cise stress in people) can enhance immune responses to vaccination (Edwards et al., 2006; Silberman' Wald, & Genaro, 2003). Additional research is needed to describe in better detail the processes involved in brief acute stress relative to longer-lasting stress experlences. As reviewed, evidence for effects of stress on vacclne response is seen across a variety of vaccines and types of stressors. Variability between specilic outcomes across stud- ies may be explained in part by the different vaccines and measurement time frames used. Moreover, prior vaccination or naturalistic exposure to an antigen will affect responses to vaccination. This can cause a range restriction problem that impedes the ability to detect effects of psychosocial facbrs (Vedhara et al., 1999). These methodological I'actors should be carefully considered in research using vaccination. Studies to date demonstrate that stressors ranging from relatively brief (e.g., academic exams) to chronic (e.g., caregiving) can significantly afTect the rapidity and mag- nitude of antibody response as well as long-term mainte- nance of immunological memory conferred by vaccination Such stress is also predictive of decreased cellular immune responses to vaccination. Although beyond the scope of this chapter, animal models demonstrate multiple effects of glu- cocorticoid hormones on cell-trafflcking, and production of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to these effects (fbr review, see Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Godbout & Glaser, 2006; Padgett & Glaser, 2003). Notably, effects of stress on responses to vaccination are seen in both older and younger adults, although effects tend to be stronger among older adults because of age-related decreases in immune responses to vaccination' In addition, deficits in immune response to vaccination have particular importance for older adults who are more vulnerable than younger adults to serious complications and death in the face of illness such as influenza (Yoshikawa, 1983). Infectious Illness M e as uring I nfe ctio us I lln e s s Consistent with findings that stress affects immune respon- ses to vaccination. stress also affects susceptibility, sever- ity, and duration of infectious illnesses including influenza- and rhinovirus (the common cold). In studies of infectious illness, the rates ofboth respiratory infection and clinical illness are of interest. Respiratory inf'ection is defined by the presence ofthe virus in circulation or significant increases in virus-spe- cific antibody titers following experimental exposure to the infectious agent. In contrast, clinical illness is typically defined by physician-judged severity of illness symptoms. Assessing both respiratory inf'ection and clinical illness is imporlant because among those exposed to a virus, only a porlion will become infected. In turn, among those inf'ected, only a portion will develop clinical symptoms. Effects of Psychosocial Factors on Infectious lllness Naturalistic studies have reported associations between stress and frequency of inf-ectious illness. In a sample of 117 adults, the experience of stressful life events in the previous 12 months and during a l5-week observation period was assessed. During the observation period, 29 participants experienced at least one clinically verified upper respiratory illness. Risk of illness was greater among those who reported a greater number of stressful life events (Turner-Cobb & Steptoe, 1996). Although naturalistic studies provide good evidence of effects of stress on sus- ceptibility to infectious illness, such methodology allows for limited control of important confounding variables including rates of exposure to infectious agents. The strongest evidence of effects of stress on inf'ectious illness comes from studies in which participants have been purposefully exposed to infectious agents that can cause upper respiratory inf'ections (URIs) and then tracked over time in a well-controlled environment. In a key study using experimentai exposure methodology, Cohen and colleagues demonstrated that self-reported stress predicted suscep- tibility to respiratory viruses in a dose-response manner. Specifically, 394 healthy subjects were exposed to I of 5 respiratory viruses, while 26 control subjects were given saline nasal drops. Participants were then quarantined and their respiratory symptoms as well as their virus-specific antibody titer levels were assessed (Cohen, Tyrell, & Smith, I 991). Individuals reporting greater stress (as determined by a composite measure of major life events, perceptions of stress, and negative affect) showed greater likelihood of developing respiratory infections as well as clinically defined colds. This effect was fbund across each of the five types of virus, and the effect remained after con- trolling for potential confounding factors including age, sex, education, season, and personality fatctors. Later research from the same laboratory fbcused on better delineating the importance of diff'erent types of stressful life events. In this study, 276 participants com- pleted in-depth inter.'riews assessing occurrence. severity.Stress and Infectious Agents l27I and emotional significance of life stressors in the past year (Cohen et al., 1998). Participants were exposed to one of two rhinoviruses and kept in quarantine for the fol- lowing 5 days during which their experience of inf'ectious illness was assessed. Results indicated that acute stressors did not predict increased risk of int-ection or clinicai colds. However, the experience of chronic stress lasting I month or longer was associated with significantly increased risk of developing a cold. These ef-fects were not accounted for by differences in social network characteristics, personal- ity, or health behaviors. The same study explored potential endocrine mediators linking stress and virus susceptibility. In this sample, ele- vations in epinephrine and norepinephrine were associated with increased risk of developing colds. However, unex- pectedly, the experience of chronic stress was not associ- ated with higher levels of these stress hormones. This could be due in part to the stress and novelty of the experimental situation, which may have caused acute stress in all par- ticipants and masked efl'ects of chronic stressors on these endocrine markers (Cohen et al., 1998). Other research indicates that variability in physiologi- cal responses to stress affects stress-induced susceptibility to infection. In a sample of I l5 healthy individuals, those who showed larger cortisol responses to laboratory stress- ors experienced greater risk of developing clinically veri- fied colds under conditions of higher stress (Cohen et al., 2002). Stress level was unrelated to URI risk among those showing smaller cortisol responses to acute stress. Thus, individuals who experience greater physiological reactiv- ity to stress may be more vulnerable to infectious illness in conditions of stress. Subsequent research, also from the same laboratory, explored the role of inflamrnation in explaining the link between stress and symptom severity. In a study of -55 sub- jects who were exposed to an influenza virus, those report- ing higher stress experienced greater symptoms of illness and greater mucous weight, as well as greater inflammatory responses to the infection, as indicated by higher IL-6 levels in nasal secretions (Cohen, Doyle, & Skoner, 1999). These data suggest that stress may contribute to an exaggerated local inflammatory response to inf'ection, contributing to illness severity. However, in the context of infectious ill- ness, efTects of stress may diff'er fbr the production of other cytokines and at other sites (e.g., lungs). In mice exposed to influenza virus, restraint stress reduced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1cr, but did not affect the production of IL-6 in the lungs (Konstantinos & Sheridan, 2001). In another animal study, restraint stress resulted in reduced production of IL-6 from splenocytes, but enhanced production of IL-6 fiom regional lymph nodes (Dobbs, Feng, Beck, & Sheridan, 1996). Thus, the effects1272 Psychological Influences on Neuroendocrine and Immune Disorders of stress on inflammatory mediators during viral infection are complex and may best be understood as dysregulated, rather than enhanced or suppressed. Moreover, the clinical relevance of noted alterations may differ for susceptibility versus severily of illness. In sum, several well-controlled laboratory studies have demonstrated a relationship between stress and suscep- tibility, severity, and duration of inf'ectious illness (see Figure 64.7). Naturalistic studies report parallel findings. Human models implicate glucocorticoids and local cyto- kine production in the link between stress and illness sus- ceptibility and severity. Animal models support and extend these findings, providing evidence for effects of gluco- corlicoids, dysregulated cytokine production, alterations in cell (Bonneau, Padgett, & Sheridan, 2001; 2001). A continued focus on physiological pathways will help to better delineate the role of specific immune alterations in affecting the susceptibility, duration, and severity of infectious illness. Latent Viruses Measuring Immune Control of l-atent Vituses Normally, viruses are eliminated from the host when infec- tion is resolved. However, some viruses are maintained in the body in a latent state in asymptomatic individuals after primary infection. Such viruses include those from the herpesviruses family, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) I (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). After primary infection,latent viruses are maintained within cerlain cells (e.g., B- lymphocytes for EBV). Although the immune system rs typically quite effective in controlling latent viruses, reac- tivation of the opportunistic virus can occur when cellular immunity wanes. During reactivation, the virus produces greater quantities ofviral proteins. This elicits cellular and humoral immune responses and results in the production of virus-specific antibody. Thus, higher levels of antigen- specific antibody can be used as an indicator of impaired cell-mediated control of a latent virus. One strength of examining immune control of latent viruses is that some forms are ubiquitous and can therefore be studied in a variety of populations. More than 9570 of the adult population is infected with EBV (Wolf & Morag, 1998). Therefore, the study of such latent viruses does not require experimental exposure to an antigen, a clear benefit for human studies. Ineffective control of latent viruses can have important clinical implications among immunosuppressed individuals. Reactivation of latent viruses predicts increased mortality and morbidity among organ transplant recipients (Gray et a1., 1995) and individuals infected with HIV (Cruess et a1., 2000). Although reactivation of EBV typically causes no symptoms in healthy individuals (Hess, 20O4), reactivation of HSV I or II can cause cold sores (Bystricka & Russ, 2005), and VZV reactivation can cause shingles (Quinlivan & Breuer, 2006). Even in the absence of clinical disease, reactivation of a latent virus provides a sensitive marker of impairment in cell-mediated immunity. Thus, studies of viral latency pro- vide clinically relevant information even among asymptom- atic individuals. 1 susceptibility, duration, severity of inf'ectious illness J humoral and cellular responses to vaccination J cellular control of latent virusesFigure 64.7 Behavioral and neuro- endocrine pathways linking stress and response to infectious agents. Note: By affecting health behaviors, social behaviors, and neuroendocrine function, stress can impair both humoral and cellular immune responses to infectious agents. This has impor- tant clinical implications for immune responses to exposure to infectious illnesses, vaccination, and control of latent viruses. (Although social support can buffer negative effects of stress. contact with a diverse social network can result in greater exposure to infectious agents.)Health and Social Behaviorsr-r Effects of Psychosocial Fsctors on Immune Control of Intent Viruses Given the effects of chronic stress on other aspects of immune function, it is not surprising that chronic stress impairs immune control of latent viruses. Individuals who are caregivers for a family member with dementia exhib- ited higher EBV (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., l99l) and HSV-1 (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1997) antibody levels compared with well-matched controls. In addition, individuals expe- riencing the enduring stress of living near the Three Mile Island damaged nuclear plant showed higher HSV-1 anti- body levels, compared with matched community controls living 80 miles away from the nuclear plant (McKinnon, Weisse, Reynolds, Bowles, & Baum, 1989). Stress from disrupted significant relationships also affects immune function (Graham, Christian, & Kiecolt- Glaser, 2006a), including immune control of latent viruses. Women who had been divorced or separated for 1 year or less showed higher levels of EBV antibody compared with demographically matched women who were currently married (KiecolrGlaser et a1., 1987). Similarly, men who were unsatisfied in their marriage had higher levels of EBV antibody than their happily married counterparts (Kiecolt- Glaser et a1., 1988). More transient stressors also affect viral latency. In pro- spective studies of examination stress, medical students exhibited higher EBY HSV-1, and CMV antibody titers on the day of an academic examination, compared with several weeks before or after the exam (Glaser, Friedman, et al., 1999; Glaser, Margalith, 2001). Other research has shown that the intense stress of space flight (Mehta, Stowe, Feiveson, expeditions (Mehta, Pierson, Cooley, Dubow, & Lugg, 2000) resulted in CMV-specific antibody titers and decreased EBV-specific T:cell responses. This is not surprising, given that effects of stress on viral latency are seen in response to much less significant sftessors (e.g., examinations). In addition to effects of objective stressors, other psy- chological factors have also been associated with poorer control of latent virus. Higher levels of EBV-specific anti- bodies have been found in students who reported a greater tendency to repress their emotions (Esterling, Antoni, Kumar, & Schneiderman, 1990), higher levels of anxiety (Esterling, Antoni, Kumar, & Schneiderman, 1993), and greater loneliness (Glaser et a1., 1985). Similarly, patients with syndromal or subsyndromal symptoms of depression have shown higher levels of HSV-I antibody and poorer VZV-specific T-cell immunity than those without depressiveStress and Infectious Agents 1273 symptoms (Delisi et al., 1986; Irwin et al., 1998; Robertson et al., 1993) Conversely, older women reporting higher vigor during housing relocation had lower EBV-antibody titers compared with women who reported lower levels of vigor (Lutgendorf et al., 2001). Thus, in addition to objec- tive stressors, certain psychological characteristics (e.g., mood, ways of coping) may be associated with impaired control of latent viruses. Other research has addressed physiological mecha- nisms by which stress may impair control of latent viruses. In studies of examination stress, students exhibited poorer cytotoxic and proliferative T-cell responses to in vitro EBV exposure on examination days compared with non- examination days (Glaser et al.,1987,1993). In addition, exam stress predicted suppression of leukocyte migration inhibition factor (MIF), a condition associated (Sheridan, Donnenberg, Aurelian, & Elpern, 1982). Glucocorticoids may play role in stress-induced reactivation of latent viruses; indeed, glucocorticoids can induce latent EBV and CMV replication in vitro (Tanaka et al., 1984). However, some human studies have failed to find an association between basal cortisol levels and con- trol of latent viruses (Cruess et al., 2000; Glaser, Pearl, Kiecolt-Glaser, & Malarkey,1994). Cacioppo et al. (2002) observed that increased tonic plasma concentration of syn- thetic glucocorticoid hormone did not lead to enhanced in vitro EBV replication. However, when the synthetic gluco- corticoid hormone was administered in a pulsative manner with varying concentration, mimicking a dysregulation of its diurnal variation, increased EBV replication occured. Thus, assessments of patterns of cortisol release may be key to understanding the role of glucocorticoids in stress- induced virus reactivation. Interventions to Improve Response to Infectious Agents A variety of factors have been demonstrated to reduce stress and benefit immune response to infectious agents. As emphasized throughout this chapter, social support can serve as an important stress buffer. College students who reported greatet social support showed stronger antibody responses to influenza vaccination (Phillips et al., 2005) as well as better cellular and humoral immune responses to hepatitis B vaccination (Glaser et al., 1992). Similarly, when exposed to infectious agents in a controlled labora- tory environment, participants reporting more social ties were less likely to develop colds than those reporting fewer social ties (Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, & Gwaltney, 1997). Although social support may buffer the effects of stress, having a diverse social network may also result in greater exposure to a broader diversity of viruses. In fact,I274 Psychological lnfluences on Neuroendocrine and Immune Disorders in a naturalistic study, greater social network diversity was associated with fewer URIs only under conditions of low stress (Hamrick, Cohen, & Rodriguez,2002). A key beneficial component of social support may be that it provides an outlet for emotional disclosure. Indeed, interventions designed to encourage disclosure beneflt immune function. In a sample of 40 students, those who completed a writing task involving emotional disclo- sure prior to receiving hepatitis B vaccination had higher antibody titers at 6 months postvaccination than did con- trol participants (Petrie, Booth, Pennebaker, Davison, & Thomas, 1995). Similarly, college students who were ran- domly assigned to write or talk about a traumatic event had lower EBV antibody titers at the end of the 4-week inter- vention while students in a control condition showed no such reduction (Esterling, Antoni, Fletcher, Margulies, & Schneiderman, 1994). Other studies have examined stress management groups that involved elements of social support and emotional dis- closure, as well as a focus on coping or problem solving. In a study of caregivers, those who participated in a stress management group fbr an hour per week for 8 weeks and subsequently received influenza vaccination were more likely to achieve a fourfbld increase in antibody titer than caregivers who did not receive the intervention (Vedhara et al., 2003). A number of studies have examined efI'ects of cognilive-behavioral stress management inlerventions among HlV-infected and at-risk gay men. Such interven- tions have resulted in decreases in HSV-2 and EBV anti- body titers, indicating improved control of latent vit'uses (Carrico et al., 2005; Esterling et al., 1992 Lutgendorf et al.. 1997). Stress reduction through relaxation and meditation has also been examined. In a study of 45 older adults, those ran- domized to relaxation training (3 practices/week for I month) exhibited decreased HSV-1 antibody titers and less distress at the end of the intervention, whereas no such changes were seen among control participants (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1985). Reductions seen in HSV-I were maintained at I -month follow-up. A more recent study demonstrated that meditation is a promising intervention strategy. In a study of 48 heaithy adults, those who completed an 8-week meditation interven- tion prior to receiving influenza vaccination exhibited better antibody responses to vaccination compared with a waiting- list control group. The meditation group also demonstrated decreased trait anxiety and increased left-sided brain activa- tion, presumably reflecting more positive affect (Davidson et al., 2003). In addition, a recent study examined effects of tai chi, which involves physical activity as well as meditation (Irwin, Olmstead, & Oxman, 2001). A group of I l2 older adults completed either a 16-week tai chi intervention or ahealth education group. At the end of the intervention, par- ticipants in both groups received a varicella-zoster virus (YZY) vaccine. VZV antibody levels were measured at the conclusion of the intervention, and following vaccination. Remarkably, tai chi alone resulted in increases in VZV- specific imrnunity equivalent to that conf-erred by vaccina- tion. Moreover. tai chi in combination with vaccination had an additive effect. Thus. participants in the tai chi interven- tion group exhibited greater VZV-specific cell-meditated immunity than the health education group both at the end of the l6-week intervention and 9 weeks after the vacci- nation. Participants in the tai chi intervention group also showed significant improvements in mental health as mea- sured by the SF-36, a quality-of-1i1'e index. SUMMARY Stressors ranging in magnitude and duration afl-ect clini- cally meaningful health outcomes including inflammation. wound healing, and responses to viruses. Effects of stress on neuroendocrine parameters via the SAM and HPA axes play a primary mechanistic role in the link between stress and immune variables. In addition, mediators that are beyond the scope ofthis chapter are also implicated in this complex system (e.g., opioids, growth hormones, neuro- peptides). Future studies should aim to more clearly deiin- eate the multiple and complex neuroendocrine pathways linking stress to immune outcomes. We have focused on physiological mediators in the link between psychological factors and immune outcomes. However, behavior change resulting fiom stress also plays an important role. The appropriate measurement and con- trol of health behaviors will continue to be important lbr studies seeking to elucidate physiological pathways link- ing psychological factors with neuroendocrine and immune function. This is especially true for research with patients experiencing chronic illness ars they may show consider- able variability in terms of health behaviors including medication adherence, sleep, and diet. Research to date indicates that age and stress interact to produce more significant irnmunological and neuroen- docrine changes among older adults. An important area of future research is the examination of how early devel- opmental experiences may set the stage tbr vulnerability in later life; psychosocial stressors during f'etal clevelop- ment and early life can have lasting effects on physiology (Graham, Christian, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2006b). A contin- ued emphasis on understanding the interactive effects of stress and age throughout the life span will contribute to our understanding of the clinical significance of stress- related immune dvsresulation.---r There have been successful attempts to intervene in stress processes to benefit immune_related health outcomes. Such interventions include stress management, meclitation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, dietary changes, psychotherapy, and antidepressant medications. In addition, social support can provide an important buffer fiom the efTects of stress on health. In future research, an increased emphasis on the identification of physiological mechanisms underlying successful interventions would be ofgreat value. Over the past 25 years, research examining effects of stress on immune outcomes has grown dramatically. A continued emphasis on appropriately controlling fbr: behav_ ioral variables, delineating physiological signiticance of noted physioiog_ ical alterations will contribute to future advances.
