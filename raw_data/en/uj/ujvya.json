Common Symptoms Chiropractic May Help... Benefits of Acupuncture Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific acupuncture points. These acupoints are points along meridians or lines of the body found to have certain effects when stimulated. Energy and fluids, including blood and lymph, flow through these points and meridians. When a blockage of these fluids occurs, dysfunction and pain can exist. Acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy and fluids by diffusing lactic acid and carbon monoxide that accumulates in muscle tissue that causes stagnation of blood. This stiffness and stagnation of blood creates abnormal pressure on nerves, lymph nodes, and blood vessels, which adversely affects the function of the skeletal system and internal organs. Acupuncture also stimulates the release of neurotransmitters and biochemicals that promote healing and reduced pain. All of these effects combine to promote healing of tissues and injuries as well as physical and emotional well-being. Acupuncture produces minimal pain and is tolerated very well by most patients. Acupuncture treats several conditions including back pain, neck pain, headaches, sciatica, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel, knee pain, shoulder pain, jaw pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, allergies, sinus problems, plantar fasciitis, and many more! Benefits of Massage Therapy Having a massage does more than just relax your body and mind - there are specific physiological and psychological changes which occur, even more so when massage is utilized as a preventative, frequent therapy and not simply mere luxury. Massage not only feels good, but it can cure what ails you. Health benefits of massage therapy include increased relaxation and decreased anxiety, lowers blood pressure, increased circulation, improves recovery from injury, helps you to sleep better and can increase your concentration. It reduces fatigue and gives you more energy to handle stressful situations. Massage offers a drug-free, non-invasive and humanistic approach based on the body's natural ability to heal itself.
