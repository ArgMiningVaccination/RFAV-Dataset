La Experiencia Inmersiva gratitud sensaci\u00f3n de claridad Celebrar de Ceremony: Cacao Ceremony is a heart-opening ritual that can be traced all the way back to the Mayas and the Aztecs 5000 years ago. It is a ritual that involves drinking cacao in its purest form, sometimes with spices like cinnamon, clove, cayenne pepper, and vanilla. The ancient civilization of the Amazon used this plant-based drink as a rite of passage, at gathering like the coming of age, marriage, a mother giving birth, community gatherings during auspicious times like the change of seasons, harvest feasts, and eclipses, and even during death rituals this ceremony was performed. Nowadays, a Cacao Ceremony is becoming a more popular ritual, especially in yoga communities, because they provide spaces for people to connect with each other in new ways, and they are an opportunity to reconnect with ancient parts of ourselves that remember the simple power of gathering together in community. Gathering together to drink cacao can create healing, connection, and inspiration. Engaging with chocolate (yes, Chocolate is from Cacao!) as a ritual, rather than consuming it as candy, has a direct positive impact on our individual well-being as well as our global ecosystem. Health Benefits of Cacao: - Rich in Antioxidants, 40 times more than Blueberries - Cacao packs in more calcium than cow's milk - Highest Plant-Based Source of Iron and Protein - Full of Magnesium for a Healthy Heart & Brain, Good sleep, and Better Digestion - Cacao has Theobromine which gives you a \"clean energy\" boost without the crash, it is a healthy substitute for coffee and caffeinated drink - A Natural Mood Elevator. Drinking cacao regularly stimulates neurotransmitters such as Serotonin and Dopamine Sound Bath: Healing with sound happens by matching frequencies to those that are conducive to healing and relaxation. The sound frequency and the vibrations stimulate the brain and the Vagus nerve system so when your body and mind are relaxed, the brain will release happy chemicals (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin, and Endorphins), and a higher Vagal tone makes your body better at regulating blood glucose levels, reducing the likelihood of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The immune system is at its best when we are relaxed. The sound can have physiological effects because its vibrations are not merely heard but also felt, and vibrations can lower heart rate, relax brain wave patterns and reduce respiratory rates. When the heart rate is relatively steady, and breathing is deep and slow, stress hormones decrease, said Dr. Mitchell L. Gaynor, an oncologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York and the author of \"The Healing Power of Sound.\" That is significant because stress can depress every aspect of the immune system. It's all a matter of the frequencies of the body being out of tune, off balance, out of synch, and vibration can help bring that back into balance. \"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration. - Nikola Tesla\" The human body is made of 70% water so the vibration initiated by the Measured Strike Technique causes waves that penetrate deeply into tissues and the process is effective but not vigorous. The vibrations are similar to those of the brain's alpha waves, and they oscillate with an energetically high frequency, like that of the \"Om\" mantra. The sound of the singing bowls has an effect on brain-wave frequencies and can help bring the brain into a Theta state within minutes (Theta waves occur during REM sleep, hypnosis, and deep meditation). At the same time, the vibrations that emit from the bowls provide a cellular massage. Those who undergo a state of deep relaxation often report a feeling of mental freshness that they carry with them after the session is over: - Reduce Stress and Improve Sleep - Aid in Depression and Anxiety - Reduce Pain and Discomfort - Improve Circulation and Blood Flow - Facilitate Meditation and Deep Relaxation - Stimulate the Immune System Meditating with singing bowls reduces blood pressure more than meditation alone, according to Human Activation Science. Those who undergo a state of deep relaxation often report a feeling of mental freshness that they carry with them after the session is over.
