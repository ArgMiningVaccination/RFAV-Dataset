Your primary care team consists of a Primary Care Provider (PCP), a Nurse (RN), a Medical Assistant (MA), and a Care Coordinator (CC). Your PCP is who you see for yearly check ups. They can prescribe medications, order preventative care tests that screen for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, or order referrals if you need specialty care. Your RN supports your provider in procedures, provides complex care coordination support and health education. Your MA can take your vitals, room you for your appointments, and do phlebotomy (take your blood for lab testing). Your Care Coordinator assists with navigating referrals, doing paperwork, enrolling you in support services, and changing identity documents. We also have Therapists, a Psychiatrist, Case Managers, a Physical Therapist an Acupuncturist, an Electrologist, a Speech Therapist, and Outreach & Harm Reduction Coordinators on staff who help us provide more in depth wrap around services. Though we integrate gender affirming methods into all care we provide at Lyon-Martin, we use the term \"Gender Affirming Care\" to talk about services that are meant to help with gender transition for trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, or intersex people. We try to minimize as many barriers as possible to accessing Gender Affirming Care by using an [informed consent model](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/informed-consent-medical-care-transgender-and-gender-nonconforming-patients/2016-11); this means we center gender self-determination and do not require Endocrinologists or Mental Health Providers to approve your access to Gender Affirming Care. Only you know what is best for you and your body, and we will do what we can to partner with you and support you in achieving your gender transition goals on your path of self-discovery and self-realization. Most surgeons and insurance companies continue to require letters of support and official clearances from medical and mental health providers to be able to access surgery. While we do not agree with these requirements ethically, we do offer these services to help our clients access life-saving gender affirming surgeries and care. "}
