Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 3 Introduction The health and economic crises brought on by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic has made the federal nutrition programs more important than ever. An unacceptably high number of people in America do not have enough to eat , and it is likely that the economic recovery for families who struggle to put food on the table will take years. Recovery will be particularly challenging for those groups that have suffered disproportionate harm from COVID -19. Inequities, also referred to as disparities, \"adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles [...] based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, disability; sexu al orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.\"1 Unlike differences, inequities are the result of the unfair distribution of resources due to structural factors. Struct ural factors include governing processes and economic and social policies that affect wages and earnings, employment opportunities and working conditions, and access to affordable housing and quality education.2 These structural factors lead to systemic injustices in food insecurity, poverty, and health. The goals of this review are to examine the connections between hunger , poverty, health, and equity during COVID -19, and to discuss the role of the federal nutrition programs in the recovery from the pand emic. Th is white paper begins with the linkages between hunger , poverty, and health during COVID -19. It then details how COVID -19 has exacerbated disparities that predated the pandemic due to systemic injustices . This paper follows with a review of new research on how the federal nutrition programs reduce hunger, poverty, and health, including initial findings on their efficacy during the pandemic . The paper then concludes with policy recommendations to leverage the federal nutrition programs for a robust and equitable recovery . Key Findings Increased hardship . Due to COVID -19, t he sudden increase in unemployment and financial hardship led to unacceptably high levels of food insecurity . From 2019 to 2020 , there were 3 million more people living in households that reported food insecurity (lack of access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life in the prior 12 months).3 Financial hardship has made it more difficult to afford other essential n eeds, like medication and housing. COVID -19 was the third -leading cause of death in 2020 and also delayed medical care , which will have long -term impacts on well -being. COVID -19 amplified already unacceptable rates of hunger and has exacerbated disparities that differ according to population . The economic and public health crises from COVID -19 have had disproportionate impacts in certain communities following preexisting disparities in hunger, poverty, and health. Understanding how the root causes of these disparities differ by community is critical when implementing policy solutions . For example, prior to COVID -19, Latinx communities experienced increased discrimination from immigration enforcement and the 2019 public charge rule (blocked permanently in March 2021 ), resulting in the distrust of public services. This has had important implications for program participation and access to vaccines during COVID -19. The federal nutrition programs have played a key role in reducing hardship during the pandemic. The social safety net, including expansions to the federal nutrition programs, contributed to mitigating a spike in hunger during the pandemic . Research indicates that benefits from the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program have reduced food insufficiency among households with children, that flexibilities in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ( WIC ) have bee n crucial in maintaining and increasing access to program benefits , and that the Supp lemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP ) has been one of the most effective anti - poverty program s during the pandemic . Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 4 Federal Nutrition Program Description s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 4 (SNAP) SNAP is the largest food program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and it serves as the nation's first defense against hunger . SNAP is an entitlement program and provides benefits to eligible applicant s on Electron ic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards for purchasing food from authorized SNAP retailers. A household's benefits are determined based on the household 's size and income. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children 5 (WIC) WIC provid es eligible low -income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children up to 5 years old with supplemental nutritious foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to health care. WIC is a discretionary program with a set budget. Participants are eligible , based on income , or automatically eligible if a family receives benefits from SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or Medicaid . School Breakfast Program6 (SBP) and National School Lunch Program7 (NSLP) SBP and NSLP provide reimbursements for healthy breakfast s and lunches served to children each school day. Any child that attends a school offering school meals can participate, but meals are provided at no cost or at a reduced price to children based on their household income, and some high -needs schools are able to offer free school meals to all students. Child and Adult Care Food Program8 (CACFP) CACFP is a program that p rovides healthy meals and snacks to child care centers, family child care homes, afterschool programs, adult daycare, and homeless shelters. Eligibility is determined at the facility level so that all attending children receive meals and snacks. Summer Food Service Program9 (SFSP) SFSP provides free meals and snacks to children 18 and under when school is not in session. Sites are located in communities where at least half of the children are from families with incomes at or below 185 of the federal poverty level ( FPL) or primarily serve children from families with low incomes . The Seamless Summer Option10 (SSO) is an alternative program for schools to provide free meals and snacks in low -income areas. The meals served through SSO must follow the nutrition standards and guidelines for the federal National School Lunch Program . Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer11 (P-EBT) P-EBT provides benefits to help replace the free and reduced -price school meals that children lost access to when schools closed in response to the pandemic. Families rec eive money on a new or existing EBT card to help fill the meals gap. Young children whose households participate in SNAP and who have lost access to free or reduced -price school meals and/or child care meals due to school and child care facility closures or reduced in - person hours became eligible for benefits during fiscal year 2021. Home -Delivered Meals Program and Congregate Nutrition Program The home -delivered meals and congregate nutrition programs p rovide adults age s 60 or older with meals via delivery to place s of residence or group meals at participating sites. Older American s Act funding is capped and is not intended to reach every eligible individual. Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) FDPIR is a unique program that provides access to food to low -income American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) families who do not have easy access to grocery stores through the delivery of food boxes. Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 5 Food Insecurity During COVID -19 Food insecurity is the primary measure of food hardship , which is associated with chronic disease and poor mental health.12 Food insecurity is fundamentally due to insufficient resources to meet basic needs, making it a reliable ind icator of economic hardship.13,14 Official estimates of food insecurity are released every September from the Census Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS - FSS) . In 2020, 10.5 percent of households , representing 38 million people, reported being food insecure sometime during the year .15 To track hardship in real time during COVID -19, the Census has fielded the biweekly Household Pulse Survey (Pulse) , which includes questions on \"food insufficiency.\"16 In addition to Pulse, a variety of data sources have been used to assess pandemic food hardship.17 Regardless of the source, studies have found that food hardship increased during COVID -19 and has been higher among people who have been systemically oppresse d because of their race, ethnicity, or both; households with children ; and families with at least one household member who has lost their job. 18,19,20,21,22,23,24 This report uses data from three sources : 2019 CPS -FSS data for trends prior to COVID -19, and 2020 CPS -FSS data, as well as 2020 -2021 Pulse data, for trends during COVID -19. \"Hunger\" will refer to the umbrella concept of food hardship, which can be measured as either food insecurity or food insu fficiency.25 Food insecurity: \"Households were, at times, unable to acquire adequate food for one or more household members because they lacked the money and other resources for food.\" Food insecurity is further divided into low food security, primarily th e reduced quality of food ; and very low food security, the reduced quality and quantity of food. Food insufficiency: \"Sometimes\" or \"often\" not having enough to eat. Because this implies disrupted eating patterns, food insufficiency is analogous to very lo w food security. Although food insufficiency is a more severe condition than food insecurity, d ifferences between the CPS -FSS and Pulse surveys26 mean that food insecurity and food insufficiency data are not directly comparable .27,28 More research is needed to understand the dynamics of food insecurity and other food hardship during the pandemic .29 See Appendix A for more details about the differences between CPS -FSS and Pulse.

Figure 1: Understanding Food Security Versus Food Sufficiency Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 6 Linkages Between Hunger , Poverty , and Health During COVID -19 Hunger is part of a larger feedback cycle between poor health outcomes and poverty. The COVID -19 pandemic has applied unique pressures to these relationships, while hunger , poor health outcomes, and poverty simultaneously increase the risk of COVID -19 transmission, infection, and morbidi ty.30,31 Figure 2: Linkages Between Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 COVID -19 Worsens Hunger, Poverty, and Health Hunger has increased . From 2019 to 2020, household food insecurity remained constant at 10.5 percent, but the percent age of individuals living in food -insecure households increased from 10.9 to 11.8 percent, or by 3 million people . Food insecurity also increased among households with children, from 13.6 percent in 2019 to 14.8 percent in 2020 (see Figure 3). In addition, racial and ethnic disparities in household food insecurity increased.32 Data from Pulse show significant variation s in food insufficiency throughout the pandemic. Food insufficiency rose to a peak of 13. 7 percent for all households in late December 2020 (18. 3 percent for households with children) before dropping to 7.8 percent for all households (9.5 percent for households with children ) in August 202133 (see Figure 4) . Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 7 Figure 3: Food Insecurity Among Households With Children (CPS -FSS) Figure 4: Food Insuf ficiency Rates Among U.S. Households During COVID -19, August 2020-August 2021 (Pulse) There are several reasons for the high rates of food insecurity. Unemployment, underemployment, and housing instability all lead to greater food insecurity. Below is a list of some reasons that are directly related to impacting access to healthy food . Higher prices : Early in the pandemic, initial food hoarding and supp ly chain disruption increased food prices and made it especially difficult for older adults and low - income families to obtain food.34 From March to April of 2020, the price of food at home increased by 1.5 percent, which was the largest monthly increase since 1974 and a stark contrast to the overall index for inflation which declined by 0.8 percent .35 Food prices never came back down. In April 2021, food prices were 2.4 percent higher than during the April 2020 spike .36 Isolation : Social distanc ing has made it more difficult for people to rely on their social networks, including family and community organizations, for food and support.37,38 School, afterschool, summer, and child care program closures : Remote learning has resulted in the loss of n ormal access to meals through the School Breakfast Program (SBP), the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP ), increasing the financial burden for these families to provide food.39,40 P-EBT has helped millions of families, but a permanent program with a predictable structure is needed to avoid these challenges in the future . Poverty would have increased without federal aid . Monthly poverty rates41 have fallen with the distribution of federal economic aid in response to the pandemic .42,43 Poverty rates peaked at 17 percent in August 2020 before declining to 1 2 percent in July 2021 .44 (see Figure 5) Federal aid, therefore, has been critical in mitigating the economic hardship during the pandemic; however, families have struggle d during the pandemic . Parents have had to reduce hours or leave the workforce to provide care due to school and daycare closures.45 Indivi duals hospitalized due to COVID -19 face medical expenses that can amount to thousands of dollars, even with health Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 8 insurance, and surviving family members of the deceased are burdened with medical bills.46 A much larger percentage of home owners have entered loan forbearance ( the high est was 8.6 percent in June 2020 compared to 0.3 percent in February 2020)47 and a high percent age of renters previously had or currently have rental debt as of January 2021 (1 6 and 8 percent , respectively).48 While the Census Pulse Survey does not track poverty, it does track financial hardship, defined as a household finding it somewhat or very difficult to pay for usual expenses. Financial hardship peaked in December 2020 at 37.5 percent of all households and almost half (45.4 percent) of households with children.49 Providers , a mobile app serving about 5 million SNAP users,50 has fielded surveys since March 2020 about hardship during the pandemic. As of June 2021, 73 percent of surveyed SNAP users reported owing on utilities or other bills, only 45 percent were able to pay rent on time, and 46 percent reported having less than $25 on hand.51 \"Rent, uti lities, and food. Can't pick just one. Families are struggling in all categories. We catch up on one thing to fall behind in the other to then be in complete debt by the time you get back around to the first bill.\"52 Poor health has increased . COVID -19 was the third -leading cause of death in 2020.53 For survivors, there are indications of persistent damage to cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological and psychological health, even among those patients with mild cases.54 Economic and social conditions of the pandemic have also led to an increase in mental health challenges. Essential workers, unpaid caregivers, and parents have been more likely to report poor mental health. 55,56 The loss of employment or a cut in benef its during the pandemic has also resulted in a loss of employer -sponsored health insurance.57,58,59 The lack of health care has caused both individuals with Figure 5: Monthly Poverty Rate During COVID -19 Source: Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Poverty60 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 9 COVID -1961 and with unrelated medical conditions62 to delay seeking care, leading to increased complications and costs. Preventive visits, including vaccinations for other diseases, have also declined, which worsens the management of current diseases as well as early diagnosis of disease onset.63,64,65,66 \"[The biggest challenges and concerns for me and my family right now are] the loss of second income, childcare, isolation, depression/anxiety. Feeling like I won't be mentally stable enough to care for my child.\"67 Hunger , Poverty, and Poor Health Increase COVID -19 Risks Hunger increases risk of exposure to COVID -19. Individuals living in low -income households have not been able to shelter in place for a variety of reasons, including to access food, which then increases their risk of exposure to COVI D-19. Participants using SNAP have been able to use their EBT cards for online shopping as states have expanded online pilot projects , although options were limited early in the pandemic.68 Poverty increases risk of exposure to COVID -19. Individuals who live in poverty are more likely to live in crowded or unstable housing and rely on public transportation, both of which are associated with elevated risk of exposure to COVID - 1969,70 and death.71 In addition, low -wage work is less likely t o be adaptable to working from home, which has resulted in either job loss or in increased exposure and risk through \"essential jobs,\"72 particularly those jobs without paid leave.73 One of the most effective tools in slowing the spread of COVID -19 has bee n decreased social interaction , yet communities with low -income s were less able to use this tool and comply with shelter -in-place mandates in the early months of the pandemic .74 Poor health increases susceptibility to COVID -19. Both a weaker immune system and chronic diseases increase susceptibility to COVID - 19 and its complications.75 An estimated 45 percent of Americans are at risk from severe COVID -19 complications due to a preexisting chronic disease (ranging from 19 percent of adults ages 19 -29 and 80 percent of adults over 80).76 Diseases with the highest risks include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.77 The association between obesity and severe COVID -19-related illness is particularly strong among adults younger than 65.78 These risk factors also impact immune system response to a vaccine,79 which may reduce the effectiveness of the COVID -19 vaccine.80,81 Linkages: Hunger, Poverty, and Health are Interrelated Hunger and health . The relationship between food insecurity and physical and mental health is reciprocal. Food insecurity drives poor health outcomes in two ways. First, food insecurity is associated with poor diet and nutrient deficiencies ,82,83,84,85 and depression and anxiety,86,87,88 which all lead to an impaired immune system.89,90 Second, food insecurity, particularly chronic food insecurity, is associated with chronic diseases , including kidney disease, obesity, cardiovascular disease , and diabetes.91,92,93,94 Poor health and disability, in turn, can make it more difficult for ind ividuals to obtain healthy foods.95,96,97 Food insecurity is also associated with poor health and educational outcomes among children,98 even when children are only marginally food insecure.99 This may be due to the direct effects of food insecurity or du e to other circumstances of living in food -insecure households. This means that any prolonged food insecurity among children during the COVID -19 pandemic and recovery will have implications over the life course for affected children. Hunger and poverty . Food is a flexible expense and, as such , is often one of the first expenses to be cut when households are faced with financial hardship.100,101 Food insecurity rates increase due to job loss102 or an increase in expenses, for example, rent103 or energy bills.104 At the same time, food insecurity can lead to chronic disease, which can make it difficult to maintain employment.105 Food - insecure adults are more likely to be unable to maintain a reliable source of medical care, leading to a higher l ikelihood of hospitalization106 and higher health care expenditures, placing a larger strain on household budgets .107,108 Debt associated Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 10 with medical bills is associated with an increased risk of household food insecurity.109 During COVID - 19, many households have been struggling with financial hardship.110 A March 2021 survey found that 1 in 8 adults had cut back on food in order to pay for health care in the previous 12 months.111 Adults with low income s report being forced to decide between food and other necessities : \"... if I paid the medical bills we wouldn't eat, and it's basically a choice between going into horrific debts and having people look at you horribly and have your credit score tank because you can't pay your medical bills or feed your child.\"112 During COVID -19, remote learning has exacerbated these decisions for families with children facing higher food costs: \"I've had to stop taking blood pressure medication because I have to feed my kids who are now home schooling because of the pandemic.\"113 Health and poverty . Poverty has been one of the most consistent correlates of poor health. Lack of income and/or wealth often signifies the lack of the material resources needed for good health, lik e food security, safe housing, and educational opportunities.114,115,116 Low -income individuals are also more likely to be uninsured or underinsured.117 When individuals require medical treatment, lack of income makes it more likely that individuals will underuse medication in order to pay bills and afford food,118,119 making it more difficult to maintain control of a disease. Poor health, in turn, makes it more difficult to focus on education and/or maintain employment, creating the \"health - poverty trap.\"120,121 For example, poor mental health and chronic disease are associated with unemployment.122 COVID -19 has caused people to make difficult decisions between keeping a job to maintain economic stability or sheltering in place to protect their families' health. \"It's readily apparent that [going to work] is a risk, but , you know, I have to stick my neck out for my family to make sure we can pay the bills and keep everything cranking away.\"123 \"My husband [...] received a 50 percent pay cut ... I will more than likely need to get a job to supplement our income, but we can't put our son in daycare due to him being high risk for serious complications from COVID -19.\"124 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 11 COVID -19 Exacerbate s Disparities The economic and public health crises from COVID -19 have exacerbated disparities in food insecurity and other indicators of health and social stability that existed before the pandemic . For example, prior to COVID -19, food insecurity had been higher among households near or below the poverty line, households with children ( particularly single -parent households or households with teenagers125), Black, Latinx, and Native households, and households either in large cities or in rural areas.126,127 Understanding the context of disparities prior to the pandemic will help identify how the federal nutrition programs fit into the broader range of interventions that are needed to prevent unnecessary hardship in the recovery from COVID - 19 and promote long -term well-being . A. Race and Ethnicity Overview of COVID -19 disparities by race and e thnicity Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID -19 cases and deaths have persisted over the course of the pandemic.128,129,130,131 Using data through March 2, 2021, the Color of Coronavirus Project reported that the death rates per 100,000 people were 256 American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people, 180 Black people, 177 Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) people, 150 White people, 147 Latinx people, and 96 Asian people.132 When these rates are adjusted for age, disparities in death rates become even more pronounced. COVID -19 has not been concentrated among older adults within Black and Latinx populations.133 Age- adjustment corrects for the fact that the White population has a higher proportion of older individuals compared to other rac ial/ethnic groups. If the age distribution of all rac ial/ethnic groups were the same, the death rates per 100,000 people would have been 401 AIAN people, 312 NHPI people, 287 Latinx people, 241 Black people, 121 White people and 117 Asian people in March 2021 .134 As a result of dying at younger ages , Black and Latinx communities have experienced more years of potential life lost due to COVID -19 than in predominantly White communitie s,135 even though there are 4.5 times as many White people as Black people and three times as many White people as Latinx people.136 While adults have been more likely to contract COVID -19, these racial disparities are also found among children, teenagers, and young adults. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report ,137 using 2020 data from 15 states and Washington, D.C. , found disparities in COVID -19 infection rates in youth by race and ethnicity. Figure 6: U.S. COVID -19 Deaths per 100,000, by Race/Ethnicity, December 2020-March 2021 Systemic Racism The same structu ral factors that lead to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID -19 health outcomes,138 including COVID -19 vaccination rates,139,140 are also related to disparities in food insecurity. The figure below is from a 2018 report by Bread for the World .141 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 12 Figure 7: Barriers Disproportionately Faced by Communities Systemically Oppressed Based on their Race or Ethnicit y A.1. Black Communities Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In 2019, 19.1 percent of Black households were food insecure (7.6 percent had very low food security), compared to 7.9 percent of White households (3.3 percent had very low food security).142 Poverty : In 2019, Black people experienced a poverty rate143 of 18.8 percent, compared to 9.1 percent among White people144 (the Supplemental Poverty Measure was 18.3 percent among Black people and 10.5 percent among White people145). Even after accounting for education and experience, Black adults are paid lower wages146 and are less likely to be employed147 than White adults, e specially during economic recessions.148 Due to occupational segregation,149 Black adults also are more likely to be essential workers150 and less likely to be represented in higher -paying professional occupations.151 In addition, the wealth gap means Black families have less financial stability to buffer against a loss of income. In 2019, a typical White family owned $184,000, while a typical Black family owned only $23,000.152 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 13 Systemic Racism and Food Insecurity in Black Communities Food insecurity is one of the many disparities that stem from racial injustice. Systemic racism has resulted in Black -White disparities in education, housing, economic stability, incarceration rates, and access to health care.153,154 The effects of structural racism on food insecurity rates show up within each of these systems. For example, Black school -age students are more likely to rely on free or reduced -price school meal s programs than White students.155 Residential segregation and continued governmental a nd commercial disinvestment mean that majority -Black neighborhoods are less likely to have supermarkets and more likely to have fast -food stores.156 Decades of discriminatory policies from government agencies and lending institutions have resulted in fewer Black farmers and the loss of Black -owned farmland.157 Health : Disparities in social determinants of health limit disease prevention and treatment among Black individuals,158 resulting in higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID -19 infection and mortality (e.g., diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure ) and lower access to health insurance .159,160,161 In addition, unethical experimentation and medical mistreatment162 have led to a health care system that has been \"untrustworthy to [Black] Americans .\"163 The cumulative effects of racism have resulted in persistent disparities in overall mortality . This l oss of life has been even greater than t he effects of COVID -19. Even after accounting for COVID -19 deaths, all-cause mortality among White individuals in the U .S. in 2020 was still lower than any all-cause mortality rate Black individuals ha d ever experienced prior to COVID -19 pandemic .164 \"At every level of income and education, there is still an effect of race [on health].\" - Dr. Williams, Professor of Public Health at Harvard University165 During COVID -19 Hunger : According to the CPS -FSS, i n 2020, 21.7 percent of Black households were food insecure (8 percent with very low food security), compared to 7.1 percent of White households ( 3 percent with very low food security).166 This Black -White disparity increased by 3.5 percentage points from 2019 to 2020. In the Pulse data, Black adults have reported the highest rates of food insufficiency compared to other racial and ethnic groups throughout COVID -19, ranging from a high of 25 percent in December ( compared to a national rate of 14 percent) to a low of 14 percent in April 2021 (compared to a national rate of 8 percent) .167 Figure 8: Disproportionately High Rates of Food Insufficiency Among Black Households During COVID -19 Poverty : Disparities in poverty have been exacerbated during the pandemic, although government programs have helped mitigate them . In January 2020, the Black -White disparity in poverty was 12.6 percentage points , increasing to a high of 14 perce ntage points in August 2020 , but decreas ing to 8 percentage points by July 2021.168 Despite this decrease, disparities are still l arge. As of August 2021, 4 4 percent of Black adults sometimes or often had trouble paying for usual household expenses compared to 2 1 percent of White adults .169 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 14 Job recovery has also been slower for Black adults. Despite a sharper increase in unemployment early in the pandemic, Black adults have been reem ployed at lower rates.170 By the end of 2020 , the unemployment rate for Black people increased by 4.5 percentage points, while the unemployment rate for White people increased by 2.8 percentage points .171 As of August 2021, the Black unemployment rate was 8. 8 percent, 4.3 percentage points higher than the White unemployment rate.172 However, u nemployment rates do not capture the full disparity in joblessness. Black workers had to leave the workforce at much higher rates than White workers, removing them from being counted as unemployed even if they prefer red to be working.173 Health : As of September 1 , 2021, Black Americans represented 1 5 percent of all COVID -19 deaths , despite representing only 12. 5 percent of the population.174 After adjusting for age, Black Americans have been twice as likely to die of COVID -19 than White Americans.175 At the state and county level, a higher proportion of Black residents has been associated with increased COVID -19 rates , an association that holds true even after adjusting for county -level characteristics , including age, poverty, comorbidities, and the duration of the pandemic.176,177,178,179 As of August 2021, only 40 percent of Black people were vaccinated in 40 of 42 states reporting data by race and ethnicity ,180 due to factors such as lack of access to a trusted health care provider , a lack of vaccination clinics in Black neighborhoods, disparities in internet access, and lack of flexibility in work hours.181,182 A.2. Latinx Communities Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In 2019, 15.6 percent of Latinx183 households were food insecure ( 4.9 percent with very low food security), compared to 7.9 percent of White households (3.3 percent with very low food security).184 Rates of food insecurity have varied within the Latinx community , with higher rates among Mex icans and Puerto Ricans compared to Cubans.185 In addition, Latinx immigrants are more likely to be food insecure than Latinx individuals born in the U.S.186 Latinx households with mixed immigrant status participate in SNAP and other social safety net programs at lower rates than the national average .187,188 In addition, fear during the Trump administration that accessing SNAP and other public benefits would categorize immigrants as a \"public charge,\" and thereby disqualify th em from obtaining a green card, had a chilling effect on participation and undermined food security.189,190 This 2019 rule was reversed in March 2021.191 Poverty : In 2019, the poverty rate among Latinx populations was 15.7 percent, compared to a national average of 10.5 percent and 9.1 percent among White populations192 (the S upplemental Poverty Measure was 18.9 percent among Latinx populations and 10.5 percent amon g White population s193). Occupational segregation has led to disproportionate representation of Latinx workers in essential jobs that cannot be done remotely194,195 and a Latinx -White wage gap that has not narrowed since 2000.196 Wealth inequality is also problematic; in 2019, a typical White family owned $184,000, while a typical Latinx family owned only $38,000.197 Health : Latinx communities have disproportionately high rates of COVID -19-related comorbidities, such as obesity, non -alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes.198,199 In 2018, 23 percent of employed Latinx workers did not have health insurance. This rate was even higher among Latinx workers in jobs requiring close cont act, where 28 percent did not have insurance when compared to 10 percent of White worker s in similar jobs.200 Latinx workers who are undocumented make up 5 percent of the workforce and are not eligible for federal health insurance or SNAP.201 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 15 Systemic Racism and Food Insecurity in Latinx Communities The Latinx community in the U.S. is particularly impacted by the structural racism inherent in the immigration enforcement system.202 Latinx immigrants make up 79 percent of the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S.203 Latinx communities are targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose activity has increased in recent years204 and regularly, and incorrectly, detains U.S. citizens as well.205,206 Deportations of parents result in economic disadvantage and trauma among family members who remain in the U.S.207,208, 209,210 In addition, empowering local law enforcement to carry out federal immigration laws has been associated with an increase in food ins ecurity.211 Fear of deportation, due to ICE or the police, reduces economic activity in communities and increases mistrust of health services and public agencies, which results in lower enrollment in social services , like SNAP , that could alleviate poverty and food insecurity.212,213 During COVID -19 Hunger : According to the CPS -FSS, in 2020, 17.2 percent of Latinx households were food insecure ( 5 percent with very low food security), compared to 7.1 percent of White households ( 3 percent with very low food security).214 This disparity increased by 2.4 percentage points from 2019 to 2020. In the Pulse data, food insufficiency ranged from a high of 21 percent in December (compared to a national rate of 14 percent) to a low of 1 1 percent in July 2021 (compared to a national rate of 8 percent).215 This hardship has mental health consequences . In May 2020, Latinx adults were more likely to report poor mental health due to not having food or stable housing th an other racial and ethnic groups.216 Figure 9: Disproportionately High Rates of Food Insufficiency Among Latinx Households During COVID -19 Poverty : In January 2020, the Latinx -White disparity in poverty was 12.5 percentage points.217 This increased to a high of 15.2 percentage points in August 2020. The Latinx -White disparity remained high at 7.5 percentage points in July 2021. This may be due, in par t, to having limit ed access to federal stimulus programs by immigration status through 2020. Similar hardship is reflected in the Pulse data; in August 2021, 39 percent of Latinx adults sometimes or often had trouble paying usual household expenses, compared to 2 1 percent of White adults.218 Latinx workers have been at higher risk of job loss during the pandemic due to disproportionate representation in hourly wag e and gig jobs in industries , including the food, hospitality, and retail sectors . Between February and April 2020 , Latinx employment fell by 18 percentage points , whereas White unemployment decreased by 12 percentage points.219 By the end of 2020, the unem ployment rate for Latinx workers increased by 4.7 percentage points (2.8 percentage points for White worker s).220 As of August 2021, Latinx unemployment was 6. 4 percent, 1. 9 percentage points higher than White unemployment.221 Health : As of September 2021, Latinx people represent 1 8.3 percent of all COVID -19 deaths .222 After adjusting for age, Latinx people have been 2.4 times as likely to have died from COVID -19 as White peopl e.223 In addition, as of August 2021, 28 percent of Latinx adults lacked health insurance (11 percent nationwide )224 and only 4 5 percent have been vaccinated.225 Read more: Food Over Fear: Overcoming Barriers to Connect Latinx Immigrant Families to Federal Nutrition and Food Pr ograms .

American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Communities Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : Few studies have focused on food insecurity in Native communities. One study aggregating data from the 2000 -2010 CPS -FSS found that 25 percent of AIAN households were food insecure, twice as likely as White household s.226 It is important to note that experiences across Tribes differ widely. For example, one recent study in 2018 found that food insecurity among the Karuk, Yurok Hoopa, and Klamath Tribes was 9 2 percent.227 Poverty : The poverty rate228 in 2019 among individuals who identified only as AIAN was 23 percent, higher than the poverty rate for any other racial or ethnic group.229 In addition, AIAN individuals who live on Tribal land are more likely to live in severely crowded housing situations and less likely to have access to clean water, sewage disposal, and plumbing .230,231,232Lack of federal support contributes to these gaps in critical infrastructure \u2014 federal spending per person on AIAN U.S. citizens is only two -thirds of the spending on the average U.S. citizen.233 AIAN workers experience disparities in employment. In 2018, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent among AIAN individuals living on or near Tribal lands and 6.6 percent among AIAN individuals not living in Tribal areas, compared to 3.9 percent for the U .S. population.234 AIAN workers were also more likely to be working part time because they could not find full -time work and were more likely to be essential workers or in jobs that ar e not able to be done remotely.235,236 As with food insecurity, unemployment rates differ widely by region. Health : According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, AIAN people are 20 -25 years behind the average American in health status, representing the largest disparity in unmet health care needs.237 Compared to any other racial or ethnic group, Native communities have higher rates of being uninsured and of underlying health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, chronic lower respira tory diseases, and hypertension).238,239 Despite high need , access to health care is poor. The Indian Health Service, the federal agency that provides health care to AIAN people , has been chronically underfunded by the federal government ,240 resulting in ext reme provider shortages and low access to care.241 In addition, Native workers are less likely to have health insurance compared to White worker s, particularly in jobs that require close proximity to others.242 During COVID -19 Hunger : Although only 28 counties have a majority of-AIAN people , 18 of those counties were projected to be in the top 10 percent of counties with the highest food insecurity rates of 2020.243 However, few data on national trends in food insufficiency among AIAN p opulations during COVID -19 exist because AIAN data are not disaggregated in the Census Pulse data. There is evidence that COVID -19 has affected access to healthy foods. During shelter -in-place mandates, AIAN people residing on reservations shopped more frequently in local convenience stores than supermarkets, which have a broader array of health y foods but are further away.244 Systemic Racism and Food Insecurity in AIAN Communities Disparities in food insecurity are a result of the structural racism originating with colonization and continuing to the present.245 Historical traumas have impacted traditional foodways, or the connection between culture, community, and the production and consumption of food. These traumas include the loss of food sovereignty from the forced relocation of AIAN people from ancestral lands, forced cultural assimilation policies, disrupted land management and fractionation, Tribal termination and land privati zation, and the substitution of Native culturally appropriate foods with commodity foods.246,247,248 Barriers to obtaining Native traditional food include permits limiting access to hunting, discriminatory farm -lending practices, fishing or farming and degrad ation of the environment,249,250 while barriers to buying healthy food include the lack of transportation and the higher cost of food in Tribal areas.251 Access to preparing healthy food is limited in those areas lacking electricity or running water. Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 17 Poverty : COVID -19 exacerbated disparities in poverty and un employment. Tribal governments often rely on income from casinos and other tourism to provide health and social services in their communities, and these revenues have dried up during the pandemic. The closure of these businesses to prevent the spread of COVID -19 has resulted in a direct loss of jobs from these businesses as well as the loss of Tribal government jobs and the ability to provide critical services .252,253 At a national level , Native unemp loyment jumped to 14 percentage points higher than White unemployment in April 2020 ,254 with large variation s by location. This has resulted in significant financial hardship. In one survey of 6,460 Native adults in July 2020 , 45 percent of respondents reported that their household's financial situation worsened, and 36 percent reported having their work hours cut or having lost their job due to COVID -19. Among respondents with low income s, these proportions jumped to 60 perce nt and 52 percent respectively .255 Health : As of March 2021, the age -adjusted COVID -19 mortality rate was higher for AIAN people than for any other racial or ethnic group at 265 deaths per 100,000 people , more than twice the rate among White people .256 This reflects that AIAN p eople have contracted COVID -19 at younger ages than White people.257 The loss of Tribal elders has also resulted in the devastating loss of cultural knowledge and language that are typically passed down through oral histories and t raditions.258,259 \"It takes your breath away , the amount of knowledge they held, and connection to our past.\" - Ira Taken Alive of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose parents, grandmother, and uncle died from COVID -19.260 High rates of COVID -19 have been associated with the prevalence of economic underdevelopment and structural inequality in AIAN communities , like the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing ,261,262,263 as well as with environmental racism, like the legacy of uranium mining in Navajo Nation.264 In addition , Tribes and Tribal Epidemiology Centers have not been given access to data from the CDC and local health agencies in a timely manner, denying them critical information required for self -governance and the a bility to respond to the spread of COVID -19 in their communities.265 In spite of these obstacles, quick, proactive, and innovative Tribal responses to COVID -19 have prevented a larger spread of COVID -19 and have resulted in high vaccination rates within communities.266 Read more: Hunger in Native America and Our Resilient Response . A.4. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) Communities Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In the only nationally representative survey of the NHPI population conducted in 2014, 20.5 percent of NHPI adults reported being food insecure in the 30 days prior to the survey, compared to 7.7 percent of White adults.267 Based on these r esults, the surveys ' authors estimate that food insecurity in the prior 12 months (the timeline reported by the annual CPS) would be between 25 - 30 percent of NHPI adults. Poverty : In 2019, the poverty rate among people who identified only as NHPI was 16.5 percent.268 NHPI workers also are more likely to work in jobs with low wages, including as essential worker s, including food preparation, maintenance, health care, and transportation and delivery.269 NHPI are twice as likely to be front -line health care workers compared to other Asian American population s.270 In Hawai i specifically, where about one-quarter of the population identifies as NHPI, 42 percent of households struggled to make ends meet due to the high cost of living ,271 and almost 40 percent of workers were employed in tourism -related sectors272 prior to COVID -19. Health : NHPI individuals have higher rates of chronic illnesses and lower rates of health care access compared to White individuals .273 For example, heart disease is the leading cause of death among NHPI adults ,274 and 20 percent of NHPI adults have heart disease compared to 6.2 percent of adults overall.275 NHPI people also have disproportionately high rates of diabetes and asthma.276 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 18 Systemic Racism and Food Insecurity in NHPI Communities The root causes of inequities in NHPI communities stems from European and American colonialism. Traditional foodways have been disrupted by the introduction of pro cessed and canned foods, while contamination from military exercises have had environmental and health consequences.277 Furthermore, while Native Hawaiians have citizenship status , which affords them access to health care and federal programs, certain Pacif ic Islanders have special worker status but are denied access to most federal and state benefits (e.g., Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands).278 During COVID -19 Hunger : Similar to AIAN populations, few data exist for rates of food insecurity, as available data are not disaggregated in the Census Pulse data for NHPI populations. One July 2020 survey in Hawai i found that food insecurity in the state was 30 percent for Nat ive Hawaiians compared to the sample average of 23 percent.279 Poverty : In a June 2021 nationwide survey of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders , 22 percent of respondents reported losing a job due to COVID -19 at some point in the pande mic.280 The economic impact of COVID -19 has been particularly hard on Hawai i and the Pacific Islands, which are dependent on tourism. The fall in gross domestic product as a result of reduced tourism and trade could cause extreme poverty in the Pacific Isl ands to increase by 40 percent.281 In Hawai i, the drop in tourism282 has resulted in significant job loss.283 Health : Due to their isolation, the Pacific Islands have had relatively low rates of COVID -19 infection and death. However, limited evidence shows t hat NHPI people living in the continental U .S. suffer disproportionately high death rates from COVID - 19. Disaggregated COVID -19 data for the NHPI population are only reported in 21 states for cases and 16 states for deaths. In most of these states, NHPI people have the highest or second -highest per capita case and death rates compared to other racial/ethnic groups.284,285 For example, in California, Pacific Islanders are dying at a rate that is four times their population share.286 However, rates are likely to be undercounted if individuals identifying with more than one race or ethnicity are not included in the NHPI count, as many NHPI individuals identify with more than one race or ethnicity .287,288 In addition, NHPI people have noticed an increase in race - and ethnicity -based discrimination compared to before COVID -19, with 60 percent of Native Hawaiians and 59 percent of Pacific Islanders reporting discrimination.289 Figure 10: Map of COVID -19 Deaths Among Pacific Islanders Through March 2021 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 19 A.5. Asian American Communitie s Compared to other racial and ethnic groups, Asian Americans have experienced lower rates of hardship during the pandemic. However, national rates mask differences by Asian ethnicity and by geography. For example, while Japanese and Filipino Americans have l ow poverty rates, Hmong, Khmer, Laotian, and Vietnamese Americans have higher poverty rates than White Americans.290 While COVID -19 mortality rates on average have been lower for Asian Americans compared to White American s, they have been higher in states such as Nevada, Utah, and Nebraska.291 Discrimination and xenophobia have also increased during the pandemic due to misinformation and fear mongering about the COVID -19 virus. This has led to a decrease in traffic to Asian American businesses292,293 and an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans, including murders and a mass shooting.294 This violence may also lead to food insufficiency. Asian Americans who report sometimes or often not having enough to eat during COVID -19 have been more likely t o cite fear of going out to buy food as the reason compared to White Americans.295 Public efforts are needed to combat this xenophobia and prevent it from propagating additional hate crimes and impacting poverty, health, and well -being.296,297 Read more: High Rates of Food Insecurity Are Hiding Among Asian Pacific American Populations ; Asian Americans Should Not be Targets for Hate Crime or Food Insecurity . B. Women Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : Although there was no disparity in food insecurity rates between single women and men living alone in 2019, 28.7 percent of households with single mothers were food insecure compared to 15.4 percent of single -father households.298 Rates were much higher fo r households living at or below 130 percent of the FPL, where 42.5 percent of single -mother households were food insecure compared to 33.9 percent of single -father households. Poverty : In 2019, poverty was higher among women, regardless of employment stat us.299 The official poverty rate was 11.5 percent compared to 9.4 percent of men (the Supplemental Poverty Measure was 12.4 percent for women compared to 11.1 percent for men300). The disparity dramatically worsens for single parents with children under 18 \u2014 the poverty rate was 36.5 percent among single mothers compared to 16.3 percent among single fathers.301 Despite a narrowing of the gender wage gap due to increasing educational attainment and work experience, women still earn less than men in the same oc cupation, are more likely to work part time than men, and female -dominated occupations are more likely to be devalued. Furthermore, occupations with comparatively smaller wage gaps between men and women and between mothers and non -mothers tend to be lower paying jobs.302 Moreover, pregnancy or child care responsibilities may lead a woman to reduce her work hours or drop out of the workforce, thereby increasing financial strain.303 Health : Food insecurity and poverty have unique adverse health implications fo r women. Food insecurity has been consistently associated with overweight and obesity in women .304,305 Food insecurity is a particular concern for pregnant women because nutrient demands are higher.306 Food insecurity is associated with inadequate micronutrient intake among women of childbearing age.307 It also is associated with higher gestational weight gain308 and an increased risk of birth defects.309 Furthermore, food insecurity is associated with dep ression and anxiety among mothers310 and among all women.311 During COVID -19 Hunger: According to the CPS -FSS, in 2020, 27.7 percent of single -mother households were food insecure ( 8.2 percent with very low food security), compared to 10.5 percent of households overall ( 3.9 percent with very low food security).312 In the Pulse data, women have been slightly more likely to report food insufficiency.313 For example, in December 2020, 14 percent of women reported food insufficiency compared to 13 percent of men, Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 20 and, in June 2021, 10 percent of women reported food insuffi ciency compared to 9 percent of men.314 Figure 11: Disproportionately High Rates of Food Insufficiency Among Women During COVID -19 Poverty : Women have been more likely to lose their job during COVID -19, be on unpaid leave, be employed with increased abse nces, and be forced to stop working compared to men.315,316 Unemployment has been higher for women compared to men,317 which is the opposite of unemployment during the Great Recession when men were more likely to lose their job. Furthermore, single parents were more likely to lose their job compared to single workers without children , married workers, or married workers w ith children, and 72 percent of single parents are female.318 There are two main reasons for this gender disparity during the COVID -19 recession. First, women are less likely than men to work in positions that can be done remotely.319 Second, women are more likely to take on the role of caregiver for family members or for children who are attending school virtually.320,321 This has added financial strain to families, as over 80 percent of women with young children who were forced to stop work or reduce their w ork hours reported that they could not afford to do so.322 \"My job has laid me off and I can't find another one. I need to work but it's just not feasible while doing remote learning and lack of affordable childcare.\"323 In April 2020, the percent age of moms actively working was 21 percentage points lower than it was in April 2019, compared to 15 percentage points lower for fathers. While this gender disparity among parents disappeared by November 2020, there were still 1.6 million fewer mothers working in Ja nuary 2021 compared to January 2020.324 Even among working parents, employed mothers with children under 12 years old spent an average of 6.1 hours per weekday on work -related tasks and 8 hours on child care compared to 7.7 hours working and 5.2 hours on child care for employed fathers from May -December 2020.325 These gender disparities will likely have long -term consequences for the career trajectories for women. Health : The pandemic has had unique health consequences for women. Compared to men, women hav e been more likely to report skipping preventive health care visits and a recommended medical test or treatment.326 Pregnant women are more likely to suffer severe complications from COVID -19 than non -pregnant women.327 Women have reported wanting to delay p regnancy during the pandemic, yet one-third of women have reported delays in obtaining reproductive health care or accessing contraception, with disparities among Black, Latinx, LGBTQIA +, and low -income populations .328 Intimate partner violence has also increased, straining shelters that have faced increased demand while having to adhere to social - distancing policies.329 In addition to physical health, the pressures women face because of gendered social roles have had a mental toll as well. COVID -19 has increased the stress of \"caregiver burden,\" which is associated with perceived lack of agency, financial stress, and social isolation.330 Women have reported more severe stress than men during the pandemic,331 particularly p regnant women.332 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 21 C. Age C.1 Older Adults (65 years and older) Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : Prior to COVID -19, food insecurity rates among older adults were lower than the national average but were still high. In 2019, more than 2.9 million households experiencing food insecurity included an older adult, and 8.7 percent of older adults living al one struggled with food insecurity.333 Participation rates in SNAP are lower than average . In fiscal year 2018 , 48 percent of adults 60 and older who were eligible for SNAP were enrolled, compared to 8 2 percent of all eligible individuals.334 This is due, i n part, to lack of knowledge around eligibility , stigma of using federal assistance programs ,335 and difficulties in the enrollment process.336,337 Other federal nutrition programs for older adults , such as congregate meals, home - delivered meals, and the Comm odity Supplemental Food Program , are not entitlement programs and do not reach all older adults who qualify for them . Poverty : Many o lder adults also face a unique combination of cost constraints because they live on fixed incomes.338 When poverty is recalculated as the Supplemental Poverty Measure to account for government assistance and cost of living (including medical costs), the pov erty rate among adults over 65 increases. For example, in 2019, the official poverty rate for adults over 65 was 8.9 percent (compared to 10.5 percent overall) but the Supplemental Poverty Measure for that age group was 12.8 percent (compared to 11.7 perce nt overall).339 Health : In 2018, approximately 88 percent of adults 65 and older had at least one chronic health condition, while 64 percent had at least two chronic conditions.340 Importantly, the high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular d isease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic respiratory disease in older adults put them at a higher risk of severe COVID -19.341,342,343 Food insecurity complicates these health conditions . Among older adults using meal service progra ms, food insecurity has been associated with an increased likelihood of emergency department visits or inpatient stays.344 During COVID -19 Hunger : According to the CPS -FSS, in 2020, 6.9 percent of households with an older adult were food insecure ( 2.5 percent with very low food security).345 In the Pulse data, t he proportion of older adults reporting food insufficiency increased during the pandemic and peaked at 6 percent in December 2020 .346 As a demonstration of this increase in need, a national Meals on Wheels survey found that home -delivered meal providers were serving an average of 77 percent more meals and 47 percent more older adults in July 2020 compared to March 2020.347 Poverty : Many o lder adults have had lower access to the two largest stimulus programs used during the pandemic: expanded unemployment benefits and SNAP. Older adults who were retired and no longer working were not eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the hi storic lack of participation in SNAP among older adults, many who are eligible for SNAP may have missed out on emergency allotments during the pandemic .348 In addition, job loss has been high for older adults during COVID -19 because older adults have been less likely to telework and have had greater health concerns due to the pandemic.349 In early January 2021, nearly 1 in 4 adults 65 and over sometimes or often had a difficult time paying for usual expenses.350 Health : Although adults 65 and older make up 17 percent of the population, they account for one- third of COVID -19 cases and half of hospitalizations.351 By the end of July 2021, adults over 65 accounted for 79 percent of COVID -19- related d eaths.352 Older adults in congregated living facilities accounted for one-third of CO ID -19 deaths in the first few months of the pandemic.353 In addition, older adults have confronted increased social isolation and ageism as a result of social distancing policies and conversations about rationing care.354 Interviews with 45 leaders from agencies serving older adults in Washington state suggest that the \"digital divide\" h as contributed to social isolation and also made it difficult for older adults to keep up with medical appointments, resulting in worsening health conditions.355 Read more: Hunger is a Health Issue for Older Adults . Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 22 C.2 Young Adults (18 -24 years old) Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : While food insecurity rates for young adults overall were not significantly higher than the national average of 10.5 percent in 2019 , data from the Hope Center indicate that rates of food insecurity among college students ranged from 42 - 56 percent at two -year institutions and from 33 -42 percent at four -year institutions.356 College students are not limited to 18 -21-year -olds . The average age of college students is 26.4 years old, 22 percent of undergraduate students have at least one child, almost half of undergraduates are students who have been systemically oppressed for their race and/or ethnicity , and 56 percent are first - generation students.357 Prior to COVID -19, the risk of food insecurity was higher among first - generation students and students of oppressed groups .358 Despite this, nearly half of students who were eligible for SNAP prior to COVID -19 did not receive benefits part ially because of certain eligibility limitations on college students and challenges in navigating the enrollment process.359,360 Poverty : Adults age s 18-24 a re not prioritized for social safety net programs, for example, the Earned Income Tax Credit. This lack of social safety net has contributed to a gre ater increase in poverty among young adults in recent decades compared to any other age group . For example, between 1970 -1973 and 2008 -2015, poverty decreased by 9.6 percentage points for infants and 23.8 percentage points for adults 75 and older. Meanwhil e, poverty increased the most for 21 -year -olds by 4.9 percentage points .361 Health : While young adults are generally healthy, those who experience food insecurity are more likely to have a chronic disease362 and suffer from depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal ideation.363 Figure 12: The Percentage of Young Adults in Poverty Increased From 1970 -1973 to 2008-2015 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 23 During COVID -19 Hunger : Food insufficiency rates throughout the pandemic have been higher for young adults (see Figure 12) .364 Moreover, rates of food insecurity have been high among college students, especially those who have experienced housing instability or a loss of income.365,366 The extra requirements for college students to qualify for SNAP benefits were not eased temporarily until Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropri ations Act, 2021 , in December 2020.367,368 Figure 13: Food Insufficiency Among Young Adults During COVID -19 Poverty : COVID -19 has severely impacted employment and educational opportunities for this age group. For example, between February 2020 and April 2020 , employment among adults ages 21-24 fell 23 percentage points compared to 13 percentage points for adults ages 35 -44.369 Fewer young adults enrolled in college in fall 2020 and spring 2021 compared t o the previous year . Community colleges, which serve primarily low - income students, have seen the steepest declines in enrollment ( -19 percent in fall 2020 and -11 percent in spring 2021 ) compared to public four -year institutions ( -11 percent in fall 2020 and -9 percent in spring 2021 ). By race/ethnicity, t he student groups with the largest declines have been AIAN student s (-14 percent in spring 2021 ) and Black student s (-8 percent).370 Students who take time off are less likely to finish college, particularly students with low income s, from rural areas, or students who are systemically oppressed because of their race and/or ethnicity .371 College graduates have more employment opportunities and higher earnings, which translates to higher food security and better health outcomes throughout life.372 Health : Vaccination rates among young adults are low. Only 45 percent of adults ages 18 -24 are fully vaccinated compared to 68 percent of adults ages 50-64.373 While young adults have been spared from high COVID -19-related morbidity and mortality, t he primary driver for COVID -19 hospitalization and death is now vaccination status ,374 putting young adults at increased risk. D. Households With Low Income s Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In 2019, 34.9 percent of households with an income below the FPL were food insecure compared with 5.1 percent of households with incomes equal to or above 185 percent of the FPL.375 When poverty is measured considering local cost of living and the receipt of government assistance (i.e., using the Supplemental Poverty Measure), the association between food insecurity and income is even stronger.376 Low -income households are more vulnerable to the economic drivers of food insecurity , including negative income shocks, high food prices, and instability in housing.377 In addition to low income, households with low wealth (e.g., owning a house, financial savings , or investments) are at higher risk of food insecurity because assets help to buffer against income shocks.378,379 Poverty : In 2019, the Official Poverty Measure was 10.5 percent while the S upplemental Poverty Measure was slightly higher at 11.7 percent.380 By accounting for cost of living, taxes, and government assistance , the Supplemental Pover ty Measure classifies more people as poor, particularly among adults in the following categories: ages 65 and older (poverty rate is +3.9 percentage points higher ), White (+1.4), Asian American (+4.3), Latin x (+3.1), without a high school degree (+3.8) and with only a high school degree (+2.4). Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 24 Health : Chronic poverty is associated with an increased risk of disease and mortality. Poverty impacts health in multiple ways. On an individual level, the immediate effects of poverty may result in poor housing conditions, lack of access to healthy foods, and in adequate health care. In the long term, the stress of living in poverty can result in chronic inflammation and disease. At the community level, neighborhood poverty and income inequality are also associated with higher rates of poor health outcomes and mor tality.381 During COVID -19 Hunger : According to the CPS -FSS, in 2020, 35.3 percent of households with an income below the FPL were food insecure compared with 4.9 percent of households with incomes equal to or above 185 percent of the FPL.382 In the Pulse data, a s of August 2021, 25 percent of households with an income less than $25,000 experienced food insufficiency, compared to 2 percent of households with an income between $75 K-$100K.383 Poverty : Throughout COVID -19, low -income people across the country have been more likely to have trouble paying bills, rent, and have had to rely on government food assistance and food charity.384 As of August 2021, 57 percent of households earning less than $25,000 a year found it sometimes or very difficult to pay usual expenses, compared to 2 7 percent of households overall.385 Workers with low wages were much more likely to lose their job early in the pandemic. From January to June 2020, the rate of job loss within the prior month rose from 1.3 percent to 10.3 percent, whereas the highest earners only saw a modest increase from 0.4 percent to 2.1 percent.386 In addition, the recovery in job growth has been the lowest f or workers with low wages (see Figure 13) . As of June 2021 , the employment rate was still 21 percent lower for workers with low wages (earning <$27K per year) than in January 2020, while workers with high wages (earning >$60K per year) have experienced a 10 percent increase in employment .387 Figure 14: Households With Low Income s Have Been Slower to Recover Jobs Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 25 This trend has an important impact on families. Among households where both heads of household work, households earning the highest wages have mostly regained full employment (93 percent had dual employment in February 2021 compared to 96 percent in February 2020), while households earning the lowest wages have faced more challenges recovering employment (64 percent dual employment in February 2021 compared to 82 percent in February 2020).388 It is important to note that higher income is not as protective for Black and Latinx families as White families. For example, the RAPID -EC survey of families with children 0 -5 years old has found that a larger proportion of Black and Latinx families who had been middle/upper income prior to the pandemic reported having difficult ies paying for basic needs during the pandemic when compared to White families. Possible reasons include r acial disparities in wealth exist between households earning similar incomes , limiting the access Black and Latinx families have to financial resources to mitigate sudde n hardship, and Black and Latinx families are more likely to financially support extended families.389 Health : There is a lack of data on COVID -19 cases and deaths by household income. However, racial disparities in COVID -19 cases and deaths were found to b e larger in counties with lower median incomes when compiling data from 10 major cities.390 In addition, greater income inequality at the county level has been associated with higher rates of COVID -19 cases and deaths.391,392 There are many reasons to believe income would be correlated with COVID -19 cases. Essential workers are more likely to have low wages (see section G. Intersectionality and Essential Workers ). In addition, stay -at-home orders also increase the time spent in unhealthy housing conditions for low - income individuals, which may increase the risk of COVID -19 exposure if houses are overcrowded. Increased time in the home following shelter -in- place orders can expose families to other health risks if there are enviro nmental contaminants , including mold, pests, or extreme temperatures.393 E. Households With Low Educational Attainment Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In 2016, food insecurity rates were 27.4 percent among households with less than a high school degree, 16.2 percent among households with a high school education, 13.4 percent among households with some college and 4.2 percent among households with a coll ege degree or higher.394 Education level is associated with food security because it may serve as a proxy for material well-being or skills , e.g., financial management.395 Poverty : In 2019, poverty rates were 23.7 percent among individuals with less than a h igh school education compared to 3.9 percent of individuals with a college degree or higher .396 Using the Supplemental Poverty Measure , this disparity slightly increases: 27.5 percent of individuals with less than a high school degree live in poverty compar ed to 5.7 percent of individuals with a college degree.397 Health : Individuals with lower education have poorer physical health, higher health care utilization , and are more likely to be uninsured.398,399 Disparities in adult mortality by education level have been increasing over time because mortality rates have steadily decreased for adults with higher education but have stagnated for adults with lower education.400 During COVID -19 Hunger : In early January 2021, food insufficiency rates among individuals with less than a high school education peaked at 35 percent compared to 4 percent of individuals with a college degree.401 While this disparity has declined, rates are still high (see Figure 15). Poverty : As of August 2021, 4 4 percent of households with less than a high school degree found it sometimes or very difficult to pay usual expenses, compared to 27 percent of households overall and 15 percent of households with at least a college degree.402 From February through April 2020, individuals with a high school degree or some college experienced a decrease of 15-16 percentage point s in employment compared to a decrease of 9 percentage point s among those with a Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 26 college degree or higher. Conversely, those with less than a high s chool degree also experienced a smaller 12 -percentage point decrease in employment, likely because a larger share are essential workers. In comparison, college graduates are able to work from home, a difference which has important implications for risk of exposure to COVID -19 and wages.403 Figure 15: Food Insufficiency by Educational Attainment, August 2020 -August 2021 Health : Counties with a higher proportion of residents who have less than a high school education have been associated with higher rates of COVID -19 cases and deaths.404,405 This may be in part due to the ability to safely work from home. From May 2020 -April 2021, only 3.1 percent of people with less than a high school degree and 8.1 percent of people with a high school degree were able to telework, compared to 38.4 percent of college graduates and 51.6 percent of people with a graduate degree.406 F. Rural Communities Prior to COVID -19 Hunger : In 2019, rural households were more likely to be food insecure than suburban households (12.1 percent compared to 10.3 percent, and among households with children , 16 percent compared to 13.3 percent).407 Poverty : Compared to urban areas, r ural areas have fewer economic and educational opportunities , and the lack of social capital and social services limits aid in economic recovery.408 Job growth after the Great Recession was slower in rural towns, and 90 percent of the counties experiencing persistent, lon g-term poverty are entirely rural counties.409 In 2018, rural poverty was 16.1 percent compared with 12.6 percent for urban areas.410 Health : Compared to urban areas, r ural areas are more likely to have inadequate access to health care services, fewer physi cians per capita, more uninsured, and a population with higher rates of disability and comorbidities related to COVID -19, including older age, smoking, high blood pressure and obesity .411,412,413,414,415,416 Individuals who live in \"digital deserts \" with limited access to telehealth are more likely to have higher incidences of chronic disease.417 In addition, 133 rural hospitals have closed over the past decade.418,419 In 2019, 20 percent of rural hospitals were at risk of closing, and more than two-thirds of those were critical for their communities (meaning they have only an emergency department and there are no other hospitals within 35 miles).420 Using data from hospital closures in California, the closure of rural hospitals was associated with a n 8.7 perce nt increase in inpatient mortality in rural areas while no association was found with urban closures.421 Mortality increased even further for patients who represented oppressed racial and/or ethnic group s and patients participating in Medicaid. Gender disparities in rural areas : Rural women have reduced diversity in job opportunities and gains to education in wages are lower in rural areas compared to urban areas. Single women, with or without children, are more likely to be in poverty than single women in urban counties. Although rural households increasingly depend on a woman's income due to a decline in rural men's wages since the 1980's, women typically get paid less than m en because women more often work in the service sector , which usually pays low er wages . Rural families are more likely to experience poverty when women are the primary or only breadwinner.422 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 27 Racial disparities in rural areas : Black, Latin x, and AIAN communitie s have higher rates of food insecurity, unemployment, and overall mortal ity rates than White communitie s in rural areas .423,424,425 Racial disparities in rural areas often exceed disparities in urban areas. Black people living in rural areas have lower socioeconomic status than White people living in rural areas or Black people living in urban areas ,426 and Black and Latin x people living in rural areas have lower access to health care compare d to White people living in rural areas or Black and Latinx people living in urban areas .427 Lack of access to clean, potable water is more common in rural areas, particularly in Black, AIAN , and migrant communities.428 Clean water is an important component of food security and the ability to maintain proper hygiene during COVID -19. During COVID -19 Hunger : According to the CP S-FSS, in 202 0, rural households were more likely to be food insecure than suburban households (11.6 percent compared to 8.8 percent , respectively) . This disparity is larger among households with children (16.1 percent reported food insecurity in rural areas compared to 12.4 percent in suburban areas ).429 Poverty : Many rural jobs are essential positions, putting workers at risk. For example, in the agricultural sector, pressure on maintaining food production has made it difficult to follow public health recommendations for social distancing and taking sick leave.430 However, rural areas have had lower unemployment rates compared to urban areas throughout the pandemic. For example, in April 2021 , the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in rural areas compared to 5.9 percent in urban areas.431 Health : The share of cases and deaths in rural areas exceed ed cases and deaths in urban counties in early September of 2020 .432,433 This may have been due to the logistical difficulties in testing rural populations or the inability to engage communities to trust public health messaging about COVID - 19.434 In addition, rural areas are more vulnerable to severe illness from COVID -19 due to an older populati on and further distance to hospitals with intensive care units.435 In 2020, 16 rural hospitals closed436 and margins for all hospitals were down 89 percent in August 2020 compared to 2019.437 Funding from the CARES Act has been crucial in helping rural hosp itals stay afloat.438 Racial disparities have been reflected in COVID -19 outcomes. From March 2020 -July 2020, the average daily increase in COVID -19 mortality rates was higher in rural counties with the highest percent age of Black and Latinx populations com pared to counties with high percent ages of White populations.439 In addition, the association of the percent age of a county's population that is Black and the prevalence of COVID -19 is stronger in rural counties than in urban counties.440 While most of rural America had low cases of COVID -19 early in the pandemic, rural counties where meatpacking is the primary occupation were an exception, where COVID -19 cases were 10 times as high as other rural counties in April 2020 and still 1.25 time s as high in October 2020.441 G. Intersectionality and Essential Workers A limitation of the disparities presented this far is that individuals are not defined by a singular identity. It is important to consider how different identities carry overlapping ri sk factors for hunger, poverty, and health.442 Intersectionality considers how interlocking systems of oppression result in unique challenges on more than one level for individuals with multiple identities that have been and continue to be discriminated aga inst.443 These systems of oppression operate through governing processes and economic and social policies that distribute resources (e.g., wages, working conditions, access to housing and food) unjustly by race, gender, social class, sexual identity, and more.444 COVID -19 has disproportionately impacted essential workers, an example of the intersection of racism, sexism and classism ( see Figure 15).445,446 Essential workers include those who work in transportation, health care, caregiving, public safety, public works, agriculture, and food .447 The majority of essential workers have low wages, are unable to work remotely and social distance on the job, and are more likely to be women and Black, Latinx , or from AIAN populations .448,449,450 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 28 In 2018, the median i ncome for essential workers who could not work remotely (27 percent of the workforce) had an average income of $45,626 and a median income of $33,000, a salary which was lower for Black, Latinx, and AIAN workers.451 In addition to being more exposed to COVID -19 through their jobs, essential workers are more likely to rely on public transportation to get to work, further increasing exposure, and are more likely to live in multigenerational households, placing older adults in their household at increas ed risk.452 Figure 1 6: Essential Workers are at the Intersection of Multiple Systems of Oppression Food insecurity among health care workers is high. Prior to COVID -19, nearly one -quarter of low -wage workers in nursing homes and residential care facilities reported being food insecure.453 More data are needed to track food insecurity among other types of essential workers, but the data that do exist reflect their greater food hardship compared to nonessential workers.454 Prior to COVID -19, 13.4 percent of essential workers reported using SNAP compared to 7.8 percent of nonessential workers. Disparities existed by race and/or ethnicity , where 23.3 percent, 23.5 percent , and 18.5 percent of Black, AIAN, and Latinx essential workers , respectively, used SNAP compared to 10.7 percent of White essential workers.455 During COVID -19, essential workers have had more difficulty affording household expenses , such as credit card bills, utilities , and food , compared to nonessential workers .456 This hardship is r eflected in mental health outcomes . Essential workers have been more likely to have anxiety or depression, increase or start substance use to cope with stress related to COVID -19, or seriously consider suicide compared to nonessential workers.457 G.1. Health Care Workers COVID -19 has had different effects across occupations, and while all jobs face increased exposure to COVID -19 and increased financial hardship , the impact of COVID -19 on health care workers (e.g., physicians, dentists, lab technicians, nursing care facilities ), which included 16.5 million workers in 2019, is highlighted here.458 The gender disparity in median income is larger in health care than almost any other industry.459 Women make up 77 percent of health care workers and 83 percent of those making less than $30,000 a year.460 There are further disparities by race: while White and Asian American women are overrepresented among registered nurses, physicians, and surgeons, B lack, Latina, and AIAN women are overrepresented among nursing aides , home care aides, and occupations with median wages less than $15 an hour. Black, Latina , and Native health care workers are more likely to live in poverty, use SNAP, public housing suppo rt, and/ or Medicaid, and lack health insurance than White and Asian American women.461 At the onset of the pandemic when nonemergency medical procedures were postponed, many health care workers lost jobs or benefits.462,463 For example, nursing home staff wor king at multiple nursing homes, nurses , and support staff hav e had their benefits cut at hospitals even as they were asked to work overtime. In addition, jobs have not fully recovered in this sector , reflecting burnout from the stress and working condition s of the pandemic .464 As of June 2021 , the health care sector has added 1 .1 million jobs since April 2020 , but still employ ed 540,000 fewer people compared to February 2020 .465 While health care workers have had lower COVID -19 infection rates than the general population, infection rates have been higher for Black and Latin x health care workers compared to White health care staff .466 One study in New York also found that essential workers were more likely to experience worse food access compared to nonessential workers during the pandemic.467 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 29 The Federal Nutrition Programs Reduce Hunger and Poverty While Improv ing Healt h The federal nutrition programs are important components of any short -term relief and long -term recovery plans for COVID -19. Prior to COVID -19, the programs were proven to reduce food insecurity, improve nutrition and health, decrease poverty for families, and provide economic stimulus for communities.468,469 This section includes new research highlighting the importance of the federal nutrition programs as well as e arly research that demonstrates how expansions to the programs have provided crucial support f or families. A. Impact on Food Insecurity and Nutrition SNAP : SNAP reduces food insecurity,470 including by producing a 9-33 percent reduction in food insecurity among households with children.471 Increases in SNAP benefits bolster positive impacts on food security.472 For example, d uring the Great Recession, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) expanded SNAP by increasing benefits by 13.6 percent (about $80 a month for a family of four). Among SNAP households, the increase in benefits reduced food insecurity by 2.2 percentage points,473 reduced very low food insecurity by 11 percentage points in areas with a high cost of living,474 increased the amount of money spent on food,475 and reduced the number of participants who ran out of benefi ts at the end of the month and had to eat less .476 Early research shows that SNAP has been an important tool in fighting hunger during COVID -19. One study found that SNAP emergency allotments , which have allowed households to access the maximum benefit level for their family size , were associated with lower rates of food insecurity early in the pandemic, especially among households with children.477 Another study found that receiving SNAP benefits lessened the association between financial struggl es and food insecurity that were a direct result of COVID -19.478 COVID -19 w aivers and flexibilities in SNAP enrollment and recertification processes have also been identified by SNAP administrators479 and community partners480 as crucial tools in maintainin g access to SNAP during the pandemic. Read more : Initiatives to Make SNAP Benefits More Adequate Significantly Improve Food Security, Nutrition, and Health . P-EBT : P-EBT has been crucial because the loss of school meals shifts the cost of those meals on to families, and families with low incomes face difficult cost constraints in increasing their food budget. It costs an estimated $30 per child per week to provide a nutritious breakfast and lunch.481 The development and implementation of P -EBT was a massive undertaking that required data matching and coordination acr oss SNAP, school meals, school districts, state agencies, and USDA. The program's innovation and adaptability allowed millions of families to access funds for the meals their children normally would have eaten at school.482 P-EBT has reduced food insufficiency rates among children and adults in low -income households during COVID -19, especially during the first week after P -EBT benefits were received.483 Figure 1 7: Monthly P -EBT Participation,484 March 2020 -September 2020 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 30 \"[P-EBT] was an amazing addition to the options for families. It helped families that could not make school distribution times due to transportation issues or health issues especially when our bus service stopped because bus drivers don't work in the summer.\" -Kristin Hilleman, Director of Food & Nutrition Services, Capistrano Unified School Distri ct485 Research on Summer EBT, after which P -EBT is modeled, also is relevant. When children eligible for free or reduced -price meals received Summer EBT, it reduced the prevalence of food insecurity by 20 percent, very low food insecurity by one -third, and improved diet quality by increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy and by reducing added sugar.486,487 Read more : Lessons from Early Implementation of Pandemic -EBT . WIC : WIC reduces food insecurity among children by 20 percent.488 WIC is associated with higher consumption of fruit s and vegetable s,489 healthier grocery store purchases,490 and overall healthier diets among low -income pregnant women491 and children.492,493 The longer that children participate, the healthier their diets are by the time they are 2 years old494,495 and 4 years old.496 WIC also inc reases access to healthy foods for WIC and non -WIC customers because WIC -authorized stores must offer a variety of affordable, healthy foods and some food products have been reformulated to meet WIC 's standards, for example, the fortification of cereals with iron and of infant formula with healthy fatty acids.497 Despite the increased barriers faced by WIC participants in redeeming benefits during COVID - 19,498 a study in Tennessee found that participants felt the flexibilities during the pandemic were helpful in maintaining access , particularly waiving the requirement for in -person appointments.499 This reflects national trends. Despite decline s in births during COVID -19 and in WIC participation prior to the pandemic, WIC participation during the first year of the pandemic increased .500 Read more: One Year of WIC During COVID -19: Waivers are Vital to Participation and Benefit Redemption . School meals and CACFP : The school meal s programs reduce the risk of food insecurity among low-income households with children and improve the dietary quality of children 's meals .501,502,503 Research finds that the School Breakfast Program (SBP) reduces food insecurity among elementary school children by as much as 15 percentage points504 and that the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) reduces food insecurity among all students by 6 percent ,505 including kindergartners entering grade school .506 After the passage of the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act in 2010 , school meals have been shown to be healthier than the average food obtained from grocery stores, worksites, and restaurants.507 In addition, CACFP is associated with a 4.2 percentage point reduction in food insecurity508 and meals and snacks are healthier than food served at child care centers that are not participating in CACFP .509 Read more: Hunger and Health \u2014 The Role of the Federal Child Nutrition Programs in Improving Health and Well -Being . B. Anti -Poverty Impa ct Individuals and families : The federal nutrition programs help keep Americans out of poverty. In 2019, the estimated number of people who were kept out of poverty by federal nutrition program were as follows: SNAP : 2.5 million ;510 NSLP : 1.2 million; and WIC : 230,000. Using data from 2013 -2016, SBP kept 620,000 individuals out of poverty each year.511 During the Great Recession, SNAP had positive impacts ,512 was one of the most responsive programs to meet increased need ,513,514 and was an effective anti -poverty program515 for lifting 3.9 million people out of poverty in 2011 .516 SNAP was also more likely than any other social safety net program to distribute resources to the households that were struggling the most to put food on the table and to reduce deep poverty ( income below 50 percent of the FPL) by 16.6 percent .517,518 These same trends have been true during COVID - 19. SNAP , including its expansions, is projected to lift 7.9 millio n people from poverty in 2021, Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 31 including 2.8 million children , which would make SNAP the second -most -effective antipoverty program during the pandemic .519 SNAP also has a long -term impact for decreasing poverty . Because SNAP has existed since 1961,520 studies have been able to track the long -term benefits of exposure to food assistance during childhood. Participation in SNAP in early childhood (ages 0 -5) has been associated with improved health, an increase in educational attainment, an increase in eco nomic stability, including higher earnings and self -sufficiency among women, living in a neighborhood with lower poverty, and declines in the probability of being convicted of a crime or incarcerated.521,522 (Figure 18) Free and reduced -price school meals ar e also an important economic support for families because they effectively act as an income transfer by reducing the amount of food that families have to buy.523 Economi c Activity : SNAP increases the amount of money households spend on food more so than if they had been given the same amount of benefits in cash . Receiving SNAP benefits also free s up money to be redirected to other goods and services .524 Increased spending by SNAP hous eholds has a domino effect: it increases income for farming and other business sectors involved in the production and distribution of products and services purchased by SNAP households , which then generates further economic activity . Overall, every $1 in S NAP during an economic downturn generates between $1.50 and $1.80 in economic activity (see Table 1 cited in the endnote ).525 All of the federal nutrition programs have a positive impact on business and economic growth , and they support the economy in a variety of ways . SNAP and P -EBT support food retail: In 2018, 8 percent of all food at home was purchased using SNAP benefits.526 This increased d uring COVID -19, when combined SNAP and P -EBT benefits accounted for 12 percent of food purchases from April 2020 - September 2020.527 Increases in SNAP participation are associated with local increases in the number of food stores, higher sales at those stores, more employees in food retail , and higher salaries for food retail workers. 528,529,530 In 2020, it is estimated that SNAP redemptions resulted in nearly 200,000 jobs in the grocery industry and 45,000 more jobs in other industri es (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation).531,532 WIC supports food retail : Small -store owners report that the availability of a variety of WIC -approved foods attracts WIC and non - WIC customers and increases sales among WIC products and non-WIC products.533 Figure 18: Receiving SNAP as a Child Improves Well -Being Decades Later Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 32 SNAP, WIC, and P -EBT s upport farmers : $1 billion in SNAP benefits supports more agricultural jobs and an estimated $32 million in additional income for agricultural industries.534 WIC generates hundreds of millions in extra revenue for farmers, especially dairy, fruit, and vegetable farmers .535 Farm -to-school programs increase income and jobs for farmers and the local economy.536 During COVID -19, redemption of SNAP and P -EBT at farmers ' markets increased compared to 2019, providing crucial support to small -scale farmers who did not qualify for Pa ycheck Protection Program loans or Coronavirus Food Assistance Program payments.537 SNAP p rovides jobs: SNAP redemption rates at the county level have been associated with more jobs in those counties, and this association was stronger during the Great Recession.538 SNAP and WIC i ncrease state revenues : SNAP and WIC free up a household's other resources for p urchases of non -food basics that may be subject to sales tax.539 In 2020, it was estimated that SNAP redemptions generated more than $1 billion in federal tax receipts and $975 million in state and local tax receipts. 540,541 C. Impact on Health Participation in WIC improves maternal health542 and birth outcomes ,543 such as healthier weight -for- length among children 0 -2 years old .544 During the Great Recession, WIC 's association with reducing low birthweight was even stronger compared to the prereces sion period, and WIC also reduced Black - White disparities in birth weight .545 School meals are associated with lower rates of overweight and obesity as well as improved mental health, including reductions in behavioral problems, anxiety, and depression.546 SNAP is associated with improved health outcomes, including better glycemic control among people with type 2 diabetes and a reduced probability of being overweight or obese in children and adults.547 Read more : Hunger and Health \u2014 The Role of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Improving Health and Well -Being ; Hunger and Health \u2014 The Role of the Federal Child Nutrition Programs in Improving Health and Well -Being ; School Meals are Essential for Student Health and Learning .

Program participation during the first year of COVID -19 refle cts the unprecedented levels of food and economic hardship during the pandemic. Several expansions were key in expanding access to the programs for vulnerable groups and increasing financial support for households. SNAP: During the first year of COVID -19, an average of 41.7 million people received SNAP benefits (a 111 percent increase compared to March 2019 -February 2020) , with an average benefit of $185 per person per month (a 153 percent increase) . SNAP participation peaked in June 2020 at 43 million peop le. Read more: SNAP: A Critical Support During the First Year of the COVID -19 Pandemic . WIC: During the first year of COVID -19, a monthly average of 6.3 million women, infants, and children participated in WIC , and redeemed $2.3 billion in food purchases. This represents an overall increase in participation of 0.5 percent compared to March 2019 -February 2020 , which includes a decrease in the number of women and infants participating but a 5.1 percent increase in the number of children participating.

SBP and NSLP: Each month during the first year of the pandemic , an average of 6.1 million children received a free or reduced -price school breakfast and an average of 8.4 million children received a free or reduced -price school lunch. Compared to March 2019 -February 2020, 56 percent fewer breakfasts were served ( 92 million each month) and 69 percent fewer lunches were served (127 million each month) . To provide a comparison of only those months when children are in school: From August 2019 - December 2019, a monthly average of 5.2 million children received a free or reduced -price school breakfast and an average of 7.4 million children received a free or reduced -price school lunch. Compared to August 20 20-December 2020, 62 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 34 percent fewer breakfasts were served ( 85 million a month) and 73 percent fewer lunches were served (121 million a month ). In sum, during COVID -19, millions of low -income students were not able to access school breakfast or lunch. However, this drop in participation was offset in part by the use of summer meals and P - EBT. Read more : School Meals: The Impact of the Pandemic on 54 Large School Districts . Summer meals : Many schools switched to the summer meals program when emergency closures started in M arch 2020, inflating data in comparison with 2019. In July 2020, an average of 5.6 million students were served each day across 38,000 summer meals sites. A total of 189.1 million meals and snacks were served in July 2020 , compared to 69.6 million meals an d snacks in July 2019 . P-EBT : Average statistics for the first year of the pandemic are not available due to missing data. However, 12.7 million children participated in both May and June of 2020 and 11.1 million participat ed when school resumed in September 2020. Read more : FRAC's resource page on P-EBT ; P-EBT Implementation Documentation Project . CACFP: During the first year of the pandemic, CACFP reimbursed an average of 129,000 child care homes and centers (an 18 percent decline compared to March 2019 -February 2020) , which served 3.8 million children each month (a 19 percent decline). CACFP also reimbursed an average of 2,100 adult care centers (a 26 percent decline) , which served 92,000 adults each month (a 32 percent decline) . In total, a monthly average of 118.9 million meals and snacks were served (a 31 percent decline) . This drop in participation reflects the increased caregiver burden placed on families with young children and adult dependents as a result of child and adult care center closures. Read More: CACFP During COVID -19. Home -Delivered Meals and Congregate Nutrition Programs : National data for 2020 are not yet available but the number of older adults receiving meals has increased, particularly home - delivered meals , due to social distancing necessitated by COVID -19. For example, by July 2020, Meals on Wheels local programs reported successfully scaling up to serve 47 percent more older adults than pre -pandemic, and had increased the number of meals by 77 percent, reaching more than 1 million new clients. Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 35 Policy Recommendations for a Robust and Equitable COVID -19 Recovery This report has examined inequities in hunger, poverty, and health among racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups , and has demonstrated how these systemic injustices have interacted with the impacts of COVID -19. Policy in response to the pandemic must be a combination of short -term interventions that respond to immediate increases in hardship from the pandemic and longer -term efforts that equitably address systemic drivers of hunger, poverty, and poor health. A wide range of policies are needed that address systemic drivers of hunger, which include low wages, underemployment or unemployment, discrimination, community disinvestment, segregation, incarceration , immigration status, limited transportation, unstable housing, and diminished educational opportunities .548 Policies that can be enacted immediately include a permanent expansion of the Child Tax Credit,549 a higher minimum wage, and affordable housing. Policy design and evaluation should ensure that policies do not unintentionally exacerbate disparities. The federal nutrition programs promote short - and long -term economic stability, health, and well - being. Policy improvements should reflect core principles of eliminating stigma and improving accessibility to ad equate, nutritious foods. This report concludes with specific policy recommendations directly related to increasing equitable access to the federal nutrition programs and increasing resources for participants. These interventions are warranted to respond t o immediate needs for the remainder of the pandemic , ensure a robust and equitable economic recovery, and produce long -term reduction s in hunger , poverty , and poor health . In addition to these legislative proposals, a number of changes could be made within existing program rules to improve the equitable impact of the programs. For FRAC's recommendations to improve existing policies and practices, see FRAC's comments to USDA's request for information, \"Identifying Barriers in USDA Programs and Services; Advancing Racial Justice and Equity and Support for Underserved Communities at USD A.\" SNAP SNAP plays a critical role in reducing hunger, under nutrition, and poverty, and improving child and adult health, employment, and other outcomes.550 Basic SNAP benefits, temporary SNAP emergency allotments , and the temporary 15 percent SNAP benefit boosts have provided crucial resources for SNAP households during the pandemic.551 USDA 's August 2022 adjustment of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) also will strengthen SNAP during CO VID-19 and beyond. Exclusive of the temporary COVID -19 benefit boosts, the revised TFP will permanently increase , per person and per month , SNAP benefits by $36.24, effective October 1, 2021. This long overdue adjustment will help tens of millions of SNAP households better afford to put nutritious food on the table .552 However, more is needed to address food hardship during COVID -19 and help spur a robust and equitable economic recovery. The 15 percent boost in SNAP is set to sunset on September 30, 2021. Moreover, emergency allotments will expire when pandemic health declarations do, likely well ahead of a full economic recovery. Gaps in SNAP's eligibility criteria will exclude certain populations. To promote increasing food security and equity , below are examples of key actions. Extend for the duration of economic hardship the t emporary boost s to SNAP benefits that were implemented during COVID -19. Such countercyclical benefit boosts should be triggered on and off by economic indicators instead of arbitrary dates . Substitute the Low Cost Food Plan for the TFP as the basis for SNA P benefits. Eliminate the cap on the SNAP shelter deduction . Increase the minimum monthly benefit . Make the Standard Medical Deduction more accessible for older adults and people with disabilities .553 Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 36 Improve a ccess to SNAP ,554 including for unemployed and underemployed people,555 college students,556 formerly incarcerated individuals, non -U.S. citizens, residents of U.S. territories,557 and low -income families working their way up the economic ladder. WIC WIC improves participants ' health, dietary intake, and birth and health outcomes; supports learning and development; and protects against obesity. Importantly, WIC has been proven to reduce racial disparities in poor infant health outcomes.558 However, program barriers exist, e.g., language and cultur e; difficulty taking time off at work to apply and maintain eligibility in person at WIC clinics ; transportation may be unavailable or unreliable , there may be long wait -times at clinics ; and there can be difficult ies with redeeming benefits.559 Crucial improvements , including the list of examples below, are needed to strengthen and expand access to the WIC program . Make permanent the flexibilities enacted during COVID -19 that allow for remote enrollment, services, and benef its issuance, and facilitating online ordering . Extend certification periods to two years for infants and postpartum women , and raise the age limit to 6 years o ld. Establish a WIC community partners outreach program, patterned after the successful SNAP outreach program, which would fund WIC state agencies to contract with non -WIC community partners to conduct WIC outreach . Increas e infrastructure, technical assistance , and management information systems funding . Coordinat e data -sharing between the health care system and WIC, particularly between Medicaid and WIC. The WIC food package should be updated to be consistent with the 2020 -2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans including increasing the value of fruit and vegetable benefits and investing significantly in the children's package. School Meals (SBP, NSLP) School meals increase access to nutritious breakfa sts and lunch es for students whose families have low incomes, reducing disparities in food security and nutrition. However, some families may be above the income eligibility threshold but still are not able to afford meals that match the nutrition standards of SBP and NSLP. In addition, stigma for receiving reduced -price or free meals lowers participation. These factors perpetuate inequities by socioeconomic class.560 Healthy school meals should be available to all students at no charge . This increases participation so that more children can experience the benefits that are linked to school meals, eliminates unpaid school meal s debt, and reduces administrative work for schools.561,562 Schools have been able to provide meals to all children at no charge from spring 2020 through school year 2021 -2022 through USDA waivers , and this should be maintained beyond the pandemic. In July 2021, California and Maine were the first states to pass s tatewide, bipartisan universal meal programs.563 For more on efforts in other states, please visit FRAC's webpage on Health y School Meals for All . The Community Eligibility Provision , a relatively new option created through the Healthy, Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 , allows more than 30,000 high -poverty schools to offer breakfast and lunch at no charge to all students. This provision has highlighted the positive impact of offering meals to all children at no charge. Community eligibility allows schools with greater than a 40 percent Identified Student Percentage (ISP), or the percentage of students qualifying for free school meals, to offer breakfast and lunch free of charge to all students. Community eligibility has dramatically moved the nation toward Healthy School Meals for All, with 1 in 3 schools that participate in SBP and NSLP u sing this option. Additional investments to support community eligibility, as well as allowing more children to be dire ctly certified for free school meals, such as those receiving Medicaid, will allow more schools to adopt community eligibility and move the nation even closer to the goal of Healthy School Meals for All. Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 37 CACFP CACFP provides funding to serve healthy meals and snacks in Head Start, child care centers, family child care homes, and afterschool programs . Many child care programs do not participate in CACFP because the benefits are inadequate, paperwork is burdensome , and the losses and penalties a re too detrimental to child care programs that operate on razor -thin margins. The brunt of these barriers disproportionately impacts communities and providers with fewer resources, contributing to inequities in child care quality and nutrition. Equity in CACFP can be achieved if systemic barriers that often give advantages to better - resourced programs are removed . The upcoming reauthorization of the child nutrition programs provides an opportunity to make much -needed improvements to increase CACFP access a nd strengthen CACFP's role in supporting good health and nutrition . Listed below are six important upgrades. (1) Give child care centers and homes the option of serving an additional meal (typically a snack or supper), as was previously allowed under CACFP. Ma ny children are in care for more than eight hours per day as their parents work long hours to make ends meet, so they rely on child care providers to meet a majority of their nutrition needs . (2) Extend the COVID -19 waivers allowing child care homes to automa tically receive the highest CACFP reimbursement rates . (3) Streamline access to CACFP by increasing direct certification and by allowing child care centers to participate based on community eligibility, rather than collecting income applications from families . (4) Make eligibility annual for proprietary child care centers . (5) Eliminate outdated enrollment forms and requirements . (6) Fix the serious deficiency process . In addition, while emergency shelters can use CACFP to provide meals to children experiencing homelessness , a resident must be 18 or younger to receive a meal. Black and Latinx youth are more likely to experience homelessness into young adulthood, which means the age c utoff perpetuates disparities in food security by race and ethnicit y. The COVID -19 expansion waiver that allows young adults up to 24 years old to be eligible to receive up to three healthy meals at homeless and youth - serving shelters should be made permanent. Out-of-School Time Programs Afterschool and summer nutrition programs increase access to snacks and meals for school -age children whose families have low incomes. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of ensuring access to nutritious meals when schools are closed. These programs would be strengthened if the following actions were taken : establish a permanent and comprehensive EBT program that all states can operate and that provides benefits when schools are closed during the summer, on weekends, and school holidays ; improv e area eligibility requirements so that more communities are able to provide summer and afterschool meals ; allow schools, local government agencies, and private nonprofit organizations to feed children year -round seamlessly through the federal nu trition programs ; and allow all summer meal sites to serve a third meal . Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center September 2021 38 Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) FDPIR provides access to food to low -income Native families who do not have easy access to grocery stores. Over the years, nutritional standards in FDPIR boxes have increased and some traditional foods were incorporated beginning in 2015. However, apart from pilot programs, Tribal organizations are not abl e to purchase foods themselves nor source foods from local Native - owned farms. This lack of food sovereignty perpetuates disparities in food security and in the root causes of hunger, e.g., economic instability.564 FDPIR and the child nutrition programs sho uld allow local procurement of foods to support Tribal food sovereignty. Participants should be allowed to use FDPIR and SNAP at the same time. Regardless of income level, all FDPIR recipients receive boxes , which are of roughly the same value, unlike SNAP , which calculates benefit amounts based on income level. Additionally, FDPIR boxes often do not contain a sufficient variety of ingredients to prepare a whole meal. Tribal governments do not currently have the authority to function as an autonomous \"state government\" to administer the federal nutrition programs , except for WIC. Tribal governments should have the right to administer all federal nutrition programs in the same way that state agencies can . Home -Delivered Meals and Congregate Nutrition Program s Supplemental funding provided through federal COVID-19 legislation and program flexibilities enabled some providers to expand the reach of home -delivered meals and adapt congregate meal service models to promote social distancing. However, these programs will need ongoing resources and additional funding to be able to respond to the growing hunger among households with an older adult member . While there is no income test to participate in these nutrition programs, the Older Americans Act directs that serv ices be targeted to those with the greatest economic and social needs, \"with particular attention to low -income older individuals, including low -income older individuals representing racial and/or ethnic groups that have been systemically oppressed , older individuals with limited English proficiency, and older individuals residing in rural areas.\"565 Post -pandemic funding for these programs should be increased commensurate to the needs of older adults who are struggling to put food on the table.

Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 39 Conclusion COVID -19 resulted in an increase in hardship, including more individuals living in households with food insecurity , and increased racial and ethnic disparities in food insecurity . COVID -19 has applied unique pressures t o the relationships between hunger, poverty, and poor health, while hunger, poverty, and health have simultaneously increased the risk of COVID -19 transmission, infection, and morbidity. It is critical to understand how disparities in COVID -19 outcomes ref lect distinct and interlocking causes across different groups of people . Policies enacted to spur recovery must account for these unique root causes and center leadership from members of systemically oppressed populations and communities . Tracking data about hunger, poverty, and health among these groups over the course of the pandemic is essential to ensure that recovery efforts are not ended too soon and leave them behind. The nutrition programs are effective tools to address disparities in hunger, pov erty, and health, and evidence from the pandemic indicates that they have been crucial resources in helping families keep food on the table. The federal nutrition programs are among our nation's most important, proven, and cost -effective public interventio ns, and f urther improvements can be made to support a more robust and equitable recovery . Hunger, Poverty, and Health During COVID -19 Food Research & Action Center Sept ember 2021 40 Appendix : Comparing the Census CPS -FSS and Pulse Surveys CPS -FSS Pulse Effect on Estimation of Food Hardship What is measured? Food insecurity Food insufficiency Questionnaire The FSS is a series of 10 questions (18 if children are in the household). Households are food insecure if they respond affirmatively to 3+ questions and have very low food security if they respond affirmatively to 6+ questions (8+ with children). Food insufficiency is a single question and is asked twice, once about the respondent's experience prior to COVID -19, and once about their current experience. Food insufficiency corresponds to selecting \"Sometimes not enough to eat;\" \"Often not enough to eat.\" The CPS -FSS is a more detailed picture of the severity and persistence of a household's food insecurity. Food insufficiency implies disrupted eating patterns and is therefore more similar to the more serious condition of very low food security rather than to food insecurity in general.566 Who is measured? Households ( Of the 50,000 sampled for the December CPS, about 34 ,000 respond to the FSS ) Individuals ( 60,000 -100,000) In both cases, a large sample size means that rates can be compared among specific groups of people (for example, by i ncome, race, or geography). How is the survey conducted? Phone and in -person interviews, once a year in December Online, every two weeks The type of person who responds to a survey on the phone versus online might be different. Reference period for food insecurity Last 12 months and last 30 days Last seven days and prior to COVID -19 A respondent is more likely to have been food insecure sometime over the past year compared to only the past week .567 Method Households are screened using income and are asked survey questions in stages . Households reporting food security in early questions are not asked later questions. There is no screening process . Every participant is asked the food insufficiency questions. Research568,569 finds that not including the screening process yields higher estimates of food insecurity .

The ACS has a larger sample size. However, we present estimates from the CPS when available ( for Black, White, and Latinx communities ) because 1) these estimates are directly comparable to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), while there is no SPM calculated using ACS data and 2) official estimates of food insecurity are derived from the CPS. As an exception, we will use the ACS for poverty estimates for AIAN and NHPI populations. For more, see: Farrigan, T. (202 1). Rural . 144 U.S. Census Bureau.

While both are administered by the Census Bureau, the CPS is used to es timate official poverty statistics. However, data is only reported for Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians - all other races are pooled together due to small sample size. This policy contributes to invisibility of Native populations from the most specific official statistical construct. For comparison, according to the 2019 ACS, overall poverty was 12.3 percent (compared to 10.5 percent in the CPS) and poverty among Whites was 10.3 percent (compared to 9.1 percent in the CPS) 229 U.S. Census Bureau.
