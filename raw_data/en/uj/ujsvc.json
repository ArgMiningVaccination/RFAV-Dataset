Yoga therapy is a healing art and increasingly researched science developed from the ancient insights of yoga. Yoga therapy today is a stand alone wellness profession. The difference between traditional yoga and yoga therapy is that traditional yoga teaches healthy individuals how to achieve excellence while yoga therapy teaches people who are suffering with pain, illness, or disease how to move to a place of ease. Yoga therapy is different than physical therapy in that it uses protocols of corrective movement as only one piece of the multi-dimensional experience, measuring also against our lifestyle, communities, and social economical structures. There are as many treatment strategies as there are people. IAYT Definition of Yoga Therapy Yoga therapy is the professional application of the principles and practices of yoga to promote health and well-being within a therapeutic relationship that includes personalized assessment, goal setting, lifestyle management, and yoga practices for individuals or small groups. Yoga therapy teaches people who are suffering from pain, illness, or disease how to move to a place of ease. Sattva means balance. The study of ayurveda is one in keeping the body balanced, and the study of yoga is one of keeping ourselves in harmony with our bodies, breath, relationships and the world around us. We have joined these sister sciences in our holistic yoga therapy training programs so that we may find the integrated approach to healthcare in the 21st century. We believe that for the whole person to not only survive but to thrive, there needs to be harmonious balance of the three treasures of mind, body and spirit. Our philosophy is one of wholeness and integration to achieve sustainable results and transformation within.
