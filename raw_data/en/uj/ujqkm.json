Now in the fourth year of implementation, the Saint Louis University GWEP team, in col - laboration with our community and university partners that span the state of Missouri, have surpassed all the goals proposed in 2015 and have made strides to improve care of older adults and their families as well as providing education on geriatric care. In the 2017 issue of Aging Successfully, we shared a summary of our activities for the first two years of this new initia - tive. Here, we would like to provide an overview of our four years and highlight our achievements and in - novative initiatives. Our success in working for improved health and social service care for older adults in primary care settings is possible only through the efforts of our community and university partners that are located throughout Missouri. As indicated in the map inset, GWEP's partners include universities (A.T. Still Uni - versity, Kirksville and Washington University, St. Louis); community health systems (Perry County Me - morial Hospital, Perryville; SSM Health; CareSTL Health (formerly Myrtle Hilliard Davis Health Cen - ter), St. Louis County Health De - partment, Kansas Ciy Care Health Center); along with Northside Youth and Senior Services, St. Louis; Midwest Area Regional Council, Kansas City; Saint Louis University Health Resource Center, St. Louis; Alzheimer's Association, St. Louis; and all seven Area Health Education Centers (East Central, Southeast, Southwest, Mid-Missouri, North - west, West Central, and Northeast regions). While the goals that we estab - lished in 2015 were ambitious, we have made an impact across our state with highlights of our suc - cesses showcased here: Interprofessional Geriatric Edu and training in the interprofessional as - sessment and treatment of common geriatric syndromes for students and practitioners has been a priority for the GWEP team and our part - ners. To achieve that goal, GWEP faculty designed a multi-faceted ap - proach to assessing such age-related conditions such as dementia, frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia, and caregiver well-being. The Rapid Geriatric As - sessment (RGA) is a brief, validated and copyright-free tool that has now been administered to 11,458 older adults in the state. A copy of \u00d2A.T.

F 314-771-8575 EDITORIAL John E. Morley, MB, BChEDITORIAL The geriatric medicine program at Saint Louis University began 30 years ago with the federally funded, Gateway Geriatric Education Center (GEC), following shortly thereafter. Over this period, we have provided education to health professionals throughout Missouri, southern Il - linois, and to professionals and students around the globe. Among our education endeavors, we have developed numerous assessment tools us-ing mnemonics ( e.g., MEALS-ON-WHEELS) and screening tools ( e.g., Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS), FRAIL, SNAQ, SARC-F, RCS, and ADAM), all of which are immortal - ized in our \"Geriatric Evaluation Mnemonics and Screening Tool\" (SLU GEMS). Clinically, we developed the first \"Delirium Intensive Care Unit,\" multiple programs to enhance function in the nursing home, imple - mented Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), a non-phar - macologic intervention for persons with dementia, and cared for thousands of our aging friends and their care partners. When the program started, our focus was to concentrate on improving persons with functional deficits and introduc - ing the Geriatric Evaluation and Management Unit concepts to the Midwest. Over the years, we have expanded our focus to develop secondary prevention programs for older adults. This expansion has led to the Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RGA) screening program (which can be completed in approximately 5 minutes) and the introduction of an algorhythmic approach to early interventions which include both exercise and cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) programs. Working with an inter - professional group of health professionals at Perry County Memorial Hospital, Perryville, Missouri, we have used these principles to create an outstanding example of an AGE FRIENDLY HEALTH SYSTEM in a rural area.30 Years of Aging Successfully \"A successful old age may lie not so much in our stars and genes as in ourselves\" - George E. Valliant Our research group has been extraor - dinarily productive, producing over a thousand papers in these 30 years. Among our major findings is the development of oligonucleotide antisenses for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; the demonstration that amyloid-beta at physiological doses is a memory enhancer; the understanding of the physiological mechanisms and diseases responsible for the anorexia of aging; the role of testosterone in sarcopenia; and the validation of the screeners we developed to rapidly recognize geriatric syndromes. One of these early ventures was the development of the copyright-free Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination which is now widely used in the United States and around the world. The geriatric medicine program has been fortunate to co- exist with the geriatric psychiatry program under the leader - ship of George Grossberg, M.D. This program has been an international leader in the development of geriatric psychia - try and provided numerous opportunities for students, resi - dents, fellows, and faculty to engage in clinical and research projects. Using the motto, Aging Successfully , the GEC has con - centrated on helping persons as they age to overcome the inconveniences that we all experience with aging and allow us to enjoy climbing the mountain of age, appreciating the beautiful views from the summit. Finally, we thank the Health Resources and Services Administration's Bureau of Health Professionals which has funded our interprofessional education programs for the last 25 years. For more information on GEC resources, please visit aging.slu.edu.4 Aging Successfully , V No. 1 5(continued on page 6)Four Years of Innovations (continued from page 3) the RGA is presented here. Through screening events held in the com - munity and in residential facilities, home visits to older adults unable to easily leave their homes, and in - tegration into the electronic health records systems in acute care and out - patient settings, the RGA has enabled students and health care providers to gain competency in identifying often overlooked geriatric syndromes that can be treated and/or managed us - ing up-to-date evidence. Our health system partners who have formally added the RGA to the care of older patients include SSM SLU Hospital, SLUCare system, Perry County Me - morial Hospital, CareSTL Health, and Kansas City Care Health System. RGA training for students and practitioners continues to be offered throughout the state and beyond. At Saint Louis University, students from medicine, nursing, occupa - tion, physical, and speech therapies, social work, medical family thera - py, and interprofessional education receive training on the RGA along with the opportunity to administer the assessment in a clinical set - ting. Other universities that have welcomed the training include Washington University School of Social Work, A.T. Still University, University of Missouri\u2014Kansas City and St. Louis, Maryville University, Missouri State Univer - sity, and Southeast Missouri State University. In total, 3,489 students have been trained, far exceeding our original goal of 1,100! To learn more about the RGA, visit the GEC website at: https://www.slu.edu/medicine/internal-medicine/geri - atric-medicine/aging-successfully/. For more information on schedul - ing a training or a screening, send an email to aging@slu.edu. Training students and practitio - ners to assess older adults, provid - ing students with an opportunity to apply the training and to work in an interprofessional environment has been a priority for the GWEP team. To enable students to experience interprofessional geriatric asse ss- ment in action, the Interprofessional Geriatric Assessment Clinic (GAC), was launched in 2017 with students and faculty from medicine, occupa - tion, physical, and speech therapies, nutrition and dietetics, social work, and medical family therapy collabo - rating to provide a comprehensive assessment of older adults (age 65 years and older) and their care part - ners. The GAC is a partnership with the SLU Health Resource Center, a free student-led multi-clinic service. Patients for this clinic may be self-referred or referred by a health or social service provider. The clinic is held the first Thursday of each month starting at 1:30 p.m. at the HRC, lo - cated at 1408 N. Kingshighway Blvd., #213, St. Louis, MO 63113. To refer a patient or make an appointment, call 314-977-8462. Since 2017, 38 older adults and their care partners have benefitted from the free GAC assess - ment and 112 students from eight disciplines and medical residents and fellows have participated in this unique educational experience. To provide students with di - verse opportunities to learn about providing interprofessional care for older adults, the GWEP team has now offered four Interprofessional Geriatric Case Competitions (see accompanying article on page 17) with students and faculty from more than 13 different professions and five universities participating in a month-long experience in which students develop an interprofessional plan of care which is presented to a panel of faculty judges. Through the an - nual competitions, 248 students have competed on interprofessional teams coached and evaluated by 50 volun - teer faculty and doctoral students to support student learning. Continued efforts to offer an Interprofessional Graduate Certifi - cate in Gerontology to students and community practitioners resulted in the launching in Fall 2017 of the university-wide training opportu - nity for current graduate students as well as professionals working in the community. The 15-credit hour cer - tificate program can include courses Students and faculty participating in the Geriatric Assessment Clinic6 Aging Successfully , V email: aging@slu.edu Questions? F AX: 314-771-8575in medicine, nursing, social work, occupational and physical therapy, law, health care ethics, medical family therapy, communication sci - ences and disorders, public health, and communication. Beginning in Fall, 2019, the program will be of - fered in both in-person and on-line formats. For more information on this specialized opportunity, con - tact Dr. Cara Wallace at cara.wal - lace@slu.edu. Four cohorts of GWEP Ge - riatric Leadership Scholars have participated in the year-long profes - sional development experience. See page 14 to learn about the current cohort of Scholars. Over the course of the year, the Scholar works with a GWEP faculty mentor to identify, plan, and implement a geriatric-focused research and/or curricular project along with engaging with faculty and students in GWEP clinical activities, and delivering education through conference pre - sentations. Our first twelve Schol - ars have completed projects in such areas as end-of-life care in nursing facilities around the world, Cogni - tive Stimulation Therapy, physical therapy with older adults in the community, examining staff turn - over in skilled care facilities, and integrating geriatric assessment and management strategies in cur - ricula. While not included in the 2015 GWEP application, GWEP faculty responded to the newly created Medi - care Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) by developing a protocol for providers to offer the AWV in primary and geriatric health care settings. GWEP faculty Drs. John Morley and Milta Little and Nurse Practitioner, Patricia Abele have compiled a guide and training video that is available on the GEC website at: https://www.slu.edu/medicine/internal-medicine/geriatric-medi - cine/aging-successfully/. Since the completion of the protocol, AWV training has been delivered to stu - dents and practitioners with 898 AWVs conducted. Specialized Training and Service Programs The provision of training to promote the identification and treatment of physical and cognitive health concerns has been a primary focus these past four years. Assess - ment is less helpful if follow-up interventions are not available. So that older adults and their caregivers have resources to address identified health concerns, GWEP faculty and students have developed specialized training for students and profession - als to optimally support successful aging. Highlights of these three ini - tiatives are presented here: 1. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) \u2014With our partners throughout the state, GWEP faculty and students continue to offer training in this non-phar - macologic intervention for per - sons with dementia with over 2000 students and profession - als from thirteen disciplines and five universities receiving training (in person an d online) in this evidence-based group and individual experience. Twenty-two full-day CST train - ings have been delivered along with 68 informational presenta - tions, 35 conference presenta - tions, and five published articles. CST is currently being offered in fourteen locations throughout Missouri. Approximately 686 older adults with dementia have participated in individual and/or group CST. In addition to the on-line training modules and videos, the GWEP CST team will be hosting the 3 rd International CST Conference at Saint Louis University on June 10-11, 2019 at which time the North America CST Learning Insti - tute will be officially launched. Through the Institute, training and credentials will be offered for professionals who want to facilitate CST interventions as well as those seasoned provid - ers of CST who seek to serve as trainers for others. In addi - tion to providing training, the GWEP CST team is engaged in a number of related activities, including: development of a course on Individual CST (iCST) for medical students, integrating CST into course - work for social work, com- munication sciences and disorders, occupational therapy, and medical family therapy students, and conducting research to ex - amine the applicability of the U.K.-developed intervention within a U.S.-based population. Here at Saint Louis Uni - versity, faculty members Max Zubatsky (Medical Family Therapy), Whitney Postman, and Andrea Vaughn (Com - munication Sciences and Disorders) and their gradu - ate students are offering CST groups and conducting re - search projects, while Drs. Marla Berg-Weger and Sue (continued on page 7)Four Years of Innovations (continued from page 5)6 Aging Successfully , V No. 1 7(continued on page 8)Tebb (School of Social Work) and Dan Stewart, social work doctoral student, have studied the impact of incorporating body movement with CST groups and the provision of iCST by family caregivers.

To inquire about training, email aging@slu.edu. 2. Exercise and Strengthening \u2014 To provide an easy-to-del iver exercise and strengthening program that can be offered to those of varying levels of mobility, GWEP faculty mem - bers Drs. Kelly Hawthorne and Jill FitzGerald, Department of Physical Therapy, developed a video-based training program to prevent falls and sarcopenia that can be offered in community or residential setting. Drs. FitzGer - ald and Hawthorne have trained staff and volunteers at Northside Youth and Senior Center Train - ing and Jesuit Hall to facilitate the exercise program. The training curriculum is available in-person or on-line at https:// www.slu.edu/medicine/internal- medicine/geriatric-medicine/aging-successfully/. 3. Caregi ver Well-Being and Sup - port\u2014Dr. Sue Tebb (School of Social Work) led the caregiver support initiative for the first three years of the GWEP proj - ect and, upon her retirement in 2018, former Geriatric Leader - ship Scholar, Dr. Max Zubatsky (Department of Family & Community Medicine Medical Family Therapy Program) as - sumed leadership of the initia - tive. In addition to developing the Rapid Care - giver Well-Being Scale (R-CGWS) and an algorithm for managing caregiver stress and burnout, an informational video, and a toolkit for creat - ing and facilitat - ing a caregiver support group, GWEP faculty developed an algorithm for developing a caregiver in - tervention. To learn more about initiatives to support caregivers, visit: https://www.slu.edu/medicine/internal-medicine/geriatric-medicine/aging-successfully/. 4. O pioid Training and Assess - ment \u2014During the fourth year of GWEP funding, the GEC re - ceived supplemental funding to develop training for students and professionals in the assessment of opioid use and abuse among older adults. GWEP faculty de - veloped a tool and has provided training at SSM SLU Hospital, area nursing homes, and Perry County Memorial Hospital. To date, the new tool has been ad - ministered to 237 older adults. For a copy of the tool, please email aging@slu.edu.

To improve outcomes of Perry County Memorial Hospital's (PCMH) exist - ing Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) program, the program ex - panded in May, 2016 to include a special physical exercise program component to the current session structure. Findings show greater improvements in all measures at 7 weeks in the CST with exercise group; including, cognition, depres - sion, quality of life, and mobility. Later in 2016, frailty exercise groups were formed for those older adults who have screened posi - tive for frailty or are at high risk of becoming frail. The intervention incorporates the same principals as the CST exercise group. The program continues to grow with non-CST participants and several from maintenance CST groups who are interested in additional exercise opportunities. In 2018, PCMH and Helsinki University Research (HUR) initi - ated a Quality Improvement (QI) Exercise Project. HUR is the lead - ing supplier of strength training equipment to senior, rehabilitation and the wellness markets and has donated two multi-function exercise machines to the project. The PCMH QI project will begin in 2019 and will examine outcome measures of hospitalized skilled and acute patients, and outpatients receiving either traditional physical therapy, the group frailty exercise program or the HUR equipment.

The Geriatric Leadership Scholars initiative is aimed at developing faculty who have the skills to teach and assess students and conduct research key to improving future care for older adults. To develop faculty with expertise in geriatrics and gerontology, the Geriatric Leadership Scholars Program provides support for three GWEP health care faculty to enhance their geriatric knowledge and skills. Scholars participate in and lead GWEP education events. Each of the Scholars is paired with a Gateway GEC Faculty Mentor who works with the Scholar throughout the year to address teaching, research, and program development issues.

Wallace, PhD, LMSW With clinicians reporting on - going barriers to quality commu - nication about goals of care and end-of-life care (EOL) choices,1-3 patients continue to face death with delayed, or no, access to hospice and palliative care (PC). Without specialized care, patients often re - ceive unnecessary, aggressive care at the end of life 4 and experience considerable pain.5 PC improves EOL quality, as patients receive less aggressive treatments, have fewer hospital visits, admissions and hos - pital deaths. 6 Patients who complete advance care planning (ACP) are more likely to utilize PC, 7 resulting in better pain and symptom man - agement.8 Narrative medicine (NM) is hypothesized to positively impact clinicians' practice in healthcare communication and is increasingly utilized in health professions' edu -cation and clinical experiences. NM draws on critical reflection and nar - rative practices - reading, writing, and telling stories - to teach com - petencies of attention, representa - tion, and affiliation. 9 Reflection in professional practice can help providers learn from their personal experiences and create meaning of complex situations. 10 As part of an ongoing study at SLU, Drs. Cara Wallace, April Trees, Jennifer Ohs, and Leslie Hin - yard help a pilot NM workshop to: (1) develop skills in attending and responding to the stories of others as a part of patient-provider com - munication; and (2) reflect on their own stories of loss in relation to professional practice. Participants strongly agreed that workshop activities assisted in developing communication skills and that they planned to use skills from the work -shop in their own professional prac - tice. Participants reported that the narrative competencies learned in the workshop are useful for framing difficult conversations, identifying patient vulnerability and increas - ing empathy, actively listening to patients' stories, and understanding connections between patients' sto - ries and preferences with decision making for care. Following our 2018 pilot work - shop, our research team received a seed grant through the Califor - nia State University Palliative Care Institute to offer ad - ditional and expanded work - shops. In partnership with SLU's Gateway Geriatric Education Cen - ter, we hosted our first of two work - shops earlier this month. Our next workshop is scheduled for Saturday, May 4, 2019 (details listed in flyer on page 23). 16 Aging Successfully , V ol.

The title of their presentation was \"This Year in Review.\" There were 1400 conference attendees.16 Aging Successfully , Team Care: GWEP Initiatives Promote Learning Interprofessional geriatric care is an important goal, especially for older adults with complex condi - tions. Historically, health profes - sions students were educated in silos, leading to lack of comfort and familiarity with others in the health care environment. Universities are increasingly fostering interprofes - sional education (IPE) 1 by offering experiences for students, so that once they get to the practice setting, they know how to work together to improve patient safety and qual - ity of care. Because of the need for health professionals in geriatrics, we encourage use of older populations for IPE activities. Studies of IPE activities consistently show positive outomes from most IPE learning activites. 2 In our experience, older adults provide rich stories and ex - amples that engage students, and we can show them positive examples of geriatric care. IPE options range from required courses, to individual activities, to games. In this article, we describe just a sample of differ - ent IPE approaches that can be used to teach geriatric team work. Fac - ulty at the Gateway Geriatric Edu - cation Center have been involved in several of these activities, others we found in the literature. Courses and Certificates Some universities offer elec - tives, specialties, certificates or single activities to promote IPE. For example, Saint Louis University has two opportunities for students: 1) Interprofessional Graduate Cer - tificate in Gerontology\u2014open to degree-seeking and non-degree- seeking students and practitioners, the 15-credit Certificate will be fully on-line in Fall 2019. (For more information, see page 22.) Center for Interprofessional Education, that oversees several options, including a major or minor in IPE. Under - graduate health professions students take a core curriculum together that culminates in an IPE practicum course. Graduate students partici - pate in IPE team seminars several times each semester. While target - ing a range of populations, older adults may be included. Interprofessional Activities IPE activities include the successful Geriatric Interpro - fessional Case Competition that we have conducted over the past 4 years, highlighted in prior issues of Aging Successfully . In our program, interprofessional teams of students meet over a month to develop a plan of care for a com - plex geriatric patient. Examples in By Helen Lach, PhD, RN, FGSA, FAAN (continued on page No. 1 email: aging@slu.edu Questions? F AX: 314-771-8575the literature include shorter times, such as a one-time meeting lasting from 90 minutes to a full day. Offered monthly, the Geriatric Assessment Clinic brings together students and faculty from seven disciplines to conduct a comprehensive assessment. We found some other ideas for team experiences, often used in conjunction with Ca - reers in Aging Week, sponsored by the Gerontological Society of America: Movie experience - interprofessional group of students watch a movie with aging-related content and participate in guided discussion (alternative - book discussion) Death caf\u00e9 - interprofessional group gatherings for informal discussions about death Speed mentoring - interprofessional students meet with professionals from different geriatric settings to learn about jobs and potential opportunities in the field of aging Senior speakers - panel of older adults who talk to in-terprofessional groups of students about their experi - ences with aging or health care. An alternative would be simulated older patients. Geriatric-focused Games Educational games provide some variety to the usual curriculum and can support learning and practicing skills, and experiencing new ways of problem solving. Several dif - ferent types of games have been used and have been pub - lished or can be found searching the web. 3 Some are targeted to improving empathy of students for the aging experience, or test knowledge in a fun way, or practice skills. Simulated aging games: use devices like goggles, gloves, braces, assistive devices to mimic aging dis - abilities, and student's complete errands and daily activities. The Geriatric Medication Game is an example. Game show games: trivia quiz games about aging, may use a take-off on a television game show, such as giving points or prizes, may test knowledge, some focus on specific topics like pain Role playing games: participants pretend they are older or focus on what they would be like when they are older, or role playing with simulated patients to build skills for working with older adults Board games: mental exercises to educate students about aging may include quiz questions, reflections, or activities students need to complete to advance around a board. This is a just a sampling of IPE activities we have identified among the numerous styles of creative, geriatric training programs and activities available. One source for ideas and materials is the Portal of Geriatrics Online Edu - cation. 5 We encourage geriatric experts to share any in - novative activities you have tried, and we can share more ideas in future issues of Aging Successfully . Currently, we are developing an Escape Room geriatric interprofes - sional activity for students to provide a fun interactive experience in a shorter format that may complement other interprofessional geriatric learning activities.

Still University Dementia is a term used to de - scribe a range of symptoms that dis - rupt one's ability to think, remember, reason, and carry out one's activities of daily living. The impaired func - tions may include memory, language skills, problem-solving, and the ability to focus and pay attention. Some indi - viduals may lose the ability to control their emotions and their personality may change. Currently, there is no way to prevent, slow or cure the pro - gression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). According to the Alzheimer's As - sociation, more than 5 million Ameri - cans are living with ADRD and this number is projected to rise to more than 13 million by 2050. 1 Nationally, we face the challenge of physicians, nurses, and other allied professionals who do not have formal training in geriatrics. Health professions students receive limited training in dementia, which includes understanding how to effectively communicate, identify and diagnose, and provide supportive resources for people living with Al - zheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers. 2 On A.T. Still University's (ATSU), Missouri campus, we provide multiple opportunities for first and second-year medical students and Truman State University (TSU) health professions students to be involved in courses that offer intergenerational studies and activities including Interprofessional Health Partners (IPHP), Interprofes an evidence-based, non- pharmacological intervention for older adults with mild to moderate dementia. The program has 18 guid - ing principles, built on the values of mental stimulation, safety, and rela - tionships. 3 Group members attend twice weekly sessions for one-hour each over seven weeks. The session structure includes a period of ori - entation and wel - coming, a current event, a main ac - tivity, and closure of the session. Exemplar top - ics from session examples include childhood, famous faces and places, physical games, and sounds. The goal is to stimulate the participants' minds and encourage them to think about new and different ideas by en - gaging as many senses as possible. 4 Once the initial seven weeks are completed, participants may choose to continue in Maintenance CST (MCST), which is a continuation of the group past the seven-week pro - tocol. CST was first made available in northeast Missouri in 2015, when Janet Head, EdD, RN, Co-Director of A.T. Still University's Area Health Education Centers (ATSU AHEC) program and the Aging Studies Project, became a collaborative partner with Saint Louis University's Geriatric Educa - tion Center through the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP). In addition to supporting informational session in Northeast Missouri, the GWEP grant afforded Head the opportunity to hire a full- time Project Coordinator who could implement community-based CST programs and develop opportunities for students to become involved. Since 2015, physicians, nurses, stude nts, and senior service organi - zational leaders have provided CST programming via live presenta - tions in all eight GWEP counties in northeast Missouri. While training opportunities remain available, our focus on the implementation of CST in the GWEP's eight-county region has increased. To facilitate CST pro - grams, we enlisted the help of Tru - man State University (TSU), senior health science students working as AHEC interns. Students received CST training and co-facilitated both Individual (iCST) and group CST with the GWEP Project Coordinator in Adair, Linn, Macon, and Scotland counties. As the CST program grew, we searched for ways to engage first and second-year medical students at ATSU's Kirksville College of Os - teopathic Medicine (ATSU-KCOM) campus. Initially, we discussed ways to involve students in the group CST intervention but we repeatedly 20 Aging Successfully , V ol. XXVIII, No. 1 email: aging@slu.edu Questions? F AX: 314-771-8575(continued on page 21)iCST (continued from page 19) encountered challenges with the stu - dents' and patients' schedules. Fideli - ty to the program's standard structure was another obstacle, so we began to look closer at Individual CST (iCST) as a more viable option for the stu - dents and patients. The iCST elective course was developed in 2016. The course allows students the opportu - nity to learn about dementia, establish effective and meaningful communi - cation with older adult patients and their caregivers, and conduct assess - ments on cognition, depression, and quality of life. The first cohort of stu - dents enrolled in the spring of 2017. The elective fits best for first and second-year medical students during their second or third on- campus semester. Students are offered an intergenerational ex - perience involving homebound, assisted living, or long-term care volunteer patients who reside in the community or in long-term care settings. ATSU faculty member and course director, Janet Head stated, \"iCST gives medical students an opportunity to interact with a spe - cial population that probably is not discussed in other settings. It en - courages students to slow down and pay attention to the patient they are working with. It brings them face to face with a national crisis and helps them appreciate the role family plays in the lives of persons living with dementia and the role of their own profession.\" The course consists of an orientation and training period that includes an intro - duction to dementia, background on program research, iCST's 13 guiding principles, and the session structure. 5 Students are introduced to and trained in the CST protocol assessment tools which include the Saint Louis Mental Status Exam (SLUMS), Cornell Scale for De - pression in Dementia, Quality of Life (QOL-AD), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG). Training includes time for the students to develop ses - sion content and role-play how they would implement their materials. Students shadow the course coor - dinator and participate in an iCST session with their assigned patient before they begin the implementa - tion phase. They are also encour - aged to attend a group CST session to further enhance their iCST train - ing. Students attend three review sessions once they begin deliver - ing iCST. The first review session occurs shortly after the students be - gin making home visits. This gives them an opportunity to share with the class what is going well and what they need to improve upon. It also allows for further develop - ment of their skills and boosts their confidence to know that others are experiencing similar successes and challenges. They view short videos on other non-pharmacological ap - proaches and ADRD resources and provide brief reflections. At a sec - ond review session, students learn from SLU GWEP faculty about geriatric-related topics, and at the final review session, students ap - ply what they have learned about the CST protocol tools and practice their skills in a simulated activity with actors from the community. After completing the training, students work in two-person teams to develop and facilitate 10 iCST sessions in their patient's residence. Students complete a session moni - toring log after each home visit. This document provides students with a period of reflection regard - ing their leadership and facilitation skills, team communication, inclu - sion or exclusion of key principles, and communication challenges. We have adapted the iCST course to include TSU health pro - fessions students, thus shifting to an interprofessional model of train - ing. Guided by th e 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) report, Framework for Action on Inter - professional Education & Collab - orative Practice, we support health professions students in opportuni - ties to learn about, from, and with other disciplines. IPE opportunities develop students' teamwork and communication skills and help pre - pare a 'collaborative practice-ready' workforce. 6 Although not all student teams are interprofessional, stu - dents do interact in the orientation and training and review sessions as one IPE group. The course focuses on the interprofe ssional competency domains such as: (1) values/ethics for interprofessional collaboration, (2) roles/responsibilities, (3) inter - professional communication, and (4) teams and teamwork. To ensure that students are mastering practice- specific competencies from each domain, they are asked to place their patient and their caregivers and fam - ily at the center of care and develop a Students are offered an intergenerational experience involving homebound, assisted living, or long-term care volunteer patients who reside in the community or in long-term care settings.20 Aging Successfully , V XXVIII, No. 1 21iCST (continued from page 20) trusting relationship, utilize effective listening skills, and reflect on their individual and team performance to improve outcomes. One student reflected on the importance of com - munication while working as a team, \"I've learne d how important it is to communicate with your partner about things beforehand. Earlier, in this process my partner a nd I were doing things separately with not much communication and our sessions were ok. Now that we have been communicating, I think our sessions have drastically improved.\" The 18 students that have par - ticipated in the iCST elective course report that they would recommend the course to others. One medi - cal student commented, \"I would definitely recommend this course to others as it does a great job of facili - tating a relationship with a patient over the course of a semester. At this point in our medical training, this is highly refreshing and is a great reminder of why we are doing this.\" To date, the nine volunteer patients show the greatest improvement in their quality of life and a slight increase in cognitive function. In a recent interview with a caregiver involved in the Spring 2018 cohort, the caregiver stated, \"my husband I still talk about the students coming out to the house and working with us. We enjoyed them so much and I feel fortunate that my spouse re - mains much the same as when the students were visiting.\" The overall goal of the iCST elective is to offer both ATSU-KCOM medical students and TSU health science students the op - portunity to work with older adult patients in a stress-free setting, over an extended period, where they can exercise listening and com -munication skills to ensure patient- centered care. Students learn from the participants themselves about the challenges they face and hear from the family and caregiver about their experiences in the dementia journey. One student wrote about his experience, \"I've really enjoyed the process of getting to know the patient and becoming comfortable talking about anything. I'm not re - ally interested in family medicine, but I now see the perks of the long- term relationships that are built by having the same provider for an extended period and the benefits it can have for the patient.\" CST and iCST are two valuable treatment approaches that can im - prove the quality of life for persons living with dementia and their care - givers. With the number of persons with dementia continuing to in - crease, it is important that patients and their caregivers continue to have access to programs like CST and other non-phamracological in - terventions in the future.
