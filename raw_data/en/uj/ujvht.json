Our permanent location is now 1311 Chuck Dawley Blvd #102 Mount Pleasant, SC, 29464 Welcome to our online booking site Chiropractic [Read More](1-description) Chiropractic is so much more than treatment for pain, injuries or accidents. Ultimately, the goal of the chiropractic treatment is to restore the body to its natural state of optimal health. This is achieved not only through manipulation, but through nutritional healing, restorative exercise, and even increased awareness of how we live, feel and move on a daily basis. The body has a remarkable ability to maintain and heal itself; chiropractic simply removes the interferences that stifle the body's natural healing ability. Dr. Susan Doyle not only provides chiropractic care to others, but receives it herself. Here's what she has to say about how it has improved her life: \"As a lifetime recipient of chiropractic care, I know what an incredible difference it can make in your health. When I was younger, it gave me years of athletic experiences that I would not have otherwise had. As an adult, it allows me an active lifestyle that is fundamental to my identity. If I can extend that experience to others and help them live their lives more fully, then my goals are met.\" TECHNIQUES INCLUDE: Diversified Activator (instrument adjusting) Cox Flexion Distraction Thompson drop technique Myofascial Release Active Release Technique (ART) Dry Needling Physiotherapies Massage Therapy We are one of the few massage therapy centers in the greater Charleston area that can treat clinical musculoskeletal issues to support your healing and provide lasting relief.
