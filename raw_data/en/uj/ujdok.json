Karina, Nutritional Therapist Working in the wrong corporate role left me feeling stressed and exhausted. I decided to fix my fatigue for good. Regaining my energy has enabled me to become a mother, clinician and author - I never thought this would happen. Read more My health deteriorated - I was constantly exhausted Before studying at CNM, I was a senior HR business partner for a private equity consulting firm, working long hours in a stressful environment. It wasn't the right career path for me, but I felt stuck and unfulfilled, and I didn't know what to do. I couldn't fathom a way out - the thought of studying and working at the same time seemed impossible. My health was suffering too. I was constantly fatigued and anxious and I felt so unwell. My sleep was dysregulated, my blood sugars were out of balance and I was experiencing regular panic attacks. Flexible study programme so I could still work I first heard about CNM through a friend. She spoke very highly of the college and told me how much she loved enjoyed there. This piqued my interest to find out more. What appealed to me most about CNM's nutrition course was its holistic focus and the 200 hours of clinic. I loved all the lecturers and the practical tools we were given. Being able to learn about other areas of natural therapies such as herbal medicine and iridology was great too. I did the course over a 4-year period whilst working and pregnant - something I thought wasn't possible. CNM's flexible study programme enabled me to fit study around my work and personal commitments. Studying nutrition helped me heal my body Just before starting the course, I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease. I learnt so much on the course to help heal my body and get my health back. Being able to talk to lecturers who are experienced practitioners and learn from them enabled me to try out different treatment protocols. I experimented with my diet, nutritional supplements, herbal remedies and teas, and other modalities such as acupuncture. Getting lots of opinions and expert advice from CNM staff meant I didn't have to go to the US to take IV drugs. It was a complete game changer and transformed my life and health. Being in the student clinic observing others and taking cases was fantastic. It was such an enthralling experience, both terrifying and wonderful in equal measure. You are given robust feedback from mentors and supervisors that helps build your confidence and expand your learning - it's the best way to prepare yourself for clinic when you graduate. Brimming with health and smashing goals Since graduating, I've launched my nutrition clinic NOCO Health, written a book and had a baby - major milestones in my life that I couldn't have achieved without regaining my energy and health. I'm using my skills as an executive coach along with my nutrition knowledge to help clients regain their health. I'm incredibly grateful for all the knowledge I gained at CNM - I feel like I've finally found my true calling. My book - Fix your Fatigue - has already reached Amazon's bestseller chart after launching a few weeks ago. After researching the book market, I discovered a niche as there were no other books quite like mine. I wrote a solid book proposal and pitched it to Penguin, a major publishing house, without a literary agent or large social media following. I was amazed when they liked my book idea and decided to publish it! I got a literary agent off the back of my book deal. What this experience has taught me is that you really have to go for things and just make them happen. Don't overthink it or second guess yourself; believe and trust you have all the knowledge you need to succeed. The only way you can become an expert is by going for things. Being able to educate and inspire others to make real change in their lives is incredibly rewarding. My tips for writing a book My advice for anyone wanting to write a book is to just get started. Adopt Tim Ferris' principle of writing one line a day - that's all it takes. One line is very achievable. Soon, all those lines will turn into chapters that form your book. Write without judgement and shut down your inner critic - let the words flow. Everyone has a USP, a unique story to share with the world. Do your research and find gaps in the market that your book could fill - this is what publishers are looking for. Plan your business methodically My tips for getting your nutrition business off the ground are to take a systematic approach and plan, plan, plan. Ensure you set up your clinic correctly and compliantly at the start; it saves a lot of time and hassle in the long term - get your accreditations, insurance and business tools organised first. Get a website up as soon as possible and don't overthink it. So many people spend hours stressing about their website, wanting it to be perfect before they start. This is what stops them getting started. Your priority is to get clients in and having a website will help you do that. Networking and having a mentor are essential Align yourself with a supervisor or mentor as they can provide valuable support and insight, answer your questions and help problem-solve difficult situations. Create your own personal boardroom of mentors for different aspects of your business. Determine your skill gaps and find an expert in these areas from whom you can learn. It's also really important to have a network of peers to connect with - a tribe of people to discuss things with and bounce ideas. Try to form a group with fellow students, join social media groups and go to in-person networking events. Anything is possible when you put your mind to it What I love most about practising is helping clients who are struggling with fatigue and helping them to turn their lives around - there is no better feeling and it's hugely rewarding. So many people are desperate for help and support, and the NHS is on its knees without the time, budget or resources to help these people. We need to work collaboratively to support people with their health. I would love to see the current healthcare model in this country changed to one that is more patient-centred. I'm excited to see what the future holds... I'd love to turn my book into a Netflix documentary, write more books and work with brands in the nutrition space. My belief is that anything is possible when you put your mind to it. CNM has been fantastic and I loved studying at the college. I highly recommend them to anyone thinking about studying nutrition or natural medicine.

Luckily, my family recommended I see a nutritional therapist. After just one week of tweaking my diet, I felt the best I had in years! This was my calling to learn more about nutrition Read more My CNM course made it easy to change career I grew up in Lithuania, where folk medicine is still very much used by most households. Alongside drugs, GP's in Lithuania also give you advice on how to manage your diet and what herbs to take. Since I was brought up in that setting, it made sense for me to deepen the knowledge of what I already knew. I was looking for a flexible course that would support my career transition from being a sommelier to a nutritional therapist. I also wanted a well-established course with a holistic approach. CNM encompassed everything I needed for and more! I now have the lifestyle I dreamed of My qualification has allowed me to have the lifestyle I've always wanted. I can pick and choose my own hours and I'm so grateful I don't have to be stuck in the office from 9 to 5 anymore! I see clients in Bath and Bristol, supporting them with a variety of health issues, from digestion and stress to energy management. I coach people with bulimia and binge eating disorders as the valuable lessons I learnt myself can help others turn their lives around too. I work my own hours and run a very successful practice Gunilla, Homeopathy & Naturopathy I used to give my children homeopathic remedies for minor ailments. I found them so effective that I decided to train to become a homeopath! Read more Natural medicine opened my eyes Realising the healing potential of natural medicine really opened my eyes. Seeing how effective homeopathy was with my children made me want to learn more. My clinic is booming I found my CNM studies completely enthralling. Despite being in my 40s and having to fit study around running a home, a family and a job, I was addicted to what I was learning. I couldn't wait for my next weekend of college to arrive, especially the clinical practice. After graduating, I quickly built up a reputation and now over 90% of my clients find me through word-of-mouth. I'm my own boss Being self-employed means I can work the hours I choose to fit around my family and lifestyle. What I love most about my job as homeopath is understanding what makes my clients tick. [Become a homeopath](https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/courses-eu/courses-homeopathy/) CNM's courses are the most well-rounded and up-to-date Suzie, Naturopathic Nutrition When comparing various nutrition courses, CNM's was the most well-rounded, holistic and up-to-date course around. The clinical practice was also fantastic to get real life practice. My CNM lecturers were brilliant, always challenging and supporting us. Read more I was ready to see clients straightaway Once qualified, I started to see clients straightaway. I soon realised how a paleo/primal approach to diet and lifestyle significantly helped whatever ailment my clients were dealing with. As a result, I became a huge paleo advocate and now my whole family follows a paleo lifestyle (including the dog and cats). I launched my own healthy snack range I launched my own range of healthy snacks, Primal Pantry, which are tasty, nutritious and made with whole foods. They are vegan and free from grains, dairy, refined sugars and vegetable oils. I could never have anticipated how popular the range would be - we sold 20,000 bars in the first two weeks after launching! I have the satisfaction of knowing that lots of people are benefitting from Primal Pantry's commitment to real food, an approach that was highly emphasised at CNM. I produced a book which became a global hit Elizabeth, Herbal Medicine and Naturopathy My first book Eat Yourself Young became a global hit, translated into eight languages. I regularly write for the media and I'm a healthy eating guru on a TV show. Read more The health foundation I needed CNM gave me the foundation of my knowledge in health, food and herbal medicine. All the teachers were amazing and so encouraging; they made me hungry for more knowledge and it was this hunger that has led me to where I am today. The great thing is I can keep coming back to CNM and learning more - the learning never ends! Thank you CNM. Studying at CNM helped me get my life and health back Nikki, Naturopathic Nutrition I loved being a student at CNM. The lecturers had so much enthusiasm in their teaching and their deep knowledge was incredibly inspiring and motivating. In the three years I was at CNM, I learned more than I could have expected or hoped for. It was a challenging and thoroughly captivating journey that changed my whole life. Read more I wanted to be self-employed so I could have the flexibility to work when I wanted. Having always been interested in nutrition and natural therapies, once I started studying at CNM, I knew I was on the right path and this was career change I'd been looking for. I desperately sought answers for my poor health After university, I had a couple of stressful life events which led me down the route of orthorexia. I followed radical health trends which weren't healthy at all and as a result, my health suffered. I experienced endometriosis, chronic UTI's, acne, candida, anxiety, panic attacks and C. difficile. I was prescribed medication but my health only worsened. Symptoms kept recurring and new health problems appeared - I was left feeling let down. The wake-up call I needed When I lost two loved ones to cancer, I got a wake-up call and I realised how important it was to look after my health. I decided to learn more about nutrition and it was the best thing I ever did. I worked with a nutritional therapist for a year and together we slowly built my health back up again. After seeing the positive effects that nutritional therapy had on my own health, I embarked on the biomedicine and nutrition course at CNM. I researched all the nutrition courses available and decided on CNM as it covered all bases for me: in-depth learning, good quality lecturers, face-to-face teaching and approved qualifications. Studying at CNM gave me access to incredible teachers and tools I could use to continue my good health journey and help others too. CNM exceeded my expectations I loved being a student at CNM. The lecturers had so much enthusiasm in their teaching and their deep knowledge was incredibly inspiring and motivating. The clinics were exciting and really prepared us for our own practice. In the three years I was at CNM, I learned more than I could have expected or hoped for. It was a challenging and thoroughly captivating journey that changed my whole life. My business is booming I've set up my own nutritional therapy business and I specialise in nutrigenomics and gut health. I'm already practising and doing well! I offer 1:1 nutritional therapy consultations at my clinic and I also run wellbeing talks for businesses. If you're interested in nutrition and supporting people with health conditions, then CNM provides you with all the tools you need to do this effectively and safely. It has motivated me to make positive changes in my life and fuelled my confidence to keep finding new adventures and challenges in life. Fantastic facilities and flexible study options Farah, Nutrition Graduate To pay for my education, I had to continue working part-time whilst studying, so CNM's flexible, part-time course structure suited me perfectly. The central London location and the fantastic facilities also drew me to the college. Read more I had a desire to help others As a wellness centre business owner, my focus was on business and staff management. Working with some very talented wellness practitioners led me to want to become a practitioner myself. I had a desire to help others improve their health and wellbeing, as nature intended. The clinical practice was invaluable I chose to study nutritional therapy as eating well makes a real difference to maintaining optimum health. The practical experience I gained from the student clinic in my final year was invaluable and meant I was ready to hit the ground running and begin practicing professionally straight after graduation. I found my true calling I have finally found my calling; I'm now able help others find a balanced way of being healthy without the gimmicky and misleading diets touted by the media, which only lead to confusion. I work with private clients in my business, Integrity Nutrition and Health, and I'm also a visiting practitioner at 5-star wellness retreats and resorts globally, helping with food nutrition and various wellness programmes. I run community presentations/webinars on nutrition and wellness, and work with chefs using my global cuisine knowledge to encourage healthy ingredient choices. I'm always expanding my knowledge I love being a practitioner and helping clients experience positive results when addressing their health issues. I also enjoy learning something new every day; I read journals and research papers, and study whenever I can as it enables me to expand my abilities to become an exceptional practitioner. Studying at CNM transformed my life Katie, Naturopathic Nutrition Words cannot express how much gratitude I have for CNM. Dreams and passions that I never thought would have been possible are now my reality. Read more So unwell I was bedbound Pushing myself physically and mentally to achieve 'perfection' at a top ten university led me to becoming unwell and bedbound. From aged 18/19 onwards, I was diagnosed with a whole medley of conditions including CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome)/ ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis), coeliac disease and IBS. I wasn't getting anywhere with a mainstream approach, so I started to go down a more holistic route. I saw a naturopath and then a naturopathic nutritionist. It was during this time that I was able to complete my degree at a local university due to the improvements I was making. Inspiring lectures and extensive clinical training Having been able to take control of my own health, I was inspired to educate myself further and went on to train in Manchester at CNM. The fact there was a college in the North West made studying accessible to me. Being able to accrue over 200 hours of clinical experience on the course also appealed to me as I knew it would be invaluable training. I've met so many inspirational people along the way who are now friends for life. I particularly loved my first year of biomedicine - it sparked a deeper passion inside me that I didn't know existed and provided a great foundational springboard to expand on knowledge in nutritional lectures and clinical experiences. My dream career became a reality Since graduating, I've just set up my own Nutritional Therapy practice where I specialise in chronic illness, particularly chronic fatigue syndrome/ME, IBS and ADHD. I'm also finishing my environmental medicine post-graduate course at CNM which has been transformational. I love helping and supporting people with their health. Running my own business has been dream of mine since attending CNM as it gives me total control over my work-life balance whilst also allowing me to make a positive difference to others. Studying natural therapies has been a privilege. It allows you look at the body as a whole and realise how interconnected and intricate each body system is, and the power that nutritional choices can have on the body. The knowledge you learn from evidence-based approaches at CNM is so empowering and inspiring. Once you start on this journey, the desire for learning never fades. My life and health have transformed since studying at CNM Lucia, Nutrition Graduate I feel so proud to have achieved a second qualification in my 30s, enabling me to change careers to do something I love where I can help improve the health of others. Read more An unhealthy lifestyle diminished my health For many years I worked in fashion which was very stressful due to the long working hours and constant travelling. I grew tired of the emptiness of the fashion industry and wanted a career where I could help others through my knowledge. Having my own business and the freedom to work flexibly was also important to me. I grew up in Italy where natural remedies are part of the culture. Even from a young age, I tried not to use too many medicines and instead focus on leading a healthy lifestyle and keeping active. My diet was balanced and I cooked from scratch using seasonal produce. I was lucky that my local pharmacy also had a herbalist and homeopath to advise on alternative natural remedies. However, when I moved to London in my 20s, I let my diet slip and didn't use alternative medicines as they weren't as accessible to me as in Italy. Over time the change in my lifestyle and stressful career resulted in low energy, insomnia and hormone imbalance. After little help from my GP, I reverted back to healthy nutrition and natural therapies to take control of my health and life again. Studying at CNM was empowering, eye-opening and motivating CNM's holistic approach to nutrition and wellbeing and their extensive clinical practice hours is what attracted me to the college. The campus is also in a prime London location which is convenient to reach. I especially loved how passionate and knowledgeable all of the lecturers were. It was great to have a range of lecturers for different topics in the first two years as it exposed me to diverse points of view and practicing styles. I also thoroughly loved the clinical practice; it was nerve wracking at first but felt so rewarding to have my first client and see how I helped them gain health. I also loved meeting new like-minded people during the course, some of whom have become very close friends. I now have complete control over my health My life has changed for the better since applying the knowledge I gained through CNM's nutrition course. I've restored my energy levels and my hormones are balanced again. Just a week after receiving my nutrition diploma, I set up my online practice and I also consult for a company that specialises in nutrition. I'm so grateful that I now have total control over my health and career and that I can apply my knowledge to help improve other people's lives too. If you're thinking about studying at CNM - don't wait! Take ownership of your life and health now, it's a decision you won't regret. A life changing course - I'm now doing a career I love! Suzannah, Nutrition and Naturopathy Graduate Understanding the healing power of food was life changing for me. When I discovered CNM, I knew from the course outline that it was the right college for me. Studying nutrition and naturopathy has enabled me to begin a new career helping others with their health. Read more Seeing a Naturopath gave me a new lease of life After years of suffering with IBS and constant gut issues, I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis and was prescribed steroids and other medication that caused me to experience multiple side effects. A few months later, my GP agreed I should come off the medication; I went to see a Naturopath instead. At that point I'd become intolerant to a long list of foods and thought I'd have to adhere to a strict diet forever. The naturopath addressed my diet and eliminated lots of foods; she also recommended supplements to reduce inflammation and heal my gut naturally. I strictly followed the plan for twelve months before re-introducing foods again. It was so wonderful to feel well and no longer be constantly bloated, nauseous and exhausted. I was pain free and full of energy; this made me want to help others the way I'd been helped. Incredible lecturers and clinic training My first career was designing children's clothes and maternity wear before becoming a full-time mum. Even though I loved my job as a designer, after a long break from it, I wanted a change. Studying at CNM enabled me to embark on a new career I'm passionate about; I highly recommend CNM to others looking to improve their health, help family members or start a new career. The training at CNM was very thorough and professional. All the lecturers were incredible and the clinical training brought it all together for me. I love sharing the knowledge I've learnt with my clients (both from my studies at CNM and ongoing courses I attend) to improve and support their health and wellbeing. I now run a successful practice, doing a job I love After graduating, I set up my own private practice, Suzannah Jackson Nutrition, and I work from my private clinic in Kingston and The Private GP Group. Before this, I practised at Irrefutable Health and Grayshott Medical Spa on their seven-day health regime. Following a functional medicine approach means I aim to get to the root cause of my client's issues to support them with gut health, skin conditions, hormones, weight loss, chronic fatigue and post viral syndrome. I'm incredibly lucky to be running a successful business and doing a job I love, working the hours I choose. My health and life have completely transformed since studying nutrition Karina, Nutrition Graduate I was the Head of HR for a fast-growing Fintech company and I decided to change my career path for a number of reasons. I felt I wasn't really fulfilled and I was stressed, tired and exhausted all the time. Read more I was so burnt out and needed a change so when lockdown hit, it was a chance to leave my job and pursue my dream of having my own business. I started NOCO Health, a nutrition clinic specialising in energy, stress, digestion and pre/post natal support as I am passionate about transforming people's lives. I've always suffered from terrible gastrointestinal issues and I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in 2014 and Lyme disease in 2018. On some occasions the gastrointestinal pain was so bad that I ended up in hospital and in 2018, I was sleeping for up to five hours during the day which went on for months. I was fed up of going to the doctors and being shipped out after five minutes, usually with a diagnosis I felt was incorrect or I was given a diagnosis too quickly without any testing or identification of the root cause. My best friend was also diagnosed with terminal cancer in that same month so I signed up to the College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) because I never want anyone to have to go through what she has. If I can help educate anyone to reduce the risk of that outcome in some small way, at least something positive will come out of this. After a lot of research CNM's course appealed to me due to its functional medicine approach, with a real emphasis on treating the root cause and not just the symptoms which I think is a really exciting and a game-changing field of nutritional science. The quality of the teaching, course content and amount of clinic hours at CNM (which most other courses don't offer) is excellent. What I loved most about the course was the people. I've made some wonderful friends, who I wouldn't have ordinarily met, who are kind, inspiring and lovely to be around. I've also had some brilliant lecturers. I've never really felt my body operated optimally and whilst I think a large part of this was due to working in stressful industries, I also think it's because I didn't have the knowledge that I now have to really change my health at a cellular level. Everything I've learnt so far has been life changing and I'm now feeling the best I've felt in years. I run NOCO Health which has been years in the making. I really enjoy working with clients to fully understand why they have decided to come and see me and what their issues are. I genuinely believe that I can help reduce or eradicate entirely their symptoms by following an evidenced based nutrition and lifestyle protocol. I take a bespoke approach with all my clients as a one size fits all approach will not work. In addition, in my sphere as an executive coach, I also coach startups in the wellness industry to support them in their journey from their idea through to the launch of their business. Starting my own business has enabled me to work flexibly and create a better lifestyle for myself and I can already see the benefits to my health and happiness. Three months ago I gave birth to my son William and this business will allow me to be a mother and a business owner. Enrolling onto CNM's Naturopathic Nutrition diploma is the best investment you can make for yourself. It is truly life changing. CNM's offers a truly unique holistic approach Dominica, Graduate of Herbal Medicine, Naturopathy and Iridology I had a gut feeling that CNM was the best place to study as it offered the holistic approach I wanted to share with my clients. This holistic aspect is missing from university training and most other courses. Read more My unhealthy lifestyle deteriorated my health After moving from Poland to London in 2007, I launched a marketing company which grew really quickly and became a huge success. After a few years, my heath started to deteriorate and this was largely due to working so hard, not resting and burning the candle at both ends. I thought that having my own business would give me more freedom but it was the complete opposite. My lifestyle involved working 16-hour days, too much socialising, drinking excessive alcohol, smoking, eating unhealthy convenience food and little sleep; I was completely exhausted and not connected to my body at all. I was plagued with constant chest infections and colds - this was my body's way of telling me something was wrong. One day I woke up with severe eczema all over my face and neck; I was devastated and couldn't believe it had happened. My cheeks and eyelids were red and inflamed; it was so painful and embarrassing. I had a workshop to run the day it happened; I cried all the way home afterwards as the eczema affected my performance and made me lose my confidence. The wakeup call I needed My poor health started to negatively affect my business and cashflow - this increased my stress levels further. After countless visits to the doctor, only to be prescribed steroid cream and medication, I felt lost and hopeless. Feeling emotionally drained, I had no energy to work. My GP recommended anti-depressants to get me back on my feet. I declined but it was a very interesting situation because as she was talking to me, I heard a voice telling me not to do it - this was the wakeup call I needed to take action. A plant-based diet healed my eczema When at home, I started researching myself and read lots of success stories about people who had overcome their health issues (including eczema) by eating a plant-based diet. After learning this, I changed my diet overnight; being Polish, this was incredibly hard for me as my diet consisted of lots of meat, dairy and fatty foods. It was the best decision I've ever made as I instantly felt better and my eczema improved. Expanding my knowledge boosted my business I started a blog to document my healing journey and share my recipes. In doing so, I rediscovered my passion for cooking which led me to start making my own plant-based patties and veggie burgers. This inspired me to run my own cooking workshops which became popular very quickly. People started asking me questions about digestion and what foods could be eaten for particular conditions. I didn't know how to help them and this left me feeling deflated. I soon enrolled on a health coaching course and this was the start of my learning experience, giving me insight into what is happening in the body. Once qualified, I started offering health coaching sessions - I finally felt I was on the right path. I love sharing how healing food can be so I went on to study nutrition, naturopathy and herbal medicine at CNM to learn how to nourish the body more. Invaluable clinical training in a supportive environment When I was looking for a herbal medicine course, I came across CNM's website. I was so impressed by all the interesting information and courses on offer that I called up the college and enrolled on the course straightaway. What I loved most about the course was the clinics, they are crucial for learning. I don't understand how other online courses give you a qualification with no clinical training. I also really enjoyed learning about Ayurveda and Iridology - for me this was lifechanging. I now build iridology into my practice. CNM's training connected all the dots for me and also connected me with so many people; I had a wonderful group of peers and we are all still in touch. The key for me was learning about the root cause of diseases, it gave me the understanding of a fully holistic approach that I was looking for. I found my true path and now love what I do With all my skills and knowledge, I've been able to create my own unique programme which offers a fully integrative approach where I combine nutrition, detox, naturopathy, herbal medicine and iridology. I empower my clients to take full responsibility for their health and give them the knowledge so they can then share it with their family and friends. I now run two companies: my private clinic, Wellness Alchemy, where I offer consultations, workshops and training. Due to my eczema, I was interested in skincare products and I began making my own creams and lotions. This soon developed into my own skincare company, Surrey Organics. You can find more information about me at [http://dominicacollis.com](http://dominicacollis.com). I've recently started a new marketing role at CNM where I'll be involved in researching and launching CNM courses in Poland and amongst Polish-speaking communities. What I love most about my job is educating and empowering people by sharing my knowledge. Seeing my clients change for the better is so rewarding and gives me such a good feeling. My advice to anyone thinking about studying natural therapies is to definitely study at CNM. The clinical training, support, staff and atmosphere are amazing. My big tip is to dedicate 15 minutes every day to read something and learn. Over time, this knowledge adds up and it really helped me to cement the knowledge, making the exams easier. Thank you CNM for my amazing studying experience! Yelena, Nutrition Graduate What I enjoyed most about the course was the enriching variety of subjects and speakers, some of whom I found moving and lifechanging. The clinic days were also very helpful and insightful; I learnt a lot and I'm grateful for my experience at CNM. Read more I was fascinated by the impact food had on my body I've always had a deep interest and passion for nutrition. I started doing fitness training when I was ten and then competing at fourteen. I was very curious about why certain foods impacted my body in different ways and I could feel the difference in my performance, dependent on the food I was eating. This ignited my desire to study for a master's in physical education. I immersed myself in the fields of biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, sports medicine and psychology for four years. It was a very nourishing time of discovery through training and studying. I went on to work as a sports coach, manager and a personal trainer at private health clubs and gyms. Weekend study suited me perfectly My interest in nutrition grew stronger, leading me to attend different seminars, expos, training days in the UK and abroad. I had the opportunity to go to many of the educational seminars at CNM. I enjoyed them immensely as the subjects were so diverse. I made the decision to enrol on the Nutritional Therapy 3-year diploma at CNM. Due to my work commitments I was only able to study at the weekends, so CNM's flexible study programme suited me perfectly. My business has now transformed I'm in the process of transforming my business to a personalised health and wellness practice for women and children, incorporating nutrition and laboratory testing as part of my services. Studying at CNM has transformed every aspect of my life Joy, Nutrition Graduate There isn't one area of my life that hasn't been positively impacted by studying nutrition at CNM. Nutritional Therapy is my passion, my career, and what I'm now known for. Read more Nutrition was the key to my health issues After suffering from chronic allergies, skin issues and digestive complaints for many years, it wasn't until I learnt about nutrition that profound changes occurred in my health. I was inspired to study natural therapies after seeing a close family member recover from chronic fatigue syndrome by making nutrition and lifestyle changes despite being told they would have the condition for life and only given antidepressants to help. They are now thriving and brimming with energy - I've always wanted to champion this kind of change in other people's lives. The clinical hours set you up for success Whilst I was looking at different colleges to study nutrition, I came across CNM which looked very impressive. I decided to find out more about the course as I loved the sound of it. The weekend study option offered by CNM Belfast suited me perfectly as I could continue working while studying. The first year of biomedicine helped lay down the foundations for understanding how the body works - this knowledge is invaluable. I especially loved the clinical hours which commenced in my second year. I observed consultations for 100 hours and then undertook 100 clinical hours with my own clients; this level of clinical experience really sets you up for success when you graduate. You learn so much and get a true feel of what your future career could look like! Changing people's lives is so rewarding I now run my own business, Joy Fuelled Nutrition, where I consult with clients privately. I also work out of a family run clinic alongside a Herbalist and a Kinesiologist. I specialise in gut health, skin health and autoimmunity, paired with relevant functional testing. I'm so inspired by clients who are ready and willing to do what they need to do to get their health back and overcome chronic illness. It's so rewarding to see the difference I've been able to make to my client's lives, enabling them get their health and quality of life back. If like me, nutrition is your passion, CNM is a great way to grow and harness your skills. Studying at CNM equips you with a wealth of tools to succeed and make your dream career a reality. CNM helped me transform my health and build a thriving career Emma, Nutrition Graduate My life has changed so much since studying at CNM. I've gained confidence in myself because I now understand how to look after my skin using nutrition. Read more Changing my diet resolved my chronic acne I suffered from face and body acne in my early teens which continued into my early adulthood. I spent years trying every product on the market, hoping that something would help, but nothing ever did. I felt very uncomfortable in my skin and was constantly trying to hide it from the world. I wore baggy t-shirts and went on sunbeds to make my skin look darker so no one would notice my acne or scars. In my mid-twenties, I learnt about the effects that dairy and sugar had on my body. After much research I embarked on an elimination diet for four weeks. By the end of the month, I not only looked amazing, I felt great too. In that moment I finally realised the impact that food has on my body; however, I didn't know how it all linked together. This made me want to learn more so I could understand what was causing my breakouts and why. Comprehensive modules in a supportive environment In October 2017, I took a short course at CNM on natural skincare and nutrition and I was shocked to discover the link between nutrition and skin conditions. On the way out I picked up a leaflet on becoming a nutritional therapist and soon after, I booked a consultation to discuss training. I signed up to start the course in January 2018. The detail CNM go into for each module is unbelievable - you learn so much! I especially loved the clinic training in the second year; being able to apply my knowledge and help people felt great. The people at CNM, both students and lecturers, are so supportive and welcoming. I really looked forward to studying and seeing everyone at the college on the weekends. Studying nutrition has transformed my life I've been able to build a thriving career I'm passionate about and help others. I specialise in acne and plan to branch out into other skin conditions as I believe many people are not informed about how nutrition affects their skin. I want to help people avoid the pitfalls I went through. As my knowledge increases, my health also improves. Knowing I have the ability to help someone look and feel better is the best feeling ever! CNM's courses are flexible, manageable and conveniently located Kimberly, Nutrition Graduate I loved that the course was part-time and spread over three years; it offered flexibility that other courses didn't. The diploma felt manageable and achievable. CNM has a fantastic reputation and the college is conveniently located in central London. Read more Having a job where I could set my own hours was key After working as an adoption and fostering social worker for many years, I took 18 months off after I had my son. When I went back to work, things didn't feel the same; my job was demanding and my work-life balance wasn't right. I wanted a job where I could set my own hours and have the flexibility to spend more time with my son. Food and nutrition had always been my passion so I went to a CNM open day and decided to do the naturopathic nutrition diploma. Inspiring lecturers and excellent in-clinic training Studying at CNM completely changed my life. All the topics were incredibly interesting, especially the nutrition modules, and I loved the practical component of the in-clinic training. Doing mock consults was a fantastic experience. All the lecturers are so inspiring and knowledgeable. I also met some lovely people who I'm still in contact with. My nutrition qualification gave me an edge I started my vegan food blog whilst studying to build an audience and a catalogue of recipes to share with clients when I graduated. Thinking about the marketing and business side early on has been pivotal in my business' success. My blog gained a lot of traction which resulted in me being offered sponsorship deals. Realising food photography was my strength (rather than consulting), I've focussed my business around food photography and styling. However, having my nutrition qualification has given me an edge and set my blog apart from the thousands of other blogs out there. I now work full-time as a food photographer and recipe developer, and I also teach food styling and food photography. I do a lot of sponsored content and influencer work too, promoting products for brands. I do all this from home, working my own hours. My job allows me to be very creative and no two days are the same; I also get to spend lots of quality time with my son. CNM offers a solid foundation in nutrition and health My advice to anyone thinking about studying nutrition at CNM is to go for it as the knowledge you gain is invaluable. Even if you don't want to practice, you can use it to improve your own health. The course gives you a solid foundation in how the body works, nutrition and healthy living. Think about your end goal from the outset - what do you want to achieve and how will your business look? When you know this, you can start brainstorming and put plans in place to make it happen. An incredibly supportive community of likeminded people Korina, Nutrition Graduate I was attracted to CNM because of their holistic and naturopathic approach to health and the 200 hours of clinical practice they offer. I enjoyed being surrounded by likeminded individuals, students and teachers, all of whom shared the same passions and interests as me. Read more I found my life purpose For over ten years, I worked as a marketing insights practitioner finding consumer insights to unlock consumer growth of products. The most profound insight of my career was discovering the power of nature and food, and its ability to prevent chronic disease and support health. I also realised that people want to eat healthier, but quite often, they are confused by all the conflicting information and they don't know how to change their diet. Knowing this shifted my life purpose into something more meaningful; to support people in achieving long-lasting health through the power of food, breathing and movement. I'm a cancer thriver, not a survivor In June 2016, I was diagnosed with Diffused B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a form of blood cancer. Although I underwent conventional treatments (chemotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplant), I felt the need to support my body by changing my diet and lifestyle. After relapsing once in 2017, the changes were essential if I wanted to stay in remission. My interest in natural therapies started through experimentation on myself. I saw Nutritional Therapist Jo Gamble who supported me with nutrition and lifestyle interventions. I knew I was on the right path when I saw what a profound effect the dietary and lifestyle changes had made; my quality of life had improved and I was thriving, despite the hideous side-effects of the chemotherapy. I now describe myself as a cancer thriver, not a survivor. Going through this experience made me want to share my knowledge with others in the hope of supporting them through the debilitating journey of cancer. CNM is supportive and nurturing What I loved about CNM's nutrition course was the emphasis on scientific rigour, underpinned not only in the lectures but also in the expectations from our assignments and the clinical practice. I received so much support from the staff and teachers throughout my illness. CNM is more than a college, it's a supportive community of likeminded individuals who are passionate about nutrition and the healing power of nature. I help add years to my client's lives My experience at CNM made me reconsider my life purpose. I've set up my nutritional practice and I mainly work with clients in my home country Greece where Nutritional Therapy is still emerging. I've received positive feedback from my clients on how I've changed their lives and made them feel well in their bodies. I now not only add more years to my client's lives but most importantly, I help add more life into their years. CNM has changed my life and health dramatically! Natasha, Nutrition Graduate Juggling study with full-time work was a challenge but it taught me how much I can achieve if I put my mind to something. CNM is a wonderful place to study. The lecturers are truly amazing and fountains of knowledge! Read more My health struggles led me to studying at CNM Before studying nutrition, I always felt like there was something missing and that my job lacked passion. I wanted to help people but didn't know how. I quit my job and went travelling in India for six months to find my feet and discover what I truly desired in life. Upon my return, I had a eureka moment and the answer came to me. My own health struggles led me on a journey. After healing myself naturally, I became fascinated by the impact that food has on the body and the science behind nutrition. I wanted to manage my PCOS naturally, not rely on medication From aged sixteen onwards, I suffered from painful stomach cramps and amenorrhoea. I was referred to a specialist who diagnosed me with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and prescribed me Metformin (a type 2 diabetes drug) and birth control pills. I was also offered surgery to remove the cysts and a series of laser hair removal sessions. Living on medication and birth control wasn't the long-term solution I wanted. So, after lots of research and with the help of my mum (who is a nurse), I looked into alternative remedies. However, as I was very young, nothing changed until after I came back to the UK from living abroad. Changing my diet and lifestyle transformed my health Whilst living abroad I developed an unhealthy lifestyle of binge drinking and poor eating habits; both of which made me put on weight. This led to me developing more painful cysts. Medical professionals were hesitant to do further surgery so I had to figure out a way of coping with PCOS without needing constant medical assistance. After returning to the UK at 23, I decided to enrol at CNM. During my studies I gradually began to sort out my diet, supplement with specific nutrients and exercise regularly. Within a few years, my periods came back which was amazing. My cycle is now regular and I have clear skin! I loved learning about biomedicine in the first year before getting stuck into nutrition as it helped me understand what is happening in the body and why. The emphasis on science and evidence-based nutrition was fascinating. My whole outlook on food and illness has changed completely, and without CNM, I wouldn't have had the knowledge and experience I do now to support my own health condition. Implementing what I've learnt at CNM has transformed my health. After suffering with irregular periods for 10 years, I now have a regular cycle and my skin has completely cleared up. Studying at CNM has been a life-changing journey Since graduating, I've set up my own clinical practice from a private medical centre; however, I also offer virtual consultation from home so I can help clients around the world. What I enjoy most is getting to the root cause of a client's health issue. The moment my clients start to see a change is so rewarding, especially if their health issues have been ongoing for years. Studying at CNM has been such an incredible life-changing journey, and it's not only impacted my health, but others too. I truly believe the more nutritionists there are with the knowledge taught by CNM, the more it could change the way our world sees health, food and medicine. I'm now in peak health and feel amazing. The most incredible thing is that I'm at my ideal weight and I have a healthy menstrual cycle. Thanks to CNM, I'm now changing so many lives through nutrition Martin, Nutrition Graduate Graduating from CNM has changed my life in so many ways. I'm now fortunate enough to work full-time as a Nutritional Therapist, allowing me to change so many people's lives. I love seeing a client come in for a follow-up with a smile on their face, telling me they've never felt better, after making the changes I recommended. Read more My lifestyle was negatively affecting my health I've been fortunate enough to play music professionally since my teens, however, the travel, late nights and beige foods started to take a toll on my health. Poor sleep, low mood and terrible energy levels had become my normal and I knew something needed to change. CNM's course is very comprehensive I started looking into nutrition and came across CNM. From my research, I felt CNM's Naturopathic Nutrition diploma was the best course to study to enable me to build a clinical practice. The course not only educated me on science and how the body works, but it also taught me how to work with clients and guide them towards better health. Excellent lecturers and peer support I found CNM exciting, enlightening and engaging. One of the main things I loved about the college was the fact that all the lecturers had clinical experience. This really added value to my learning experience and helped put the theory into a real-life context, even before I started in the student clinic. The support I received from other students was fantastic; most of us had been out of education for several years, so the bond we formed was really special. I now run two busy clinics I now run a clinic specialising is digestive health, with two clinic locations in the North West (Wilmslow and Central Manchester). I also run nutrition workshops at the Maggie's Cancer charity for those going through cancer treatment. I'm part of the Healthpath team where I analyse a variety of test reports and design protocols for their clients. Every now and then (when I have the time), I run workshops on food fermentation. Flexible study that fitted around my work and lifestyle Matthew, Nutrition Graduate What attracted me to CNM was the immediate warming nature of the team and the guest lecturers. Being able to attend lectures and clinical practice on the weekends was a huge bonus as I was very busy working full-time Monday to Friday. Read more CNM's training was completely different to university After training in Sports and Exercise Sciences at University and doing a Postgraduate in Sports and Exercise Nutrition, I became a Sports Nutritionist. I was interested to understand a different perspective and look at the body in terms of systems so I decided to study the Naturopathic Nutrition diploma at CNM. I wanted to diversify my practice and be able to work in private healthcare in the corporate wellness sector as a Nutritional Therapist. The Naturopathic Nutrition training offered at CNM was completely different to the way I was trained at university. The clinical practice was invaluable Whenever I set foot in the college, I felt a sense of calm and anticipation to sit back, listen and learn. I found the final year clinical practice extremely valuable as it enabled me to learn from experienced practitioners and my peers. The real-time problem solving that took place in my final year allowed me to put science and anecdotal evidence into practice. After studying nutrition with CNM you have the wonderful opportunity to establish a nutrition business online or in person and set up your own clinic. You also have the opportunity to work as a Nutritional Therapist in a business. My job is now so varied and interesting I now work as a Nutritional Therapist for Nuffield Health part-time and I run a nutrition consultancy service online where I deliver 1-2-1 consultations remotely and create content for business in the form of nutrition education. I also host a podcast called Big Feed Up HQ which focuses on nutrition, movement and outdoor experiences. I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without gaining insurance to practice through studying with CNM. Studying at CNM transformed my health and life Eleanor, Nutrition Graduate The hands-on learning experience at CNM and the true passion that every lecturer has for their field of expertise is what I loved most about the course. Read more The course changed my life I suffered from severe gut problems, acne and hormone-related conditions and wanted to gain in-depth knowledge about what was going on in my body to understand how I could help myself. Studying CNM's Naturopathic Nutrition course completely changed my life. I enrolled on the course thinking I was going to learn about different types of foods and why they are good for you. Instead, I discovered, uncovered and investigated my own health worries further and through my own knowledge, power and understanding, I've been able to heal my body and understand my symptoms. This is something I thought would never be possible. Each CNM lecturer has a true passion for the field What really attracted me to CNM's Nutrition course is how thorough the course is. It doesn't just teach you about food, it also explains the complete biological and chemistry understanding of the human body that is equal to, or even more in-depth than what is taught in some medical establishments. The hands-on learning experience and the true passion that every lecturer has for the nutrition field is what I loved the most about my studies. The fact I was also able to use evidence based research and findings to support my learning highlighted how important nutrition is for our health. The power of nutrition inspired me to help others I now have my own practice called Well Nourished Nutrition ( [http://www.wellnourished.me/](http://www.wellnourished.me/)) where I see clients on a one-to-one basis to support them with their health and wellness journey. As someone who has been affected by gut, hormone and acne related conditions, I understand the impact these health conditions can have on your life. I want to support people to get to the bottom of their symptoms to empower them to reach their optimal wellbeing. As well as seeing clients, I also run programmes, write e-books and organise events for people to take part in. I'm also a freelance digital and publication content producer, applying my passion for writing to support brands and publications. There is nothing more powerful than hearing someone say that you have made a difference to their health and that they can see the benefits of your hard work and commitment. I also love being able to use the qualification how I want to, and choose a path that works for me. An incredibly supportive college with such inspiring Jo, Nutrition Graduate If you're curious about health and nutrition, consider studying with CNM. Even if you don't want to practice, you'll leave feeling so in awe of your incredible body and you will be equipped to take the very best care of it. You're never too old to learn something new! Read more I was in constant pain I started to suffer with a very bad back and nerve pain. Some days I found it hard to walk or sleep; it was soul destroying. I got through the days with over-the-counter pain relief and spinal injections; I constantly looked pale with dark rings under my eyes. My focus on food began when juicing had just become fashionable and I went on a week-long juicing retreat. The positive impact that nutrition had on my body soon became clear. Changing my diet was a real turning point I decided to try acupuncture and explore nutrition and lifestyle changes. I started to feel so much better and this was a real light bulb moment for me. I then made the decision to study nutrition, so I began looking for courses. I found CNM on a Google search and went to meet a college representative to discuss the course in more detail. I was so excited at the thought of starting and signed up to the 3-year diploma as soon as I could. Inspiring lectures with an amazing group of peers After years of studying via distance learning, I was ready to meet other students on a regular basis and I loved the fact that CNM involved time at the college with other students. I was so lucky to study with an amazing group of people. Every lecture inspired me to learn more about the subject. I also loved the final year student clinics; even though they were nerve wracking at the beginning, the clinics gave me the confidence to be able to practice on my own. We had incredible clinical support from our clinic supervisors and peers. I got to the root cause of my symptoms The course has helped me to focus on my health and realise the importance of healing my body in a holistic way. I've been able to get to the root cause of my ill health, rather than just silencing my symptoms which has been so powerful. I now have the skill-set to help others and empower them to take charge of their health which is an amazing feeling. I now empower others to make positive changes Since graduating, I've set up a private clinic at home called Vitalife Nutrition. I create recipes and meal plans for other clinics and therapists. I'm constantly learning new things, following the latest research and reading everything I can about nutrition. I love helping clients understand how their body works and empowering them to take the first step towards positive change. Studying at CNM was life-changing, inspiring and exciting Alex, Naturopathic Nutrition I chose CNM because the college is so well-recognised and respected in the health industry. The high standard of teaching was evident from the outset. The real-life practice in the student clinic was brilliant as it prepared me for practicing immediately after graduating. Read more Studying nutrition changed my life I decided to follow my dreams and study nutrition after a life-changing event which made me reassess my life. As a chef and cookery teacher, I'd always been into food but my passion was health and nutrition. After successfully overcoming my own health issues, I wanted to learn how to help others using natural therapies. I now teach others how to eat healthily My CNM studies were life-changing, inspiring and exciting. I loved learning about the principles of functional medicine and addressing the underlying cause of a client's condition. I'm now practicing as a naturopath and nutritional therapist with clinics in Balham and central London. The feedback I get from my clients inspires and encourages me. Being able to combine my nutrition knowledge with my former chef experience enables me to show my clients practical ways to improve their diet. I'm passionate about my job and I'll never stop learning. It's so rewarding helping people to make improvements to their health. Studying nutrition has been so lifechanging; knowledge truly is power! Alicia , Nutrition Graduate I was really impressed when I visited the college for a tour; I also liked the setup of weekly lectures and observing the nutrition clinics. The syllabus was very comprehensive and the course content was amazing; I never expected to learn so much. Every module was incredibly riveting and enriching. Read more Studying nutrition elevated my business credentials I've always worked in the food industry, in my own business and as a freelance development chef, so my decision to study at CNM was to continue my learning and progress further in my profession. As a recipe developer I became really interested in nutrition and I felt a need to explore this further. Being able to improve my knowledge and understanding of food could only be a good thing. I'm the owner and curator of Lifebox Food, one of the leading health and wellbeing subscription boxes in the UK and Europe. With so much misleading information out there and dubious advertising from food brands, I felt it was really important to embark on a nutrition qualification to help ensure our customers could trust Lifebox and my judgement on the products included in the boxes. I also wanted customers to feel enriched by the health and wellbeing information we give out with each box. I wanted to help nourish people from the inside out Having suffered from a period of ill health myself, I began to notice that everyone I spoke to - friends and family - all had an ailment of some sort. It got me thinking about the importance of nutrition and the role it plays in our physical and mental health. This was the driving force that made me want to study nutrition; I wanted to help people understand their bodies so they can nourish themselves from the inside out. Learning how the body works was so eye-opening After struggling with my health in the past, learning about how our bodies work on a physiological level and the impact that nutrition and lifestyle choices have on the body has been so eye-opening. It has totally changed my mentality towards food and health, and this will never change. It's also awakened my desire to work with clients in a therapeutic capacity to help people feel their best. Establishing relationships with clients has been more rewarding than I ever could have imagined, and this all started in the CNM clinic. I help make a difference to people's lives I'm now seeing clients for nutritional therapy and corporate nutrition, as well continuing to do freelance recipe development and running Lifebox. What I love most about practicing is being able to establish therapeutic relationships with clients and feel like I'm making a difference to their quality of life and outlook. By educating clients to understand their bodies more and seeing them feel so empowered is such a wonderful thing! Studying at CNM completely changed my life Mays, Nutrition Graduate The lecturers were amazing and so inspiring. What I learnt really changed my life for the better and changed me as a person. Read more Switching to a plant-based diet cleared up my health issues I worked as an advertising producer for 18 years but I became unhappy and dissatisfied with my very stressful corporate career. I was teaching yoga on the side but it wasn't enough. I knew it was my calling to be in service and to not work in such a stressful environment that negatively impacted my health. During my yoga teacher training in India eight years ago, I was introduced to a month of raw vegan food and to the concept of conscious clean eating which changed my life. Before that I ate a standard western diet, drank alcohol and had lots of late nights; as a result I suffered from some serious gut health, skin and mood issues. Eating a natural, plant-based diet while doing my yoga training for a month increased my energy levels and I felt amazing. So, I naturally transitioned to a plant-based diet and I also dabbled in raw veganism too. Slowly all my health issues cleared up and I also developed a keen interest in health and nutrition. I started studying and researching myself and then contemplated doing a course. The course is so unique A friend recommended CNM's Naturopathic Nutrition diploma to me and I was looking at it for many years before I signed up - I was travelling a lot back in those days so it was a big commitment to stay in London for three years. But eventually I enrolled on the course and I've never looked back. What I loved about the course was the naturopathic element to it; I'm a big believer in the healing powers of nature and having looked at other courses, none of them had this important holistic element. I found my calling and now do a job I love I signed up for the course initially for my own interests; I never thought I would quit my advertising job and become a nutritionist. However, by the start of the third year, I knew there was no turning back and that I'd found my calling. I then left my job in advertising and launched my clinic as soon as I qualified. I can honestly say I've never been happier. Being able to help people every day and change their lives for the better is so rewarding and brings me so much joy on a daily basis. I help people transform their lives I have a clinic in East London but I mostly work virtually now. I also host webinars and group weight loss programmes and run an NHS-funded weight loss programme in Tower Hamlets. A lot of my clients come to me with burn-out, stress, insomnia and anxiety often linking to gut problems so I help them overcome these issues as well as specialising in plant-based nutrition. I also teach yoga and meditation and host transformational wellness retreats. I love helping people transform their lives and feel great inside and out. I work holistically and look at the overall mind body soul connection; their diet, lifestyle, connection to others, spiritual connection and purpose. CNM's training has made me a confident and competent practitioner Zo\u00eb, Nutrition Graduate I'm really proud of what I've achieved at CNM, both personally and academically, and I am grateful for the opportunities it has given me. I love being able to educate and empower my clients; enabling them to explore their health status and achieve optimal wellbeing. Read more I wanted to help myself and my family I began my studies at CNM following a long-standing interest in nutrition. I had worked in IT since leaving university but I never felt that spreadsheets and storage solutions were my true calling. After my dad had a heart attack, I started to read about nutrition as I wanted to find out how I could help him and what preventative health measures I could use for myself and my family. The clinical practice brought the knowledge to life I particularly wanted classroom-based learning and I was attracted to CNM's emphasis on clinical practice. For me, the clinical training was essential as it enabled me to feel competent and confident enough to apply the knowledge in real-life. I enjoyed learning about the science of nutrition and seeing this knowledge really come to life during clinic days. Leading and observing in clinic was an absolute privilege. The career change I was desperately seeking I quickly realised that nutrition was an area I wanted to work in and during my third year, I left my IT job to concentrate on my studies. I'm now the assistant manager for Amaranth, an award-winning wellness store based in Manchester. I also offer client nutrition consultations from Amaranth's treatment rooms as part of my own business, Step Back Nutrition. In the future, I would like to specialise in the fields of autism and ADHD. I believe everyone can benefit from nutritional therapy and I'm delighted to be a part of this growing industry. \"Studying with CNM is one of the greatest experiences you'll ever have.\" Kelly, Naturopathic Nutrition I worked for many years in events and marketing which was very stressful. My diet was poor, I lived off ready meals, pastries, crisps and coffee. I had suffered long-term with IBS, eczema and adult acne after coming off the pill for 15 years. I was run down and kept getting ill all the time. After countless trips to the GP and fruitless medical testing to get to the bottom of it all, I was so confused and upset as to why my body was completely out of sync. I'd finally met my tipping point. From then on, I decided to start taking my health into my own hands and exploring ways to improve my symptoms. Read more I was sure that my poor diet and prolonged hormonal contraception were not good for my body and wanted to make changes to my diet and lifestyle. Whilst talking to a friend, the topic of nutrition came up and it really resonated with me. There I was, struggling to enjoy full health and stumbling across Naturopathic Nutrition was like an epiphany moment. I could get to the root cause of my symptoms, and improve my health through food; a win-win! I went on to research different functional medicine degrees and realised none of them had any real-life clinical experience. CNM's 200 clinical hours meant I would be confident in my own practice as soon as I graduated. It was a huge bonus to have so much real life clinical experience rather than just academic learning and case studies. Within a week I had quit my job in events and enrolled on the Nutritional Therapy course at CNM. I also trained as a yoga teacher so that I could work teaching this whilst studying, as this was more in line with the holistic path I was choosing. Each week I was so excited to come to college. The scientific and clinical diversity of the course, as well as the holistic approach to wellness, really made me feel I would be able to make a difference in people's lives. Taking into account not only someone's physical and mental health but also their family, work and social life truly makes nutritional therapy a unique complementary practise. Understanding that as practitioners, we are a sounding board for our clients to offload their deepest worries, fears and health concerns is both an important privilege and a gateway for us to help them improve their life in every way possible. I found studying with CNM life-changing, exciting and rewarding. I also loved the community I gained over the years; creating a network of colleagues who became friends. Since graduating I am working with both private clients in Harley Street as well as corporate nutrition in the workplace. I find it so fulfilling that I am able to offer two forms of service, through my practice, The Natural Balance. I work both one-on-one with private clients, (in particular with women who have hormonal imbalances and IBS, much like I did) as well as in the corporate environment, improving workplace wellbeing. In the workplace I offer talks and workshops to educate and emphasise how nutrition helps with energy, focus, motivation and stress. I do a lot of work providing employees with the tools they need to understand what makes up a healthy diet and how to improve energy and sleep hygiene patterns. I love sharing the knowledge that enables people to help themselves. It's incredibly rewarding when I see my clients' symptoms improve. It's amazing how making small changes can produce such big results. I hope that by sharing my story, it can give others hope that they too can live a better life with full health. Nutrition has changed my life in every way possible. I think, feel, look and sleep better and I am constantly rewarded when I am able to help those around me to live a better life. Whether you are interested in learning more about nutrition and health for yourself, to help someone you know, or even to become a practitioner, studying with CNM is one of the greatest experiences you'll ever have. The knowledge you gain is invaluable and the ability to help others is everlasting. I'm the strongest and healthiest I've ever been Adam, Acupuncture & Naturopathy After years of being crippled with severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and dosed up on medication with adverse side effects, I decided to take ownership of my health. Read more I needed to make changes quickly My health was at an all-time low and I knew I needed to do something about it. What stood out to me most about studying acupuncture at CNM was the fact that the course is combined with Naturopathy. I also got to study all the naturopathic principles which was fascinating. I studied multiple subjects together Studying at CNM was mind-expanding, stimulating and enriching - I'm so grateful to my teachers for passing their wisdom onto me. I really loved the all people I met at CNM; it's a college brimming with talent, knowledge and dedication. Over 4 years, I studied biomedicine, Chinese medicine theory, applied acupuncture techniques, ancillary techniques and naturopathic principles on a part-time basis. No other college offers this mix of study and I'm proud to call myself a Naturopathic Acupuncturist. Undertaking this breadth of study has enabled me to offer a wide range of services to my clients. My health and clinic are thriving Studying naturopathy and acupuncture has changed my life because it gave me the tools to manage my own health. I'm now the strongest and healthiest I've ever been. Two weeks after graduating, I set up my own acupuncture clinic with three colleagues from my course. Being able to start making a tangible difference to other people's lives so soon after graduating was mind-blowing. The clinic has continued to grow and we've recently opened a new location to accommodate our ever-growing client list. I love working alongside colleagues I know and trust. Applying what I've learnt to benefit and support people to make positive changes in their health gives me a deep sense of satisfaction and gratitude. The story of how Adam returned to health is featured in the August 2018 edition of WDDTY Magazine.

Read more I was at breaking point After 10 years of chronic stress and working long hours, with no work-life balance, I decided I needed a change. I was at breaking point - running on adrenaline, not eating properly and experiencing chest pains. I was exhausted, my hair was thinning and I struggled with acne and hormone imbalance. The wake-up call I needed I attended a nutrition event that my trainers (two CNM graduates) were running. After listening to what they had to say and following their protocols, my health and perspective on life transformed. It was a huge wake up call. I finally understood the damage I was doing to my body and how I needed to fix it. I also realised I had a huge desire to help others. Having heard lots of great things about CNM, I decided to join. I healed my body from the inside out The clinical experience of observing and working with clients was fascinating and fulfilling. It challenged me, pushed me outside of my comfort zone and gave me an incredible sense of purpose. The CNM course emphasises the need to tackle the root cause of symptoms. This was so true in my life as I needed to address my stress and align with my core values. I'm no longer stressed and miserable Studying at CNM set the course of my life and gave me an incredible sense of purpose.

[Learn how to become a Nutritional Therapist](https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/courses-eu/courses-nutrition/) CNM's course led to my dream career Sarah, Herbal Medicine and Naturopathy As a teenager I suffered with terrible acne and poor skin. Not understanding the underlying cause, I tried every lotion and potion under the sun, but nothing helped. I then turned to nutrition. Read more The pill made my symptoms worse My GP put me on the contraceptive pill in an attempt to balance my hormones and improve my acne. This made my health and skin worse. I had mood swings, I felt depressed and I was suffering from endless bouts of thrush and irregular periods. Eventually, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. My teenage years were miserable. The course saved my life! I went to see a naturopath who helped me with my hormonal issues. I soon started to feel better and this inspired me to learn everything I could about natural therapies. I enrolled at CNM which saved my life - now I have my health back and my dream career! I get to do something I love every day and help so many people with my knowledge. Such a supportive community CNM has such an involved and supportive community. The sheer diversity of the topics was fascinating and inspired me greatly. It was amazing to meet and learn from the people who are experts in their field. I can't imagine a life without herbs I now run a busy clinic in Cornwall and I'm fortunate to be able to support people with a wide range of health issues. I can't imagine living a life without herbs or the knowledge I gained from taking the CNM course. When I made my peace with food, nutrition became my passion Karolina, Naturopathic Nutrition I wanted to study a prestigious and well-recognised diploma so I enrolled at CNM as I'd heard the courses were fantastic. Read more I was overweight and addicted to sugar I had a turbulent relationship with food growing up. As a teenager I battled with anorexia nervosa and then when I started my busy corporate job, I lived off coffee and sugary foods. After I had my children, I became overweight, fatigued and addicted to sugar. I tried every diet possible to lose weight but nothing worked. It wasn't until I realised that eating unprocessed, unrefined and chemical-free foods was all I needed to maintain my weight that something clicked. I then decided to study nutrition. After I made my peace with food, nutrition became my passion. I could fit study around my family and work With three children, I needed a study programme to fit around my family and not the other way around - CNM allowed me to do just this. Leaving the corporate world behind and re-training in nutrition has been a life-altering decision. I loved that I could see my own clients in the student clinic as it gave me the much-needed experience to prepare me for future clinic practice. The learning process was definitely worth the effort. Choosing when I work has been life-changing Straight after graduating, I founded my practice in North West London. I see patients in clinic but I also offer online consultations via Skype. I can choose when I work and I'm able to schedule my day around my kids' school, which means I don't miss anything happening in their lives. It's not only my clients who have benefitted from my knowledge, my family are also eating healthier! I consider myself very lucky to have transformed my passion into a way of living. CNM was hugely educational and inspiring Vivien, Naturopathic Nutrition Studying at CNM turned my health around and inspired me to work in this field. If you're interested in health and wellness or you're trying to improve your health naturally, then CNM is for you. The knowledge you receive is priceless. Read more I had no period, terrible acne and severe hair loss At 18, I was diagnosed with PCOS. I stopped menstruating, I developed cystic acne and my hair started to fall out at a rapid rate. I went to see numerous specialists and GP's about my symptoms, especially the hair loss, but my concerns were always dismissed. When I asked if nutrition or lifestyle could be contributing to my symptoms, I was told they wouldn't be. As a young woman, experiencing acne and hair loss was very distressing and I wanted to rid myself of these symptoms as soon as possible. I opted for the oral contraceptive pill as doctors told me this would help my skin. Instead, I ended up with depression, severe acne breakouts, night leg pains/cramps, further hair loss, food sensitivities, hives, digestive problems, dermatitis and anxiety. I discovered through research that these were very common with this medication. I now know after studying nutrition and becoming a nutritional therapist, that my poor health was directly related to how I was living my life. My symptoms disappeared when I changed my diet I was inspired to study nutrition after working with my nutritionist Dee Brereton Patel, a former CNM graduate. After listening to what she had to say, I was so motivated to improve my health that I radically changed my whole lifestyle and stopped taking the pill. I went on a gluten and dairy-free, nutrient-dense diet and took supplements to support my skin, gut and hormones. The results were amazing - my menstrual cycle returned, the cystic acne cleared up, my hair grew back and I overcame depression and anxiety. As the treatment progressed, my struggles with gut dysbiosis, bacterial overgrowth and parasites (which were identified through functional lab testing) resolved and I stopped suffering with digestive problems. The food I eat and the supplements I take, support my health and keep me well. If I deviate from my lifestyle or eat foods that don't work for my body, old symptoms flare up. Now whenever I deal with the occasional health issue, I use 'food as medicine'. I wake up every day feeling energised and positive about life. I'm so grateful every month when I get my period as it's a reflection of my health and fertility. I've learnt life-long skills to keep me healthy What I loved most about CNM was the 'whole body approach' to wellness - this really resonated with me. CNM students are trained to identify root causes, not just look at diet or count calories. We take into consideration the person's relationships, emotions, environmental exposures and health history. I loved connecting with inspiring students and lecturers and seeing people's positive life transformations in the clinics. I made great, like-minded friends and learnt how to take care of my body for the rest of my life. I love my job and life now! I now specialise in women's health, hormones, PCOS and gut health. My plan is to help as many women as possible find answers to their health issues and get the support they need. I wholeheartedly agree with the quote \"If you love your job, you never have to work a day in your life.\" This is so true for me. CNM changed my life Lauren, Naturopathic Nutrition What attracted me most to CNM was the combination of academic learning and clinical training, as well as the flexible study programme. I could study part-time whilst also working. CNM enabled me to have the lifestyle I always desired and launch my dream nutrition business. Read more I was told my case was incurable I became very unwell with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome during my second year at university. After seeing various GP's and specialists who all told me that my case was incurable, I was left feeling completely hopeless. After doing some research myself, I discovered that changing my diet and lifestyle could help relieve my symptoms and improve my overall wellbeing. This opened a door for me and I couldn't wait to learn more about nutrition and how the body works. When I left university, I enrolled at CNM where I studied Naturopathy and Nutrition. CNM transformed my health and life What I loved about the course at CNM was that it helped me to understand how important diet and lifestyle is to maintaining health and wellbeing. The course gave me the tools I needed to make decisions about my own health and also provided me clinical training to work with clients in a clinical setting. CNM provides excellent resources and help you to develop your skills to become a confident practitioner. I now have my dream nutrition business CNM changed my life because it enabled me to have a lifestyle I always desired. I launched my dream business in nutrition, coaching people to become the healthiest versions of themselves. I co-founded my own wellness brand, ARDERE, with my sister. We provide expert nutritional advice, offer healthy recipes and sell 100% organic natural wax aromatherapy candles. CNM allowed me to turn my passion into a career Mariana, Naturopathic Nutrition My studies were enjoyable, insightful and sociable! CNM offered both mid-week and weekend classes, with the added flexibility of doing much of the work remotely. This enabled me to work around my family's needs. Read more Changing my daughter's diet stopped her hospital visits I decided to study with CNM after experiencing the impact food and nutrition had on my little girl's health. She was very poorly between the ages of one and three, with frequent trips to the hospital due to recurrent chest infections and asthma-like symptoms. She had to take corticosteroids and antibiotics, plus use a variety of inhalers. We never received any nutrition or lifestyle advice. I was so frustrated as all we were doing was managing my daughter's symptoms with medication and not actually seeing any progress in her health. I consulted a nutritional therapist and worked with her to modify my daughter's diet by removing allergens and improving her gut microbiome. She got progressively better - her colds became less frequent and problematic and within 6 months she no longer needed inhalers. Now she is a very healthy and active child. We keep a 'reliever' inhaler at home as a safety precaution, just in case she catches a bad cold. Studying remotely gave me flexibility My daughter's experience was an eye-opener for me and I decided to re-train to become a nutritional therapist. I wanted to know how to manage and improve my own family's health, and help educate others. I was also looking for a career that offered me flexibility to fit my hours around the school schedule. CNM offered both mid-week and weekend classes in Manchester, with the added flexibility of doing much of the work remotely. The fact that the college also operates from other cities around the country meant that, if necessary, lectures and clinics could be attended at other locations. They offered a package that enabled me to work around my family's needs. CNM provides a supportive network My studies were enjoyable, insightful and sociable. I met so many amazing students on the course from diverse backgrounds and with different motives for studying. We became friends and still have a mutually supportive network. I also really enjoyed the fact that we were taught by different lecturers depending on the subject being covered. This gave me a good insight into different research methods and clinic styles. What I learnt at CNM has allowed me to turn my passion into a fulfilling career. I now inspire families globally to eat better When I graduated, I started working as a nutritional therapist at an existing long-established clinic as well as setting up my own clinic. What I love about practising is the people I get to work with and being part of their health journey. No two days are the same; there is always a new challenge and new areas to explore. My knowledge and continuous research and personal development in the field allows me to help others. I regularly record and post videos on YouTube to show parents how they can encourage their children to make better choices when it comes to food. CNM was an awakening and pioneering journey Eloise, Naturopathic Nutrition Studying at CNM opened up a whole new world to me and I loved learning something new every day. Aside from the knowledge, the relationships I formed with my fellow students and tutors has been invaluable. CNM connected me to many like-minded people for which I'm very grateful.

Read more I studied around my full-time job I've always had a passion for food, nutrition and how the human body works. Whilst my job in television was interesting and enjoyable, I felt my heart lay elsewhere. I was keen to train for a career I felt passionate about and one where I could help myself, my family and others to feel better. What attracted me to CNM was the holistic approach and the flexible study programme, which allowed me to study around my full-time job. The course was in-depth, engaging and empowering. My CNM qualification has opened up amazing doors of opportunity for me. My children have never been healthier I adore my work. I love sharing my knowledge and educating people in areas which are often confusing or overwhelming. It feels amazing to be able to offer personalised nutrition advice which helps people make informed decisions and become responsible for their own health. Studying nutrition has been hugely encouraging as a mother and has enabled me to help my children in the best way possible. I have clients in 6 continents Rebecca, Naturopathic Nutrition CNM changed my life completely - I now run my own business and my health has transformed. My experience at CNM was jaw-dropping, enlightening and life altering. I always wanted to work for myself, I just didn't know how. Read more I was plagued with chronic eczema I was born with chronic eczema and suffered with it my whole life. Now in my 30's I'm taking back control of my body. As a result of using steroids and antibiotics long-term, I'm now dealing with a number of serious health complications. Suppressing chronic inflammation over the years led to bone density issues later on. I was also diagnosed with atypical cells and large lumps in my breasts. My skin is now clear through detoxing Since studying at CNM and learning about nutrition, I've managed to turn my health around. Through consistent detoxification, I no longer have any atypical cells and the lumps in my breasts have shrunk dramatically. I'm still detoxing as I know how important it is to look after my body. You would never guess I ever had eczema! I now help others with their eczema I went back to school (CNM) to learn about the body so I could fix myself! Now my life is all about preventing my fate by helping the millions of children prescribed steroids for eczema at a very early age. What attracted me to CNM was the fact that I got to do supervised clinic days for practical experience. I loved the grounding the course gave me in biomedicine. I run a global online practice My life has completely changed since graduating and I love my job. I support families who have children with eczema to figure out the root of the problem and teach them how to dig it out. I run an online practice and employ 3 others to support my work. I have clients in 6 out of the 7 continents around the world. CNM has been the launchpad for my career change. Without the support and education, I wouldn't be able to do the work I do today. I published my own health book when I graduated Ciara, Naturopathic Nutrition The course was comprehensive, enjoyable and affirming - I loved every minute of it! With the skills I learnt at CNM, I've been able to publish my own nutrition and yoga book. Read more A course designed just for me I already had some knowledge of nutrition, having grown up with a mother interested in natural health. When looking for nutrition courses, I stumbled across the CNM course and it immediately resonated with me. It felt like the course had been designed just for me! I loved the lecturers and meeting like-minded people, some of whom have become very good friends. The course enriched my knowledge and helped me understand the intricate nature of therapeutic rapport and how key it is to build trust and confidence with your clients. I started my dream wellness business I was still working full-time in private banking when I started at CNM, however, I knew in my heart there was so much more I had to offer in this lifetime. I was eventually able to resign from my job and start my dream wellness business. Having also qualified as a yoga teacher, I set up my business, Wholly Aligned, which draws upon the wisdom of nutrition and yoga to help people reconnect with their mind, body and soul - ultimately to awaken their inner physician. I turned my passion for wellness into a career Amie, Naturopathic Nutrition The flexible weekend study programme and varied course content is why I chose to study at CNM. The extensive clinic training helped prepare me for clinical practice. The support and friendships I made at CNM have had an everlasting, positive impact on me. Read more I was told I'd never have children I started experiencing problematic menses when I was 14. I was subsequently diagnosed with PCOS at 19 which involved numerous visits to GP's, gynaecologists and endocrinologists. I was prescribed the contraceptive pill, metformin, the coil, antidepressants and many painkillers for my painful periods. No nutrition or lifestyle advice was ever offered to me. I gained lots of weight and my periods eventually stopped altogether. I developed acne, low mood and liver problems, which worsened through poor dietary choices at university. One gynaecologist told me (after an ovarian scan) that I was unlikely to ever be able to conceive naturally. Nutrition was the solution to my PCOS My mum inspired me to try natural therapies. At first, I wasn't interested at all. Despite my lack of interest and the GP telling her to stop putting 'faddy diet ideas' into my head, she persevered and continued to convince me. Eventually an interest sparked within me. I remember her taking me into Waterstones to choose some nutrition books - Marilyn Glenville's books were a real turning point for me. It's entirely thanks to my mum that I found the solution to my PCOS. After years of living in denial, I knew that I was the only person who could make changes so I started researching the effects of diet and exercise. I didn't want to feel miserable anymore! By changing my diet, I now have 3 children I had a lot of weight to lose so I removed all refined sugars and carbohydrates from my diet, replacing them with plenty of vegetables instead. I also exercised at the campus gym daily and started taking herbal supplements. Within four months, I'd lost two stone. For once in my life I started to listen to my body. As the weight shed, my periods returned and my skin and energy improved. My body shape changed completely and this was the motivation to keep me going. I've kept my weight to an optimal level and this has been key to maintaining hormonal balance. I've been able to have three children without any issues - something I thought was never possible! I could study and raise a family What attracted me to CNM was the flexible study programme and exciting course content. I loved the foundation year of biochemistry, anatomy and physiology - it really helped me to understand how the body works. The transformation between year one and year three of the course, in terms of knowledge, confidence and ability was amazing. My year group was fantastic, many of us studying as mature students. The whole experience was rewarding, inspiring and fascinating. I feel part of a big, supportive community where the opportunity to keep learning through events and webinars continues. I didn't think it was going to be possible to study again after having children, however, the course structure at CNM allowed me to ease myself back into education and achieve the career I wish I'd always had. I qualified in the same week as having my third child! Being able to fit education and career around my family makes it all the more enjoyable. My children have been on the journey with me and they're also benefitting from my knowledge. I now empower other women My CNM qualification has opened up a whole new world to me. When I graduated, I founded Surrey Nutrition, my nutritional therapy clinic where I focus on women's health. Being able to help women who feel so disempowered and unheard is a real privilege. I love my job as I can help make a difference to women's lives by educating and supporting them back to health. I remember what it was like to feel like them and not get the help you need. I ate myself healthy Terry, Naturopathic Nutrition The course inspired me to combine my chef skills with my newfound passion for nutrition. I created my own recipe book with healthy recipes and lifestyle tips fuelled by the correct nutritional protocols. Read more My health was deteriorating fast I was plagued with severe acne and constant mouth ulcers. Conventional treatments didn't work and my health deteriorated; this is when I started to investigate what was causing my health problems. My thought process shifted and I wondered if what I was eating - or more importantly, not eating - was the cause of my symptoms. I've written 2 books and transformed my health I enrolled on a three-year, part-time nutrition diploma with CNM, Belfast. Going back to school was daunting, however, I was hungry for the knowledge. I bought a juicer and a smoothie machine and started consuming more fruit and vegetables. I also went to see a nutritionist. By making small dietary adjustments my presenting symptoms all but disappeared. It was transformational! The course inspired me to combine my chef skills with my newfound passion for nutrition to create my own recipe book. My new book Super Nutrition is my life's work; it outlines the ways I've used nutrition and my passion for food to heal my body and mind. My practice is constantly expanding and flourishing Janet, Acupuncture & Naturopathy Over the years, I've had M.E, breast cancer and other health problems, all of which I tried to treat conventionally. Looking back as a naturopath, I can see that work stress, a marital breakdown and family bereavement all played a part in my poor health. It wasn't until I studied at CNM that my health turned around. Read more I could study at my own pace I heard about CNM's holistic approach to health so I began studying naturopathy and herbal medicine part-time whilst working and dealing with my M.E.

Read more Our genes are not our destiny As a former nurse, I was looking to build on my knowledge and learn how to prevent western diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. I refused to believe that genes are our destiny and there is little we can do to stay healthy. Studying was a huge positive turning point Studying at CNM was a turning point in my life as it opened my eyes to the impact my food choices had on my health. After every lecture, I went home buzzing with new information and the urge to research further. I used my new-found knowledge to help myself, my family and friends. When I graduated, I set up my own practice where I help people overcome addictions to refined foods. My clients may have weight issues, cravings, lack of energy and low self-esteem. I love showing them simple steps they can take to revamp their body and their health. I now have a career with real purpose Julie, Naturopathic Nutrition I studied nutrition to ensure I had a sustainable future career. I wanted a rewarding job which allowed me to make a real difference to people's health. Studying after the age of 50 has given me a new lease of life - it's opened so many doors and given me a real sense of purpose. Read more My quest for answers turned into a career When my mother was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, I was horrified that she didn't receive any nutritional advice which may have given her a better quality of life. When she passed away, I read everything I could get my hands on related to how diet and lifestyle impacts health and disease. At the time I was busy with my life and work, but I knew that one day, I'd make my quest for nutritional knowledge and answers into a career. I was inspired every single day I enrolled at CNM because of the sheer scope of the course. Studying at a college focused on the naturopathic approach brought me the opportunity to connect with so many like-minded people, lecturers and students. Everyone had special stories to tell and a passion for health - I was constantly inspired, challenged and motivated. I'm the go-to person for corporate wellness Since graduating, I've set up my own home-based practice and I work alongside a local GP. I run specialised nutrition courses and training at a skincare company and provide a corporate wellness consultancy service to local companies. As a naturopathic nutritional therapist, I love being able to positively impact people's health through education. CNM study helped me recover after cancer Nicky, Naturopathic Nutrition My CNM journey has been one of inspiration, self-discovery and personal growth. Having access to knowledgeable and passionate lecturers was such a gift. Read more Getting cancer was my wake-up call My life was turned upside down when my health deteriorated and I burnt out. Up until that point, I had had zero knowledge or interest in food. Food was just fuel and I was living on ready meals and sugary snacks. Following a diagnosis of bladder cancer, I realised I had to start taking responsibility for my health. My poor diet, coupled with a stressful lifestyle had created perfect storm! The course was affordable and flexible I attended a CNM's Nutrition for Everyday Living weekend course which I loved, so I enrolled in the full nutrition diploma. I wanted to learn how to recover my health. The part-time study and affordable course fees were attractive, plus the course content was fascinating. Being pain-free was a profound moment Six months into my course, I had a very bad reaction to my final cancer treatment. I was in agony, taking lots of pain killers and barely able to crawl out of the house. I knew I couldn't give up on my studies; it gave me focus to keep going. I was learning so much about the body including how cancer works and the dietary changes I needed to make to get well again. I learned to listen to my body. Two years later when sitting in the cafeteria at college, I had the emotional realisation that I was no longer in pain and my health was improving - it was a profound moment. My dream job in Thailand After graduating, I hit the ground running and practiced as a nutritional therapist at a retreat in Thailand for three months. I now have my own home-based private practice. I also work in clinics teaching groups of pre-diabetic people how they can prevent the onset of diabetes through nutrition and lifestyle. I offer nutrition and yoga workshops and run wellbeing talks at local creative companies. I'm planning to offer wellness retreats, in the UK and abroad, to harness the power of sunshine and encompass the adventure of travelling. The power of good nutrition and our body's ability to heal is incredible and people deserve to know it! I make a difference to people's wellbeing Pia, Acupuncture & Naturopathy I worked as a pharmacist and biochemist in biomedical research nearly 20 years before embarking on my natural medicine journey. I wish I'd done it sooner! Read more Learning about Eastern medicine was mind-blowing A friend of mine started a course at CNM and shortly after, she enthusiastically told me about it. I thought it sounded great so I signed up myself. I wanted to study a topic that was far-removed from my daily occupation. When it got to the point where I needed to choose my specialism, I surprised myself by opting for acupuncture. Eastern medicine was so different to my belief system and western education but I absolutely loved the research and hands-on clinical aspect. Changing careers was so easy! I gradually reduced my hours at work and then started my own clinic soon after I graduated. I'm now a full-time practitioner which I love. CNM's course enabled me to become my own master in a field I'm very excited by. I feel I can make a significant difference to people's wellbeing. Positively impacting someone's life is hugely rewarding Fiona, Naturopathic Nutrition I went from journalist to nutritionist and it's the best thing I've ever done! Working sensible hours and being my own boss has been life-changing. Read more I wanted to be my own boss After years of working as a journalist, I realised I wanted to do a job with sensible hours and be my own boss. I'd always been interested in nutrition, so I went along to the CNM open evening and signed up to the nutrition diploma that evening. The impact food has on our bodies My older sister became quite ill when she was in her late twenties. She would wake up in the morning shaking, sometimes vomiting, and she was frequently anxious. My mother, who is a forward-thinking GP, suggested she cut out gluten as she knew intolerances could manifest as neurological symptoms. My sister did and she was back to normal within a week. Observing my sister's experience made me realise how powerful an effect our food has on our health. I wanted to learn more so I could help my family and others. Studying at CNM changed my life What attracted me to CNM was the exceptional amount of clinic hours. I knew I wanted to work with people, so I was keen to get all the clinic training I could. Knowing the theory is one thing but applying it to individuals is quite another. The variety of lecturers and the relationships I formed with fellow students also made my study journey so special. My experience at CNM was fascinating, stimulating and empowering - it changed my life profoundly. I've embarked on a new career and it's really shifted my own relationship with food. Knowing exactly how our bodies respond to what we eat makes you discover the joy (and power) of nourishing yourself. I thought I was healthy before, but now I feel so much more vibrant. I'm excited to get up in the morning! I'm now practising as a nutritional therapist, with several arms to my business. I work with private clients, write for various publications, consult for brands and deliver workplace talks. It's hugely rewarding to know that I'm having a positive impact on someone's life, however small or large. It makes me excited to get up every morning! Learning about naturopathy really opened my eyes Despina, Naturopathic Nutrition I joined CNM due to my fascination with natural therapies. I was excited to learn something different to what I'd studied in the past. Although I started with the nutrition course, I soon became enthralled with naturopathy and decided to enrol in this too. Read more Studying naturopathy gave me an edge I dove deep into the courses and although it was overwhelming at times, our patient lecturers and lively class participation made absorbing the material achievable. Studying naturopathic principles, I soon realised that everything I was learning would be very valuable to me and would differentiate me from a nutrition graduate. The plethora of topics is amazing I learnt a whole range of skills, from detoxification methods to tongue, nail and face diagnostics. It was a complete eye-opener for me. The plethora of knowledge available to us as practitioners to help our clients reach optimal health is amazing. Learning how to deliver this information in a clinical setting was one of the best things about CNM - the clinical training is outstanding. I'm a more enlightened practitioner Even though the workload of taking two courses together was more demanding, the diverse range of topics and the practical nature of the naturopathy course made it easy to study. I would highly recommend anyone studying nutrition to also do the naturopathy course - you will be a more enlightened practitioner. I'm a GP who studied nutrition Dr Laura, Naturopathic Nutrition I qualified from medical school in 1991 and have been practicing as a GP ever since. I've always been interested in complementary medicine and having an open-minded, holistic approach with my patients. Read more There had to be another way Whilst conventional medicine is fantastic and lifesaving for many patients, I felt there had to be another way to tackle some health problems without the endless prescriptions of drugs, which can often do more harm than good. Fruitless referrals to hospital specialists, who seemed to only focus on one part of the body, used to leave my patients no closer to understanding their problems. I began to suspect that many patients' problems had a connection with their food or their gut, so I started looking for a course to help me understand food as medicine. Getting to the root cause The idea of a naturopathic approach is what attracted me to CNM. Nutrition is placed firmly in the context of a person's individual lifestyle and experience. Focussing on finding underlying drivers to a problem and developing individualised solutions is key to health. I wanted a quality course where I could meet other people, collaborate, share ideas and foster relationships over time, rather than do an online or short course. Brimming with ideas to help my patients The CNM course is of a very high standard; it's structured, well-paced and thorough. There are opportunities to critically evaluate the evidence behind the headlines. Lecturers are informed and experienced. I loved attending lectures to gain new ideas and support from my fellow students. I've met many interesting people from a diverse variety of backgrounds. It has set me on a new path which is constantly exciting and rewarding. I enjoyed bringing ideas back to my own patients and fellow doctors which led to fantastic and positive results. Food is our medicine Food is the medicine we consume three times a day, yet my conventional medical training in nutrition was very limited. I'm constantly amazed by what I did not appreciate before the course. I'm excited to be involved in cutting-edge ideas for health in the future. I now have a career where I'm fulfilled Hannah, Naturopathic Nutrition I was a solicitor at a large commercial law firm. It was so stressful and unfulfilling. I was looking for a career change, to do something that lights me up and improves my family's health. I'm so happy I found CNM! Read more Changing my diet stopped my allergies I read a lot about how certain foods can trigger allergies and started experimenting on myself. When I got results in only a couple of days, I was hooked on the topic and decided to study nutrition. Coming from a medical family, I always thought it must be rewarding to help people regain their health. I can work internationally I was attracted by the multicultural education available at CNM and the fact that CNM diplomas are widely accredited, as I planned to work in different countries. Meeting like-minded lecturers and students was great. Practicing at the student clinic helped me ease into my new profession. It changed my relationship with food Studying Nutrition changed my whole life, my food choices and the way I think about health. When I qualified in 2016, I left my full-time job in advertising and started to build my own practice. I mainly focus on women's health, digestive health and sports nutrition. I really enjoy researching topics and writing articles about them. I choose my working hours This interest made it possible for me to participate in a blog competition and win an internship at a fantastic retreat in Malta. I love the flexibility of my job and that I can choose my own working hours. Most of all, I enjoy meeting different people and helping them achieve their goals. I adore helping people achieve their health goals Vikt\u00f3ria, Naturopathic Nutrition I started to get allergies when I moved to London in my late twenties. I didn't want to become dependent on medication so I instinctively tried to find the root cause of my symptoms and decided to study nutrition.

Richard, Naturopathic Nutrition The frustration and traumatic loss of losing my father from a heart attack when I was 15 inspired me to study nutrition. Read more Dietary advice could have saved him At no point during my father's ill health had doctors ever sat down with him to explain what else he could do other than be dosed with drugs. He was never offered any diet and lifestyle advice. I decided to study nutrition so I could help promote wellbeing to others. I studied to improve my own health Before CNM I worked in a corporate environment which was stressful and unfulfilling. I wanted to follow my interest and passion for food and good health so I could help improve my own health and the health of my family. The course is so comprehensive I loved the scope of learning at CNM, it was comprehensive and covered all types of illnesses. It's so important to be able to understand 21st century diseases and ailments, and how much we can turn them around through diet and lifestyle. My life and health have transformed The course has changed my life in so many ways. I've lost two stones in weight; my health has improved and I'm much more motivated and confident. Since graduating I've been practicing in London and Derbyshire. I see a range of clients who suffer with anything from severe autoimmune problems to wanting to lose weight. It's a full spectrum and no two people are the same. Good nutrition can make a massive difference to their health and I love being able to help them to see improvements so quickly. I overcame chronic fatigue and now help others Rebecca, Naturopathic Nutrition When I was looking to study nutrition, I investigated what was on offer and found that most courses were heavily based on pharmaceutical or food company research. I enrolled at CNM because their approach is very natural and holistic. Read more I was wheelchair-bound and incurable I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue and Lyme disease at the age of 13. I went from being a top-grade student to being so poorly that I was only able to attend a part-time 'special school' in a wheelchair - and only when I felt well enough. I was told my condition was incurable. However, through my own research, I realised the power of nutrition and natural remedies. The course allowed me to go at my own pace I loved CNM's holistic approach to wellness. The foundation in biomedicine was also fantastic! Being able to study at weekends meant I could rest during the week which was important when I was so ill. The students at CNM are all likeminded; they're there because they want to be there and we all support each other. My Director of Studies was really helpful and supportive. I'm wheelchair free and now lead a normal life I managed to heal myself through nutrition and diet. Understanding what my body needed to overcome chronic fatigue was mind-blowing. Now I lead a normal life and I have a busy social life with no fatigue or pain. The wheelchair is long gone! I work hours to suit me I opened my clinic straight after graduating and it's now thriving. I'm so busy but I'm able to work the hours that suit me. I run detox programs and specialise in chronic fatigue. When clients see how my health has transformed, they are filled with hope and can't wait to get started. Practising doesn't feel like work to me and I love seeing my clients' progression. I feel more empowered than ever Jennifer, Naturopathic Nutrition Following periods of high stress and several antibiotic-treated infections, I developed symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). I didn't want to take medication for the rest of my life so I decided to study natural medicine. Read more I didn't want to take medication for life When my GP told me at the age of 24 that I might need over-the-counter medication for life to manage my IBS symptoms, I instinctually knew there must be another way. This led me to research natural remedies and ways to support my digestive health from within. I soon stumbled across the training offered by CNM. Retraining was the best decision I made With a growing interest in supporting myself and my family's health through nutrition, I decided to change my career path. I wanted to retrain so I could work doing something I loved while fitting work around those that mattered the most. The support from CNM continued post-graduation What attracted me to CNM was its emphasis on clinical practice. Without the skills I learnt in clinic, under the supervision of highly skilled and experienced teachers, I don't think I would have gone on to practice so successfully. The support I've had from CNM since graduating has been excellent. I'm still in contact the other students from my class and we continue to support each other. I now feel strong and empowered As the mother of three young children, I practice part-time in a local complementary health clinic, seeing clients for a wide range of health issues. Doing the course changed my life so much as I went from feeling frustrated with my health in my mid 20's to feeling stronger and empowered in my 30's. It's allowed me to have a career that I can fit around raising my children, creating the work-life-family balance I was desperately seeking. I learned more at CNM than I did during my PHD Atilla, Acupuncture & Naturopathy I trained as a social scientist and studied for many years for my PhD. After undertaking such a practical, hands-on course at CNM, I couldn't see myself ever doing another theory-based degree again. I realised I needed to follow my heart and help people in a tangible way. Read more The clinic hours prepared me for practice I developed an interest in acupuncture after receiving treatments myself. CNM was recommended to me by a friend who had studied there and was very happy with her experience. I was particularly attracted by CNM's emphasis on providing hands-on training in acupuncture as every student has to complete 400 clinical hours prior to graduating. What I most loved about my CNM course was the wealth of experience amongst teachers and the diverse approaches to acupuncture they bring to the course. This gave me many ideas about the kind of practitioner I'd like to become and how I could develop professionally post-graduation. Volunteering has given me excellent experience I'm now seeing clients at a well-established clinic and I also volunteer at a community acupuncture clinic which is a great way to gain more hands-on experience. As I'd like to teach acupuncture in the future, I've signed up to CNM's Assistant Clinical Supervisor programme where I'll get to oversee students in the acupuncture clinic. Studying at CNM was the best decision I made! Neringa, Naturopathic Nutrition My husband and I had been trying for family for over five years with no success. It was a very stressful time. I felt constantly fatigued, had a poor diet and my weight kept fluctuating. Studying at CNM helped me get pregnant! Read more I was told IVF was the only way After undergoing lots of tests, doctors couldn't find a reason why we couldn't conceive. My GP told me that IVF would be the only way we'd be able to have a family. I decided to go ahead with IVF but just before the first cycle, I realised it felt wrong and I couldn't go through with it. I felt awful telling my husband that we might never have children. I fell pregnant when I changed my diet By chance, I started talking to a girl in my local health store who was a student at CNM. She said it was a great college and recommended I study nutrition to help address my health issues. Not only did I enrol in CNM's fascinating course, I also used my college contacts to see a nutritionist and herbalist. I was given a detailed naturopathic plan including extra support for my thyroid. I also received appropriate herbs and lifestyle advice. I was 100% compliant with my treatment plan and in a couple of months I noticed significant changes. My mood and digestive difficulties improved, my hair stopped falling out and within six months I fell pregnant. Despite being told my uterus lining was thin and it wouldn't be easy to carry a baby to term, my pregnancy was great and I felt fantastic. Studying nutrition changed my life completely My experience at CNM was wonderful and I tell everyone about it. Studying was one of the best decisions I ever made! The more I learnt about nutrition, the more astonished I was to discover how it can heal the body. I have the family I always dreamed of My life has changed 100% since studying - I now have two beautiful, super-healthy daughters. I see clients at my home office in Kensington and I love everything about practicing and improving people's lives. I specialise in weight loss and energy nutrition, helping others overcome the same issues I had. It's fantastic being my own boss as I can work around my family. I'll always reccomend CNM to potential students Brina, Acupuncture & Naturopathy Graduating from CNM as a naturopathic acupuncturist more than 15 years ago set me on a new career path and empowered me in a way I'd never expected. Read more Reading nutrition books opened my eyes I was working in IT when I started reading books on nutrition and natural therapies in an effort to treat my own difficult health problems. I started practicing massage and manual lymph drainage and it became obvious to me that I should go on to train further in natural health.

I'd finally found the meaning to my life and I decided to turn it into a career to help the others.

I've created my own nutrition programmes I hold private consultations in a clinic in London and online. I specialise in gastric and digestive issues, women's health and stress and anxiety. I've also teamed up with a friend from CNM to create a nutritional programme for corporate clients. I cherish the contact with my clients, knowing I can help them make positive changes in their lives.

I was living an unhealthy lifestyle, with late nights and a fast food diet. I was then diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and had to move back home with my mum. I was on medication and constantly sick To control the MS flare-ups, I was put on a drug which suppressed my immune system, leading to me being constantly poorly. I got meningitis and was in hospital for some time. I soon realised the importance of health and this kickstarted my fascination with natural therapies, which then led me on to study nutrition. My MS has radically improved My CNM education has changed my life infinitely. The knowledge I've learnt has empowered me as I can now support my health appropriately.

I could study at different college locations The flexibility of CNM's course made it manageable for me to work as the director of a PR agency at the same time as studying nutrition. I live in Brighton but I was working in London so I studied at both colleges, depending on timetables, which was fantastic. Clinic practice brought the theory to life I really enjoyed studying at CNM, especially when we started to see clients in clinic.

Read more Acupuncture helped me fall pregnant Faced with fertility issues, I had acupuncture to increase my chances of conceiving.

CNM stood out as it allowed me to study part-time and it also offered extensive clinical hours. CNM's acupuncture training is unique When I enrolled in CNM's diploma course in naturopathic acupuncture, I was unaware of how unique the CNM training was.

I researched courses and enrolled in CNM's naturopathic nutrition course due to their weekend classes and flexible study options. The naturopathic approach was also very important to me.
