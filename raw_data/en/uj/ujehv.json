Alternative medicine is a means of treating a symptom or illness outside of conventional Western medicine. Often, alternative treatments originate from Eastern cultures and use methods such as herbal remedies. People have been using some alternative medicine practices for thousands of years \u2014 for example, Ayurvedic medicine has been used for more than 3,000 years. It began in India and emphasizes the use of natural practices, herbs, and diets to treat health conditions ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185965/) Although there isn't always clinical research behind it, alternative medicine may sometimes be effective. Today, many traditional approaches to healing have been incorporated into conventional Western medicine. For example, using acupuncture for nausea alongside chemotherapy is called complementary care. These books offer a closer look at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) techniques and how and when to use them. - Best overall natural remedies book: \" [Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies](#natural-remedies)\" - Best herbal medicine book for beginners: \" [Herbal Medicine for Beginners: Your Guide to Healing Common Ailments with 35 Medicinal Herbs](#herbal-medicine)\" - Best essential oils book: \" [The Essential Oils Apothecary: Advanced Strategies and Protocols for Chronic Disease and Conditions](#essential-oils)\" - Best for hormonal balance: \" [Hormone Intelligence: The Complete Guide to Calming Hormone Chaos and Restoring Your Body's Natural Blueprint for Well-Being](#hormonal-balance)\" - Best on Chinese medicine: \" [Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine](#Chinese-medicine)\" - Best on aromatherapy: \" [Aromatherapy for Self-Care: Your Complete Guide to Relax, Rebalance, and Restore with Essential Oils](#aromatherapy)\" - Best on Ayurvedic practice: \" [Ayurveda Beginner's Guide: Essential Ayurvedic Principles and Practices to Balance and Heal Naturally](#Ayurvedic-practice)\" - Best for self-care: \" [Body into Balance: An Herbal Guide to Holistic Self-Care](#self-care)\" - Best for overall wellness: \" [Natural Health, Natural Medicine: The Complete Guide to Wellness and Self-Care for Optimum Health](#wellness)\" - Best for women's reproductive health: \" [Taking Charge of Your Fertility, 20th Anniversary Edition: The Definitive Guide to Natural Birth Control, Pregnancy Achievement, and Reproductive Health](#womens-reproductive-health)\" CAM includes healing practices that differ from those of Western, or allopathic, medicine.

Reviewers recommend this book to all women who want to know more about how their body works. Even though modern medicine offers solutions for most issues, many people try natural remedies first. In a small 2018 study with 46 participants, the most common reason participants gave for trying herbal medicine was dissatisfaction with conventional treatments and medications ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29544493/) While natural botanicals such as herbs and essential oils can have detrimental side effects if used improperly, they often have fewer negative side effects than conventional medications. In many cases, natural remedies work to address the causes of ailments rather than only masking the problem by relieving symptoms. While natural remedies may be beneficial for some ailments, there are times when you need to seek modern medical treatment. If your symptoms are persistent despite the use of natural treatments, or if they last a long time, it's a good idea to check in with a healthcare professional. This is true even for milder ailments such as [headaches](/health/constant-headache), sleep problems, or stomach issues. Serious symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, an inability to stay awake, confusion, or trouble keeping fluids down may require emergency medical attention. If you experience any of these, it's best to seek immediate medical attention rather than to experiment with natural remedies ( [6](https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/regular-emergency-care-differences/)). What is the study of natural remedies called? The study of natural remedies is called naturopathic medicine. The practices are sometimes referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). What are examples of natural remedies? Natural remedies can include body therapies, nutrition strategies, and other traditional approaches. Here are some examples ( [7](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/types-of-complementary-and-alternative-medicine)): - herbalism - diet and nutrition [acupuncture](/health/acupuncture-how-does-it-work-scientifically) - Ayurveda - traditional Chinese medicine - massage - yoga - reiki - meditation Do natural remedies work? For centuries, people have used natural remedies to prevent and treat issues ranging from common annoyances to chronic health conditions. Scientific evidence does not support the effectiveness or safety of all types of alternative practices. However, emerging and ongoing research backs the benefits of many of the methods ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538520/) Learn more about CAM [here](/health/why-more-people-are-turning-to-complementary-and-alternative-medicine). CAM practices may help prevent illness, promote general wellness, or complement traditional medical care for a number of ailments. The books on this list can help you identify which CAM methods might benefit you and explain how to get started.
