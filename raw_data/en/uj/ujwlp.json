How to Get Started If you think tech use is affecting your physical and mental well-being, taking time away from things you need to get done, or both, it may be time for a digital detox. You don't have to quit your devices altogether -- just do what works best for your lifestyle. This could mean setting your phone aside for a few hours every now and then, exploring how much you really need to use it or disconnecting completely from the internet for a day or more. To get started on your digital detox: Pay attention to your emotion when you use your phone. Be mindful of your phone use to better understand the relationship you have with your device. Ask yourself why you're using your phone at different times. Is it boredom? Do you need it for work? Do you feel like you're missing out on what others have? Does checking your phone make you feel better or worse? Experts say getting a better sense of your emotions can help you control your phone use better. If it's taking a toll, try to cut back on the amount of time you use it every day. Schedule a break from your phone. If you're obsessively using your smartphone and you suspect addictive behavior, one way to detox would be to block out time intervals to check your phone. For example, try to check your phone only every 15 or 30 minutes. Experts say an easy rule to follow would be to keep your phone away during mealtimes. This can help you focus on surroundings. If you have a hard time resisting your phone, try to keep it out of sight in a different room or out of easy reach so you can focus on your food. Or you could set times that you won't use it, like when you're out for a walk, at a social gathering, or after a certain hour at night. Use apps to track your usage. Want to track how much you use your phone daily? If your phone can't do it for you, there's an app for that. Some apps can also block your access to social media sites for period of time or give you a detailed report on what you're spending too much time on. This can help limit your reliance on your phone and take back some control. Disconnect at night before bedtime.

This will help you get into routine to go to bed and improve sleep. Turn off notifications.
