By being focused on wellness and health, rather than only a specific condition, integrative medicine can treat the whole person. Conventional medicine, that is the use of synthetic drugs and surgery to treat health conditions diagnosed within a hospital or clinic, is often both expensive and invasive. While handling emergency conditions such as massive injury or a life-threatening stroke through conventional medicine is completely necessary, there are many benefits to seeking integrative medicine for treatment of other health related issues like pain management. At ProMedSPINE, our [team of back treatment professionals](http://promedspine.com/meet-the-doctors/) seeks to provide each patient with care that will get them back to better total health while also providing effective medical care for specific conditions.

The Principles of Alternative Spine Medicine Integrative medicine has a few major principles at its core that distinguish it from conventional medicine, including: - A partnership between patient and practitioner in the healing process. - Distinguishing between appropriate use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's natural healing response. - Considering the mind, spirit, and community in addition to the physical body. - Use of natural, effective, less-invasive interventions whenever possible. - Commitment to the process of self-exploration and self-development. Integrative medicine explores treatment of not only the disease itself, but the person. Although some of the therapies are nonconventional, integrative medicine is guided by the principle of using therapies that have some high-quality evidence to support them. Some nonconventional methods include, herbal medicine, acupuncture, yoga, massage, biofeedback, and stress reduction techniques. These [spinal treatments](http://promedspine.com/laser-spine-surgery/) are used with mainstream medicine, not as replacements or alternatives. Holistic Spinal Treatments Holistic treatments seek to treat the whole person. If an individual is suffering from migraine headaches, holistic doctors take a look at all potential factors that may be causing the patients headaches instead of simply procuring a list of medications. Oftentimes, other health problems, diet and sleep habits, and stress and personal problems are to blame for the headaches. Now, instead of treating headaches as they happen, overall lifestyle modifications are made to keep headaches from occurring in the first place. The types of holistic treatments being offered include: - Patient education on lifestyle changes - Self-care to promote healthier habits, including diet, exercise, psychotherapy, relationship and spiritual counseling etc. - Acupuncture - Chiropractic care - Homeopathy - Massage therapy - Aromatherapy - Ayurveda medicine - Vibrational medicine - Spiritual counseling - Naturopathy - Energy based therapies Healing holistically seeks to provide patients with a more balanced lifestyle. Physical illnesses are often the symptoms of a greater imbalance that may or may not have a root cause in the physical. Integrative medicine is really a lifestyle approach, incorporating all aspects of a person's life, including, physical healing, mental health and wellness, emotional well being, and spiritual beliefs and values.
