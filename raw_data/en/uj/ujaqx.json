While acute inflammation can be useful as part of the immune and healing responses, inflammation can damage the body when it becomes chronic or imbalanced. Chronic, systemic, and low-grade inflammation is a major contributor to [aging](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/69/Suppl_1/S4/587037/Chronic-Inflammation-Inflammaging-and-Its), [allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573758/), and chronic diseases like: The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is the main nerve of the parasympathetic (rest and digest) division of the autonomic nervous system. [It is an important route of communication between the brain, cardiovascular system, gut, and immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4082307/). This bi-directional nerve pathway travels all the way from the brainstem down through the chest and into the abdomen, branching off to multiple organs. This wide-reaching pathway gave rise to its name, vagus, which means \"wandering\" in Latin. The body is intricately connected, and the vagus nerve plays a key role in coordinating communication. Signals are sent from the brain to the organs of the chest and abdomen, as well as from the gut and organs back to the central nervous system. The vagus nerve helps orchestrate this communication network by signaling the brain to produce neurotransmitters and hormones, [coordinating responses, regulating stress reactions, and helping to keep inflammation in check](https://chopra.com/articles/mind-body-connection-understanding-the-psycho-emotional-roots-of-disease). For example, the vagus nerve plays a central role in coordinating the [parasympathetic relaxation response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017164/), helping to slow down breathing and heart rate, promote relaxation, stimulate digestion, and bring about a sense of peace and calm. To help coordinate this relaxation response, the vagus nerve releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, [which seems to be a major brake on inflammation in the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037330/). Since the vagus nerve is a major control center for the body, the health of this nerve is of utmost importance to the health of your brain, immune system, and overall inflammatory state. Some people have stronger vagus nerve activity than others, allowing their bodies to relax more quickly after stress. The strength of your vagus response is known as vagal tone. Low vagal tone has been associated with chronic inflammation. Research shows that those with inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, often have [decreased heart rate variability, a marker of reduced vagal tone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037330/). This reduced vagal tone triggers the production of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785020/) (substances secreted by inflammatory cells and affect other cells) and leads to an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and stress hormones, contributing to systemic inflammation. Fortunately, you can activate this nerve and strengthen your vagal tone through natural techniques to help balance your immune system, calm the body and mind, and reduce inflammation. Research shows that stimulating the vagus nerve acts as a [natural anti-inflammatory and tranquilizer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21975140) since it reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and calms the nervous system. An emerging technique for reducing inflammation and toning the vagus nerve is a type of self-abdominal massage. [Moderate pressure massage has been shown to stimulate the vagus nerve, increase the movements of the digestive system and contents, and improve insulin secretion to help balance blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133856/) in pre-term infants (studies on adults have yet to be done). The combination of manual manipulation and stimulation of the vagus nerve can have powerful anti-inflammatory benefits. This abdominal massage technique is easy to do at home in just a few minutes. It is best to perform this practice on an empty stomach, a few hours after eating. Start slowly and see how your body responds. Try out this simple practice for accessing the power of your vagus nerve. Perform these techniques for a few minutes once or twice a day for several weeks. You may be surprised by the rewards of reduced stress, improved digestion, better detoxification, decreased pain, and squelched inflammation! *Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only; does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Chopra Center's Mind-Body Medical Group; and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
