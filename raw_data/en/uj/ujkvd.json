Meditating together increases the degree of Self-realization of each member of the group by the law of invisible vibratory exchange of group magnetism. \u2014 Paramahansa Yogananda YSS/SRF President Online Dhyana Kendra on January 31, 2021. In the spirit of our revered guru and founder, Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda, I joyfully welcome you to the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India Online Dhyana Kendra. As with all YSS kendras and mandalis, this online venue is overseen by the YSS sannyasis serving at our YSS ashrams in India, and run with the help of devotee volunteers. Through this online centre, we look forward to sharing with you the blessings of experiencing group meditation and study of Paramahansaji's teachings, in fellowship with many other YSS devotees and friends from around the world. In divine friendship, Swami Chidananda Giri President, Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship There are many tangible and intangible benefits to participating physically at a Yogoda Satsanga ashram, kendra, or mandali, and we encourage everyone to attend in person if this is possible for them. However, many devotees live far from a YSS mandali or kendra - or are unable for other reasons to attend in person. Now all devotees, regardless of their location or circumstances, have the opportunity to join together in spiritual fellowship with other truth-seeking souls for group meditation and retreats. Throughout his life, Paramahansa Yogananda described group meditation as invaluable for deepening one's sadhana. Now you'll have the opportunity to join group meditations regardless of your location or circumstances. By participating in an online group meditation, you will join with followers of Paramahansa Yoganandaji from across India and around the world in an uplifting period of meditation and divine communion. In future, the group meditation offerings will be expanded to include a variety of meditation formats: short, long, with kirtans, etc. As soon as possible, we also will begin offering events in numerous Indian languages. We plan to initiate online scriptural and YSS Lessons study groups in the coming months. To join an online meditation follow these steps: 1. [Download and install the free Zoom application](https://zoom.us/support/download) (you do not need to create an account). 2. Navigate to the [calendar of online meditations and special programmes](https://yssofindia.org/online-meditation/calendar). 3. Click on the event in the calendar, then click the blue Zoom link in the event description to open Zoom and enter the meditation. If you are a YSS/SRF Kriyaban and have an interest in becoming an online meditation leader or online usher, please sign up on the Volunteer Portal. We look forward to serving Gurudeva with you. \"It truly captured the spirit of a group meditation. It was wonderful.
