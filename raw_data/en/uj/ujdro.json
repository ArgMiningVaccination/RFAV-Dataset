This article will use the terms \"male,\" \"female,\" or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. [Click here to learn more](/articles/232363). Many health conditions can contribute to erectile dysfunction (ED), including hormonal disorders, cardiovascular disease, [anxiety](/articles/323454), [depression](/articles/8933), and certain medications. [Vitamins](/articles/195878) and minerals help the body function efficiently. Getting enough nutrients can improve general health. It can also benefit reproductive health. There is no firm evidence that specific vitamins can cure ED, but there may be a link between specific nutrient deficiencies and the condition. A [2020 review and meta-analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1411/htm) notes a link between [vitamin D](/articles/161618) deficiency and severe ED. Research had previously suggested that people with hypogonadism also had low levels of vitamin D. After receiving human chorionic gonadotropin treatment for hypogonadism, their vitamin D levels rose. Hypogonadism develops when the body [does not produce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/) Another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-018-0041-7) These results suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and ED. Vitamin D [may reduce](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1411/htm) oxidative stress, regulate blood pressure, and stimulate nitric oxide production. All of these may contribute to erectile response.

People should seek shade, wear UV protective clothing, and wear sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Discover the [best face sunscreens](/articles/best-face-sunscreen) here. It is also possible to get vitamin D from certain foods, such as: - oily fish, including salmon and sardines - mushrooms - fortified milk - fortified cereal - egg yolk - beef liver Some people may need to take vitamin D supplements in order to maintain optimal levels. Vitamin B9, or folate, may also play a role in ED. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240352/) A [2020 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237081/) Folic acid comes in two forms: a synthetic version that manufacturers add to food products, and folate, which occurs naturally in foods. The [following foods](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/) - beef liver - greens, such as spinach, [kale](/articles/270435), Brussels sprouts, and broccoli - avocado - asparagus - eggs - citrus fruits and [bananas](/articles/271157) - beans, peas, lentils, and other legumes People can also take folate in supplement form, and folic acid is present in fortified foods, such as cereals and pasta. [Vitamin B3](/articles/219593), or niacin, may also improve erectile function. One [older study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21810191/) Foods rich in vitamin B3 [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/) - beef liver [turkey](/articles/285736)and chicken breast - salmon and tuna - peanuts - lentils - brown rice - sunflower seeds Tribulus terrestris has long played a role in traditional medicine in India and China. It often features in male sexual health products. Results of [animal studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8451697/) - boost erectile function - increase sexual behavior - possibly increase testosterone levels, although there are no measures to confirm this It also appears to increase nitric oxide production and boost vasodilation. However, more evidence is needed to show how it works and how effective it is. A [2017 review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329482397_ROLE_OF_OXIDATIVE_STRESS_AND_VITAMIN_C_E_ON_MALE_FERTILITY_MINI_REVIEW) notes that [vitamin C](/articles/219352) helps improve blood flow, which is important for sexual function. However, a [2021 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779240/) While companies market many herbs and supplements as ED remedies, only a few have scientific evidence to show their efficacy. A [2021 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8094213/) [ginseng](/articles/262982) may have a small effect on ED compared with a placebo. A [small 2021 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221295881930597X) involving 52 participants found that combined supplementation with ginseng and vitamin E improved ED scores over 6 weeks. A [2019 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609518313626) found evidence that arginine may help with mild to moderate ED compared with a placebo or no treatment. However, 8.3% of the participants experienced side effects. The authors of a [2020 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32441833/) [Cialis](/articles/cialis)) and L-arginine. The following table compares the supplements in this article on form, size, dosage, and more. |Form||List price||Size or count||Dosage||Amount per serving| L-Arginine 4,000 mg](https://www.amazon.com/Arginine-Vegetarian-L-Arginine-Supplement-Horbaach/dp/B07VMZT65N/?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) There is some evidence that these vitamins and supplements can help with ED, but more research is necessary to confirm their safety and effectiveness. It is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate herbal supplements in the same way it regulates medications. The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/tainted-sexual-enhancement-products) It is best for a person to speak with a doctor before trying any new supplements. The doctor will be able to recommend a suitable place to purchase them. These are supplements that people may have to avoid, as there is limited research or they could be harmful. Herbal Viagra The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/tainted-sexual-enhancement-products) The FDA states that these products may contain ingredients that are not listed on the label. They may cause serious side effects or interact with other medications or supplements that a person is taking. In fact, [back in 2019](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-herb-viagra-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient-0) Viagra is an approved-prescription drug that helps address ED and may cause interactions in persons who take medications to control their blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Horny goat weed Horny goat weed is a traditional Chinese herb. According to [recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK583203/) Companies may claim that it cures ED, but there is not enough research that discusses the beneficial uses of Horny goat weed for erectile problems. General physical and [mental health](/articles/154543) have a significant impact on ED. As such, making lifestyle changes may also benefit a person's symptoms. These changes could include: Eating nutritious foods and exercising A 2019 review notes that people with obesity may have a [40%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348436/) Reaching or maintaining a moderate body weight by following a balanced diet and getting physical exercise may help reduce the symptoms or progression of ED. This may also help manage underlying conditions that can contribute to ED, such as [diabetes](/articles/323627) or [hypertension](/articles/150109). Relieving stress According to a [2022 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/andr.13171) [stress](/articles/145855) may cause ED. This may occur because stress reduces blood flow to the penis, reducing the firmness or duration of erections. The reduction in blood flow may be due to changes in nerve signaling in various pathways relating to erectile response. Therefore, learning to manage and relieve stress may help with ED. ED itself can also cause stress or anxiety. Someone with persistent worries or a low mood can seek guidance and support from a doctor or therapist. Stopping smoking Smoking can damage blood vessels and decrease blood flow. A [2020 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7239286/) Receiving acupuncture A [2019 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6336605/) [acupuncture](/articles/156488) at key acupressure points may improve nerve sensitivity and promote blood circulation. Some people may find it difficult to talk about ED. However, understanding the cause of ED is an important step in finding a treatment or approach that helps. If an individual has persistent difficulty maintaining an erection, they may wish to ask a doctor about treatment options. Here are some questions people often ask about supplements for ED. Can vitamins really help cure ED? Vitamins can boost overall health, and some vitamins may help improve conditions that cause ED, but they cannot cure ED. How much vitamin D should a person take if they have ED? There are no specific dosage recommendations for vitamin D in the treatment of ED. According to the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, males aged 19-70 years need 15 mcg, or 600 international units (IU), of vitamin D per day. This rises to 20 mcg (800 IU) after the age of 70 years. People should not consume more than 100 mcg (4,000 IU) per day, but doctors may recommend higher doses if levels are low or deficient. Can too much vitamin D cause ED? There is no evidence that too much vitamin D increases the risk of ED. Very high levels of vitamin D [can lead to](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) ED is a common condition with a range of possible causes. A person may find that getting enough vitamins and minerals improves their health, but there is no evidence that vitamins can cure ED. Vitamins B3, B9, and D are important for male sexual health and may help manage ED. Ginseng and L-arginine may also prove effective, but more research is necessary to confirm this. A person can usually get enough vitamins through safe sun exposure and a balanced diet, but both vitamins and other supplements can help boost levels if a doctor advises this. "}
