Is your focus on living a toxic-free and sustainable lifestyle? When looking at the interior of your home, one method to help decide what needs updating is to ask yourself, is this material safe for my family to be around for most of their lives? If your answer is NO, it might be time to make some non-toxic upgrades. A good starting point is with your cleaning products, then furniture and decor, but something that may not seem apparent immediately is your home's wallpaper. Whether you have an old or a new home, you might already have or are considering adding wallpaper as a design element. Wallpaper can be a fun way to add style and color to a room, but you have to be diligent about the brands and products of wallpaper you use. Certain wallpaper can contain toxins, including lead, so it's important to educate yourself on what wallpaper is safest and what type to avoid. Making Updates If your home currently has wallpaper, depending on the age of the home, it can be hard to determine what type.

PVC-Free A [PVC-free wallpaper](https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegandesignorg/list/1CF0RNHFHEL3X?ref_=aipsflist_aipsfvegandesignorg) will create healthy and breathable air quality. PVC-free means it does not include harmful microplastics, lead, mercury, or chlorine. In addition to being PVC-free, you should look for statements that say phthalate and formaldehyde free as well. You want to look for products that are GreenGuard gold certified. This is a standard that is set to ensure a product has low chemical emissions. Water Based Ink When looking at wallpaper options, you want something that is water-based ink vs. traditional ink. Alternative inks that are solvent-based will be higher in VOCs. A bonus is a product that is created from water-based ink and on recyclable paper or made from vegetable dyes. Flame Retardant Free Wallpaper Flame retardant products can contain additional toxic chemicals. When searching for [non-toxic wallpaper](https://www.amazon.com/shop/vegandesignorg/list/1CF0RNHFHEL3X?ref_=aipsflist_aipsfvegandesignorg), seek a product that is flame-retardant free.

Choosing Where & How To Apply Non-toxic wallpaper options will also vary in the application process to make it safer and more sustainable. You don't want to use the traditional way of pasting. New eco-friendly alternatives will include peel and stick, pre-pasted, or unpasted. Peel and stick will not require any additional products.
