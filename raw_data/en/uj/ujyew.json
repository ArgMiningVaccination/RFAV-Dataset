Doctors take measurements of the mother's abdomen and use ultrasonography to take measurements of the fetus to help estimate the fetus's weight. Large babies born to mothers with diabetes are more likely to be overweight as adults. Cesarean delivery is sometimes necessary. Complications are treated.

Gestational age refers to how far along the fetus is. The gestational age is the number of weeks between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery. This time frame is often adjusted according to other information doctors receive, including the results of early ultrasound scans, which give additional information regarding the gestational age. A baby is estimated to be due (the due date) at 40 weeks of gestation. At a gestational age of 40 weeks, boys who weigh more than about 9 pounds 4 ounces (4.2 kilograms) are large for gestational age (LGA). Girls who weigh more than about 9 pounds 1 ounce (4.1 kilograms) are LGA. Doctors use published growth charts or computer apps to evaluate babies at other gestational ages. Macrosomia (large body) is a related term used to describe infants who weigh more than 9 pounds 15 ounces (4.5 kilograms). Causes of LGA Newborns Large newborns may be normal babies who simply are large because the parents are large. However, certain problems in the mother sometimes cause babies to be large for gestational age. The most common cause of LGA newborns is Other risk factors for having LGA newborns include Having had previous LGA babies Genetic abnormalities or syndromes (for example, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or Sotos syndrome) Excessive weight gain during pregnancy (the fetus gets more calories as the mother gains more weight) The reason for excessive growth of the fetus varies but primarily results from an abundance of nutrients combined with hormones in the fetus that stimulate growth. In pregnant women who have poorly controlled diabetes, a large amount of sugar (glucose) crosses the placenta (the organ that provides nourishment to the fetus), resulting in high levels of glucose in the fetus's blood. The high levels of glucose trigger the release of increased amounts of the hormone insulin from the fetus's pancreas. The increased amount of insulin results in accelerated growth of the fetus, including almost all organs except the brain, which grows normally. Symptoms of LGA Newborns Symptoms of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns are mainly related to any complications that occur. Complications Common complications in LGA newborns include the following: [Birth injuries](/home/children-s-health-issues/general-problems-in-newborns/birth-injuries-in-newborns) [Birth Injuries in Newborns Birth injury is damage that occurs as a result of physical pressure during the birthing process, usually during transit through the birth canal.

At the time of delivery, the placental supply of glucose is abruptly stopped, and the high level of insulin can rapidly drop the baby's blood sugar level, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may cause no symptoms, but some babies are lethargic and limp and some are jittery and very excitable. Despite their large size, newborns of mothers with diabetes often do not feed well for the first few days.

Too many red blood cells may cause the blood to become too thick, which may slow blood flow. Newborns with polycythemia have a reddish complexion and are sluggish. Polycythemia can contribute to hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and hyperbilirubinemia. Diagnosis of LGA Newborns Before birth, measurement of the uterus and ultrasonography After birth, assessment of gestational age and size and weight of the baby During pregnancy, doctors measure the distance on the woman's abdomen from the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus (fundus). This measurement, called a fundal height measurement, corresponds roughly with the number of weeks of pregnancy. If the measurement is high for the number of weeks, the fetus may be larger than expected. [Ultrasonography](/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-diagnostic-testing#v808929) [ Ultrasonography Prenatal diagnostic testing involves testing the fetus before birth (prenatally) to determine whether the fetus has certain abnormalities, including certain hereditary or spontaneous genetic... read more ](/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-diagnostic-testing#v808929) can be used to assess the size of the fetus and estimate fetal weight to confirm the large-for-gestational-age (LGA) diagnosis. After birth, LGA is diagnosed by assessing the gestational age and the weight of the baby. LGA newborns are assessed for any complications. Blood sugar is measured to detect hypoglycemia, and doctors do a thorough examination to look for birth injuries and structural or genetic abnormalities. Prognosis for LGA Newborns The most common problems of LGA infants (hypoglycemia, birth injuries, and lung problems) typically resolve over a few days with no long-term consequences. As adults, LGA girls have an increased risk of having an LGA infant. All LGA infants are at risk of obesity and may have an increased risk of heart disease. Treatment of LGA Newborns Treatment of complications There is no specific treatment for large-for-gestational-age newborns, but underlying conditions and complications are treated as needed. Newborns with [polycythemia](/home/children-s-health-issues/blood-problems-in-newborns/polycythemia-in-the-newborn) [ Polycythemia in the Newborn Polycythemia is an abnormally high concentration of red blood cells.

If the polycythemia is severe, the doctor may remove some blood and replace it with saline (partial exchange transfusion), which dilutes the remaining red blood cells. Newborns with hypoglycemia are treated with early (within 1 hour after birth) and frequent feedings, or sometimes are given glucose with fluids by vein. Respiratory distress and meconium aspiration are treated with supplemental oxygen or other supportive devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP\u2014a technique allows newborns to breathe on their own while being given slightly pressurized oxygen) or a [mechanical ventilator](/home/lung-and-airway-disorders/respiratory-failure-and-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/mechanical-ventilation) [ Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
