Young bodies and minds are extremely adaptive and responsive to natural methods used in our practice. We work with your kids to maintain strong and communicative bonds so they feel empowered and supported throughout their lives. We collaborate on information about their bodies, action steps for prevention and maintenance of health and an awareness practice to help develop their innate empathetic biology. Working with Patients We recognize that some of the principles of naturopathic and integrative medicine will be new and perhaps different from what you've been exposed to in the past, so we intentionally take the time to fully explain everything to parents and children. When patients understand the process and the real benefits derived from the integrative approach espoused by our providers, they often become enthusiastic supporters and users of this powerful and effective system of wellness.

That being said, we believe it is far too complicated to evaluate the real long-term impact at this time. For this reason, we are cautious. We believe that one size does not fit all and that a vaccination schedule should be tailored to a specific child's exposure and risk. We use evidence-based research to help guide our patients and their family's decisions. "}
