There were 48 million surgical inpatient procedures performed in 2009 and numbers have been rising since, according to the National Center for Health. Your surgeon does his part while you are in the hospital but when you leave, recovery is your challenge. Here are six ways to speed up the healing process so you can get back to life as quickly as possible: Give your body proper healing energy Although you may not feel like eating after surgery, it is important to provide your body the needed energy to recover. Protein is very important to the healing process, so choose chicken, eggs and other proteins. Vitamin C found in fruits has also been shown to boost the healing process. Foods like fish and eggs, which contain iron and B12 help the body form needed new blood cells. Fiber and probiotics boost the immune system so it can fight off infection. A simple method for getting both fiber and probiotics is eating yogurt and granola. Avoid sugary snacks since they upset the body's balance and suppress the immune system. Sports drinks with sodium should also be avoided because the sodium makes the body retain water, which can lead to swelling. Get out of bed As soon as possible, get up and start moving. Movement increases the flow of blood, which aids in healing. Walking can help prevent harmful blood clots also. Mild activity helps reduce the chances of developing pneumonia. When the doctor gives approval, start therapy to stretch scar tissue and regain muscle strength. Remember to hydrate Drinking low-calorie, non-carbonated beverages can help with the healing process. Plain water is great but flavored waters are good too. Fruits like watermelon, strawberries and grapefruit help with hydration also Grant yourself permission to rest Listen to your body for the weeks following surgery. Even though you feel anxious about getting back to work, allow yourself some time to recover. If you feel tired, take a rest. It is good to want to get moving but remember to take a break if you need it. Get proper wound care Wear clothing that does not irritate your surgical site. Change the dressing as instructed and look for signs of infection. If itching or other discomfort occurs, contact your physician for proper treatment. Be sure to protect scar tissue from the sun since newly formed scar tissue has no pigmentation. Use sunscreens recommended by your doctor. Follow instructions Do not override the doctor with your own treatment plan. Take all prescribed medications as instructed even if you don't feel you need them. Do not drive, lift or perform other restricted movements. Even if your wound looks healed, there may be internal healing that has to take place before it is safe to do certain activities. Go back to the doctor for follow-up visits and share all concerns. Take a team approach and work with your surgeon for the best results.
