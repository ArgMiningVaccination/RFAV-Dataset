On November 5, 2019, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to continue CPRIT's work and invest an additional $3 billion for finding and funding the best cancer research and prevention opportunities in the state. CPRIT is now a $6 billion, 20-year initiative - the largest state cancer research investment in the history of the United States and the second largest cancer research and prevention program in the world.", "sitename": null, "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "|Award Mechanism||Core Facility Support Awards| better understand cancer cells - why they arise in the body, how they differ from normal cells, why they grow uncontrollably, how our immune system responds to them and how they can be targeted more successfully for treatment - scientists use sophisticated technologies to identify and characterize these aberrant cells and the cells that they interact with, including cells of the immune system. Flow cytometry, a laser-based technology for characterizing and purifying cells, is the method of choice for studying the molecular features that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. The central goal of this proposal is to take advantage of recent transformative advancements "}
