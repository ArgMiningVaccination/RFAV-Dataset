To study this further, we have constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing HIV or hemagglutinin (HA) Ags along with IFN- (HA-VV-IFN-), or IFN- (HIV-VV-IFN-), a recently discovered member of this family. Our aims were to characterize IFN- functionality as a type I IFN and also to study the biological properties of these factors toward the development of safer and more effective vector-based vaccines. HIV-VV-IFN- and HA-VV-IFN- grew to lower titers than did their parental controls in murine cell lines. In vivo, however, HIV-VV-IFN- growth was not attenuated, while IFN- demonstrated potent local antiviral activity with no replication of HA-VV-IFN- detected. Flow cytofluorometric analysis of B lymphocytes incubated with virally encoded IFN- up-regulation CD69 and CD86, while RT-PCR of IFN--treated cells revealed that gene expression levels of antiviral proteins were elevated, indicating the induction of an antiviral state. The use of these constructs in a poxvirus prime-boost immunization regime led to robust humoral and cellular immune responses against the encoded Ags, despite the lack of replication in the case of HA-VV-IFN-. Thus, coexpression of these factors may be beneficial in the design of safer vector-based vaccines. Our data also indicate that while IFN- exhibits certain biological traits similar to other type I IFNs, it may also have a specific role in mucosal immune regulation that is quite distinct. Interferons are a group of cytokines first discovered based on their antiviral activity against influenza ( [1](javascript:;)). Two families of IFNs, type I and type II, can be distinguished. Type I comprises a family of cytokines, while type II consists of a single cytokine, IFN-. The type I IFN family includes multiple IFN- subsets, a single IFN- and IFN- gene, and also the recently discovered IFN- ( [2](javascript:;)). All members of the type I IFN family bind the same cell surface-specific receptor, IFN-IR, and all share sequence homology, with all type I IFN genes located in a single gene cluster both in humans and in mice ( [2](javascript:;), [3](javascript:;), [4](javascript:;)). In a viral infection, induction of the production of IFN- and IFN- occurs via two pathways. TLR signaling triggers production of IFN from APCs upon recognition of viral nucleic acids endocytosed from infected cells ( [5](javascript:;), [6](javascript:;)). A second more widespread system recognizes viral infection within the cytosol of the infected cell and triggers production of IFN by signaling via RNA helicases, retinoic IFN response to infection is rapid, and these cytokines serve as a frontline of defense against many pathogens and diseases. Previous studies have shown that IFN-/ play a major role in the generation and survival of effector and memory T cells in response to viral infection ( [9](javascript:;), [10](javascript:;), [11](javascript:;)). Additionally, type I IFNs demonstrate a range of activities on innate cells of the immune system, such as the activation and survival of NK cells during viral infection ( [12](javascript:;)). IFN- is a newly discovered member of the type I IFN family. Its expression has been localized to reproductive as well as to brain tissues ( [2](javascript:;)). However, no significant work has been performed to elucidate any immunomodulatory or regulatory functions of IFN- in these tissues. In the human cervix following exposure to seminal fluid, increased expression of IFN- has also been reported ( [13](javascript:;)). Seminal fluid delivers a range of signaling molecules that prime the environment to receive and protect an embryo and to provide a barrier against infection. Thus, IFN- may be involved in the recruitment, activation, and function of local leukocytes and APCs, and it may have a role in mucosal immunity. Vaccinia virus (VV) [3](javascript:;) is a member of the genus orthopoxvirus, which includes variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. These viruses are very closely related and, as such, infection or vaccination from one member of the genus can confer a level of cross-protection against other members. Consequently, VV has been effectively used in the worldwide eradication of smallpox ( [14](javascript:;)) and has also been extensively studied as an expression vector for foreign genes in a number of experimental systems ( [15](javascript:;), [16](javascript:;), [17](javascript:;)). Using VV as a live recombinant vaccine, many groups have demonstrated that potent cell-mediated and humoral immunity can be generated against an encoded vaccine Ag ( [18](javascript:;), [19](javascript:;)). The capacity to insert large pieces of foreign DNA into VV or other poxvirus vectors has enabled the construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing multiple proteins, such as vaccine Ags and costimulatory molecules ( [20](javascript:;), [21](javascript:;)), that can enhance cell-mediated and humoral immunity to the encoded Ag or the vaccine vector ( [22](javascript:;), [23](javascript:;), [24](javascript:;)). In particular, cytokines known to have antiviral activity such as IFN-, or those that influence the differentiation or activation of cell subsets involved in the immune response such as IL-4, have been found to significantly modulate the immune response ( [24](javascript:;), [25](javascript:;)). Due to the type I IFNs pleiotropic effects on immune cells both of the innate and adaptive immune systems, as well as their promising use as therapeutic agents, we have constructed rVV coexpressing the murine type I IFNs, IFN-4, IFN-, and IFN-, along with a model Ag, hemagglutinin (HA) from the influenza virus, or HIV gag/pol genes. We have demonstrated that the expression of IFN-4 or IFN- causes a marked attenuation of viral virulence both in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mouse models. Furthermore, we elucidate that viral attenuation by the expression of IFN-4 or IFN- occurs without compromising the effectiveness of the immune response to HA or to the viral vector. Results indicate that expression of IFN-/ could increase the safety and efficacy of rVVs as vaccine vectors. In contrast, IFN- expression causes a reduction in the viral growth in vitro in murine cells but does not cause viral attenuation in vivo. Additionally, expression of IFN- does not alter the immunogenicity of the vaccine vector. Thus, the functionality of IFN- as a member of the type I IFN family remains to be fully characterized. Materials and Methods Mice Female athymic BALB/c nude mice (4-6 wk old) were obtained from the Animal Resource Centre, Perth, Western Australia. Female BALB/c (H-2d) mice, type I IFN receptor knockout (IFN-IR/), and wild-type 129 mice (4-6 wk old) were obtained from the Animal Breeding Facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Female type II IFN receptor knockout (IFN-IIR/) mice (8-11 wk old) were kindly provided by Sue Fordham at The Canberra Hospital. All mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and used in accordance with animal ethics guidelines. Cells African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells, human osteosarcoma 143B cells, and (Invitrogen) 5% FCS, 1 mM l-glutamine, 37\u00b0C in 5% CV-1, 143B, and L929 cells were for VV growth. Generation of recombinant vaccinia and fowlpox viruses RNA was extracted from BALB/c ovarian tissue and cDNA was reverse transcribed. For cloning purposes, SalI restriction enzyme sites were added to was PCR amplified using Elongase enzyme mix (Invitrogen) according to the conditions were 94\u00b0C for 2 min and then 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The IFN- gene was cloned into pTK7.5 digested with SalI, which was then transfected into cells infected with the parental HIV-VV thymidine kinase-negative (TK) virus, which contained HIV B clade gag/pol genes. Recombinants were selected and IFN- expression was confirmed by PCR. Fowlpox virus recombinants (rFPV) expressing HA and HIV as described previously ( [26](javascript:;), [27](javascript:;)). rVVs expressing IFN-/ were derived from the Western reserve (WR) strain of the virus as described previously ( [18](javascript:;), [28](javascript:;)). They express the HA gene from the A/PR/8/34 strain of influenza virus as well as genes encoding murine IFN-4 (mIFN-4) or murine IFN- (mIFN-; we thank Dr. Rentrop (German Cancer Research Center, Heidleberg, Germany) for plasmid containing mIFN-). Expression of the IFNs was confirmed by virus cytopathic effect assay with respect to international reference standards provided by the National Institutes of Health (see Ref. ( [29](javascript:;))). Peptide The H-2Kd restricted, ( [30](javascript:;)) was the 9-fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl (FMOC) method on a Rainen Symphony/Multiplex peptide synthesizer and supplied by the Australian Cancer Research Foundation Biomolecular Resource Facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University. An HIV overlapping 15mer Gag peptide pool was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Virus growth curves Monolayers of CV-1 cells or L929 cells HA-VV-IFN-, HA-VV, HIV-VV-IFN-, HIV-VV) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 6-well plates. MEM (2 ml) supplemented with 5% FCS was added to each well and the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. At each time point both the intracellular and extracellular fractions were collected as described previously ( [31](javascript:;)). The fractions were frozen, thawed, sonicated (2 \u00d7 15 s), and trypsinized. Viral titers were then determined by titration onto 143B cell monolayers in 6-well plates by plating out dilutions of 1/10 to 1/106 and staining plaques with crystal violet after 48 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. Virus growth in immunocompetent mice Groups of BALB/c mice (n = 4) were immunized i.v. HIV-VV-IFN-, HIV-VV) in 200 l sterile PBS. Mice were sacrificed after 72 h by CO2 asphyxiation after which ovaries were harvested, homogenized, and trypsinized, and dilutions were plated onto monolayers of 143B cells to determine viral titers. Vaccinia virulence in nude mice Viral pathogenicity was measured in groups of BALB/c nude mice (n = 4-5). Mice were immunized i.v. with doses of the different rVVs ranging from 106 to 108 PFU/ml in 200 l sterile PBS. Mice were monitored daily and were sacrificed when they showed signs of severe weight loss and reduced responsiveness. Spleen, ovaries, lung, and brain were harvested, frozen immediately, and stored at 20\u00b0C. Viral titers in the organs were enumerated by plaque assays, by plating dilutions of homogenized organs monolayers of 143B cells in assay Spleen cells were assayed by IFN- ELISPOT for HA- or HIV Gag-specific T cells as described elsewhere ( [32](javascript:;)). Briefly, MultiScreen HTS filter plates (Millipore) were coated overnight with 5 g/ml purified rat anti-mouse IFN- capture Ab (BD Pharmingen). Splenocytes/well \u00d7 105) were incubated for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 1 g/ml 9mer HA 0.5 without peptide, or 5 g/ml Con A as a positive control. For vaccinia-specific IFN- responses, naive spleen cells were infected with a wild-type vaccinia WR strain (VV-WR) at a MOI of 10 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and then washed cells were added to primed cells at a ratio of 1:4 and incubated as described above. Following incubation, the plates were washed and incubated with biotinylated rat (Amersham (SFU) were developed using BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase substrate (Moss) and counted using an ELISPOT Bioreader-4000 PRO-X (Bio-Sys). The background counts from unstimulated cells were subtracted for the purpose of analysis. Results are expressed as SFU per 1 \u00d7 106 cells and represent duplicate or triplicate experiments. ELISA HA-specific serum Abs were detected by ELISA. Ninety-six-well ELISA plates (Thermo LabSystems) were coated with PR8 influenza virus diluted in borate buffer (BupH borate buffer, Pierce Biotechnology) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The plates were washed with PBS 0.05% Tween and then blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The mouse serum diluted in PBS was added to the plates at appropriate dilutions and incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C, and then plates were incubated with 0.5 g/ml biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a Abs (Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Finally, plates were incubated with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA for a further 90 min at 37\u00b0C. After each step plates were washed 4\u00d7 with PBS 0.05% Tween. The serum Ab was detected by developing with alkaline phosphate substrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min, and the absorbances were read at 405 nm using a ThermoMax plate reader and SoftMax software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Properties of IFN- protein For biological IFN- assays, L6 plate monolayers of CV-1 cells were infected with 0.01 MOI HIV-VV-IFN- or HIV-VV and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. The medium was collected and live virus removed by double filtration through 0.22-m filters. Supernatant was incubated with primary splenocytes for 16 h at 37\u00b0C, after which cells were washed, incubated with Abs to cell surface markers, and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess cellular activation states. CD8-allophycocyanin, B220-FITC, CD69-PE, and CD86-PE Abs were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Recombinant mouse IFN- was used as a positive control (Chemicon International). Expression of antiviral proteins was assessed at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. L929 cells were incubated as above with inactivated supernatant, and then RNA was isolated as described previously ( [33](javascript:;)). cDNA was synthesized and PCR was performed using Scientifix Taq polymerase and the for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. Real-time PCR To detect and quantify antiviral expression, real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems SYBR Green PCR mix. Reactions were performed in Eppendorf twin-tec 96-well PCR plates in 20 l reaction volumes, which contained 10 l master mix, 1.5 pmol each forward and reverse primers, and 1-10 ng cDNA. All primers were designed to have the midpoint of thermal denaturation (Tm) of 60\u00b0C using reverse: as above. Reactions were run using the following cycling conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Samples were run on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using SDS 1.9.1 software. Fold increases in mRNA were calculated as described previously ( [35](javascript:;)). Ectromelia challenge studies Groups of BALB/c mice (n = 4) were immunized i.m. with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU of rVV diluted in 100 l sterile PBS, or with PBS only. At 21 days postimmunization mice were challenged with 1 \u00d7 103 PFU of ectromelia virus (ECTV) Moscow strain by footpad injection. Mice were monitored daily and were sacrificed when showing symptoms of acute mousepox. These symptoms included lethargy, eye inflammation, ruffled fur, and a haunched posture. Statistics p values were calculated using a two-tailed, two-sample, equal variance Student's t test. Results Effect of type I IFN expression on the growth of rVV in vitro Coexpression of cytokines and other immune-modulating genes by poxvirus vaccine vectors has proven to be a useful tool in optimizing the vaccine response. rVV expressing IFN-4, IFN-, and IFN- were constructed from parental viruses expressing HA gene from the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 or HIV gag/pol genes, as described in Materials and Methods. Confirmation of IFN-/ cytokine expression by the rVVs was assayed by the cytopathic effect inhibition bioassay using influenza virus and L929 cells. At 24 h postinfection (PI), we observed a 10-fold increase in the bioactivity of virally expressed IFN- compared IFN-4 and 63,000 IU/ml IFN- detected. To establish whether the increase in antiviral activity of IFN- was due to differing viral expression levels, IFN-4 and IFN- expression in rVV-infected CV-1 cells was assayed by real-time PCR. Results show no difference in the viral mRNA expression levels of the two cytokines at 6 h following 10-fold MOI (Fig. [1](javascript:;),a). Viral mRNA expression of IFN- was assayed by RT-PCR and indicates a time- and virus dose-dependent level of gene expression (Fig. [1](javascript:;) b). [Close modal](javascript:;) To study the growth characteristics of the rVVs, low MOI (0.01) growth curves were conducted using murine L929 cells (responsive to murine type I IFNs) CV-1 cells (nonresponsive to murine type I IFNs). We observed no difference in the replication of HA-VV-IFN-4 or HA-VV-IFN- as compared with the HA-VV parental in the CV-1 cells (Fig. [2](javascript:;), a and c). In contrast, addition of the IFN- greatly attenuated the levels of viral replication in mouse L929 cells, while IFN-4 expression had no observable effect (Fig. [2](javascript:;), b and d). Likewise, viral expression of IFN- resulted in a reduction in virus growth in murine L929 cells but not in nonmurine CV-1 cells compared with the HIV-VV parental (Fig. [3](javascript:;)), protein expression of IFN-. modal](javascript:;) [Close modal](javascript:;) Up-regulation of reduction in HA-VV-IFN- and HIV-VV-IFN- growth in a cell-specific manner suggests that vaccinia expression of the murine IFN-/ may be activating an antiviral state in the murine cells, inhibiting the ability of the virus to replicate. IFN- has been well characterized as to its antiviral properties ( [36](javascript:;), [37](javascript:;)); however, little or no work has been performed to determine the properties of IFN-. To assess the ability of virally expressed IFN- to up-regulate antiviral molecules on cells was cells, and up-regulation of antiviral genes PKR and 25OAS were determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. [4](javascript:;), components of the viral infection alone can affect gene expression, as supernatant from HIV-VV-infected cells up-regulated expression of PKR and 25OAS (Fig. [4](javascript:;),a). However, the addition of IFN- further increased the magnitude of PKR and 25OAS mRNA expression 4- and 10-fold, respectively, above HIV-VV supernatant (Fig. [4](javascript:;),b). In addition to providing antiviral activities during a viral infection, the type I IFNs also have immunoregulatory features. Thus, to investigate the regulatory effects of IFN- on lymphocyte activation, primary splenocytes from wild-type 129 or IFN-IR/ mice were incubated with the inactivated supernatants as above. As shown in Fig. [5](javascript:;), elevated CD69 and CD86 expression on B cells incubated with HIV-VV-IFN- (Fig. [5](javascript:;), a and b) compared with HIV-VV (Fig. [5](javascript:;), c and d) or medium only were observed. Although it appeared that some component of the viral infection present in the supernatant was causing an increase in CD86 expression compared with medium alone, the data suggest that this is independent of IFN-IR signaling, as both wild-type 129 and IFN-IR/ B cells showed elevated CD86 expression levels when incubated with HIV-VV supernatant (Fig. [5](javascript:;),d). The presence of IFN- both CD69 and CD86 levels compared with HIV-VV supernatant in a IFN-IR-dependent manner, as an increase in expression levels was observed in wild-type mice and not in IFN-IR/ mice (Fig. [5](javascript:;), a and b). Positive controls of cells incubated with 100 U rIFN- are shown in Fig. [5](javascript:;), e and f. [Close expression attenuates vaccinia virulence in BALB/c mice To assess whether the observed in vitro antiviral properties of IFN-/ coexpression conferred an inhibition of replication of the rVVs in vivo, groups of 4 female BALB/c mice were i.v. 107 PFU of HA-VV, HIV-VV-IFN-, or HIV-VV, and the viral titers in the ovaries were measured after 72 h as described in Materials and Methods. Results indicated a significant reduction (i.e., >1 log) of viral titers of HA-VV-IFN-4 in comparison to HA-VV (p < 0.05), for which titers were as high as 4.8 \u00d7 107 in the ovaries (Fig. [6](javascript:;),a). Additionally, the coexpression of IFN- appeared to aid the rapid clearance of HA-VV-IFN- following infection, or suppressed viral dissemination, as virus could not be detected in the ovaries at this time to the limits of the plaque assay (102 PFU). In contrast, coexpression of IFN- resulted in a moderate (<1 log) but insignificant reduction in the growth of HIV-VV-IFN- compared with HIV-VV (Fig. [6](javascript:;) type I IFNs attenuates rVV in nude mice To assess the contribution of T lymphocytes in the reduction of in vivo viral titers, we compared the ability of the rVVs to replicate in athymic BALB/c nude mice, which lack functional T cells. Nude mice were infected i.v. with 106 PFU of HA-VV-IFN-4, HA-VV-IFN-, HA-VV, HIV-VV-IFN-, or HIV-VV, and their survival was monitored. Nude mice infected with HA-VV all developed pox lesions and displayed severe weight loss before succumbing to disease at an average of 16 days PI. In contrast, nude mice infected with HA-VV-IFN-4 showed a longer average survival period of up to 30 days. Furthermore, nude mice infected with HA-VV-IFN- did not develop the weight loss or pox lesions typical of pox infection in immunodeficient mice and survived the infection during the period of observation (90 days) (Fig. [6](javascript:;),c). Coexpression of IFN- did not have such a marked effect on the survival of nude mice as did IFN-/, as mice survived no longer (17 days PI) than did mice given the control virus HIV-VV (15 days PI) (Fig. [6](javascript:;) d). At the time of sacrifice, ovaries, spleen, and brain were taken and titrated for rVV (data not shown). Surprisingly, no virus was detected at the time of death in the brain, ovaries, or spleen of nude mice infected with HA-VV-IFN-4, despite a disease progression similar to pox disease observed 5 days leading up to death. However, virus replication was observed in the ovaries and brains of nude mice infected with 106 PFU of the control virus (HA-VV), with titers of up to 107 PFU detected in the ovaries. In concurrence with the observation that nude mice infected with HA-VV-IFN- remained healthy throughout the experimental period, no evidence of virus replication in the organs at the time of sacrifice was observed. Furthermore, nude mice infected with 5 \u00d7 106 and 5 \u00d7 107 PFU HA-VV-IFN- also remained healthy for the duration of the observation period (90 days), and no virus was detected in the organs at the time of sacrifice. Organs from nude mice infected with HIV-VV-IFN- yielded similar recoverable virus levels to mice infected with HIV-VV, suggesting that IFN- expression was unable to curb virus growth in the T cell-deficient model, thus indicating that T cells may be a target for IFN- activity (data not shown). The significant attenuation of HA-VV-IFN- observed in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice suggests a local antiviral state induced by expression of IFN-, which is independent of T lymphocytes. Studies investigating antiviral therapies have suggested that a highly antiviral state can be induced by coactivation of IFN-/ and IFN- receptor pathways ( [38](javascript:;)). To evaluate whether endogenous IFN- can act in synergy with the expressed IFN-, IFN- receptor knockout mice (IFN-IIR/), which have defective resistance to virus infection and increased susceptibility to VV ( [39](javascript:;)), were used. However, IFN-IIR/ mice given 107 PFU of HA-VV-IFN- did not exhibit any signs of disease and remained healthy throughout the duration of the observation (37 days PI), nor was any virus detected in the ovaries of these mice at sacrifice (data not shown). Coexpression of the type I IFNs in a prime-boost vaccination strategy generates high levels of cellular and humoral immunity The data suggest that coexpression of different type I IFNs by rVV can have varying effects on the virus replication both in vitro and in vivo, leading to different levels of viral attenuation in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Coexpression of IFN-/ VV replication in murine cells in vitro; however, IFN- expression also reduced viral virulence in both nude and normal mice. To study the immunomodulatory effects of cytokine coexpression on the vaccine-generated T cell responses to the coexpressed and viral Ags, BALB/c mice were prime-boost immunized i.m. 1 107 PFU rFPV i.m. at a 2-wk intervals. Results indicate that mice immunized with HA-VV-IFN- generated a robust anti-HA CD8+ T cell response (357 \u00b1 169 SFU/106 cells) However, these CD8+ IFN- responses were unchanged compared with the control vaccine group (514 \u00b1 151 SFU/106 cells) (Fig. [7](javascript:;) a). Likewise, when immunized via the i.m. route, HA-VV-IFN-4 followed by HA-FPV generated similar numbers of IFN--secreting CD8+ T cells (338 \u00b1 214 SFU/106 cells) compared with mice primed with modal](javascript:;) Similarly, BALB/c mice immunized by a HIV-FPV booster immunization i.m. elicited elevated numbers of HIV Gag-specific T cells (1380 \u00b1 170 SFU/106 cells), with similar counts being found in mice immunized by HIV-VV followed by HIV-FPV (826 \u00b1 420 (Fig. [7](javascript:;) b). ELISAs were conducted on serum from vaccinated mice at sacrifice to assess the humoral immune response induced by vaccination with HA-VV-IFN-4 and HA-VV-IFN- as described above. No significant differences were observed in the HA-specific IgG1 or endpoint titers between mice that were primed with HA-VV, HA-VV-IFN-4, or HA-VV-IFN- (Fig. [7](javascript:;), c and d). generated significantly HA-specific IgG2a than did priming with HA-VV-IFN- (p = 0.04); however, this was not significantly higher than that generated by priming with HA-VV (p = 0.075). High levels of antivaccinia cellular immunity generated by prime-boost vaccination with rVV-IFNs Our data demonstrate that coexpression of murine IFN-4 or IFN- attenuates replication of and immunodeficient mice; indeed, rVV coexpressing IFN- could not be detected in vivo. Both viruses also induced cellular and humoral immune responses against HA in a vaccine regime to similar levels as induced by the control virus. Presently, the smallpox vaccination carries the risk of severe reactions and adverse effects due to the local dissemination and shedding of live virulent VV, which is introduced under the skin to cause local infection and a cellular immunity and Ab response. Therefore, we assessed whether the attenuated rVV, HA-VV-IFN-4 and HA-VV-IFN-, could be used to reduce risk yet induce a high vaccinia-specific cellular response. Using the poxvirus prime-boost regime as described previously, and using vaccinia-infected splenocytes as stimulator cells at a stimulator-to-responder cell ratio of 1:4, we found no statistical difference in the high levels of vaccinia-specific IFN--secreting T cells generated by priming with 280 (Fig. [8](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Protection against the ECTV Our data show that coexpression of IFN- limits viral replication in vivo, yet is able to induce high numbers of vaccinia-specific T cells. To investigate whether the cellular immunity generated by HA-VV-IFN- is protective, a challenge model with the highly virulent mousepox virus, ECTV, was used as described in Materials and Methods. Both VV and ECTV are members of the gene family orthopoxvirus, which are closely related, and infection or immunization with one such virus is known to confer a level of cross-protection. C57BL/6 mice immunized with HA-VV-IFN- or the control virus (HA-VV) were protected against challenge by otherwise lethal doses of the Moscow strain of ECTV. Discussion Cytokines play an important role in the immune response as the initiators and regulators of both the innate and adaptive immune networks. The type I IFNs play an integral role in the antiviral immune response, promoting an antiviral state and contributing to the CD8+ T cell clonal expansion and memory cell survival. In the present study, we used rVV vectors to deliver the local release of the murine type I IFNs, IFN-4, IFN-, and the newly discovered IFN-, to study their effects on the immunogenicity and safety of the virus vectors, as well as to determine their ability to modulate the immune response to the vaccine Ags in a poxvirus prime-boost strategy. It is well established that the type I IFNs can induce an antiviral state in infected cells by signaling through type I IFN receptor-linked JAK-STAT pathways to induce expression of IFN-stimulated genes ( [37](javascript:;), [40](javascript:;)). The present in vitro studies suggest that the local expression of IFN- and IFN- elicit a similar antiviral state, resulting in an impaired ability of these viruses to replicate in murine L929 cells (compared with the control viruses; Figs. [2](javascript:;) and [3](javascript:;)). This indicates an induction of antiviral effects by IFN-stimulated genes rather than a defect in the pathology of the viruses themselves. Additionally, we have shown that IFN-, similar to other type I IFNs, can up-regulate antiviral proteins such as PKR and 25OAS (Fig. [4](javascript:;)). However, IFN-4 did not reduce viral growth in vitro as was observed with IFN- and IFN-. Although all characterized type I IFNs bind the same receptor (IFN-IR), which is composed of two subunits, IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2, binding to this receptor can occur with different affinities, leading to multiple signaling cascades, which can lead to distinct biologic outcomes such as conferring antiviral resistance to different virus species ( [41](javascript:;), [42](javascript:;)). Using IFN--deficient mice, Deonarain and colleagues ( demonstrated that IFN- is essential for protection against VV, and that many of the IFN- subtypes, including IFN-4, are dependent on IFN- for induction. We postulate that the observed impaired ability of HA-VV-IFN- to replicate in murine cells in vivo may be due to rVV-encoded IFN- causing a considerable antiviral response to the VV. In contrast, signaling induced by the virally encoded IFN-4 may not have as high an antiviral response against VV. The induction of IFN-inducible proteins PKR and 25OAS by IFN- suggests that it, too, signals via the type I IFN receptor. Early viral infection causes the activation of lymphocytes, which can be measured by the up-regulation of cell surface molecules, and this is thought to be a direct consequence of type I IFN production ( [44](javascript:;), [45](javascript:;)). Indeed, our findings that IFN- can up-regulate CD69 and CD86 expression on B cells from wild-type mice (Fig. [5](javascript:;)) but not in mice lacking IFN-IR indicates signaling via the common receptor and demonstrates that this highly conserved signaling mechanism is used by IFN-. Similarly, CD8 T cells cultured with IFN- were found to up-regulate CD69 expression in an IFN-IR-dependent manner (data not shown), although this increase was not as high as that observed on B cells. Results indicate that both HA-VV-IFN- and HIV-VV-IFN- demonstrate reduced replication in murine cells in culture; however, the extent of these antiviral effects of the cytokines in vivo could be different. Indeed, only the virally encoded IFN- was able to attenuate the virus highly in a systemic infection model. BALB/c mice infected with HA-VV-IFN-4 or HIV-VV-IFN- had 1 log reduction in virus titers detectable in their ovaries at 3 days PI compared with the controls, HA-VV, and HIV-VV, respectively. Interestingly, mice infected with HA-VV-IFN- had no detectable virus in the ovaries, suggesting significant virus attenuation by IFN- expression, which may be beneficial for improved safety of the vector for use as a vaccine or immunotherapeutic treatment. In many cases the use of live viral vaccines is contraindicated for immunocompromised patients, due to the risk of vaccine-related complications, and thus improvements in vaccine attenuation is of great potential value. Our data demonstrate that local IFN- expression appeared to greatly enhance the safety of vaccinia for use as a vaccine, as immunocompromised nude mice that lack functional T lymphocytes (important effector cells in the primary response against vaccinia infection) were nonetheless able to resist or overcome infection by HA-VV-IFN-. We found that systemic infection induced by a dose of 106 PFU of HA-VV resulted in rapid weight loss and pox lesion formation, and the mice succumbed to pox infection 17.8 \u00b1 1.3 days PI, which was confirmed by high viral titers recovered from their ovaries at the time of death. However, systemic infection with up to 107 PFU of HA-VV-IFN- did not cause any signs of disease or infection for up to 9 mo monitored. In contrast, the mice infected with the HA-VV-IFN-4 died at 22.7 \u00b1 5 days PI. Interestingly, even though these mice displayed classic symptoms of pox infection such as pox lesions and high weight loss, at the time of death no virus was detectable in any organs. It is possible that this pathology is being caused by IFN produced by virus that is present below levels detectable in our assay system (100 PFU). Our data highlight clear differences in the ability of IFN-, IFN-4, and IFN- to induce antiviral states; whereas HIV-VV-IFN- demonstrated a similar reduction in growth in vitro to HA-VV-IFN-, in the nude and BALB/c mouse models the effect of IFN- on viral growth was minimal. Several studies have shown that the replication of some viruses such as HSV and human CMV can be blocked by the coactivation the IFN-IR and IFN-IIR signaling pathways ( [38](javascript:;), [46](javascript:;)). To investigate whether the lack of detectable replication of HA-VV-IFN- in vivo is caused by a synergistic effect of virally encoded IFN- and endogenous IFN-, we looked at an in vivo model of infection in the absence of IFN- responsiveness by infecting IFN-IIR/ mice with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU HA-VV-IFN- or HA-VV and monitoring them for signs of vaccinial disease. These mice were defective in their ability to clear VV infection, as 1 \u00d7 106 PFU VV-WR proved fatal to most mice in 3-4 days ( [39](javascript:;)). Interestingly, neither mice infected with HA-VV or HA-VV-IFN- showed any sign of infection for >30 days (data not shown). VV-WR is known to be a virulent strain of VV, which would explain the differences in susceptibility observed. We have shown that the coexpression of the type I IFNs, especially IFN-, can improve the safety of the vector, as demonstrated in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Introduction of the HA-VV to nude mice induced a progressive fatal vaccinia infection, which could be circumvented by the coexpression of IFN-. To determine the efficacy of the rVVs as vaccine vectors, it was necessary to demonstrate that the reduction in replication did not occur at a cost to the immunogenicity of the viruses. Previous work has demonstrated that a poxvirus prime-boost regime can generate better immune responses to coexpressed Ags than a single vaccination or using a DNA/poxvirus combination prime-boost regime ( [32](javascript:;), [47](javascript:;)). Likewise, coexpression of immunomodulatory cytokines and molecules by the vaccine vectors has shown to enhance or modulate the vaccine-induced immune response ( [48](javascript:;), [49](javascript:;), [50](javascript:;)). Thus, we used the poxvirus prime-boost strategy to examine the ability of the type I IFNs to modulate the anti-HA or anti-HIV immune response. In this model, IFN- coexpression was unable to enhance the levels of HIV-specific T cells generated by immunization. Little is known regarding the activities of IFN- and immune regulation. The data to date indicate that IFN- expression is restricted to reproductive tissues ( [2](javascript:;)) and that IFN- expression is up-regulated with exposure to seminal fluid ( [13](javascript:;)). This suggests that it may have important immunomodulatory or protective roles in these regions, and thus systemic immunization may not be an effective measure of elucidating a role of IFN-. We postulate that IFN- may have an antiviral, protective, or inhibitory role in the mucosa, as the cervix is both a site of entry for many sexually transmitted pathogens, but conversely, it is also subject to exposure to seminal fluid to which no immunity should be raised. Our data show that despite the greatly reduced replicative capacity of HA-VV-IFN-, a considerable level of transcription and translation of the viral proteins could be occurring in the mice, as the use of this vector in the prime-boost immunization did not significantly alter the HA-specific or vaccinia-specific T cell responses as detected by IFN- ELISPOT (Fig. [7](javascript:;),a and 8). Similarly, no significant changes in the HA-specific IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. [7](javascript:;), c and d) levels in the serum of vaccinated mice were observed. The viral attenuation by expression of IFN- without cost to vaccine immunogenicity suggests that such vaccines can be used as alternatives to the currently available smallpox vaccine. Several studies have been conducted to test the ability of using rVV such as modified VV Ankara as a safer smallpox vaccine that can induce an effective immune response without replication of the VV ( [51](javascript:;), [52](javascript:;)). Similar to our characterization of HA-VV-IFN-, modified VV Ankara is highly attenuated and yet it induces a robust immune response upon vaccination that can protect against challenge by virulent poxviruses. However, as modified VV Ankara has an extremely narrow host cell range in which it can replicate ( [53](javascript:;)), the large-scale synthesis of the vaccine could prove difficult. In contrast, HA-VV-IFN- appears to have reduced replication only in murine cells due to the specific immunomodulatory actions of the murine cytokine, and thus it has a better potential as a live attenuated vaccine. To assess whether the antivaccinia immunity generated by vaccination with the rVVs is cross-protective, BALB/c mice HA-VV, HA-VV-IFN-, or HA-VV-IFN-4 and challenged at 21 days PI with 1 \u00d7 103 ECTV Moscow strain. Although BALB/c mice are susceptible to ECTV growth, which results in fatal disease within 7 days ( [54](javascript:;)), we found that all rVVs were able to protect against infection from the ECTV Moscow strain (data not shown), indicating that a single immunization is sufficient to provide cross-protection against an otherwise lethal dose of ECTV. We have demonstrated that coexpression of the type I IFNs in rVV causes varying degrees of attenuation of the different rVVs. Local IFN- expression imparts a low level of antiviral activity to the rVV, as seen by a reduction in viral growth in vitro and also up-regulation of antiviral genes; however, this does not translate to an enhancement of the immune response generated to the viral vector. Tissue-restricted expression of IFN- suggests a specialized role that may be quite distinct (i.e., mucosally related) to the antiviral activities of IFN-/. Reports examining the expression of IFN- in various tissues have found low levels of gene expression in the lung ( [2](javascript:;)). We have found that in an allergic BALB/c model, IFN- appeared to be up-regulated in the lung when compared with the control BALB/c lung. Quantitative real-time PCR showed a 5-fold increase in message RNA levels of IFN- in allergic lung compared with the control. However, levels of IFN-/ increased 29- and 17-fold, respectively. Nonetheless, constitutive expression levels of IFN- were higher than the other IFNs. Additionally, unlike IFN-, neither IFN- nor IFN- was up-regulated when cervical epithelial cells were exposed to seminal fluid ( [13](javascript:;)). We thus propose a role for IFN- in mucosal immune regulation that may be quite distinct from the other type I IFNs, and we are currently investigating this possibility in other models of mucosal immunity and disease.
