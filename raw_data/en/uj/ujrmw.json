Compromising on taste is hardly an option. When it comes to taste improvement, the food and beverage industry has many challenges to face that require expertise. They need to meet customer expectations by providing specific flavor notes, increasing the overall richness of a food application and maintaining an appetizing taste while reducing the level of certain ingredients such as sugar or salt. Taste and flavors are the result of what our tongue and nose perceive when we eat or drink. Both send information to our brain, which will analyze the data, helping us to characterize tastes and flavors of the foods we are eating. There are five basic tastes known: saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and umami. Each one is linked to one reference molecule. The first four are well-known and have been described for centuries. Umami taste was discovered in 1908 by a Japanese researcher while tasting dashi broth, a traditional broth made from Kombu seaweed. It was only scientifically recognized as the fifth basic taste in the 1980's. Umami literally translates \"savory taste\" from Japanese and refers to a lingering taste that stimulates salivation. A new taste concept has been recently discovered in the field: kokumi. It refers to the attributes of slow cooking or home-made cuisine. \"Richness\", \"mouth fullness\" and \"smoothness\" are commonly used to describe the kokumi sensation. Taste and flavors are complex to describe and require specific expertise to improve. Experts have divided taste into three building blocks: Umami and kokumi bring out all the other flavors and highlight the overall profile. Due to its natural complex composition, yeast extract is a great tool to build complete taste profiles, by bringing out flavor notes. It is also used to reduce and remove specific ingredients for clean label or nutritional purposes. Our culinary and sensory experts are dedicated to help solve your needs and select the right ingredients and dosages, guided by their strong understanding of taste improvement. Our wide range of yeast-based solutions will allow you to: Lipids are essential components of a living cell. However, a high fat intake can lead to obesity and increase the risk of heart diseases. Food manufacturers are encouraged to reformulate processed foods to reduce fat content. Fat components play an important role in building balanced taste profiles and appealing textures.

The Biospringer Culinary Center has demonstrated a reduction of fat by 30% using Biospringer yeast-based ingredients while maintaining appetizing organoleptic profiles. Salt reduction is one of the top 10 trends in healthy foods. The World Health Organization (WHO) Member states have agreed to reduce the global salt intake by 30%, before 2025. Food manufacturers are strongly encouraged to lower the sodium content of processed foods, which are high in salt. The reduction of salt without compromising the taste is a challenge.

Today, consumers are more and more health-conscious and environment friendly: they are increasingly inquisitive about the natural origin, traceability, and nutritional or sustainability impact of the food they buy and eat. The expectation for transparency and simplicity explains the significant growth of the \"free-from\" claim. 74% of US consumers want more transparency in food and drink ingredients, 53% of Chinese people pay attention to additives and preservatives in food and drink labels 33% of Europeans are avoiding the word \"artificial\" on a packaging. This strong requirement for naturality and clarity is guiding the clean label and clear label trends, slowly becoming the industry standard. Clean label is defined as a clear, understandable declaration for the consumer. Therefore, a product is considered as clean label when it consists of recognizable ingredients, without artificial additives. \"Less is more\" quite clearly summarizes the clean label concept. However, understanding the ingredient list is not enough anymore. Clean Label is evolving to Clear Label. Customers expect more transparency on the origin and on the process, to trust what they eat. Customers want to understand the impact the product will have on their health and the environment.

Nearly 64% (Nielsen Global Ingredients and Dining Out Trends - August 2016) of the world population follow a diet that limits or bans the consumption of specific ingredients and types of foods. Meat and animal-based products are not an exception. Consumers are lowering or eliminating their consumption of meat in place of vegetables, fruits and plant-based proteins while embracing Vegetarian, Vegan or Flexitarian diets. 14% of consumers worldwide identify as Vegetarian, and 6% as Vegan. What does this alternative diet imply? \"Vegetarian\", \"vegan\" and \"flexitarian\" deserve a clear definition: These new eating habits provide interesting innovation opportunities for the food industry.

To compensate for the impact on taste or texture, food manufacturers adapt and innovate by using alternative solutions such as sweeteners or plant proteins. The alternative ingredients can bring unwanted off-notes that need to be masked to develop flavorful products. Taste properties of yeast extract make it a valuable natural origin ingredient to mask undesirable notes. Off-note masking requires a strong expertise in formulation mastered by the [Biospringer Culinary Center](https://biospringer.com/en/our-expertise/#culinary).
