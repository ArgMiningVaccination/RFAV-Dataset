There is a TCM near my house and I want to go in and consult with them. I do believe in natural medicine. When my 90 year old grandma heard I had mc she said she is going to ask somebody to bring back some \"bush tea\" for me from Costa Rica. My mom side is from Costa Rica. I also ordered this book: [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316159212/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Opens a new window](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316159212/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=bccmty-20) You can see much of the book when you click to look inside. I was really fascinated that it said people like me (back cramps, feel cold in womb before cycle, heat relieves cramps, clots in cycle blood etc.) would benefit from warming herbs like Vitex and a few others. I totally do feel a cold feeling in my womb when my period is coming so I don't even test. Anyone tried TCM, acupuncture, etc. with success?

I had been TTC for about 6 months & NTNP for awhile before that; I'm in my mid-30's so my clock's a'tickin but I thought I would consult an acupuncturist as one last thing before I went to an RE & haven't looked back since (though I'm not saying an RE/ART is out of the question but I feel acupuncture is working well for me right now). I conceived for the first time the month I began to go but unfortunately that pg ended in a mmc in my 8th week. I have found my acupuncture to be an incredible help with my road to recovery post-mc & D&C and received my first AF 26 days post D&C (D&C was December 21st)... I am feeling more myself with each passing cycle and can feel my hormones getting back into balance as well. I go to acupuncture once a week and take my herbs (powder form) twice daily. My acupuncturist is an herbalist and mixes her own herbs for me and changes the formula at times based upon my TCM diagnosis pattern changes but overall the formula has stayed mostly similar... I can't remember all that is in there though... I credit my acupuncturist with much of my journey to recovery and she has been so wonderful and gentle with me; she too had a loss last year (hers was in October) and she shared this with me only once I'd mc. She's a kind soul and practices at my MD's office... they have a holistic medicine arm of the practice which is really convenient. My acupuncture treatments aren't cheap ($100 per visit) but I figure they are totally worth it since I feel so much more relaxed and centered afterwards and I almost feel like they're a mini-therapy session since she asks about my emotional well being each time too (which my OB never did as much as I like my OB & I really do like her too;) Also, I just finished Randine Lewis' \"The Infertility Cure\" which was given to me by one of my best friends who'd read it when TTC her rainbow daughter. It's an amazing book and taught me a great deal about acupuncture & TCM in general; Randine went to medical school here in the US but chose to practice TCM and specifically fertility related TCM instead of practicing as an MD. I loved the book b/c it speaks about acupuncture from both an Eastern & Western perspective and is truly just a lovely book, whether you have ever been pg, have had a loss, are planning to use ART or planning to TTC au naturale it is a wonderful read. I almost didn't want it to end and I cried during the last chapter... she's a wonderful writer and her tone is soothing and not preachy or clinical in the least. This book along with Taking Charge of Your Fertility are my faves so far in my TTC reading. Sorry for the long post but hopefully you find it helpful... sending healing thoughts & sticky rainbow dust to us all!! ~L - Posted 04-19-13Tracey, if you end up doing TCM, can you please let us know how it goes? I'm on the fence about it myself, but have heard good things about it. I guess I'm just leery about taking some herbs I've never heard of.Advertisement | page continues below - Posted 04-19-13I have been going for almost 2 months with accupuncture and herbs. I took a cycle off to try a herb that you can't take while pregnant. She told me I wouldn't have cramps with my period and I thought she was full of hot air. I always get cramps pretty bad. She was right, it was great. I am still doing the acupuncture and different herbs. My insurance actually covers it, so I only pay $12/visit. I am testing next week and hoping for a BFP. [Bklyn Mamacita]\u00b7 Original PosterPosted 04-19-13Thank you for the posts. I got the book in mail yesterday. Plbailey would you pm me where you go? I used to work in SF but now work on east bay. I plan to go to the herbal store and see what they have to say. Hi I'm new here but recently started TCM 2 months ago. I'm 41 and have been ttc for 4 years. My problem is age and recurrent MC's. I've tried it all: IUI, Clomid, 2 cycles of IVF: 1 was unsuccessful, 2nd time resulted in bfp but MC at 8 weeks. We finally decided it was time to get back to nature and try TCM. DH and I both hail from the Caribbean where people go to their yard instead of the pharmacy to cure their ailments. I live in Brooklyn, NY so a quick train ride to Chinatown is very convenient. I'm prescribed anywhere between 11-14 different packs of herbs to mix and drink as tea 2x a day. It tastes like a bad cup of coffee but I'm use to it now and I'm determined to run it's course to see if it gets my body in shape for pregnancy. So far I've noticed more energy, sleep better, better bowel movements and less pms symptoms. I plan on dropping in to give updates, but in the meantime check out this site for more information and inspiration: [http://www.zhaiclinic.com/Opens a new window](http://www.zhaiclinic.com/) Good luck to all and please don't lose faith. - JdhcalInactivePosted 04-26-13 I do acupuncture and herbs too and love it! I have noticed significantly more CM. I have only TTC'd 1 cycle with it so far and hope #2 is the lucky one. [Bklyn Mamacita]\u00b7 Original PosterPosted 04-26-13 Smith538 you and I have a lot in common. My grandma is Jamaican and my mother is from Costa Rica so there is a lot of natural medicine practice. Also my screen name-Brooklyn born and raised kicking it out here in CA. I hope the TCM works for us all! - mPosted 04-29-13 Hi everyone. I too recently turned to TCM. Like others, we have been trying for over a year... and have had 5 unsuccessful IUIs. Our first resulted in a BFP however we lost his hearbeat at 8 weeks. We have been TTC with IUI since to no avail. I recently started to see Dr. Zheng in Manhattan -- she has been terrific. I too take herbal supplements (the powder kind that taste like bad coffee) and thus far I feel soooo positive and great about this journey. I have hope again, as I am really scared of the IVF process, and at 33 I feel too young to go that route just yet. Like others, Randine Lewis's book is what inspired me to go this route. She is a miracle worker.... I look forward to taking this journey with all of you ladies. Baby dust to us all.... - Posted 04-29-13I started acupuncture about six weeks ago. We got pregnant after trying for three months last year but I had a MMC then ultimately a D&C in May. Since then we haven't gotten pregnant again. Usually I get ovulation pain for half a day, but last month I got it for five days! I've also noticed an increase in CM. It's also very relaxing. I'm not taking any herbs except red raspberry leaf. She did offer me a pregnancy tea, but a 3-week supply was $200 so I opted to start with just acupuncture and go from there. We'll "}
