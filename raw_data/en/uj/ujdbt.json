It's hands-on, even while being online, so you get to experiment with the tools. By the end of the course, you have learnt how to use several tools that you were not able to use before. I think that if you want to invest into something this year or next year and you really want to have a return on investment - this is the course to do.\" Raquel Correia, Medical Doctor, as Medicine](?a=850187&SQ_VARIATION_850187=0) \"I am a homoeopath and was interested in knowing more about nutrition to assist my practice; the Food as Medicine course offered by Monash University seemed to completely fit the bill. The academic staff are very successful in simplifying and demystifying an area which can otherwise be very confusing due to information overload. Their approach helps you cut through the multitude of myths and misinformation regarding food and nutrition, to get to the basics of what the body needs to function at its best. I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in health, whether they have a background in this area or not.\" Nicky Martin "}
