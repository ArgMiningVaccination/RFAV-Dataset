SEC. 318. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DECONTAMINATION OF FORMER BOMBARDMENT AREA ON ISLAND OF CULEBRA, PUERTO RICO. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following-- (1) Section 2815 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 Stat. 4464) requires the Secretary of Defense within 270 days of receiving a request from the government of Puerto Rico, to conduct a study assessing the presence of unexploded ordnance, and any threat to public health, public safety and the environment posed by such unexploded ordnance, in the portion of the former bombardment area on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, that was transferred to the government of Puerto Rico by quitclaim deed on August 11, 1982. (2) On April 25, 2011, the Governor of Puerto Rico formally requested by letter that the Secretary of Defense commence this study. (3) On May 25, 2011, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment acknowledged receipt of the Governor's letter on behalf of the Secretary of Defense, and affirmed that the Department of Defense would conduct the study in accordance with such section 2815 and provide the final report to Congress no later than 270 days from the date of the Governor's letter. (4) January 20, 2012, marked the date 270 days after the Governor's letter of April 25, 2011. (5) Section 204(c) of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1974 (Public Law 93-166; 87 Stat. 668) stated that ``the present bombardment area on the island of Culebra shall not be utilized for any purpose that would require decontamination at the expense of the United States.'' The Department of Defense has interpreted this provision to constitute a permanent prohibition on the use of Federal funds in the area of Culebra referenced in such section to pay for decontamination and removal of unexploded ordnance, although it may be warranted to protect public health, public safety, and the environment. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the Secretary of Defense should expeditiously submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives the final report prepared in accordance with section 2815 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 Stat. 4464); (2) if that report indicates that decontamination and removal of unexploded ordnance in the portion of the former bombardment area on Culebra that was transferred to the government of Puerto Rico by quitclaim deed on August 11, 1982, could be conducted at reasonable cost to the Federal Government, it is appropriate for Congress to amend section 204(c) of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1974 (Public Law 93-166; 87 Stat. 668) to authorize such decontamination and removal of unexploded ordnance; and (3) any removal of unexploded ordnance should be accomplished pursuant to the normal prioritization process established by the Department of Defense under the Military Munitions Response Program within the Defense Environmental Restoration Program.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Department of Defense conducted a survey of members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty that revealed that only 13.5 percent of such members reported incidents of sexual assault, which means that more than 19,000 incidents of sexual assault of members of the Armed Forces actually occurred in 2010 alone. (2) Despite attempts, the Department of Defense has failed to address the chronic under reporting of incidents of sexual assault and harassment, as by the Department's own estimates, 86 percent of sexual assaults went unreported in 2010. (3) Sexual assault in the military is an ongoing problem leading many victims to seek help after separation from the Armed Forces from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (4) About 1 in 5 women and 1 in 100 men seen in Veterans Health Administration respond ``Yes'' when screened for military sexual trauma. (5) Among users of healthcare provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, medical record data indicates that diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders, depression and other mood disorders, and substance use disorders are most frequently associated with military sexual trauma. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should expand efforts to raise awareness about military sexual trauma and the treatment and services that the Department provides to victims; and (2) in light of the fact that the available data shows an overwhelming number of military sexual trauma claims go unreported within the Department of Defense, making it very difficult for veterans to show proof of the assault when filing claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs for post- traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions caused by military sexual trauma, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should review the disability process to ensure that victims of military sexual trauma who file claims for service connection do not face unnecessary or overly burdensome requirements in order to claim disability benefits with the Department.

(3) ``Taps'' is now established by the uniformed services as the last call of the day and is sounded at the completion of a military funeral. (4) ``Taps'' has become the signature, solemn musical farewell for members of the uniformed services and veterans who have faithfully served the United States during times of war and peace. (5) Over its 150 years of use, ``Taps'' has been woven into the historical fabric of the United States. (6) When sounded, ``Taps'' summons emotions of loss, pride, honor, and respect and encourages Americans to remember patriots who served the United States with honor and valor. (7) The 150th anniversary of the writing of ``Taps'' will be observed with events culminating in June 2012 with a rededication of the Taps Monument at Berkley Plantation, Virginia.

SEC. 596. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE RECOVERY OF THE REMAINS OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES KILLED IN THURSTON ISLAND, ANTARCTICA. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Commencing August 26, 1946, though late February 1947 the United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program Task Force 68, codenamed ``Operation Highjump'' initiated and undertook the largest ever-to-this-date exploration of the Antarctic continent. (2) The primary mission of the Task Force 68 organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd Jr. USN, (Ret) and led by Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen, USN, was to do the following: (A) Establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV. (B) In the defense of the United States of America from possible hostile aggression from abroad - to train personnel test equipment, develop techniques for establishing, maintaining and utilizing air bases on ice, with applicability comparable to interior Greenland, where conditions are similar to those of the Antarctic. (C) Map and photograph a full two-thirds of the Antarctic Continent during the classified, hazardous duty/volunteer-only operation involving 4700 sailors, 23 aircraft and 13 ships including the first submarine the U.S.S. Sennet, and the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Philippine Sea, brought to the edge of the ice pack to launch (6) Navy ski-equipped, rocket-assisted R4Ds. (D) Consolidate and extend United States sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent. (E) Determine the feasibility of establishing, maintaining and utilizing bases in the Antarctic and investigating possible base sites. (3) While on a hazardous duty/all volunteer mission vital to the interests of National Security and while over the eastern Antarctica coastline known as the Phantom Coast, the PBM-5 Martin Mariner ``Flying Boat'' ``George 1'' entered a whiteout over Thurston Island. As the pilot attempted to climb, the aircraft grazed the glacier's ridgeline and exploded within 5 seconds instantly killing Ensign Maxwell Lopez, Navigator and Wendell ``Bud'' Hendersin, Aviation Machinists Mate 1st Class while Frederick Williams, Aviation Radioman 1st Class died several hours later. Six other crewmen survived including the Captain of the ``George 1's'' seaplane tender U.S.S. Pine Island. (4) The bodies of the dead were protected from the desecration of Antarctic scavenging birds (Skuas) by the surviving crew wrapping the bodies and temporarily burying the men under the starboard wing engine nacelle. (5) Rescue requirements of the ``George-1'' survivors forced the abandonment of their crewmates' bodies. (6) Conditions prior to the departure of Task Force 68 precluded a return to the area to the recover the bodies. (7) For nearly 60 years Navy promised the families that they would recover the men: ``If the safety, logistical, and operational prerequisites allow a mission in the future, every effort will be made to bring our sailors home.''. (8) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command twice offered to recover the bodies of this crew for Navy. (9) A 2004 NASA ground penetrating radar overflight commissioned by Navy relocated the crash site three miles from its crash position. (10) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command offered to underwrite the cost of an aerial ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey of the crash site area by NASA. (11) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command studied the recovery with the recognized recovery authorities and national scientists and determined that the recovery is only ``medium risk''. (12) National Science Foundation and scientists from the University of Texas, Austin, regularly visit the island. (13) The crash site is classified as a ``perishable site'', meaning a glacier that will calve into the Bellingshausen Sea. (14) The National Science Foundation maintains a presence in area - of the Pine Island Glacier. (15) The National Science Foundation Director of Polar Operations will assist and provide assets for the recovery upon the request of Congress. (16) The United States Coast Guard is presently pursuing the recovery of 3 WWII air crewmen from similar circumstances in Greenland. (17) On Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, President Barack Obama declared: ``* * * the support of our veterans is a sacred trust * * * we need to serve them as they have served us * * * that means bringing home all our POWs and MIAs * * *''. (18) The policies and laws of the United States of America require that our armed service personnel be repatriated. (19) The fullest possible accounting of United States fallen military personnel means repatriating living American POWs and MIAs, accounting for, identifying, and recovering the remains of military personnel who were killed in the line of duty, or providing convincing evidence as to why such a repatriation, accounting, identification, or recovery is not possible. (20) It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to return to the United States for proper burial and respect all members of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty who lie in lost graves. (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings under subsection (a), Congress-- (1) reaffirms its support for the recovery and return to the United States, the remains and bodies of all members of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty, and for the efforts by the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command to recover the remains of members of the Armed Forces from all wars, conflicts and missions; (2) recognizes the courage and sacrifice of all members of the Armed Forces who participated in Operation Highjump and all missions vital to the national security of the United States of America; (3) acknowledges the dedicated research and efforts by the US Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, the Fallen American Veterans Foundation and all persons and organizations to identify, locate, and advocate for, from their temporary Antarctic grave, the recovery of the well-preserved frozen bodies of Ensign Maxwell Lopez, Naval Aviator, Frederick Williams, Aviation Machinist's Mate 1ST Class, Wendell Hendersin, Aviation Radioman 1ST Class of the ``George 1'' explosion and crash; and (4) encourages the Department of Defense to review the facts, research and to pursue new efforts to undertake all feasible efforts to recover, identify, and return the well- preserved frozen bodies of the ``George 1'' crew from Antarctica's Thurston Island.

SEC. 723. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRICARE WORKING GROUP. (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) children of members of the Armed Forces deserve health- care practices and policies that-- (A) are designed to meet their pediatric-specific needs; (B) are developed and determined proactively and comprehensively; and (C) ensure and maintain their access to pediatric- specific treatments, providers, and facilities. (2) children's health-care needs and standards of care are different and distinct from those of adults, therefore the TRICARE program should undertake a proactive, comprehensive approach to review and analyze its policies and practices to meet the needs of children to ensure that children and their families receive appropriate care in proper settings and avoid unnecessary challenges in seeking or obtaining proper health care; (3) a proactive and comprehensive review is necessary because the reimbursement structure of the TRICARE program is patterned upon Medicare and the resulting policies and practices of the TRICARE program do not always properly reflect appropriate standards for pediatric care; (4) one distinct aspect of children's health care is the need for specialty care and services for children with special- health-care needs and chronic-health conditions; (5) the requirement for specialized health care and developmental support is an ongoing and serious matter of day- to-day life for families with children with special or chronic- health-care needs; (6) the Department of Defense and the TRICARE program, recognizing the special needs of certain children, have instituted special-needs programs, including the ECHO program, but there are collateral needs that are not being met, generally because the services are provided in the local community rather than by the Department of Defense, who may not always have the best tools or knowledge to access these State and local resources; (7) despite wholehearted efforts by the Department of Defense, a gap exists between linking military families with children with special-health-care needs and chronic conditions with the resources and services available from local or regional highly specialized providers and the communities and States in which they reside; (8) the gap is especially exacerbated by the mobility of military families, who often move from State to State, because special-needs health care, educational, and social services are very specific to each local community and State and such services often have lengthy waiting lists; and (9) the Department of Defense will be better able to assist military families with children with special-health-care needs fill the gap by collaborating with special-health-care needs providers and those knowledgeable about the opportunities for such children that are provided by States and local communities. (b) Establishment.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a working group to carry out a review of the TRICARE program with respect to-- (A) pediatric health care needs under paragraph (2); and (B) pediatric special and chronic health care needs under paragraph (3).

(B) Review.--In carrying out the duties under subparagraph (A), the working group shall-- (i) identify improvements in policies, practices, and administration of the TRICARE program with respect to pediatric-specific health care and pediatric-specific healthcare settings; (ii) analyze the direct and indirect effects of the reimbursement policies and practices of the TRICARE program with respect to pediatric care and care provided in pediatric settings; (iii) consider case management programs with respect to pediatric complex and chronic care, including whether pediatric specific programs are necessary; (iv) develop a plan to ensure that the TRICARE program addresses pediatric-specific health care needs on an on-going basis beyond the life of the working group; (v) consider how the TRICARE program can work with the pediatric provider community to ensure access, promote communication and collaboration, and optimize experiences of military families seeking and receiving health care services for children; and (vi) review matters that further the mission of the working group. (3) Pediatric special and chronic health care needs.-- (A) Duties.--The working group shall-- (i) review the methods in which families in the TRICARE program who have children with special-health-care needs access community resources and health-care resources; (ii) review how having access to, and a better understanding of, community resources may improve access to health care and support services; (iii) recommend methods to accomplish improved access by such children and families to community resources and health-care resources, including through collaboration with children's hospitals and other providers of pediatric specialty care, local agencies, local communities, and States; (iv) consider approaches and make recommendations for the improved integration of individualized or compartmentalized medical and family support resources for military families; (v) work closely with the Office of Community Support for Military Families with Special Needs of the Department of Defense and other relevant offices to avoid redundancies and target shared areas of concern for children with special or chronic-health-care needs; and (vi) review any relevant information learned and findings made by the working group under this paragraph that may be considered or adopted in a consistent manner with respect to improving access, resources, and services for adults with special needs. (B) Review.--In carrying out the duties under subparagraph (A), the working group shall-- (i) discuss improvements to special needs health care policies and practices; (ii) determine how to support and protect families of members of the National Guard or Reserve Components as the members transition into and out of the relevant Exceptional Family Member Program or the ECHO program; (iii) analyze case management services to improve consistency, communication, knowledge, and understanding of resources and community contacts; (iv) identify areas in which a State may offer services that are not covered by the TRICARE program or the ECHO program and how to coordinate such services; (v) identify steps that States and communities can take to improve support for military families of children with special health care needs; (vi) consider how the TRICARE program and other programs of the Department of Defense can work with specialty pediatric providers and resource communities to ensure access, promote communication and collaboration, and optimize experiences of military families seeking and receiving health care services for their children with special or chronic health care needs; (vii) consider special and chronic health care in a comprehensive manner without focus on one or more conditions or diagnoses to the exclusion of others; (viii) focus on ways to create innovative partnerships, linkages, and access to information and resources for military families across the spectrum of the special-needs community and between the medical community and the family support community; and (ix) review matters that further the mission of the working group.

SEC. 1015. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE COUNTERDRUG TETHERED AEROSTAT RADAR SYSTEM PROGRAM. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Since 1992, the Air Force has administered the Counterdrug Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) program, which contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving illicit drugs into the United States. (2) There are eight current tethered aerostat systems, located at Yuma, Arizona, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Deming, New Mexico, Marfa, Texas, Eagle Pass, Texas, Rio Grande City, Texas, Cudjoe Key, Florida, and Lajas, Puerto Rico. (3) Primary customers of the surveillance data from the TARS program are the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Northern Command, the United States Southern Command, and the North American Aerospace Defense Command. (4) In the past two years, the radars in two of the eight tethered aerostat systems have been destroyed in strong weather conditions, namely the radar at Lajas, Puerto Rico, which was destroyed in April 2011, and the radar at Marfa, Texas, which was destroyed in February 2012. (5) The Air Force has indicated that it does not have sufficient spare parts in its inventory to replace either of these two radars or the funding necessary to purchase any new radars. As a result, there are no current plans to resume operations at Lajas, Puerto Rico or Marfa, Texas. (6) The loss of these two tethered aerostats systems substantially degrades counterdrug capabilities in the Caribbean corridor and along the Southwest border. (7) The loss of the tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico, is particularly detrimental to the national counterdrug mission. In Section 1023 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Public Law 109-163), Congress found that-- (A) ``Drug traffickers use the Caribbean corridor to smuggle narcotics to the United States via Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This route is ideal for drug trafficking because of its geographic expanse, numerous law enforcement jurisdictions, and fragmented investigative efforts.''; and (B) ``The tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico, contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving illicit drugs into Puerto Rico. The aerostat's range and operational capabilities allow it to provide surveillance coverage of the eastern Caribbean corridor and the strategic waterway between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, known as the Mona Passage.''. (8) In such section 1023, Congress expressed that ``Congress and the Department of Defense should fund the Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program.''. (9) In recent years, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands have been increasingly impacted by the drug trade and related violence. Both jurisdictions have homicide rates that are roughly six times the national average and about three times higher than any State, and many of these homicides are linked to the drug trade. (10) The Department of Defense has raised questions as to whether it should continue to administer the TARS program or, alternatively, whether responsibility for this program should be vested in the Department of Homeland Security. (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings under subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that-- (1) irrespective of whether the Department of Defense continues to be responsible for the Counterdrug Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) program or such responsibility is assigned to another agency, Congress and the responsible agency should fund the TARS program; and (2) Congress and the responsible agency should take all appropriate steps to ensure that the eight current tethered aerostat systems are fully functional and, in particular, to ensure that the TARS program is providing coverage to protect jurisdictions of the United States in the Caribbean region, as well as jurisdictions of the United States along the United States-Mexico border and in the Florida Straits.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 12304b(i) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by striking ``231(e)(2)'' and inserting ``section 231(f)(2)''. Subtitle D--Counterterrorism SEC. 1031. FINDINGS ON DETENTION PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE ENACTED IN 2001. Congress finds the following: (1) In 2001, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) (hereinafter referred to as the ``AUMF''), which authorized the President to ``use all necessary and appropriate force'' against those responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, and those who harbored them ``in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States''. (2) In 2004, the Supreme Court held in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the AUMF authorized the President to detain individuals, including a United States citizen captured in Afghanistan and later detained in the United States, legitimately determined to be ``engaged in armed conflict against the United States'' until the end of hostilities, noting that ``[W]e understand Congress' grant of authority for the use of `necessary and appropriate force' to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles''. (3) The Court reaffirmed the long-standing principle of American law that a United States citizen may not be detained in the United States pursuant to the AUMF without due process of law, stating the following: (A) ``Striking the proper constitutional balance here is of great importance to the Nation during this period of ongoing combat. But it is equally vital that our calculus not give short shrift to the values that this country holds dear or to the privilege that is American citizenship.''. (B) ``It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.''. (C) ``[A] state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.''. (D) ``[A]bsent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States.''. (E) ``All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.''. (F) ``[A]n enemy combatant must receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.''. (G) ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake.''. (H) ``[U]nless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executive's discretion in the realm of detentions.''. (I) ``We reaffirm today the fundamental nature of a citizen's right to be free from involuntary confinement by his own government without due process of law, and we weigh the opposing governmental interests against the curtailment of liberty that such confinement entails.''. (4) In 2008, in Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court also extended the constitutional right to habeas corpus to the foreign detainees held pursuant to the AUMF at the United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (5) Chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code, as originally enacted by the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-366), only allows for prosecution of foreign terrorists by military commission. (6) In 2011, with the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81), Congress and the President affirmed the authority of the Armed Forces of the United States to detain pursuant to the AUMF a person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks, or a person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces. (7) The interpretation of the detention authority provided by the AUMF under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is the same as the interpretation used by the Obama administration in its legal filings in Federal court and is nearly identical to the interpretation used by the Bush administration. This interpretation has also been upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. (8) Such Act also requires the Secretary of Defense to regularly brief Congress regarding the application of the detention authority provided by the AUMF. (9) Section 1021 of such Act states that ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.''. SEC. 1032. FINDINGS REGARDING HABEAS CORPUS RIGHTS. Congress finds the following: (1) Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution states ``The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.''. (2) Regarding the Great Writ, the Supreme Court has noted ``The writ of habeas corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless state action.''. SEC. 1033. RIGHTS UNAFFECTED. (a) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus or to deny any Constitutional rights in a court ordained or established by or under Article III of the Constitution for any person who is lawfully in the United States when detained pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) and who is otherwise entitled to the availability of such writ or such rights. (b) Notification of Detention of Persons Under Authorization for Use of Military Force.--Not later than 48 hours after the date on which a person who is lawfully in the United States is detained pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), the President shall notify Congress of the detention of such person. (c) Habeas Applications.--A person who is lawfully in the United States when detained pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) shall be allowed to file an application for habeas corpus relief in an appropriate district court not later than 30 days after the date on which such person is placed in military custody.

SEC. 1052. COMMITMENTS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE MODERNIZATION. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) In 2008, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that ``to be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program.''. (2) Secretary Gates also warned in September 2009 that modernization is a prerequisite to nuclear force reductions, stating that modernizing the nuclear capability of the United States is an ``enabler of arms control and our ability to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. When we have more confidence in the long-term viability of our weapons systems, then our ability to reduce the number of weapons we must keep in the stockpile is enhanced.''. (3) President Obama's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that-- (A) ``In order to sustain a safe, secure, and effective United States nuclear stockpile as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States must possess a modern physical infrastructure--comprised of the national security laboratories and a complex of supporting facilities.''; and (B) ``[I]mplementation of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the nuclear infrastructure investments recommended in the NPR will allow the United States to shift away from retaining large numbers of non-deployed warheads as a hedge against technical or geopolitical surprise, allowing major reductions in the nuclear stockpile. These investments are essential to facilitating reductions while sustaining deterrence under New START and beyond.''. (4) Section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2549) required the President to submit a report to Congress on the plan for the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear weapons complex, and delivery platforms at the time a follow-on treaty to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was submitted by the President to the Senate. The President submitted such report in May 2010 and submitted updates in November 2010 and February 2011. (5) Such section 1251 also contained a sense of Congress that ``the enhanced safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile, modernization of the nuclear weapons complex, and maintenance of nuclear delivery systems are key to enabling further reductions in the nuclear forces of the United States.''. (6) Forty-one Senators wrote to President Obama on December 15, 2009, stating, ``we don't believe further reductions can be in the national security interest of the United States in the absence of a significant program to modernize our nuclear deterrent.''. (7) Former Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy James Schlesinger stated, while testifying before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate in April 2010, ``I believe that it is immensely important for the Senate to ensure, what the Administration has stated as its intent, i.e., that there be a robust plan with a continuation of its support over the full 10 years, before it proceeds to ratify this START follow- on treaty.''. (8) Former Secretary of State James Baker stated in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate in May 2010 that ``because our security is based upon the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, it is important that our Government budget enough money to guarantee that those weapons can carry out their mission.''. (9) Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also stated in May 2010 while testifying before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that ``as part of a number of recommendations, my colleagues, Bill Perry, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and I have called for significant investments in a repaired and modernized nuclear weapons infrastructure and added resources for the three national laboratories.''. (10) Then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, while testifying before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate in June 2010, stated, ``I see this treaty as a vehicle to finally be able to get what we need in the way of modernization that we have been unable to get otherwise * * *. We are essentially the only nuclear power in the world that is not carrying out these kinds of modernization programs.''. (11) Secretary Gates further stated that ``I've been up here for the last four springs trying to get money for this and this is the first time I think I've got a fair shot of actually getting money for our nuclear arsenal.''. (12) The Directors of the national nuclear weapons laboratories wrote to the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate in December 2010 that ``We are very pleased by the update to the Section 1251 Report, as it would enable the laboratories to execute our requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable and effective stockpile under the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. In particular, we are pleased because it clearly responds to many of the concerns that we and others have voiced in the past about potential future-year funding shortfalls, and it substantially reduces risks to the overall program. In summary, we believe that the proposed budgets provide adequate support to sustain the safety, security, reliability and effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent within the limit of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads established by the New START Treaty with adequate confidence and acceptable risk.''. (13) President Obama pledged, in a December 2010 letter to several Senators, ``I recognize that nuclear modernization requires investment for the long-term * * *. That is my commitment to the Congress--that my Administration will pursue these programs and capabilities for as long as I am President.''. (14) Secretary Gates added in May 2011 that, ``this modernization program was very carefully worked out between ourselves and the Department of Energy; and, frankly, where we came out on that played a fairly significant role in the willingness of the Senate to ratify the New START agreement.''. (15) The Administrator for Nuclear Security, Thomas D'Agostino, testified before Congress in November 2011 that, ``it is critical to accept the linkage between modernizing our current stockpile in order to achieve the policy objective of decreasing the number of weapons we have in our stockpile, while still ensuring that the deterrent is safe, secure, and effective.''. (b) New START Treaty Defined.--In this subtitle, the term ``New START Treaty'' means the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. SEC. 1053. LIMITATION AND REPORT IN THE EVENT OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR MODERNIZATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.

(b) Insufficient Funding Report and Limitation.-- (1) In general.--Paragraph (2) of section 1045(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (50 U.S.C. 2523b) is amended to read as follows: ``(2) Insufficient funding.-- ``(A) Report.--During each year in which the New START Treaty is in force, if the President determines that an appropriations Act is enacted that fails to meet the resource levels set forth in the November 2010 update to the plan referred to in section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2549) or if at any time determines that more resources are required to carry out such plan than were estimated, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, within 60 days of making such a determination, a report detailing-- ``(i) a plan to remedy the resource shortfall; ``(ii) if more resources are required to carry out the plan than were estimated-- ``(I) the proposed level of funding required; and ``(II) an identification of the stockpile work, campaign, facility, site, asset, program, operation, activity, construction, or project for which additional funds are required; ``(iii) any effects caused by the shortfall on the safety, security, reliability, or credibility of the nuclear forces of the United States; and ``(iv) whether and why, in light of the shortfall, remaining a party to the New START Treaty is in the national interest of the United States. ``(B) Limitation.--If the President submits a report under subparagraph (A), none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the National Nuclear Security Administration may be used to reduce the number of deployed nuclear warheads until-- ``(i) after the date on which such report is submitted, the President certifies in writing to the appropriate congressional committees that the resource shortfall identified in such report has been addressed; and ``(ii) a period of 120 days has elapsed following the date on which such certification is made. ``(C) Exception.--The limitation in subparagraph (B) shall not apply to-- ``(i) reductions made to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear weapons stockpile and strategic delivery systems, including activities related to surveillance, assessment, certification, testing, and maintenance of nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems; or ``(ii) nuclear warheads that are retired or awaiting dismantlement on the date of the report under subparagraph (A). ``(D) Definitions.--In the congressional defense committees; and ``(II) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives. ``(ii) The term `New START Treaty' means the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011.''. (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect on October 1, 2012. SEC. 1054. PROGRESS OF MODERNIZATION. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) In 2008, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that ``to be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program.''. (2) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that ``the President has directed a review of post-New START arms control objectives, to consider future reductions in nuclear weapons. Several factors will influence the magnitude and pace of future reductions in United States nuclear forces below New START levels'', including-- (A) ``First, any future nuclear reductions must continue to strengthen deterrence of potential regional adversaries, strategic stability vis-a-vis Russia and China, and assurance of our allies and partners. This will require an updated assessment of deterrence requirements; further improvements in United States, allied, and partner non-nuclear capabilities; focused reductions in strategic and non-strategic weapons; and close consultations with allies and partners. The United States will continue to ensure that, in the calculations of any potential opponent, the perceived gains of attacking the United States or its allies and partners would be far outweighed by the unacceptable costs of the response.''; (B) ``Second, implementation of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the nuclear infrastructure investments recommended in the NPR will allow the United States to shift away from retaining large numbers of non-deployed warheads as a hedge against technical or geopolitical surprise, allowing major reductions in the nuclear stockpile. These investments are essential to facilitating reductions while sustaining deterrence under New START and beyond.''; and (C) ``Third, Russia's nuclear force will remain a significant factor in determining how much and how fast we are prepared to reduce United States forces. Because of our improved relations, the need for strict numerical parity between the two countries is no longer as compelling as it was during the Cold War. But large disparities in nuclear capabilities could raise concerns on both sides and among United States allies and partners, and may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic relationship, especially as nuclear forces are significantly reduced. Therefore, we will place importance on Russia joining us as we move to lower levels.''. (3) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review also stated that the Administration would ``conduct follow-on analysis to set goals for future nuclear reductions below the levels expected in New START, while strengthening deterrence of potential regional adversaries, strategic stability vis-a-vis Russia and China, and assurance of our allies and partners.''. (4) The Secretary of Defense has warned in testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives regarding the sequestration mechanism under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 that ``if this sequester goes into effect and it doubles the number of cuts, then it'll truly devastate our national defense, because it will then require that we have to go at our force structure. We will have to hollow it out * * * [i]t will badly damage our capabilities for the future * * *. And if you have a smaller force, you're not going to be able to be out there responding in as many areas as we do now.''. (5) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review also stated that ``by modernizing our aging nuclear facilities and investing in human capital, we can substantially reduce the number of nuclear weapons we retain as a hedge.''. (6) The President requested the promised $7,600,000,000 for weapons activities of the National Nuclear Security Administration in fiscal year 2012 but signed an appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012 that provided only $7,233,997,000, a substantial reduction to only the second year of the ten-year plan under section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2549). (7) The President requested only $7,577,341,000 for weapons activities of the National Nuclear Security Administration in fiscal year 2013 while the President's section 1251 plan promised $7,900,000,000. (8) The President's section 1251 plan further promised to request $8,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2014, $8,700,000,000 in fiscal year 2015, $8,900,000,000 in fiscal year 2016, at least $8,900,000,000 in fiscal year 2017, at least $9,200,000,000 in fiscal year 2018, at least $9,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2019, at least $9,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2020, and at least $9,500,000,000 in fiscal year 2021. (9) While the administration has not yet shared with Congress the terms of reference of the so-called Nuclear Posture Review Implementation Study, or the Department of Defense's instructions for that review, the only publicly available statements by the administration, including language from the Nuclear Posture Review, suggest the review was specifically instructed by the President and his senior political appointees to only consider reductions to the nuclear forces of the United States. (10) When asked at a hearing if the New START Treaty allowed the United States ``to maintain a nuclear arsenal that is more than is needed to guarantee an adequate deterrent,'' then Commander of the United States Strategic Command, General Kevin P. Chilton said, ``I do not agree that it is more than is needed. I think the arsenal that we have is exactly what is needed today to provide the deterrent.''. (b) Nuclear Employment Strategy.--Section 491 of title 10, United States Code, as amended by section 1051, is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following: ``(c) Limitation.--With respect to a new nuclear weapons employment strategy described in a report submitted to Congress under subsection (a), none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense may be used to implement such strategy until a period of one year has elapsed following the date on which such report is submitted to Congress.''. (c) Limitation.--During each of fiscal years 2012 through 2021, none of the funds made available for each such fiscal year for the Department of Defense may be used to carry out the results of the decisions made pursuant to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Implementation Study that would alter the nuclear weapons employment strategy, guidance, plans, or options of the United States until the date on which the President certifies to the congressional defense committees that-- (1) the President has included the resources necessary to carry out the February 2011 update to the report required under section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2549) in the budget of the President submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for such fiscal year; (2) the resources described in paragraph (1) have been provided to the President in an appropriations Act; and (3) the sequestration mechanism under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 has been repealed or the sequestration mechanism under such section for the security category has otherwise been terminated. SEC. 1055. LIMITATION ON STRATEGIC DELIVERY SYSTEM REDUCTIONS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Nuclear Posture Review of 2010 said, with respect to modernizing the triad, ``for planned reductions under New START, the United States should retain a smaller Triad of SLBMs, ICBMs, and heavy bombers. Retaining all three Triad legs will best maintain strategic stability at reasonable cost, while hedging against potential technical problems or vulnerabilities.''. (2) The Senate stated in Declaration 13 of the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty that ``In accordance with paragraph 1 of Article V of the New START Treaty, which states that, `Subject to the provisions of this Treaty, modernization and replacement of strategic offensive arms may be carried out,' it is the sense of the Senate that United States deterrence and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States is committed to accomplishing the modernization and replacement of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring the continued flexibility of United States conventional and nuclear delivery systems.''. (3) The Senate required the President, prior to the entry into force of the New START Treaty, to certify to the Senate that the President intended to modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems. (4) The President made this certification in a message to the Senate on February 2, 2011, in which the President stated, ``I intend to (a) modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, an ICBM, and a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM; and (b) maintain the United States rocket motor industrial base.''. (b) Limitation.-- (1) In general.--Chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 1051, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 494. Strategic delivery system reductions ``(a) Annual Certification.--Beginning fiscal year 2013, the President shall annually certify in writing to the congressional defense committees whether plans to modernize or replace strategic delivery systems are fully resourced and being executed at a level equal to or more than the levels set forth in the November 2010 update to the plan referred to in section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2549), including plans regarding-- ``(1) a heavy bomber and air-launched missile; ballistic missile; ``(5) ``(A) the nuclear command and control system; and ``(B) the rocket motor industrial base of the United States. ``(b) Limitation.--If the President certifies under subsection (a) that plans to modernize or replace strategic delivery systems are not fully resourced or being executed, none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense may be used to reduce, convert, or eliminate strategic delivery systems, whether deployed or nondeployed, pursuant to the New START Treaty or otherwise until a period of 120 days has elapsed following the date on which such certification is made. ``(c) Exception.--The limitation in subsection (b) shall not apply to-- ``(1) reductions made to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear weapons stockpile and strategic delivery systems, including activities related to surveillance, assessment, certification, testing, and maintenance of nuclear warheads and delivery systems; or ``(2) strategic delivery systems that are retired or awaiting dismantlement on the date of the certification under subsection (a). ``(d) Definitions.--In this section: ``(1) The term `New START Treaty' means the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. ``(2) The term `strategic delivery system' means a delivery platform for nuclear weapons.''. (2) Clerical amendments.--The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is amended by adding at the end the following new item: ``494. Strategic delivery system reductions.''. SEC. 1056. PREVENTION OF ASYMMETRY OF NUCLEAR WEAPON STOCKPILE REDUCTIONS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned in 2008 that, ``There is no way to ignore efforts by rogue states such as North Korea and Iran to develop and deploy nuclear weapons or Russian or Chinese strategic modernization programs. To be sure, we do not consider Russia or China as adversaries, but we cannot ignore these developments and the implications they have for our national security.''. (2) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that, ``large disparities in nuclear capabilities could raise concerns on both sides and among United States allies and partners, and may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic relationship, especially as nuclear forces are significantly reduced.''. (3) The Senate stated in the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty that, ``It is the sense of the Senate that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the New START Treaty, the President should regulate reductions in United States strategic offensive arms so that the number of accountable strategic offensive arms under the New START Treaty possessed by the Russian Federation in no case exceeds the comparable number of accountable strategic offensive arms possessed by the United States to such an extent that a strategic imbalance endangers the national security interests of the United States.''. (4) At a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives in 2011, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said, with respect to unilateral nuclear reductions by the United States, ``I don't think we ought to do that unilaterally--we ought to do that on the basis of negotiations with the Russians and others to make sure we are all walking the same path.''. (b) Certification.--Section 1045 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (50 U.S.C. 2523b) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(d) Prevention of Asymmetry in Reductions.-- ``(1) Certification.--During any year in which the President recommends to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpiles of the United States by a number that is greater than one percent of the number of nuclear weapons in such stockpiles, the President shall certify in writing to the congressional defense committees whether such reductions will cause the number of nuclear weapons in such stockpiles to be fewer than the number of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpiles of the Russian Federation. ``(2) Limitation.--If the President certifies under paragraph (1) that the recommended number of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpiles of the United States is fewer than the number of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpiles of the Russian Federation, none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the National Nuclear Security Administration may be used to carry out any reduction to such stockpiles of the United States until-- ``(A) after the date on which such certification is made, the President transmits to the congressional defense committees a report by the Commander of the United States Strategic Command, without change, detailing whether the recommended reduction would create a strategic imbalance between the total nuclear forces of the United States and the total nuclear forces of the Russian Federation; and ``(B) a period of 180 days has elapsed following the date on which such report is transmitted. ``(3) Exception.--The limitation in paragraph (2) shall not apply to-- ``(A) reductions made to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear weapons stockpile and strategic delivery systems, including activities related to surveillance, assessment, certification, testing, and maintenance of nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems; or ``(B) nuclear warheads that are retired or awaiting dismantlement on the date of the certification under paragraph (1).''. SEC. 1057. CONSIDERATION OF EXPANSION OF NUCLEAR FORCES OF OTHER COUNTRIES. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty of the Senate said, ``It is the sense of the Senate that if, during the time the New START Treaty remains in force, the President determines that there has been an expansion of the strategic arsenal of any country not party to the New START Treaty so as to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the Senate to determine whether adherence to the New START Treaty remains in the national interest of the United States.''. (2) In 2011, experts testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives that-- (A) ``Russia is modernizing every leg of its nuclear triad with new, more advanced systems'', including new ballistic missile submarines, new heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying up to 15 warheads each, new shorter range ballistic missiles, and new low-yield warheads; and (B) ``China is steadily increasing the numbers and capabilities of the ballistic missiles it deploys and is upgrading older ICBMs to newer, more advanced systems. China also appears to be actively working to develop a submarine-based nuclear deterrent force, something it has never had * * *. A recent unclassified Department of Defense report says that this network of tunnels could be in excess of 5,000 kilometers and is used to transport nuclear weapons and forces.''. (b) Report and Certification.-- (1) In general.--Chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 1051, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 495. Consideration of expansion of nuclear forces of other countries ``(a) Report and Certification.--During any year in which the President recommends any reductions in the nuclear forces of the United States, none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the National Nuclear Security Administration may be used for such recommended reduction until the date on which-- ``(1) the President transmits to the appropriate congressional committees a report detailing, for each country with nuclear weapons-- ``(A) the number of each type of nuclear weapons possessed by such country; ``(B) the modernization plans for such weapons of such country; ``(C) the production capacity of nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems (as defined in section 491(c) of this title) of such country; and ``(D) the nuclear doctrine of such country; and ``(2) the Commander of the United States Strategic Command certifies to the appropriate congressional committees whether such recommended reductions in the nuclear forces of the United States will-- ``(A) impair the ability of the United States to address-- ``(i) unplanned strategic or geopolitical events; or ``(ii) technical challenge; or ``(B) degrade the deterrence or assurance provided by the United States to friends and allies of the United States. ``(b) Form.--The reports required by subsection (a)(1) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex. ``(c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, the term `appropriate congressional committees' means the following: ``(1) The congressional defense committees. ``(2) The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.''. (2) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 494 the following new item: ``495. Consideration of expansion of nuclear forces of other countries.''. SEC. 1058. CHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY RESEARCH REPLACEMENT NUCLEAR FACILITY AND URANIUM PROCESSING FACILITY. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Administrator for Nuclear Security Thomas D'Agostino testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives in February 2008 that ``Infrastructure improvements are a major part of the complex transformation plan that we have, and we've made important progress, but we have a lot more to do. Some major facilities that we have date back to World War II and cannot readily meet today's safety and security requirements. Let me give you just two quick examples, if I could. A sufficient capability to work with plutonium is an essential part of a national security enterprise and is required for as long as we retain a nuclear deterrent, and most likely even longer. Currently, we have a very small production capacity at Los Alamos, about 10 pits per year, at our TA-55 area. Our building at Los Alamos, the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility, is well over 50 years old and is insufficient to support the national security requirements for the stockpile and for future national security mission areas. So, whether we continue on our existing path or move towards a replacement modern warhead-type stockpile, we still need the capacity to produce about 50 to 80 pits per year, which is less than one-tenth of our Cold War level, as well as the ability to carry out pit surveillance, which is an essential part of maintaining our stockpile.''. (2) Then Commander of the United States Strategic Command General Kevin P. Chilton also testified in February 2008 that ``When you have a responsive complex that has the capacity to flex to production as you may need it or adjust your deployed force posture in the future, should you need it--in other words, if we go to a lower number, you need to be certain that you can come back up, should the strategic environment change, and you can't necessarily without that flexible or responsive infrastructure behind it, and that's probably one of my great concerns. And then how you posture both the portion of your stockpile that you hold in reserve and your confidence in the weapons that you have deployed is very much a function of modernizing, in my view, the weapons systems that we have available today, which are, as the secretary described, of Cold War legacy design, and the associated issues with them.''. (3) The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States reported in May 2009, with respect to the timing of the replacement of the nuclear weapons infrastructure of the United States, that ``This raises an obvious question about whether these two replacement programs might proceed in sequence rather than concurrently. There are strong arguments for moving forward concurrently. Existing facilities are genuinely decrepit and are maintained in a safe and secure manner only at high cost. Moreover, the improved production capabilities they promise are integral to the program of refurbishment and modernization described in the preceding chapter. If funding can be found for both, this would best serve the national interest in maintaining a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile of weapons in the most effective and efficient manner.''. (4) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review states-- (A) ``The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in close coordination with DoD, will provide a new stockpile stewardship and management plan to Congress within 90 days, consistent with the increases in infrastructure investment requested in the President's FY 2011 budget. As critical infrastructure is restored and modernized, it will allow the United States to begin to shift away from retaining large numbers of non-deployed warheads as a technical hedge, allowing additional reductions in the United States stockpile of non-deployed nuclear weapons over time.''; (B) ``In order to sustain a safe, secure, and effective United States nuclear stockpile as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States must possess a modern physical infrastructure--comprised of the national security laboratories and a complex of supporting facilities.''; (C) ``Funding the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory to replace the existing 50-year old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility in 2021.''; (D) ``Developing a new Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee to come on line for production operations in 2021.''; (E) ``Without an ability to produce uranium components, any plan to sustain the stockpile, as well as support for our Navy nuclear propulsion, will come to a halt. This would have a significant impact, not just on the weapons program, but in dealing with nuclear dangers of many kinds.''; and (F) ``The non-deployed stockpile currently includes more warheads than required for the above purposes, due to the limited capacity of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) complex to conduct LEPs for deployed weapons in a timely manner. Progress in restoring NNSA's production infrastructure will allow these excess warheads to be retired along with other stockpile reductions planned over the next decade.''. (5) In the memorandum of agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy concerning the modernization of the nuclear weapon stockpile of the United States dated May 3, 2010, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu agreed that ``DOE Agrees to * * * increase pit production capacity * * * plan and program to ramp up to a minimum of 50-80 PPY in 2022.''. (6) The plan required under section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111- 84; 123 Stat. 2549) submitted by the President states that the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility will complete construction by 2021 and will achieve full operational functionality by 2024. (7) The Senate required that, prior to the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President certifies to the Senate that the President intends to-- (A) accelerate to the extent possible the design and engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility; and (B) request full funding, including on a multiyear basis as appropriate, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon completion of the design and engineering phase for such facilities. (8) The President did request full funding for such facilities on February 2, 2011, when the President stated, ``I intend to (a) accelerate, to the extent possible, the design and engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF); and (b) request full funding, including on a multi-year basis as appropriate, for the CMRR building and the UPF upon completion of the design and engineering phase for such facilities.''. (b) Limitation.--Section 1045 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (50 U.S.C. 2523b), as amended by section 1056(b), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(e) CMRR and UPF.-- ``(1) Annual certification.--Beginning fiscal year 2013, the President shall annually certify in writing to the congressional defense committees whether-- ``(A) the construction of both the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility will be completed by not later than 2021; and ``(B) both facilities will be fully operational by not later than 2024. ``(2) Limitation.--If the President certifies under paragraph (1) that the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility will be completed by later than 2021 or be fully operational by later than 2024, none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the National Nuclear Security Administration may be used to reduce the nondeployed nuclear warheads in the nuclear weapons stockpile of the United States until a period of 120 days has elapsed following the date of such certification. ``(3) Exception.--The limitation in paragraph (2) shall not apply to-- ``(A) reductions made to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear weapons stockpile and delivery systems, including activities related to surveillance, assessment, certification, testing, and maintenance of nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems; or ``(B) nuclear warheads that are retired or awaiting dismantlement on the date of the certification under paragraph (1). ``(4) Termination.--The requirement in paragraph (1) shall terminate on the date on which the President certifies in writing to the congressional defense committees that the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility are both fully operational.''. SEC. 1059. NUCLEAR WARHEADS ON INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES OF THE UNITED STATES. (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that reducing the number of nuclear warheads contained on each intercontinental ballistic missile of the United States does not promote strategic stability if at the same time other nuclear weapons states, including the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, are rapidly increasing the warhead-loading of their land-based missile forces. (b) Limitation.-- (1) In general.--Chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 1051, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 496. Nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United States ``(a) In General.--During any year in which the President proposes to reduce the number of nuclear warheads contained on an intercontinental ballistic missile of the United States, none of the funds made available for fiscal year 2012 or any fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the National Nuclear Security Administration may be used for such proposed reduction if the reduction results in such missile having only a single nuclear warhead unless the President certifies in writing to the congressional defense committees that the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China are both also carrying out a similar reduction. ``(b) Exception.--The limitation in subsection (a) shall not apply to reductions made to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear weapons stockpile and delivery systems, including activities related to surveillance, assessment, certification, testing, and maintenance of nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems.''. (2) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 495 the following: ``496. Nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United States.''. SEC. 1060. NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPON REDUCTIONS AND EXTENDED DETERRENCE POLICY. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The NATO Strategic Concept of 2010 endorsed the continued role of nuclear weapons in the security of the NATO alliance, stating-- (A) ``The supreme guarantee of the security of the Allies is provided by the strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States; the independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France, which have a deterrent role of their own, contribute to the overall deterrence and security of the Allies.''; (B) ``We will ensure that NATO has the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our populations. Therefore, we will * * * maintain an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces''; and (C) ``[NATO will] ensure the broadest possible participation of Allies in collective defence planning on nuclear roles, in peacetime basing of nuclear forces, and in command, control and consultation arrangements.''. (2) However, the 2010 Strategic Concept also walked away from the decades-long policy encapsulated by the 1999 Strategic Concept that said, ``The presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remains vital to the security of Europe, which is inseparably linked to that of North America.''. (3) Former Secretary of Defense William Perry said in March 2011 testimony before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives that ``the reason we have nuclear weapons in Europe in the first place, is not because the rest of our weapons are not capable of deterrence, but because, during the Cold War at least, our allies in Europe felt more assured when we had nuclear weapons in Europe. That is why they were deployed there in the first place. Today the issue is a little different. The issue is the Russians in the meantime have built a large number of nuclear weapons, and we keep our nuclear weapons there as somewhat of a political leverage for dealing with an ultimate treaty in which we may get Russia and the United States to eliminate tactical nuclear weapons. My own view is it would be desirable if both the United States and Russia would eliminate tactical nuclear weapons, but I see it as very difficult to arrive at that conclusion if we were to simply eliminate all of our tactical nuclear weapons unilaterally.''. (4) During testimony before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives in July 2011-- (A) former Department of Defense official Frank Miller stated, ``as long as United States allies believe that those weapons need to be there, we need to make sure that we provide that security.''; and (B) former Department of Defense official Mort Halperin stated, ``I do not think we should be willing to trade our withdrawal of our nuclear weapons from Europe for some reduction, even a substantial reduction, in Russian tactical nuclear weapons because if it is * * * that the credibility of the American nuclear deterrent for our NATO allies depends on the presence of nuclear weapons in Europe, that will not change if the Russians cut their tactical nuclear arsenal by two thirds, or even eliminate it because they will still have their strategic weapons, which, while they can't have intermediate range missiles, they can find a way to target them on the NATO countries.''. (5) Section 1237(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) expressed the sense of Congress that-- (A) the commitment of the United States to extended deterrence in Europe and the nuclear alliance of NATO is an important component of ensuring and linking the national security of the United States and its European allies; (B) the nuclear forces of the United States are a key component of the NATO nuclear alliance; and (C) the presence of the nuclear weapons of the United States in Europe--combined with NATO's unique nuclear sharing arrangements under which non-nuclear members participate in nuclear planning and possess specially configured aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons--provides reassurance to NATO allies who feel exposed to regional threats. (b) Limitation.--Chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 1051, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 497. Limitation on reduction, consolidation, or withdrawal of nuclear forces based in Europe ``(a) Policy on Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons.--It is the policy of the United States-- ``(1) to pursue negotiations with the Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed and nondeployed, nonstrategic nuclear forces; ``(2) that nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be considered when weighing the balance of the nuclear forces of the United States and the Russian Federation; ``(3) that any geographical relocation or storage of nonstrategic nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation does not constitute a reduction or elimination of such weapons; ``(4) the vast advantage of the Russian Federation in nonstrategic nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to the United States and its allies and a growing asymmetry in Western Europe; and ``(5) the forward-deployed nuclear forces of the United States are an important contributor to the assurance of the allies of the United States and constitute a check on proliferation and a tool in dealing with neighboring states hostile to NATO. ``(b) Policy on Extended Deterrence Commitment to Europe.--It is the policy of the United States that-- ``(1) it maintain its commitment to extended deterrence, specifically the nuclear alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as an important component of ensuring and linking the national security interests of the United States and the security of its European allies;

SEC. 1085. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HONORS. (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following: (1) The spread of warfare across Europe and Asia led to the establishment on May 20, 1941, of the United States Office of Civilian Defense by Executive Order No. 8757 of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to ``assure effective coordination of Federal relations with State and local governments engaged in defense activities, to provide for necessary cooperation with States and local governments in respect to measures for adequate protection of the civilian population in emergency periods, to facilitate constructive civilian participation in the defense program, and to sustain national morale''. (2) The December 7, 1941, attack by the Empire of Japan on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, precipitated the entry of the United States into the worldwide conflict and signaled a new era of warfare that demanded new efforts to protect the people of the United States from airborne assault by an overseas enemy. (3) In response to this new threat, the United States Office of Civilian Defense mobilized millions of volunteers to participate in efforts to enhance the preparedness of the United States in case of attack, including fire protection, communication and logistics, construction of bomb shelters, and air raid blackout drills. (4) Thousands of Americans unable to serve in the United States Armed Forces volunteered their service as Air Raid Wardens in communities across the United States during World War II, contributing to America's defense against potential enemy assault and the ultimate victory of the Allied nation. (5) A training manual distributed to Air Raid Wardens during World War II noted that ``In the system of civilian defense, the Air Raid Warden occupies the key position. He is the field officer under whose supervision the efforts of the civilian population are directed in the tremendous task of effective defense. Through the Air Raid Wardens, civilian activity is coordinated with that of the police and fire departments and other vital services.''. (6) Training manuals distributed to Air Raid Wardens included ``I am an Air Raid Warden'', by Frank W. Atherton, Chief Air Raid Warden, 1st District, United States Citizens' Defense Corps of Michigan, which read, in part that ``I am an Air Raid Warden. My country, my state and my community have given me many pleasant and fruitful years and now in time of trouble I feel that it is my duty to do my part in the work assigned to me in helping to reduce to a minimum any harm that may come from without or within.''. (7) Tony Pastor and His Orchestra released a song in 1942, titled ``Obey Your Air Raid Warden'', which was widely distributed as a public service announcement and contained the following lyrics: ``One, be calm. Two, get under shelter. Three, don't run. Obey your air-raid warden. Four, stay home. Five, keep off the highway. Six, don't phone. Obey your air- raid warden. There are rules that you should know, What to do and where to go, When you hear the sirens blow, Stop, look, and listen. Seven, don't smoke. Eight, help all the kiddies. Most of all, obey your air-raid warden. Stop, look, and listen. Dim the lights, Wait for information, Most of all, obey your air- raid warden. Stop the panic, Don't get in a huff, Our aim today is to call their bluff. Follow these rules and that is enough. Obey your air-raid warden.''.

SEC. 1093. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESERVATION OF SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL STATIONED OR RESIDING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. (2) Approximately 40,000 servicemen and women across all branches of the Armed Forces either live in or are stationed on active duty within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Unless these individuals are granted a waiver as serving in a law enforcement role, they are subject to the District of Columbia's onerous and highly restrictive laws on the possession of firearms. (3) Military personnel, despite being extensively trained in the proper and safe use of firearms, are therefore deprived by the laws of the District of Columbia of handguns, rifles, and shotguns that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their persons, homes, businesses, and families. (4) The District of Columbia has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to previous local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding persons who would have otherwise been able to defend themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and businesses. (5) The Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, provide comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local laws that only affect and disarm law-abiding citizens. (6) On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, and thus ruled that the District of Columbia's handgun ban and requirements that rifles and shotguns in the home be kept unloaded and disassembled or outfitted with a trigger lock to be unconstitutional. (7) On July 16, 2008, the District of Columbia enacted the Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 (D.C. Act 17- 422; 55 DCR 8237), which places onerous restrictions on the ability of law-abiding citizens from possessing firearms, thus violating the spirit by which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller. (8) On February 26, 2009, the United States Senate adopted an amendment on a bipartisan vote of 62-36 by Senator John Ensign to S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, which would fully restore Second Amendment rights to the citizens of the District of Columbia. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that active duty military personnel who are stationed or residing in the District of Columbia should be permitted to exercise fully their rights under the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and therefore should be exempt from the District of Columbia's restrictions on the possession of firearms.

SEC. 1214. PROHIBITION ON USE OF PRIVATE SECURITY CONTRACTORS AND MEMBERS OF THE AFGHAN PUBLIC PROTECTION FORCE TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND FACILITIES IN AFGHANISTAN. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the Department of Defense, as of February 1, 2012, there had been 42 insider attacks on coalition forces since 2007 by the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, or Afghan nationals hired by private security contractors to guard United States bases and facilities in Afghanistan. (2) The Department of Defense data shows that the trend of insider attacks is increasing. (3) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States continue to be garrisoned and housed in facilities and installations in Afghanistan that are guarded by private security contractors and not by United States or coalition forces. (4) President Karzai has prohibited the use of private security contractors in Afghanistan and determined that beginning in March, 2012, the Afghan Ministry of Interior will provide Afghan Public Protection Forces on a reimbursable basis to those desiring to contract for additional security. (5) The Afghan Ministry of Interior will have the primary responsibility for screening and vetting the Afghan nationals who will comprise the Afghan Public Protection Force. (6) The current force levels in Afghanistan are necessary to accomplish the International Security Assistance Force mission and force protection for members of the Armed Forces garrisoned and housed in Afghanistan should not come at the expense of mission success. (7) The President of the United States has begun to draw down United States military forces in Afghanistan and has committed to continue this drawdown through 2014. (8) The redeployment phase of any military operation brings increasing vulnerabilities to members of the Armed Forces. (9) It is the responsibility of the Commander in Chief to provide for the security for members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan and to mitigate internal threats to such forces to the greatest extent possible, while continuing to meet the objectives of the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, including the training and equipping of the Afghan National Security Forces in order that they may provide for their own security. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the best security and force protection for members of the Armed Forces garrisoned and housed in Afghanistan should be provided; (2) better security and force protection for members of the Armed Forces garrisoned and housed in Afghanistan can be provided by United States military personnel than private security contractors or members of the Afghan Public Protection Force; (3) the President should take action in light of the increased risk to members of the Armed Forces during this transitional period in Afghanistan and the increasing number of insider attacks; and (4) the United States remains committed to mission success in Afghanistan in light of the national security interests in the region and the sacrifice and commitment of the United States Armed Forces over the last ten years. (c) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding section 2465 of title 10, United States Code, funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be obligated or expended for the purpose of-- (1) entering into a contract for the performance of security-guard functions at a military installation or facility in Afghanistan at which members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan are garrisoned or housed; (2) otherwise employing private security contractors to provide security for members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan; or (3) employing the Afghan Public Protection Force to provide security for such members or to perform such security-guard functions at such a military installation or facility. (d) Requirement.-- (1) In general.--The President shall ensure that as many appropriately trained members of the Armed Forces of the United States as are necessary are available to-- (A) perform security-guard functions at all military installations and facilities in Afghanistan at which members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan are garrisoned or housed; (B) provide security for members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan; and (C) provide adequate counterintelligence support for such members. (2) Relationship to other requirements and limitations.-- The members of the Armed Forces required to be made available under paragraph (1) shall be in addition to-- (A) the number of such members who are deployed to Afghanistan to support the requirements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission in Afghanistan and the military campaign plan of the Commander of the International Security and Assistance Force; and (B) any limitation on force levels that may be in effect. (e) Waiver.--The President may waive the prohibition under subsection (c) and the requirement under subsection (d) if the President submits to Congress a certification in writing that-- (1) the use of private security contractors or the Afghan Public Protection Force can provide a level of security and force protection for members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan that is at least equal to the security and force protection that can be provided by members of the Armed Forces; and (2) the Secretary of Defense has ensured that all employees of private security contractors and members of the Afghan Public Protection Force providing security or force protection for members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan are independently screened and vetted by members of the Armed Forces of the United States. (f) Report.-- (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the end of each quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2014, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the following: (A) Data on attempted and successful attacks by the Afghan National Security Forces, the Afghan Public Protection Force, and private security contractors on United States Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense. (B) The number of members of the United States Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense wounded or killed due to such attacks. (C) A description of tactical or covert methods used in such attacks and a description of motivations for such attacks. (2) Additional information.--The first report submitted following the date of the enactment of this Act and the report submitted for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 shall also include the following: (A) Actions the Department of Defense is taking to monitor indicators and early warning signs of infiltration or co-option of the Afghan National Security Forces, the Afghan Public Protection Force, and private security contractors. (B) The methodology and systematic approach to resolving disputes between the Afghan National Security Forces and United States Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense when such disputes arise.

Subtitle C--Matters Relating to Iran SEC. 1221. DECLARATION OF POLICY. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Iran, which has long sought to foment instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, is now seeking to exploit the dramatic political transition underway in the region to undermine governments traditionally aligned with the United States and support extremist political movements in these countries. (2) At the same time, Iran may soon attain a nuclear weapons capability, a development that would threaten United States interests, destabilize the region, encourage regional nuclear proliferation, further empower and embolden Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and provide it the tools to threaten its neighbors, including Israel. (3) With the assistance of Iran over the past several years, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas have increased their stockpiles of rockets, with more than 60,000 rockets now ready to be fired at Israel. Iran continues to add to its arsenal of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region. (4) Preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is among the most urgent national security challenges facing the United States. (5) Successive United States administrations have stated that an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. (6) President Obama stated on January 24, 2012, ``Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.''. (7) In order to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, the United States, in cooperation with its allies, must utilize all elements of national power including diplomacy, robust economic sanctions, and credible, visible preparations for a military option. (8) Nevertheless, to date, diplomatic overtures, sanctions, and other non-kinetic actions toward Iran have not caused the Government of Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. (9) With the impact of additional sanctions uncertain, additional pressure on the Government of Iran could come from the credible threat of military action against Iran's nuclear program. (b) Declaration of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States to take all necessary measures, including military action if required, to prevent Iran from threatening the United States, its allies, or Iran's neighbors with a nuclear weapon. SEC. 1222. UNITED STATES MILITARY PREPAREDNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

(b) Plan.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall prepare a plan to augment the presence of the United States Fifth Fleet in the Middle East and to conduct military deployments, exercises, or other visible, concrete military readiness activities to underscore the policy of the United States described in section 1221(b).
