If there's one thing we've learned, it's that germs are everywhere. And after being away for a while, your immune system may be more at risk than ever. After finally getting the chance to talk to your peers without buffering issues, the last thing you want to do is be sent right back home again with a cold or the flu. So how can you protect yourself? Let's talk about some ways to boost your immune system as you and your family go back to school and work. Set Healthy Boundaries Everyone is going to have a different idea of which activities are safe and healthy...and which are not. It's important to communicate to other people what your boundaries are. Refusing a handshake at the office may have been taboo two years ago, but now it's unlikely that anyone will bat an eye if you prefer an elbow bump or a friendly wave hello. Don't be shy about telling classmates or coworkers what you're comfortable with--your health is worth it! Stay Hydrated Sometimes it feels like hydration is the answer to everything. Drink more water: it will give you more energy! It will cure your headaches! It will clear your acne! But unlike the latest fad diet, drinking water actually lives up to the hype. Getting enough H2O helps your body better absorb nutrients, regulates your body temperature, improves your circulation, and more. All of these functions are beneficial for your immune system and overall health. So as you're making your back-to-school checklist, don't forget to add a reusable water bottle! Maintain a Healthy(ish) Diet For a great way to help boost your immune system, look no further than the produce aisle of your grocery store. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables is an important part of any healthy diet and can also help keep you feeling your best during cold and flu season. In particular, veggies like broccoli and spinach are full of antioxidants, which are thought to help the body fight infections. For a burst of vitamin C, you may immediately reach for an orange, but did you know that red bell peppers actually contain three times the amount of that immune-boosting vitamin? While some fruits and veggies have more of certain vitamins than others though, what is most important is finding ones that you love and making them a consistent part of your diet. Turns out an apple a day (or a pear, or some green beans, or carrot sticks) really does help keep the doctor away! But don't worry. We won't tattle on you if you eat that occasional slice of cake. Everything in moderation, right? Kick Stress to the Curb School and work are often stressful environments. Sometimes, that stress is a good thing. It can motivate you and help you rush to meet an important deadline or cram last-minute for a test. Too much stress, though, will start to take a negative toll on your immune system. And if your immune system is weak, you may get sick. And if you get sick, you may miss class, and if you miss class, you may get even more stressed, and if you get more stressed . . . well, things can get out of hand, fast. But no need to panic--there are lots of ways to break the stress cycle. Anything from meditating to practicing your favorite instrument to playing with your pooch can help! It may be tempting to spend all your free time being \"productive\", but you'll actually be better off in the long run if you take some time to de-stress and let your body recover. Get Outside and Sweat Speaking of kicking stress to the curb, exercising can work wonders for your stress levels and your immune system. The best part? You don't even have to go full P90X to get the benefits! [Studies show](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080104123421.htm) that moderate exercise, like a brisk walk, water aerobics, or some doubles tennis, can improve how your body responds to illness. For an even bigger boost to your immune system, try exercising outdoors. You'll be able to get your heart rate up while also enjoying some fresh air and soaking up some vitamin D, which, you guessed it, can also strengthen your immune system! Take the Right Supplements Natural medicine has been around for thousands of years for a reason. While they can't cure or prevent disease, supplements that use natural ingredients can be a beneficial addition to your immune-boosting regimen. European Elderberry extract, for example, can increase the response of your immune system, which may reduce your symptoms when you're sick, or decrease the amount of time that you stay sick. A [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/) found this to be true in a clinical trial of air travelers, which is good news for those of us flying for the first time in over a year! Olive leaf extract has antimicrobial properties, so researchers believe it might help stop germs from spreading and multiplying. Products of the olive tree are [well-known to promote overall good health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227229/) Structured Silver Water, [according to a 2007 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17651227/), demonstrates unique bacteria-fighting qualities. In their research, it stopped most bacterial growth 24 hours after application. That's why all 3 products in our [TriGuard Cold & Flu Pack](https://www.oxygennutrition.com/collections/bacteria-infection-supplements/products/triguard-plus-cold-flu-pack) contain our signature OLE-100\u00ae Complex\u2014a unique blend of these powerful natural ingredients.
