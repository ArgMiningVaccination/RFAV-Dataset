FACULTY GUIDE 3 ABOUT MODULE 3 This module is part of the Alzheimer's Association curriculum, A Public Health Approach to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias . Developed as part of a cooperative agreement with CDC's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program, and in partnership with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, this curriculum addresses cognitive health, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and is for use by undergraduate faculty in schools and programs of public health and other related disciplines . It can also be adapted for other purposes. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? briefly describes the Alzheimer's disease epidemic in the U.S., followed by a discussion of four tools of public health that may play significant role s in mitigating the Alzheimer's disease crisis. The four public health intervention tools discussed are: 1. Surveillance/monitoring 2. Primary prevention 3. Early detection and diagnosis 4. Ensur ing safety and quality of care Each tool is described and applied to the context of a public health response to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Progress to date and challenges associated with each tool are addressed. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? students will be able to: List four key tools public health can apply to the Alzheimer's epidemic Describe surveillance/monitoring and how public health practitioners can apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease Name the two Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS) modules that pertain to cognitive decline and caregiving Describe primary prevention and how public health practitioners may apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease Explain why it is important to promote early d etection of Alzheimer's disease Summarize one workforce challenge that affects the safety and quality of care for people living with dementia Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health?

FACULTY GUIDE 10 SLIDE 3: Introduction: Dementia & Alzheimer's Disease1 Dementia is a decline in mental abilit y that interfere s with daily life Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia o Progressive loss of memory and brain function o Requires increasing aid and assistance o No cure and limited treatment options Huge financial and emotional burden Public health plays important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease TALKING POINTS: Before we begin discussing the role of public health in addressing Alzheimer's disease, it may be helpful to know a little more about Alzheimer's and dementia. The term dementia is a general term for a decline in mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia, which is not a disease but a syndrome, is characterized by damage to brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases , heredity , or a combination of factors . There are several types of dementia and most occur in those over 65; however, there are types of dementia that occur in those younger than 65. The term Alzheimer's dementia is used to describe the stage of Alzheimer's disease when an individual has observable symptoms such as memory loss, mood/behavior changes, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's is a disease that progressively 1 Alzheimer's Associa tion. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 11 damages and eventually destroys brain cells over the course of many years , even decades . There is no cure for Alzheimer's. While there are approved drug treatments , the goal of existing treatment is to delay or reduce symptoms, not to cure or reverse the course of the disease. As the person with Alzheimer's loses memory and function, caregivers , who are most often family members, are needed to provide inc reasing amounts of assistance. This assistance can range from helping to manage finances and household tasks to hands -on care, such as bathing, dressing, feeding , and o ther activities of daily living. Given the nature of the disease and its increasing prevalence, there is a huge financial, emotional and physical impact on people with Alzheimer's, their families, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole. Public health plays an important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease through surveillance, prevention, detection, and support of dementia -capable systems. In this presentation, we will be focusing on the role of public health. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 12 SLIDE 4: Alzheimer's: A Public Health Crisis Historically viewed as a medical or aging issue Growing recognition of public health crisis: o Large and growing epidemic o Significant impact o Ways to intervene TALKING POINTS: Historically, Alzheimer's and other dementia s have been viewed primarily as medical or aging issue s. Yet as more is learned about these conditions and the impact they are having on society, there is a strong recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as issues in which public health has an important role to play. Alzheimer's disease is a public health crisis because : The epidemic is large and growing The impact on populations and communities is substantial There are ways to intervene using a public health approach to achieve meaningful improvements in health ou tcomes Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 13 SLIDE 5: Alzheimer's: Epidemic (U.S.)2 Nearly 6 million adults 1 in 10 adults age 65 1 in 3 adults age 8 5 By 2050, expected to reach 13.8 million TALKING POINTS: Today, nearly 6 million adults in the U .S. are living with Alzheimer's , including an estimated 200,000 under the age of 65. One in ten adults age 65 and older (10%) currently has Alzheimer's disease; approximately one in three people age 8 5 and older have the disease. By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to total 13.8 million and could be as high as 16 million . 2 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 14 SLIDE 6: Alzheimer's Impact: Costs3 Significant costs to Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, caregivers Annual costs of care nearly $300 billion Most expensive disease in the U.S. TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's imposes significant costs on federal and state budgets t hrough Medicare and Medicaid, as well as on individuals, families, and caregivers. In the U.S. the annual costs of direct care for people with Alzheimer's disease is nearly $300 billion . \"Direct care\" includes both paid health care and long -term care. It does not include caregiving (an essential part of Alzheimer's care). Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease to treat and provide care for in America, costing more than heart disease and cancer. 3 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 15 SLIDE 7: Alzheimer's: Disproportional Impact4 Women: 2/3 of affected population African -Americans: 2 times more likely Hispanics: 1.5 times more likely TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's dementia disproportionately impacts women and minority populations . Women make up 2/3 of the population with Alzheimer's . In the U.S., African -Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than whites . Available data indicate that in the United States, older African -Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's and other dementias. Older Hispanics are about one and one -half times more likely than older whites to have these conditions. 4 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures.

FACULTY GUIDE 16 SLIDE 8: Alzheimer's: Caregiving Burden5 Requires increasing levels of caregiving (paid and unpaid) Over 16 million caregivers 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually Hardships: health, emotional, financial TALKING POINTS: Living with Alzheimer's disease requires increasing levels of caregiving (paid and unpaid) as the disease progresses. Later stages may require constant supervision and involve complete de pendence on caregivers. Currently, it is estimated that over 16 million family members and friends provide nearly 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually. Financially, these contributions are valued at over $230 billion . As a result of their role in caring for someone with Alzheimer's, c aregivers often face significant hardships related to their own health, emotional wellbeing, and financial stability. 5 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 17 SLIDE 9: Alzheimer's: Health Care Burden6 Disproportionate use of health care resources o Hospitalized twice as often o 7 in 10 residents in assisted living have some form of cognitive impairment Workforce shortage Inadequate professional training TALKING POINTS: The burden of Alzheimer's and other dementias on the health care system is significant. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease use a disproportionate amount of health care resources. For example, they have twice as many hospitalizations than older adults without the disease. In addition, nearly 7 in 10 of residents in assisted living facilities have some sort of cognitive impairment. Many people with Alzheimer's and other dementias receive care in their home or a loved one's home as long as possible before entering an assisted living or nursing home . Care is most often provi ded by family members or paid home care workers . With the growing number of older adults in the U.S. population (both with and without Alzheimer's and other dementias ), the country is facing a workforce shortage of health care and home care professionals who are trained to meet the needs of older adults. Many professionals already in the workforce are not adequately trained on the needs of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. 6 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

FACULTY GUIDE 19 SLIDE 11: Public Health Impact : SURVEILLANCE & MONITORING TALKING POINTS : Public health s urveillance and monitoring involve collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health -related data within a population. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 20 SLIDE 12: Surveillance & Public Health8 Compile data on a population level, including: o Prevalence of certain diseases o Health risk factors o Health behaviors o Burden of diseases State-level data on Alzheimer's and dementia growing ; yet data gaps remain TALKING POINTS: Public health surveillance is the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data that informs planning, implementation , and evaluation of public health practice , policies, and programs. Surveillance activities are done at the federal, state , and local levels. Surveillance is used to compile data on a population level, including: The prevalence of certain diseases to understand how common or widespread they are Health risk factors (such as tobacco use, high blood pressure, and overweight/obesity) Health behaviors (such as nutrition and physical activity) Burden of particular diseases and conditions (such as financial costs, mortality, and morbidity) Developing effective responses to the Alzheimer's epidemic necessitates understanding how Alzheimer's and dementia impact states and co mmunities. As it relates to Alzheimer's and other dementias, t he availability of state -level data is growing, but gaps remain regarding prevalence and impact of cognitive decline as well as roles and impact on caregivers of those with dementia . 8 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 21 SLIDE 13: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS )9 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) - CDC o Health -related risk behaviors o Chronic health conditions o Use of preventive services State -based data Cognitive Decline module , Caregiver module TALKING POINTS: In the U.S., state -based data on health- related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services is collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . The BRFSS is the nation's premier system for collecting data on health -related risk behaviors, chronic conditions and use of preventive services. The survey is conducted by telephone and is collected at the state level by all 50 states and U .S. territories. It is a partnership between the Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. The survey is conducted by state health departments and is comprised of core component questions, optional modules and state -based questions. CDC has developed two BRFSS modules that allow states to collect data on the prevalence of and impact on those experiencing cognitive decline as well as provide insight into the role and challenges faced by caregivers. The two BRFSS modules are the Cognitive Decline module and the Caregiver module . 9 Centers for D isease Control and Prevention. (2014 ) About BRFSS .

FACULTY GUIDE 29 SLIDE 21: Primary Prevention17 Designed to prevent a disease or condition from developing in a population Causes of Alzheimer's not fully understood Primary prevention for Alzheimer's: o Risk reduction o Promotion of cognitive health TALKING POINTS: An important role of public health is promoting primary prevention which is intervening before health effects can occur . Common examples of primary prevention in public health include regular physical activity to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease , vaccination against infectious diseases , bike helmet laws, and anti -tobacco use campaigns . Secondary and tertiary prevention refer to identifying and managing a disease or condition at its earliest stage, and minimizing or reducing complications of or disability resulting from a disease or injury , respectively. Research hasn't yet revealed the exact causes of Alzheimer's in most people . However, a growing base of evidence suggest s there are ways to reduce risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia , as well as ways to promote cognitive health at the population level . 17 Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention.

Several conditions known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease -including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes \u2014 also appear to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Some autopsy studies show that up to 80% of individuals with Alzheimer's also have cardiovascular disease. Many cardiovascular disease risk factors are modifiable -that is, they can be changed to decrease the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseas e. Many experts believe that controlling card iovascular risk factors may be the most cost -effective and helpful approach to protecting brain health and reducing the risk of cognitive decline .

FACULTY GUIDE 33 current smoking increases the risk of cognitive decline and possibly dementia and that quitting smoking may over time reduce the associated risk to levels comparable to those who n ever smoked. Diet : Current evidence also suggests that eating a heart -healthy diet may also help protect the brain. Two diets that have been studied and may be beneficial are the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet . A third dietary intervention is the Mediterranean -DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay ( MIND ) diet, which is a combination of the two diets and focuses on foods that support cognitive health. Physical activity : Regular physical activity is important for heart health and may help lower the risk of Alz heimer's and vascular dementia. Exercise may directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow in the brain. Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) a week and muscle -strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).

FACULTY GUIDE 34 SLIDE 25: Risk Reduction: Avoidance/Management24,25 Prevent onset of or effectively manage conditions that can increase risk for Alzheimer's o High blood pressure (hypertension) o Diabetes o Midlife obesity TALKING POINTS: Growing evidence suggests that the avoidance and management of high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes , and midlife obesity may reduce risk for Alzheimer's and other dementia s. There is even stronger evidence that these factors may also help protect against cognitive decline in general. A large -scale clinical trial showed that medical treatment to reduce blood pressure can significantly lower the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and combined outcome of MCI and dementia in older adults with hypertension. Controlling blood pres sure is also important for reducing risk for stroke, another source of cognitive impairment. Preventing and managing these and other chronic diseases and conditions have been priorities of public health practice for many years. The increasing evidence base about the impact of these conditions on cognitive health must also be taken into account and incorporated into public health practice going forward . 24 Alzheimer's Association.

Mentally stimulating activities may include: Learning new information and s kills that challenges the brain in novel ways Volunteering Reading Playing challenging games (such as bridge, chess, Sudoku, etc.) Other studies have also suggested a link between social connections and cognitive health. Keeping strong social connections with others through activities such as clubs, friends, social groups, volunteering may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and possibly delay the onset of dementia . 26 National Institute on Aging.

Similarly, reducing risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia is in line with public health efforts to improve detection and treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes and promote smoking cessation . Such c ampaigns should include in their target audience midlife and older adults . Specifically, e vidence -based interventions are needed to increase physical activity , promote smoking cessatio n and heart -healthy diets , and control high blood pressure . To achieve health equity goals, public h ealth campaigns need culturally appropriate education and awareness campaigns for heart health and brain health. These are especially important for African -Americans and 28 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FACULTY GUIDE 41 SLIDE 30: Why Promote Early Detection?30,31,32,33 Access to treatment and services Planning Potentially reversible causes Clinical trials TALKING POINTS: Promoting and assuring early detection of disease and disability is a third key impact for public health and is vitally important for people with Alzheimer's and dementia . Although there are no pharmacological treatments that change the course of the disease, there are numerous reasons why early detection is important: Access to treatment and services : A formal diagnosis allows individuals and their caregivers to have access to available treatments , build a care team , and identify support services . It may help individuals: Begin medication to help manage symptoms Identify health care professionals to help with different aspects of the disease (such as primary care, neurologist, occupational therapist, etc.) Manage co-morbidities (such as high blood pressure, diabetes) and potentially minimize or avoid further complications 30 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FACULTY GUIDE 42 Access community -based services, such as support groups and ser vices to assist with daily life All of these factors may help reduce the burden on people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers . Health care costs could be reduced if better care averts avoidable hospitalizations or delay s admission to long - term care facilities. Planning : Early detection of Alzheimer's and other dementias can also help individuals and their families make important decisions and plans surrounding care, treatment opt ions, and finances. Many people with Alzheimer's and their families may benefit from creating a dvance directives -legal documents that specify the type of medical and end- of- life care a person wants to receive once he or she can no longer make or communicate these decisions. Such a document allows the person's wishes to be carried out by their family. Reversible Causes : In some cases, dementia -like symptoms are not actually dementia , but are due to reversible causes. Common causes of dementia -like symptoms are depression, untreated sleep apnea, delirium, side effects of medications, thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive alcohol consumption. Unlike Alzh eimer's and other dementias, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment. Clinical Trials : Having access to clinical trials provides individuals with the opportunity to access the latest experimental approaches available and provides them with ca re by clinical research staff. It is important for diverse populations to participate in clinical studies. This is especially true for African American and Hispanic populations, both of which are at increased risk for Alzheimer's and are traditionally under -represented in research .

Many people of all ages fear getting Alzheimer's more than any other disease , and others may lack basic knowledge about cognitive decline, including the early signs of Alzheimer's . These are two of many reasons why we saw , as with the BRFSS data on subjective cognitive decline , many people experiencing memory issues are not discussing the symptoms with their doctor. Yet, 90% or more of people would want to know if they themselves or a family member had Alzheimer's. 34 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. 35 Alzh eimer's Association. (2018) Race, Ethnicity, and Alzheimer's Fact S heet. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 45 A key challenge with early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's is that many individuals and their caregivers are not being told of the diagnosis, even when their doctor has diagnosed it. An analysis by the CDC found that among people with Alzheimer's or another dementia, they o r their caregivers reported being aware of the diagnosis only in 35% of the cases . (For more information: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data - search/Search -the-Data#objid=4158 ) These rates are far below diagnoses for other chronic diseases. Analyses have shown that 90% or more of those diagnosed with cancer and cardiovascular disease , for example, were aware of their diagnosis. There are also health care disparities surrounding diagnosis. Medicare data show that African -Americans are even less likely than whites to be diagnosed. Furthermore, when they are diagnosed, A frican - Americans and Hispanics, possibly due to issues surrounding access to health care , are typically diagnosed in later stages of the disease , resulting in higher use of health care services and substantially higher costs. In the next slide, we will look at possible reasons for the lower rate of diagnosis and disclosure . Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 46 SLIDE 33: Early Detection: Challenges36,37 Diagnostic uncertainty Time constraints , lack of support Communication difficulties Fear of causing emotional distress Reluctance to discuss with health care provider TALKING POINTS: There are many reasons why Alzheimer's and other dementias go undiagnosed or diagnosed but not disclosed to the patient. Diagnostic uncertainty : Health care providers frequently cite the complexity and uncertainty of the diagnosis as barriers to disclosure. Time constraints and lack of support : Disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another dementia to a patient usually requires discussion of treatment options and support services, as well as education about the disease and what to expect. In many health care settings, providers may perceive t hey have insufficient time to properly assess and effectively communicate with the patient. However, to address this barrier, Medicare created a billing code for conducting comprehensive assessments for patients diagnosed with cognitive impairment, develop ing a care plan, and referring the patient and caregivers to community resources . 36 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 47 Communication difficulties : Many providers report challenges in communication skills related to disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or other dementias. It is also important for providers to be culturally competent and aware in presenting information on Alzheimer's that is respectful of and responsive to the needs, concerns, and belief systems of diverse patient populations. Fear of causing emotional distress : One of the most common reasons family members and health care providers give for not disclosing an Alzheimer's diagnosis is fear of causing emotional distress . However, studies have found that few patients become depressed or have other long -term emotional problems b ecause of the diagnosis. Reluctance to discuss with health care provider : Many people are reluctant to discuss memory or cognitive issues with their health care provider. The BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey found that the majori ty of people who have experienced subjective cognitive decline have not talked to their health care provider about it. [Note to Presenters: It was more common in the past for physicians to withhold a serious diagnosis from patients. For example, survey results published in 1961, indicated that 9 in 10 physicians said it was their usual policy to not tell patients that they had been diagnosed with cancer. Typical reasons included not causing patients unnecessary anxiety or depression, a perceived lack of effective treatments, and not wanting to take away hope.] Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health?

Nearly 89% of Americans say that if they were exhibiting confusion and memory loss, they would want to know if the cause of the symptoms was Alzheimer's disease. Of those aged 60 and older, 95% say they would want to know. Over 97% say that if they had a family member exhibiting problems with memory loss, they would want them to see a doctor to determine if the cause was Alzheimer's disease. 38 Alzh eimer's Association.

Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 53 SLIDE 38 : Safety and Quality of Care40 Workforce supply and training /development Safety of those with dementia and their caregivers Caregiver support and resources TALKING POINTS: Given the epidemic of Alzheimer's and other dementias, it is vital that health systems and communities infrastructure are equipped to serve the growing number of individuals needing care and services. A well-trained , adequate workforce is needed to enhance the safety of those with Alzheimer's and dementia and deliver high -quality care . The public health challenge is two -fold: Currently, in many communities, there is a shortage of care professional s (geriatricians, nurses, personal care attendants, home health aides, etc.) needed to provide care to people living with Alzheimer's and dementia. Workforce shortages are likely to wo rsen as the popula tion with Alzheimer's increases At the same time, those who work with individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias do not often have the specialized knowledge and training needed to best meet the needs of these individuals Both of these issues will impact the quality of care and safety of those with Alzheimer's. At present, many health care and other care professionals have received little formal training in Alzheimer's and other dementias. 40 Alzheim er's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FACULTY GUIDE 54 For example, i n 2015, only 23 states required training in dementia for staff in nursing homes . A variety of stakeholders have created training opportunities in recent years, so the situation is slow ly changing . Caregiver Support and Resources: Currently about 70% of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias live in the community, not in a long -term care facility. Therefore, the care provided to these individuals is most often by family caregivers, followed by paid home -care staff. Both family and professional caregivers need to understand the unique nature of Alzheimer's and how to effectively communicate with and care for an individual with cognitive impairment. Caring for a family member or friend with Alzheimer's , especially in the later stages, is a very challenging job . Caregivers need knowledge about the disease , changes to expect, and ways to care for a loved one over the course of the disease. The health of caregivers can be negatively impacted by the physical and emotional stress e xperienced in providing a high level of care for multiple years . In addition to education and training, c aregivers need community support, such as respite care (short -term care for the person with Alzheimer's ), adult day services, financial/legal planning assistance, peer support groups, and resources that promote self -care. (Module 4 covers more information on these topics.) Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 55 SLIDE 39: Conclusion : Public Health Impact 4 key ways public health can have an impact : Surveillance/monitoring Risk reduction Early detection and diagnosis Safety and quality of care TALKING POINTS: Public health addresses Alzheimer's disease from a population perspective in four primary ways: 1. Surveillance and monitoring allows public health to compile data and use it to: Develop strategies and interventions Inform public policy Evaluate programs and policies Educate populations Guide research 2. Risk reduction Primary prevention strategies can be used to promote risk reduction for Alzheimer's and dementia , as well as to promote cognitive health in general. Public health may design and implement health education and promotion campaigns to promote brain health and risk reduction strategies, reaching wide audiences and affecting change on the popula tion level. Public health and its partners may also initiate or strengthen programs and policies aimed at risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease. Programs and policies could help ensure access to: Injury prevention resources (e.g., helmets, falls prevention assets) Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health?

At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable in accommodating the needs of a popul ation with Alzheimer's and other dementia s. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support , and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Public health research and translation Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Public health can also support the creation of dementia friendly communities. These are cross -sector, community- wide efforts to have support services, resources , and safe environments that allow people with dementia and their caregivers to stay connected to the community. Over time, these partnerships should: Enhance support services and resources Address accessibility and mobility barriers Provide dementia traini ng for health care providers and first responders Provide a range of resources to support family caregivers such as respite care services Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health?

Mrs. Williams lived on a Native American reservation in Arizona before moving in with her daughter, Delma, in Los Angeles. In many tribal communities, obtaining an Alzheimer's diagnosis is a challenge; for example, tribal communities may not have a word for dementia. Native American cultures have historically considered aging and signs of Alzheimer's (memory issues, forgetfulness, getting lost) as part of the cycle of life: people begin life as children and leave as children. Mrs. Williams' daughter did not know what Alzheimer's disease is because no one ever talked about it. Once in Los Angeles, Mrs. Williams' memory problems grew increasingly worse. Mrs. W illiams began wandering and becoming lost. During moments of lucidity, Mrs. Williams begged her daughter to return her to her home on the reservation. Eventually Delma and her family moved back to the reservation. Mrs. Williams has 13other children who liv e in that area, but Delma is the only one who cares for their mother. Delma is not sure why her siblings do not visit their mother and their absence upsets her. Delma also feels guilty for doubting her mother when she first mentioned having memory issues.

Terry and Mary have created a structured routine for Helen that involves time at the adult day center that provides socialization with other older adults, engaging activities, and care. This routine has become an important part of maintaining Helen's health and wellness. The winter holidays are coming up, and Terry and Mary must strategize about how to celebrate with family and friends without disrupting Helen's routine. The winter holidays are additionally stressful to families caring for members with Alzheimer's and can mak e caretakers feel overwhelmed. Terry and Mary must prepare visiting relatives for Helen's worsening condition. They also must mentally prepare themselves for the disappointment of fewer and fewer friends visiting to celebrate the holidays. Terry and Mary are exhausted all the time and say that they are just trying to get through Christmas now. As Helen's Alzheimer's progresses, Terry and Mary have come to accept that their lives are very different than from seven years ago when Helen moved in, and they con tinue to make personal sacrifices in order to take the best possible care of Helen. For example, Terry and Mary can no longer go to all of their friends' and family's various holiday celebrations anymore, and often friends and family don't understand why. Terry and Mary have accepted they can no longer do everything they once did during the holidays; however, they still feel the sense of missing out and being excluded.

Aurora's daughter, Maria, comes by their apartment almost daily to help her mother bathe, grocery shop, do laundry, provide medical care, and do many other tasks around the house to help her father and care for her mother. Early in her Alzheimer's disease diagnos is, Aurora began wandering at night. Afraid that she might wander into the street, Arturo, began sleeping on the floor in front of the bedroom door in order to keep Aurora from leaving the apartment. Maria had the idea of attaching wind chimes to the door so that Arturo can hear when the door is opened and closed. Maria and Arturo are currently able to provide all the necessary care for Aurora to live safely in her own home. However, caring for people living with Alzheimer's tends to be mentally and financ ially exhausting. As Aurora's Alzheimer's progresses, her safety in the apartment becomes an increasing concern. The story discusses ways that technology, such as remote sensor monitoring systems, can help people with dementia stay independent longer whil e giving caregivers a way to monitor activity and safety. Discussion Questions: What are some technologies available to help monitor the health of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease? What are ethical dilemmas about these kinds of technologies that may be considered invasive of an individual's privacy and health? Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health?

Yvonne Russell, a recreation therapist discusses how music has positively impacted one of her patients, Henry. Henry has been in a n ursing home for ten years after he began having seizures and his wife was no longer able to care for him at home. His daughter recalls how her father was always singing and dancing when she was a child. At the nursing home, Henry is typically unresponsive and spends most of the day looking down sitting in his chair, unable to carry on a conversation or speak more than a few words. After learning about his love of music, Yvonne had all of Henry's favorite songs downloaded on to an iPod. When she puts the hea dphones on Henry and plays the music, he immediately sits up, eyes go wide and begins to sing along and dance in his chair. After listening to the music, Henry is asked a series of questions and is able to respond quicker and with more detail than usual. H e recalls the name of his favorite singer and even sings his favorite song. Discussion Questions: How did music impact Henry? Discuss ways that caregivers and care facilities can better engage individuals with Alzheimer's. What should public health professionals take away from this case study?

These Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 69 efforts support implementation of the Washington State Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias regarding culturally -appropriate strategies to educate the public about reducing risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia. DOH prioritized African American women as a main audience for cognitive health education based on national prevalence data. DOH then reviewed evidence - based, brain health messages developed by the Alzheimer's Association for the Healthy Brain Initiative. After securing approval from Washington's state health officer, DOH partnered with the Seattle based, nonprofit Center for MultiCultural Health (CMCH) to help tailor and disseminate brain health messages to African American audiences. CMCH identified African American churches as a promising venue to reach women and recommended creating hand fans printed with culturally -tailored messages. Additionally, the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA) and the University of Washington Healthy Brain Research Network (UW -HBRN) partnered to conduct outreach and education for Seattle AAPIs. Through six focus groups, they solicited input from local Chin ese and Japanese adults with at least one living relative age 65 or over. The focus groups assessed the acceptability of messages developed by the University of Pennsylvania HBRN Center to encourage non-Hispanic white or African American urban adults conce rned about the cognitive health of an older relative to accompany that relative to an appointment with a healthcare provider. NAPCA and UW -HBRN released two briefs on their findings: Connecting with AAPIs about Dementia: An Action Guide for Service Provide rs and Connecting with AAPIs about Dementia: An Action Guide for Policymakers. Each offers dementia resources and information on treatment options. The importance of early detection of cognitive impairment is emphasized in the guide for service providers, as these professionals play a crucial role in facilitating older AAPIs' and their caregivers' access to cognitive assessment resources. The Dementia Action Collaborative provided guidance on the action briefs and also helped to disseminate them. UW -HBRN re ceived a 2017 Seattle Innovation Fund grant for its work on the AAPI action briefs. If you would like to learn more about this case study, a supplemental video has been provided to illustrate public health in action.

Currently, about 11% of the state's three million residents is aged 65 or older, and the state has about 30,000 people with Alzheimer's dementia, which is expected to rise 40% to 42,000 b y 2025. Diagnoses of dementia in later stages may lead to higher levels of disability while receiving care, delays in accessing timely primary care, lack of care coordination, and duplication of services. To improve early detection of cognitive impairment , a focus of Utah's State Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias , the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) contracted with HealthInsight, a quality improvement organization. HealthInsight interviewed providers about their experiences and processes conducti ng cognitive assessments during the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV). While some providers reported performing routine cognitive assessments during the AWV, others reported screening only under certain conditions, such as when patients request assessme nt or when patients have specific risk factors for cognitive decline, etc. Providers also expressed a need for better tools to detect early stage memory loss. The resulting report, Cognitive Assessments during Medicare Annual Wellness Visits, was a collabo rative product from HealthInsight; UDOH; the Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging and Research at the University of Utah; and Intermountain Medical Center. Actions in the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map include improving healthcare providers' ability to recognize the early warning signs of dementia and knowledge of validated cognitive assessment tools. As a step in this process, UDOH sent the study report to all Utah primary care physicians, along with a list of resources for people with cognitive i mpairment and a recommendation from UDOH's executive director for routine cognitive assessment during the AWV using the Mini -Cog as the primary assessment tool, followed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA). Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 71 The project deepened UDOH's understanding of some challenges that physicians face in assessing cognition during the AWV, one of which is uncertainty about which validated tool to use. Receiving clear recommendations from UDOH's executive director may begin increasing physician use of the to ols during AWVs or other occasions in which a physician has concerns about potential cognitive impairment. Use of validated early detection tools helps physicians assess cognitive functioning and detect potential concerns early, the first step in increasing early diagnoses. With some legislative support, UDOH plans to continue collaborating with HealthInsight to develop: Cognitive assessment training for primary care physicians and their office staff that will include use of recommended tools and workflow improvement techniques to instill a reliable, repeatable process in clinics; and Cognitive health and wellness toolkit to help health professionals navigate the cognitive assessment process, including assessment, diagnosis, referrals, and community resour ces. Discussion Questions: What stakeholders did the Utah DOH involve in this initiative? Why is early detection of cognitive impairment important? Describe some of the barriers to early detection of cognitive impairment and the recommendations that came from this evaluation to overcome those barriers. Why is it important that public health professionals conduct evaluations like this? How does this study align with the Health Brain Initiative Road Map goals? 9. \"Preparing First Responders for Interactions w ith People with Dementia,\" Healthy Brain Initiative: Colorado Key Terms: EMS, healthcare system, stigma, first responders, increasing aging population, community outreach, training, education, cultural context Modules: 3, 4 Supplemental Materials: https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/case -study -co- executive -summary.pdf Description: Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers receive many calls to assist people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. However, they often have little or no Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 72 formal training to prepare them for the unique physical, behavioral, and communication challenges related to dementia. To develop a dementia -competent workforce t hroughout Colorado, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE) partnered with the Alzheimer's Association Colorado Chapter to deliver its Approaching Alzheimer's: First Responder Training Program . CDPHE marketed the availability o f the free, in- person training through its internal networks and all 11 of Colorado's Regional Emergency and Trauma Advisory Councils. The training helps first responders serve people with Alzheimer's in situations involving wandering, disasters or other emergency situations, abuse or neglect, \"shoplifting\" because they forgot to pay, and driving. At the completion of training, participants receive a poster\u2014 Tips for EMS Working with People with Alzheimer's\u2014 to display and reinforce effective responses. See the supplemental material link to learn more about this example of public health workforce education.

FACULTY GUIDE 73 Description: The Puerto Rico Department of Health worked with the Prevention Research Center's South Carolina Healthy Brain Research Network at the University of South Carolina to implement the Puerto Rico Alzheimer's Action Plan , with a special focus on education and empowerment of individuals and families. One component was a collaborative educational initiative called Un caf\u00e9 por el Alzheimer . With special attention toward decreasing stigma, this initiative used social media and in -person gatherings to support informal but structured conversations with experts about Alzheimer's disease, risk factors, diagnosis, pharmacological and non - pharmacological treatments, manag ement of behavioral changes, and healthy living. The Alzheimer's caf\u00e9s enabled participants to have informal conversations in coffee shops across the island. Participants could raise questions at any time and were encouraged to share testimonials and comments. At the end of the gatherings, the participants were invited to continue the conversation online by following the Facebook page. These social media efforts reinforced key messages and helped engage and educate the wider audience. Pre/post surveys in four sessions with a total of 212 participants showed improved knowledge and high satisfaction ratings. All participants said they learned something new from the program, and 80% said most of the information presented was new to them. A total of 250 messag es were posted on the Un caf\u00e9 por el Alzheimer community Facebook page over a seven -month period. An average increase of nearly 65% in the number of people reached by the Facebook page offered evidence of the program's success in helping participants remain actively engaged while fostering social support and reducing stigmas and myths surrounding the disease. Discussion Questions: How did public health professionals help to reduce social stigma surrounding Alzheimer's disease? Why do you think this educational initiative was successful? How could this model be implemented in your community? What would you change or keep the same? How does this initiative align with the Health Brain Initiative Road Map goals? 11. \"Encouraging Advance Care Planning for People with Dementia,\" Healthy Brain Initiative: Maryland Key Terms: increasing prevalence, increasing aging population, family support, caregiver burden, policy, healthcare, advance directive, end of life decisions, education, community outreach, long ter m care Modules: 2, 3, 4 Supplemental materials: Healthy Brain Initiative Roadmap Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 74 o https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/healthy of people with Alzheimer's dementia is projected to rise\u2014from 110,000 people in 2018 to 130,000 in 2025, an 18% increase in eight years. As the number of people with dementia rises, so too does the need to assist families in planning for future care needs. The passage of Maryland House Bill 1385 in May 2016 aimed to increase advance care planning among families impacted by dementia. Among other mandates, the law directs the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to encourage the use of el ectronic advance directives, develop an electronic platform to connect with healthcare providers at point- of-care using the state -designated health information exchange, and conduct outreach to increase public awareness of the Advance Directive Program. An early assessment found that advance care planning in Maryland is offered primarily through hospitals and hospice providers, with limited free care planning services available through Maryland Legal Aid and Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service Pro Bono Resou rce Centers. To increase advance care planning, MDH collaborated with the Maryland Faith Health Network to lead a year- long series of community engagement activities on electronic advance directives. More than 500 Marylanders learned about advance care planning through health fairs, faith -based events, and end -of-life seminars. In addition, three local health improvement coalitions hosted seven advance -planning educational sessions, with a combined total of 144 participants. More than twice as many partici pants were able to identify core legal and financial advance planning documents post- session (25%) as pre -session (10%). Also, a greater number of participants (post -session compared with pre -session) reported understanding the importance of involving people with cognitive impairment in advance planning. The medical director of the MDH Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control served as a co -chair (along with a representative from the Maryland Department of Aging) of the governor -appointed Virginia I. Jones Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Council during this time. The Council monitors implementation of the Maryland State Plan on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders . As a tenet of the Maryland State Plan, MDH used this unique opportuni ty to engage partners to discuss potential cognitive health education and establish interventions in Maryland's public health programming.

FACULTY GUIDE 85 Additional Learning Activities The following suggestions are additional learning activities that can be used to increase student interaction and engagement with the, A Public Health Approach to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias curriculum. Reverse Classroom Approach The r everse classroo m, also known as the flipped classroom, is an approach that provides students with instructional materials to review outside of the classroom and encourages assignments that mirror homework to be used during the designated instructional time. Examples of i ncorporating this approach are as follows: Think, Pair, and Share. Assign students to review the curriculum, video, case study, or related assignment and propose a question about the material at the start of the next class. Students will first think quietl y for a minute or two to collect their thoughts and questions about the material. Next, students will pair up and discuss their thoughts with a partner or small group. Finally, each pair will briefly share their discussion with the class. This activity can be u sed at the start of class to help students review any assignments. Alternatively, this activity can also be used at the end of class to help students reflect on the day's teachings . Mini Curriculum. Divide the class into four groups and have each gro up present one module to the class. Ask students to create a \"mini curriculum\" to teac h their peers about Alzheimer's disease and the role public health and related disciplines plays. This assignment is meant to be creative and allow s students to use any platform they think would work best for their peers to learn the material by using video, lecture, handout, games, or discussion . This may also provide insight into your students' preferred learning style. Reflection P aper . Reflection papers allow students not only to reflect on the curriculum, but also on the larger effect Alzheimer's and other dementias have on society. Students will review a module, case study, or video as assigned and then write a reflection paper that will b e used to guide discussion during the next c lass. These reflections should ask students to critical ly think about the topic at hand, but do not ne ed to be a specific length. This activity may also be done during class time by setting a 5-minute timer and ask ing students to write down their reflections from the class that day. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 86 Learning Lab A learning lab instructional approach is participatory and results -oriented with the sole objective of students working together to innovatively solve an issue or publi c health challenge. In each activity, students are tasked with thinking through various potential actions to solve the challenges raised using a public health lens. Examples of incorporating this approach are as follows: Assistive Technology. Break the class into groups and ask them to come up with an innovative assistive technology or monitoring system to support individuals living with dementia and their caregivers. This is meant to be a creative project and students do not have to produce a n actual product; however, students should demonstrate their knowledge of the behavioral and physical changes associated with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Policy Brief. Ask students to write a one -page policy brief and present it to the class. Using what they have learned from the curriculum, videos, and case studies , students should be able to identify a need of someone living with dementia or their caregiver that can affect policy change. The policy brief should include the follo wing sections: title, summary, scope of problem, policy alternatives, policy recommendations, and sources. Students should also have a specific audience in mind for the policy brief, such as a Member of Congress. This activity can be done by an individual or group. What's Hap pening in the N ews? Ask students to find a recent scholarly article or news article related to Alzheimer's . Students may find articles related to prevention, clinical trials, intervention s, or other related topics and be prepared to briefly explain them to the class. The purpose of this activity is to expose students to the current state of Alzheimer's research and to learn more about public health and related disciplines in action. Helpful resources may include the N ational Institutes of Health , Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention, Alzheimer's Association, credible newspapers, scholarly articles, and research happening at your own university. Case Study S tations: This activity allows students to get up and move around the class as they visit differe nt case studies placed around the room. It is suggested that you use the My Typical Day case studies (available at http://www.mytypicalday.org/ ) for this activity, but feel free to use any examples from the provided case studies in the curriculum. Print a copy of each case study you have selected (as many as appropriate for your class size) and place them around the classroom. Students will then break into small groups and rotate around the room to read and d iscuss each case study. Students should discuss each case both from the perspective of the individual, but also the caregiver and others involved if applicable. Prompts for the students are listed below . o In what ways has life changed since their diagnosis ? Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 87 o How have they reacted to their diagnosis? Positively? Negatively? o How have they adapted their everyday routine? o What support do they have? o What changes have they noticed? o What role do their family and friends play? Dementia Friendly C ommunities . The sources below provide visual images and key takeaways on how communities can be dementia fri endly. After reviewing the example images as a class, students will be asked to draw their own community and identify ways in which their community is dementia frie ndly and ways their community could improve. Students may choose the town or city where the university is located or even their own hometown if they would like to offer a different example to the class. If you would like to make this a group activity, project a map of your university on a chalkboard or whiteboard and have students dr aw directly on it during class time. o Fostering Dementia Friendliness : https://www.dfamerica.org/communities - overvi ew o Building Dementia -Friendly for Everyone: https://dementiapartnerships.com/resource/building Dementia Friendly Community Toolkit: https://www.actonalz.org/dementia - friendly -toolkit Guest Speakers Pairing the curriculum with guest speakers is an instructional approach that allows students to learn from th e experiences of people who have been affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias or work in a related field. Examples of guest speakers include: Caregivers of someone with dementia. An individual with early stage dementia. Local Alzheimer's Association chapter. Nonprofit organization working on issues related to dementia. A local department of public health, another government agency, or a community - based group such as an Area Agency on Aging. Nurses, doctors, social workers, and other professionals who work with individuals with dementia . Faculty and staff at your university who are conducting related research. Module 3: Alzheimer's Disease - What is the Role of Public Health? FACULTY GUIDE 88 Test Your Knowledge Quiz the class using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). The ADKS contains 30 true or false items to assess their knowledge about Alzheimer's disease. The scale addresses topics such as risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, symptoms, course, life impact, caregiving, treatment, and management. This is a quick way to gauge what the students have learned, without creating a formal exam. Students can take the quiz independently (5 to 10 minutes) and then review the answers as a class. The ADKS and answers to each question can be found at the Resources for the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale website "}
