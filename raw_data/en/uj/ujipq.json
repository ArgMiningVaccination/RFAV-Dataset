INTRODUCTION Treatment has dramatically changed over the past century for people diagnosed with Hansen's disease ( HD or leprosy) in the United S tates . Confinement at the National Leprosarium in Carville , Louisiana was the only option before 1950. With the discovery of an effective drug protocol and the establishment of Ambulatory Care Programs (ACP) in select cities , patients are now treated in proximity to their homes. Travel to the National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP ) headquarters for treatment is no longer neces sary unless patients experience complications that cannot be managed by local providers . Currently, in addition to the NHDP and ACP, appro ximately 375 private physicians are treating one or more HD patients in cities throughout the United States. Since the number of treatment providers for HD has increased , a standardized guide for the care of HD in the U.S. is essential . A. Objective The purpose of this manual is to serve as a practical guide for clinicians and healthcare professionals directly involved in the diagnosis and treatment of people with H D in the United States and its territories. It may also be a valuable tool as an overview o f HD for medical students, residents and others interested in the disease. Clarification regarding the content of this manual may be requested from the NHDP at 1 -800-642-2477 or found on the website: https://www.hrsa.gov/hansens -disease/index.html B. Mission The Division of National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP) is a medical service within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) , Healthcare Systems Bureau (HSB). NHDP is authorized by Public Law 99-177, Section 2, (a), Section 320 and is guided by DHHS regulations. \"The mission of the NHDP is the treatment and eventual eradication of Hansen's disease through its clinical, rehabilitation, research and training programs. It is the only program in the United States devoted exclusively to the management of HD and the only referral source where all associated complications can be managed.\" C. Eligibility Individuals living in the United States , or its territories , may receive outpatient medical care for the diagnosis and treatment of HD and its complications. Ideally, individuals are diagnosed and treated locally; however, eligibility for patient care at the NHDP in Baton Rouge, LA is currently based on answers to the following questions: 1. Is the patient's problem one that is related to HD ? 2. Can this problem be solved locally for the patient? 3. Can the NHDP successfully treat this problem if the patient cannot receive local treatment? 6 4. Does the patie nt have any additional health complications that would interfere with treatment or require more intensive care than can be provided at the NHDP? Contacts of known patients are also eligible for HD related services as described by NHDP policy (see \"Contact Evaluation \" in Section XIV ). II. HISTORY OF HANSEN'S DISEASE The earliest written description of leprosy ( HD) was recorded in India during the s ixth millennium BC. The cause, however, remained unknown until 1873 when Dr. G erhard Armauer Hansen (for whom the disease was renamed) of Norway identified M. leprae as the bacteria responsible for the disease. A variety of palliative therapies w ere tried, but none proved effective and most people were relegated to a life of isolation and abandonment. In 1941, sulfone drugs were first used to treat HD at the National Leprosarium in Carville, Louisiana, and by 1950; dapsone had become the standard treatment. The rapid improvement in patients treated with dapsone therapy led to hopes of the eradication of HD, and the search began in earnest for even more powerful drugs. However, there were no effective animal models at the time and M. leprae still cannot be cultivated in vitro . In 1960, Charles Shepard described the limited multiplication of M. leprae in the mouse footpad, which made it possible for the first time to screen drugs for anti -leprosy activity and detect drug resistance. Since then, armadillos, nude mice, and a variety of immunosuppressed rodents have been used to obtain higher yields of M. lepr ae for bacteriological and immunological studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced multidrug therapy (MDT) to the global community in 1982. Today, HD drugs are distributed free of charge around most of the w orld by the Novartis Foundation. NHDP provides medications at no cost to diagnosed patients living in the US and its territories. Because of these efforts, the global burden of disease has fallen dramatically in recent decades. III. OVERVIEW OF M. LEPRAE A. BACTERIOLOGY M. leprae is a weakly acid-fast rod, 2 -8 microns lon g and 0.3 microns in diameter. It is an obligate intracellular organism, and can be found in tissues singly or in clumps (globi) which may contain hundreds of bacilli. M. leprae will survive for a short period in tissue cultu res. Limited metabolism (but not multiplication) can take place in some types of special laboratory media. Consistent multiplication occurs following injection of viable bacilli into the footpads of mice, as well as in nine -banded armadillos . The generally accepted generation time of M. leprae is approximately 12 days. This very slow rate of multiplication is consistent with the long (usually 3 -5 years) incubation period of HD in humans. M. leprae DNA can be identified in tissue biopsies by nucleic acid amp lification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotyping of M. leprae DNA has demonstrated 7 several major geno types globally, and has revealed that armadillos and humans in the United States share some genotypes. M. leprae from biopsies can also be tested for mutations associated with drug resistance. Since its discovery by Gerhard Armauer Hansen, M. leprae was thought to be the only infectious bacterium to cause leprosy. In December 2008, the American Journal of Clinical Pathology published an original article by X. Han, MD, PhD., et. a l. documenting the discovery of a \"new Mycobacterium strain\" (Am J Clin Pathol The comparison showed this \"new strain\" to be a new species of Mycobacterium . This new speci es has been named Mycobacteria lepromatosis . Cases of M. lepromatosis have been reported in Canada, Asia, several provinces of Mexico, South America and Central America (Jessamine 2012, Sotiriou 2016, Han 2014). M. lepromatosis , is genetically distinct fro m M. leprae , but shares striking evolutionary and biologic similarities . M. lepromatosis manifests with the same broad spectrum of cutaneous and neurologic findings that are described in HD and is comparable to infection with M. leprae . Reactions -Type 1 re versal and Type 2 ENL can occur with both M. leprae and M. lepromatosis . There is insufficient evidence to determine if immunologic reactions with M. lepromatosis are more severe. M. lepromatosis could be the causative agent of several cases of DLL (Diffuse Lepromatous Leprosy) with presentations similar to that seen in patients who develop Lucio's phenomenon (Han 2008). To date, no clear clinical or histopathologic differences between infections with the two species can be recognized, and thus differentiating them is mostly of epidemiologic value. Importantly, multi- drug therapy appears to be effective for both infections, and therefore, one diagnosis does not seem to portend a more ominous diseas e course than the other. B. IMMUNOLOGY 1. The Host Response Only 3 -5 percent of the world 's population appears to be susceptible to clinically detectable infection with M. leprae . Among susceptible individuals, a wide range of clinical manifestations is comparab le to the spectrum of histopathological appearance; which is, in turn, based on a spectrum of human cell mediated immune (CMI) responses to M. leprae . At the Tuberculoid end of the spectrum there is good host CMI response that localizes the disease. At the Lepromatous end , CMI response to M. leprae is weak or absent and the disease is generalized, affecting skin, nerves, eyes, lymph nodes, muscle, and internal viscera such as the liver. In the middle of the spectrum, known as Borderline HD, various clinical presentations between the two extremes are seen, reflecting the variation in host responses. (The clinical - pathological classification of HD is described in Section IV. ) Immunodeficiency due to HIV infection or to medical immunosuppression, such as tran splantation or cancer chemotherapy, will rende r individuals more susceptible. 8 Similar increases in susceptibility may occur in individuals taking corticosteroids or newer biological agents for arthritis or autoimmune diseases. 2. The Lepromin Test The Lepromin skin test is not a diagnostic test and the reagent is no longer available. Historical information about this test can be found in the medical literature. 3. Skin and Nerve Involvement M. leprae and M. Lepromatosis have a particular affinity for skin and peripheral nerves. In the skin, they are found in macrophages where, in Lepromatous HD, it is able to avoid digestion and multiply to form large masses of bacilli (\"globi\"). In nerves, they are found within macrophages a nd Schwann cells. The presence of M. leprae and M. Lepromatosis in nerves is pathognomonic of HD . C. EPIDEMIOLOGY HD is found primarily in trop ical and sub -tropical regions. Approximately 25 percent of the world's population live in areas where they might be exposed to the infection. Because of stigma and other reporting issues, it remains difficult to get an accurate estimate o f the global number of HD cases. The NHDP is the federal agency primarily responsible for care, treatment and control of Hansen's dise ase in the United St ates. The disease has been reported among individual s from every state. About 14,000 cases of HD have been recorded in the U.S. since 1894. Since the 1990's , an average of 175 new cases are reported annually. The majority of new cases arise among immigrants to the United States from HD endemic countries, or citizens who have worked abroad in endemic areas. However, the single country contributing the most cases is the United States, that is, individuals born in the United States who hav e not traveled to endemic areas. Transmission: The exact mode of transmission of M. leprae is poorly understood. The evidence suggests that the optimal transmission occurs in a setting of prolonged, close contact, and not from casual contact. It is thought to be transmitted between people primarily via the respiratory route, but there is also some evidence for skin -skin transmission. However, the disease is not highly contagious. Approximately 95 -97% of the world's population appear to be naturally immune t o HD. Although m an is considered the primary reservoir for leprosy bacilli, the nine -banded armadillo in the southern United States is also a reservoir for the infection. It is clear that transmission occurs between armadillos and humans, but the exact mea ns of transmission is not known. 9 IV. CLASSIFICATION AND CLINICAL FEATURES Extensive differences exist in the pathological features, immunological status, treatment, and types of complications that develop with HD. The aim of HD classification is to define zones in the spectrum of the disease in which these features are similar or different. Two systems of classi fication are now in general use : the Ridley -Jopling five -group classification and the W HO two -group classification (see Table 1). Table 1 . The HD sp ectrum as defined by the Ridley -Jopling and the WHO classifications. Classification Zones of the HD spectrum Ridley -Jopling TT BT BB BL LL WHO Classification Paucibacillary Multibacillary A. The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification System When the WHO introduced Multidrug Therapy (MDT) , they recommended a simplified classification for treatment purposes with only two categories, Paucibacillary (PB) and Multibacillary (MB). The current WHO definition of MB disease is \"any patient with six or more lesions with or without positive skin smear results\" . PB disease is defined by the WHO as \"any patient who has less than six skin lesions with or without positive skin smear results\" B. Ridley -Jopling Classification System: The Clinical Spectrum of Hans en's disease Clinical features of HD cover a wide range, from a single hypopigmented skin macule to generalized disease. The Ridley -Jopling system captures this spectrum in 5 main classifications . The NHDP uses skin biopsy results and the Ridley -Jopling sc ale to determine the classification for diagnosis and treatment. (Figure 1) The i ndeterminate class of HD will be described in section C. Figure 1 10 1. Tuberculoid (TT) Tuberculoid HD is characterized by limited disease with the presence of a few, well- defined hypopigmented skin lesions with marked sensory loss. Loss of hair in the lesion is common and there is often central healing. In the absence of treatment, the lesions enlarge s lowly. This ty pe of HD may be self -healing. (Figure 2 ) Figure 2 Histologically TT lesions reveal a very well organized epithelioid granuloma, with dense foci of lymphocytes. M. leprae are rare and hard to find in biopsies. Caseation can occur in nerves (Figure 1 1). 2. Borderline Tuberculoid (BT) When resistance is high, but not as strong as TT, skin lesions look like TT lesions, but there are too many for the disease to be classified as polar TT. (Figures 3 and 4) Figure 3 Figure 4 11 Histologically, BT lesions also show granulomatous inflammation , but not as compactly organized as TT. M. leprae are p resent in low numbers (Figure 1 1). 3. Mid-borderline (BB) In the mid- range of resist ance, the lesions show a mixed appearance, some looking like BT and others like BL lesions. Usually, BB lesions have very clearly defined areas of central healing (\"punched- out\" areas) with somewhat less well -defined outer edges. This is a unique characteristic of mid -range BB HD , which is considered an immunologically unstable form where such patients tend to shift clinically toward BT or Borderline Lepromatous ( BL). (Figure 5) Figure 5 Histologically, BB lesions contain poorly organized granulomas as well as collections of foamy histiocytes. The acid fast bacilli (AFB) seen are not numerous but are not diffi cult to find (Figure 11). 4. Borderline Lepromatous (BL) When resistance is lower, skin lesions look more like Lepromatous (LL) lesions with macules and nodules more sharply defined than in po lar LL, and with areas of normal looking skin between them. There is usually some asymmetry of the lesions, whereas in polar LL, they are symmetrical. (Figures 6 and 7 ). Figure 6 Figure 7 12 Histologically, BL lesions reveal poorly organized collections o f foamy macrophages and a substantial lymphocytic component. AFB are present in moderate to large numbers and are seen in almost every field, and may include clumps called 'globi' (Figure 1 1). 5. Lepromatous (LL) Lepromatous HD represents the extreme of the spectrum where the patient essentially has no resistance to the infection and the bacill i multiply uncontrollably. The highest concentrations are in skin and nerves, but ar e not confined to these sites. There may be a bacteremia, even though the patient se ldom feels ill. The skin lesions are numerous and may have vague margins . They may present as slightly hypopigmented macules , while in other cases the lesions may present as painless nodules or plaques. There is usually little or no loss of sensation in th e skin in the early lesions. There is a generalized infiltration of the skin, usually maximized in the cooler zones of the body such as the extremities or the eyebrows. Extensive anesthesia can develop, but motor nerve function is often well preserved. (Figure s 8, 9, 10). Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 10 The histological appearance in LL includes totally disorganized collections of foamy histiocytes with a small component of lymphocytes. AFB are present in very large numbers, often with many globi. Bacilli are found in large numbers in nasal mucous membranes, and may be seen in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, testes, eyes, smooth muscle, and blood vessel walls (Figure 11). 13 Figure 1 1 The histological spectrum of HD based on the Ridley -Jopling classification sysem .

Clinical Microbiology Reviews, April 2006 19 (2): 338 - 381. doi:10.1128/CMR.19.2.338- 381.2006 C. Other Types of HD Other types of HD are sufficiently distinctive to merit a separate description although, actually, they are varieties o f the established groups of HD. 1. Pure neural HD In this type of HD, one or more nerve trunks are damaged and/or enlarged, but no skin lesions are visible. Nerve biopsies show that these patients usually belong to the 14 tuberculoid end of the spectrum although the entire range of the HD spectrum has been described in neural HD. This type of HD is more common in India than in the U.S. 2. Indeterminate (I) There is also an indeterminate form of HD . This is the very earliest stage of the disease in which histological features and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing are insufficient to mak e a definitive classification. Clinically, the lesions consist of one or two vague hypopigmented macules, which may be slightly dry in texture, sweat less readily than usual, and have minimally impaired sensation. It is difficult to find acid fast bacilli in the lesion . If it progresses beyond the indeterminate stage, it develops into one o f the established forms of HD. 3. Diffuse Lepromatous Leprosy (DLL) DLL might be associated with infection with Mycobacterium lepromatosis . At times, these patients may be simul taneously infected with M. leprae . Patients will have a diffuse infiltration of the skin over most of the body, with a smooth shiny appearance and extensive loss of body hair, incl uding eyebrows and eyelashes. Some of these patients may develop a severe ty pe of reaction kn own as Lucio's phenomenon, which involves diffuse ulcerations of the skin. Experience at NHDP has shown that patients with confirmed infection of M. lepromatosis by PCR studies can exhibit an aggressive form of HD. Such patients develop multiple skin ulcers and necrotic skin lesions, which can be a challenge to treat. Intensive wound management and aggressive treatment of reactions when they develop appear to be necessary for the successful treatment of such patients. These patients often need inpatient specialized care. V. NERVE INVOLVEMENT IN HANSEN'S DISEASE A. Select Nerve Damage Damage to select cranial and peripheral nerves is the basis of serious HD co mplications that can lead to permanent nerve damage and subsequent deformity and disa bility . Because M. leprae and M. lepromatosis bacilli prefer cooler temperatures, the peripheral nerves susceptible to infection are at sites where the nerves emerge from under the muscles, surfacing near the skin. When the bacteria enters the nerve, infla mmation and swelling occur, which can lead to permanent damage including sensory loss, muscle paralysis and sweat gland dysfunction. The vulnerable sites and resulting deformities are shown in Figure 12. M. leprae and M.lepromatosis bacilli can infiltrate the facial and trigeminal cranial nerves. Damage to the facial nerve can cause muscle paralysis leading to lagophthalmos, while damage to the trigeminal nerve may result in loss of corneal sensation. If untreated, this nerve damage can lead to blindness. 15 Figure 12 B. Silent Neuritis Some patients have no signs of reaction or nerve pain, but continue to have progressive sensory or motor loss in hands or feet. Such patients need to be assessed to determine that they are receiving appropriate chemotherapy since noncompliance with medication intake could contribute to this pro blem. However, some patients take their medications regularly and still have deteriorating nerve function. This idiopathic deterioration may improve in some patients if they receive steroid t reatment. If the loss of function has been six months or less, they should be given a course of steroids in the dose range for reactions. If the loss has been present for longer than six months the cha nce of recovery is diminished. Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor all patients under treatment for any changes in nerve function and treat accordingly. VI. DIAGNOSIS and DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS A. Diagnosis of Hansen's Disease 1. Cardinal Signs Identifying t hese cardinal signs of leprosy can be useful in making a clinical diagnosis . a. Skin Lesions with Anesthesia Complete or partial anesthesia occurs almost exclusively in HD skin lesions. 16 (Note: Pure neural leprosy will not have skin lesions.) b. Nerve enlargement Enlarged and/or tender periphe ral nerves are palpated at specific anatomical sites shown in Figure s 15-21. 2. Presence of Acid -Fast Bacilli The only laboratory study that can definitively diagnos e HD is a skin biopsy. There are no serologic or microbiological tests able to diagnose HD. M. leprae and M. lepromatosis are non -cultivable. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies are helpful in some difficult diagnostic cases. PCR studies for M. leprae and M. lepromatosis are available commercially and are performed in some research laboratories . Skin biopsies can be processed and interpreted and PCR studies performed by the dermatopathologist at the NHDP in Baton Rouge, LA. (See Appendix A and B) B. Differential Diagnosis of the Skin Lesions HD skin lesions can mimic other skin diseases such as those listed below, but HD lesions, almost exclusively, have the cardinal sign of impaired sensation. 17 Table 2 .

There may be islands of preserved sensation on the hands or feet. 3.The tendon reflexes are preserved and position sense is usually intact. 4.Hansen's disease never involve s the central nervous system. http://www.internationaltextbookofleprosy.org/chapter/differential -diagnosis - leprosy See the website cited above for a more thorough discussion of the differ ential diagnosis of HD . VII.PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS The healthcare provider who first informs a patient about a diagnosis of HD sets the tone , which will convey either hope or fear . Fear increase s the patient's anxiety and perpetuate s the stigma and misunderstandings about HD. Even if the medical provider do es not have experience in treating HD, he/she should convey that medical resources are available for this disease and that the patient can be treated and cured. Acceptance of the pa tient by all clinical staff is vital since it helps the patient feel confident that HD is like other treatable diseases. By a ddressing the issues associated with stigma early during treatment, medical providers can decrease the negative effect on the patie nt. Moreover, by continuing to address the issue throughout treatment, the provider decreases the likelihood that patients will define themselves as leprosy patient s for the rest of their lives . The way in which patients view their lives and conceptualize the disease are decisive factors for their future mental health. Cultural background should also be considered . Various c ultures have differ ing belief systems that can affect stigma, treatment and compliance. Adherence to the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) is vital when caring for patients . People diagnosed with HD find that s tigma can manifest itself in prejudice, discrimination and emotional distress . Education al efforts begin with the patie nt and medical provider and extend to the family and community. The goal of all interventions associated with HD is that the patient is able to maintain or reclaim physical, mental and social well -being . 19 A.Stigma/myths The stigma surrounding HD can be more d amaging and enduring than the effect of the infection. Though HD is a treatable bacterial infection, the magnitude of the stigma can affect the patient's physical status, mental health and interpersonal relationships. Demystifying HD is an essential intervention to help the patient cope with HD and its stigma. In the early stages of educating patients about the medical aspects of HD, it is important to emphasize that it is treatable and curable. B.Living with the diagnosis Personal concerns arise for all patients as they interact with the people in their lives: Whom to tell? What to tel l? When to tell others? Signs of deformity, skin rashes, or reaction may force patients to deal with these questions sooner than they had hoped. Medical p rovide rs can help a patient decide what works best in his/her particular situa tion. Information should be given to patients about treatment resources for HD and support resources for coping with the di sease, treatment and stigma. C.Common concerns and questions : Initial reactions to a diagnosis of HD include : 1.Disbelief - unaware that leprosy still exists 2.Confusion - wondering how and when they caught HD and if it is treatable 3.Fear of contagion - concern about \"spreading HD\" to family and friends 4.Fear of rejection and social isolation - often associated with images from the Bible, movies, etc. wondering if their appearance will change, if deformities are inevitable 5.Feelings of shame - associated with religious/cultural connotations of punishment, being cursed 6.Feelin gs of depression or despair - thinking their life as they knew it, is over Family members and others significant in the patient's life are likely to have the same reactions, fears and misconceptions. Providing the same education and support to them (with the patient's permission) helps not only the family and significant others, but also the patient. 20 D.Psychiatric disorders This disease carries a number of psychosocial issues, which lead to a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders among patients with HD than in the general population. Depression is the most common disorder found in HD patients. Early detection and treatment of psychiatric disorders is a powerful psychotherapeutic measure. Integrated behavioral healthcare improves outcomes. VIII. CLINICAL EVALUATION A.Patient Interview 1.Do you have the following s ymptoms ? a.No pain with injuries such as cuts or burns b.Wounds or ulcers that will not heal c.Skin rash that has not responded to conventional treatment d.Recurrent nosebleeds e.Chronic nasal congestion f.Burnin g sensation or loss of sensation on the hands or feet g.Painful or tender peripheral nerves h.Eye problems (red sclera, poor blink reflex, corneal ulcers, lagophthalmos) i.Hair loss in areas of the body, especially the eyebrows and eyelashes j.Fever, joint pain, malaise k.Enlarged lymph glands l.Testicular pain or enlargement m.Eye pain with or without redness 2.When did the symptoms first appear and how have they progressed over time? 3.Where have you already sought treatment? 4. Were you diagnosed with HD on his first medical visit or were you initially diagnosed with a different disease? 5.What treatments have already been tried? 6. Do you have a family history of HD? 7.What is your travel history ? B.Examination of the Patient Every patient with suspected HD should have a careful examination directed to the skin and its appendages (hair and sweat/oil gland activity), eyes, nose, ears, neck, extremities, chest , 21 abdomen, back, testes, and lymph nodes. The main goal of the examinat ion is to confirm or exclude the cardinal signs listed above (Section VI-A). 4.Skin : It is important to perform a complete examination of the skin in good light. Hypo - pigmented or hyper -pigmented flat or raised lesions may be found on the face, ears, trunk, extremities, buttocks, or thighs. Absence of sweating, hair loss, or changes in texture of the skin may also be present. Any suspected skin lesion should be examined for light touch, preferably with a sensory monofilament , but a cotton wisp or similar item, which can detect light touch, may suffice for an initial screen. S kin lesions may manifest as macules, papules and /or nodules. There may be skin ulcers, tender red nodules, and edema of the face, ears, and extremities . Anasarca may occur in type I (reversal reaction ) but especially occurs in type II (ENL) rea ctions . Also, examine for loss of hair (alopecia), especially madarosis (loss of eyebrows and eyelashes), dry, cracked, and fissured skin , and dry scaly eruption on the legs . 5.Eyes : Eye Screen Form (Appendix F) Other than the skin and nerves, the eyes are the most frequently affected organs in Hansen's disease. HD can affect the eyes by direct invasion or nerve damage. a. Direct Invasion Direct invasion of the anterior part of the eye by M. leprae and M. lepromatosis causes subsequent inflammation and can result in episcleritis, scleritis and/or iridocyclitis. Long -term oral steroid therapy, used to treat these conditions may ause cataract s and glaucoma. b. Nerve Damag e 1.Facial Nerve (7th Cranial Nerve): The Facial Nerve i nnervate s the orbicularis oculi muscles surrounding the eye and is not palpable . Paralysis causes lagophthalmos and subsequent corneal exposure resulting in high risk for injury and blindness. Damage to the seventh cranial nerve can also cause facial deformities due to muscle paresis or paralysis, i.e. seventh cranial nerve palsy . 22 2.Trigeminal Nerve (5th Cranial Nerve): The trigeminal nerve is not palpable. The sensory distribution includes the cornea of the eye. Damage results in loss of corneal sensation and the patient may the eye. This raises risk of eye injury and blindness. All HD patients should have at least a recording of visual acuity, a simple evaluation for lid closure and evaluation for any evidence of redness or eye pain. T hese simple examination procedures can prevent further ocular morbidity and blindness. An ophtha lmologist should examine patients with any evidence of an eye problem that includes vision loss, lagophthalmos (incomplete eye closure) , red eye and cataract. Surgical procedures of the eye, such as tarsorrhaphy temporalis muscle transfer; laser iridectomy , and trabeculoplasty for cases of glaucoma and cataract may be indicated. 3.No se Look for signs of erosive epistaxis.

Great Auricular Nerve 23 5.Extremities : A. Upper Extremity - (Hand Screen Form - Appendix G) The NHDP Hand Screen is specifically designed to identify issues representative of nerve damage from HD. The hand s creen is required at diagnosis for a baseline status, and on a routine basis to monitor the nerve s tatus of the upper extremity for early changes. Evaluation includes sensory testing , muscle testing, skin integrity, nerve palpation, and identification of deformity. Inflamed nerves are at risk of damage causing secondary problems including sensory and motor deficits. The nerves commonly affected are located at sites in the upper extremities where they are superficial and easy to palpate . Palpation of the upper extremity nerves affected by HD is shown in F igures 16-18. 1. Ulnar Nerve Located proximal to the cubital tunnel of the elbow Motor function- intrinsic muscles of the hand - paralysis inclu des clawing of the 4th and 5th f ingers and a weak pinch.

The foot screen is required at diagnosis for a baseline s tatus, and on a routine basis to monitor the nerve status of the lower e xtremity for early changes. Evaluation includes sensory testing , muscle test ing, skin integrity, nerve palpation, and identification of deformity . Nerves of the lower extremity affected by HD include (Figures 19-21): 1. Peroneal Nerve - Located posterior/distal to the fibular head at lateral knee Motor function - anterior tibialis - dorsiflexion of the foot -p aralysis can cause drop footSensory distribution - dorsum of the foot Figure 19.

Sural Nerve 6.Joints and Tendons Arthritis and tenosynovitis can occur non- and reactive disease of borderline lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous leprosy (LL). 7.Breasts In males, gynecomastia can occur in non -reactive disease and mastitis in females with ENL. 8.Testicles Testicles can be involved in non -reactive disease and as orchitis in reactive disease (ENL.) Ask male patients about pain or swelling of the testicles and examine for erythematous nodules. 25 9.Lymph nodes Tender lymphadenitis may reaction. C.Laboratory Studies 1.Skin Biopsy (Appendix A) Skin biopsy is the only lab test that can diagnose Hansen' s disease . 2.PCR Assay (Polymerase Chain Reaction) (Appendix B) At NHDP, PCR assay is performed routinely on all samples. 3. Slit Skin Smears (Appendix C) Results of Fite stained skin smears gives the clinician an assessment of the range and severity of the patient's infection. It can also be used to assess response to treatment or the degree of bacterial load affecting the severity of the patient's Type 1 or Type 2 reaction. For reliable results, slit skin smears need to be performed by a properly trained laboratory tech nician. D.Special Considerations 1.HD and Pregnancy: A female with HD who is pregnant is uncommon in the U.S., but a few cases occur each year. The majority of these pregnancies are uneventful as far as HD is concerned, but there are a number of potential problems and risks that should be considered when advising female HD patients of childbearing age, and when managing pregnant patientswho have HD. All female patients of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy duringearly stages of the disease, at least until MDT has been completed and preferably, until the disease is completely inactive. The postponement of pregnancy is especiallyimportant for patients who have evidence of reaction or neuritis since these problemswill be exacerbated during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additionally, the drugs needed to treat reaction s can be teratogenic. There are alterations in the immune response during all pregnancies, causing adepression of the cell -mediated immune (CMI) system. This immune suppression during pregnancy and its recovery in the postpartum period appears to play a role in the clinicalmanifestations of HD in women. It is common for the first symptom of HD in young women to occur during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. ENL is more common during pregnancy when the CMI is depressed, while reversalreaction is more common during the postpartum period when the CMI is recovering.The risk of reactions or neuritis during pregnancy will vary considerably with the type of disease and the amount of treatment a patient has received prior to the pregnancy. If a reaction occurs during a pregnancy, it should be managed as in non -pregnant patients26 with the use of prednisone s ufficient to control the reaction and prevent nerve damage. Use of Thalidomide is contraindicated and cannot be used under any circumstances . For patients who are or become pregnant during the early stages of the disease, chemotherapy should generally cont inue during pregnancy with some modification of the treatment regimen . Dapsone can be continue d throughout the pregnancy but avoid the use of rifampin during pregnancy if possible. Clofazimine can be safely given but it can cause hyperpigmentation in the m other and the child. Patients who have had HD sometime in the past, who have been adequately treated and cured , and whose disease is now completely inactive, can expect to have essentially normal pregnancies. There is no risk of the mother transmitting the disease to infants in such cases. 2. HD and Children: HD in children is uncommon in the U.S., but when it does occur , it is usually the indeterminate or tuberculoid type disease. It is usu ally a benign disease with very few deformities reported. Management o f the disease is generally the same as for adults except for the adjustment of drug dosages based on the patient's weight to be determined by the physician. Transmission of HD to children or adults should not occur after the patient starts on treatment. Pr eventive treatment is not generally recommended for child contacts. The presence of new cases in children usually indicates that HD is still being transmitted in the general population. 3. Testicular HD: Direct invasion of the testicles probably occurs in mos t cases of Borderline Lepromatous and Lepromatous disease. The testicles are a cool part of the body and are preferentially affected. If HD is not treated early, there is progressive destruction of testicular tissue and eventually testicular atrophy with s terility and a decrease in testosterone production. Acute orchitis may d evelop during ENL and may be an indication for prednisone therapy. Testicular atrophy is usually permanent. After testicular function is destroyed, the only treatment is testosterone r eplacement. This does not restore fertility but is helpful in restoring sexual potency. Injectables are the preferred route for replacement therapy. Oral androgens are not recommended for long -term therapy because of potential liver toxicity. E. HD Surveillan ce Form (Appendix D) The HD Surveillance Form is the document used to report leprosy cases to the US NHDP registry. The surveillance form is only required one time, when a patient has been newly diagnosed . F. Follow -Up Visit 1. Patient Interview 2. Examination of the patient 27 3.Laboratory monitoring (See Lab Monitoring schedule - Table 5 ) 4.Annual biopsy is recommended 5.Skin Smears annually (optional) 6.Eye, Hand and Foot Screens (See Frequency of Performance in Section XVI ) 7.Patient Education every clinic visit IX. TREATME NT OF HANSEN'S DISEASE While the care of an individual diagnosed with HD involves considerably more than prescribing medication, the appropriate drug combination is the most important step toward curing the infection. Health care providers should emphasize to their patient the importance of taking all medications for the duration of treatment. This section will provide an overview of the medications used to treat HD, potential side effects, and alternative medications that may be used if complications arise . Read package inserts for complete information regarding each medication and contact the NHDP for questions not answeredin the material below. A.Chemotherapy : The Anti -Leprosy Drugs 1. Dapsone Dapsone is bacteriostatic and therefore, must be used in combination with other antibiotics. Dapsone monotherapy may cause drug resistance . Dapsone is available in 25 and 100 mg white tablets. The normal dose is 50 mg or 100 mg daily with or without food. Side Effects : A mild hemolytic anemia is common . Patients who have a glucose -6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency cannot take dapsone an d will need an alternate drug . Rare cases of agra nulocytosis have been reported. Dapsone allergy is rare, but if it occurs, it could be mistaken as an HD reaction. Severe case s may develop dermatitis, fever, hepatitis , or even Stevens -Johnson syndrome. 2.Rifampin Rifampin is a vailable as a 150 mg and 300 mg reddish capsule. It is the most effective bactericidal drug given as a 600mg daily dose . Rifampin is absorbed best when taken on an empty stomach, 1 hour before eating or 2 hours after eating. Side Effects : Elevated liver function tests (especially ALT, AST). Rifampin should be discontinued if the ALT or AST rises to more than two and one half times normal. Rifampin enhances the toxicity of alcohol. Occasionally patients will develop thrombocytopenia and therefore platelet counts should be monitored . Patients must be advised that urine and other bodily fluids will turn a reddish color. Drug Interactions : There are a number of drug interactions with rifampin including steroids , oral contraceptives, warfarin, among many others .28 3.Clofazimine Clofazimine is a lipophilic dye that has antibacterial and anti -inflammatory properties. It is available as a brown 50 mg gelatin capsule. The serum half -life of the drug is about 10 days and the tissue half -life may be up to 70 days. The recommended antibacterial dose is 50 mg daily with fatty food. Side E ffects : Clofazimine gives t he skin a re d to blue/black discoloration, more marked in HD skin l esions than in u naffected skin. Sun exposure intensifies the di scoloration. The color takes s everal weeks t o develop a nd may take 2 y ears or longer to d isappear after the dr ug is discontinued. NOTE: S ome patients a re so di stressed by the di scoloration that they di scontinue the medication w ithout i nforming the p hysician. I t is imp ortant, therefore, to a lert t he patient in advance tha t this i s a possible side e ffect. If the patient can agree to ta ke it, and minimize t he e ffect by a voiding the s un, the b enefit of Clofazimine w ill far o utweigh the temporary is sue o f discoloration. Other s ide e ffects include dr yness a nd itching o f the s kin a nd eyes. Special a cquisition requirements: Clofazimine, used f or decades t o treat H D around t he w orld, is no longer availa ble in the US commercially . The o nly w ay to o btain the drug in the U.S . is by c ompleting an investigational n ew d rug (IND) a pplicatio n through the F ood Dr ug A dministration (FDA). The N HDP holds the IND #67.033 for i ts use in treating H D in t he U .S. To obtain the drug for tr eating HD patients , physicians have to register as an investigator un der t he NHDP IND. This re quire s submitting a signed FD A form 1572 an d curriculum v itae to the NHDP. A packet of in formation , incl uding f orm 1572 a nd consent f orms, e tc., will be provided. An Institutional Review Board (I RB) of the Centers fo r Disease C ontrol (CDC) act s as the central I RB fo r the use o f Clofazimine f or Hansen's disease, so that i ndividual physicians do not ne ed to a rrang e these themselves. For f urther i nform ation regarding receiving Clofazimine for tr eatment of HD, or enroll ing as an investiga tor under the IRB held by CDC, please, contact: National Hansen's Disease Programs 9181 drug therapy (MDT) has been used by the NHDP to treat patients since the 1970's. WHO introduced MDT globally in 1982 with a slightly different protocol than NHDP recommend s. The U.S. protocol s involve a longer duration of treatment with standard guidelines as follows in Table 4. 29 Table 4 MULTIDRUG THERAPY REGIMENS for Newly Diagnosed Patients Dapsone Rifampin Clofazimine Length of TX Paucibacillary (TT ,BT, I) Option 1 100 mg/daily 600 mg/daily 12 months Option 2 100 mg/daily 600 mg/monthly 12 months Multibacillary (LL, BL, BB) Option 1 100 mg/daily 600 mg/daily 50 mg/daily 24 months Option 2 100 mg/daily 600 mg/monthly 50 mg/daily 24 months In general, NHDP recommend s Option 1 protocols that include daily rifampin. Option 2 is used for patients on prednisone. For immunologically compromised or elderly patients, these protocols may be modified. Consultation with the NHDP is advised (800 -642-2477) . The recommended duration of treatment is sufficient to kill leprosy bacilli, even though large numbers of dead organisms may remain in the tissues for several years before they are physiologically eliminated. There is no evidence that additional or prolonged treatment hastens the elimination of these dead organisms. C.Alternative Anti -Microbial Agents The main indication for the use of alternative anti -microbial agents is intolerance for the recommended drugs or drug -drug interaction . 1.Minocycline, 100 mg daily, can be used as a substitute for dapsone in individuals who do not tolerate it . It can also be used instead of Clofazimine, although evidence of the ef ficacy of its anti- inflammatory activity against Type 2 reactions is not as substantial as the evidence for Clofazimine . Minocycline causes photosensitivity and sunscreen is highly recommended during use. Minocy cline is not to be used during pregnancy. 2.Clarithromycin XL, 500 mg daily is also effective against HD and can be used as a substitute for any of the other drugs in a multiple drug regimen. 3.Levo floxacin, 500 mg monthly , may be used in place of Rifampin , for adults, but is not recommended for children.30 D. Special Considerations 1. Treatment for Pregnant Women: While pregnancy during HD treatment is strongly discouraged, in the event that it occurs, modifications to the medication regime is described in Table 5 . Table 5 Pregnant Women Diagnosed with Hansen's Disease Dapsone Rifampin * Clofazimine Length of TX Paucibacillary 50 mg daily with folic acid 600mg daily 12 months Multibacillary 50 mg daily with folic acid 600mg daily 50mg/daily 24 months * Rifampin is taken monthly if the patient is on prednisone. 2. Treatment for Children: In the United States, the occurrence of leprosy in children is fairly low. The general guidelines for HD treatment for children is found in Table 4, however, i t is strongly recommend ed to contact the NHDP for management of leprosy in child ren. Table 6 CHILDREN - MULTIDRUG THERAPY REGIMENS for Newly Diagnosed Dapsone Rifampin * Clofazimine Length of Paucibacillary mg/kg 1 mg/kg daily 24 months *Rifampin is taken monthly if the patient is on prednisone. 3. Testicular HD If testicular function is destroyed by HD, the only treatment is testosterone replacement. This does not restore fertility but is helpful in restoring sexual potency and general well- being . Injectables are the preferred route for testosterone replacement therapy. 31 E. Laboratory Monitoring Table 7 Laboratory Monitoring for Drugs Used to Treat Hansen's Disease Drug Laboratory Studies Frequency Initial studies for all drugs CBC w/platelets, UA, CMP, G6PD, CRP, Sed Every 3 months Rifampin CBC w/platelets, CMP Every 3 months Clofazimine No recommended laboratory studies Thalidomide * CBC with differential Every 3 months Methotrexate * CBC, CMP Every 3 months *Drugs used in managing reactions ( see below Section X -Immunological Reactions ) F. PROGNOSIS Patient isolation is unnecessary since HD is difficult to transmit to another person before treatment and impossible to transmit after 72 hours on treatment . The majority of patients are able to continue normal activities and occupations with little interruption in their daily routines during treatment. Success of Hansen's disease treatment is measured by completion of prescribed medication and by absence of deformity and disability due to nerve damage. Most patients in the U.S. have little or no disability at the time of diagnosis. If recent nerve damage or neuritis is present when diagnosed, prompt treatment may improve the patient's nerve status or at least prevent further damage to the nerves . While the prescribed multidrug regimen minimizes the possibility of nerve damage , 30-40% of patients have recurrent episodes of reaction during treatment with possible nerve damage. Unfortunately, nerves damaged for years prior to diagnosis will not recover, and disabilities are permanent. G. Follow -Up after Completion of Treatment Clinical examinations are performed at the following intervals after MDT is complete: 1. Paucibacillary (PB) - Annually up to two years 2. Multibacillary (MB) - Annually up to three years Annual follow -up forms are completed at each yearly follow -up visit. Skin biopsies are performed at the doctor's discretion. X. IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTION S Reports indicate that up to 50% of all HD patients will experience an acute hypersensitivity or immunological reaction to the M. leprae organism during the course of their disease. Table 6 identifies the two types of reactions and how they correspond with the 32 WHO/Ridley- Jopling classification. Table 7 includes a summary of the differences between reversal (Type I) and ENL (Type II) reaction s. Unfortunately, t here are no predictors to identify which patients will develop a reaction. Patients who do develop reaction should be monitored closely as they are at a higher risk of nerve damage and subsequen t disabilities and deformities. Table 8 WHO and Ridley -Jopling classifications with corresponding Reaction types Paucibacillary Multibacillary TT BT BB BL LL No Reaction Reversal Reaction (RR) Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) A. Reversal Reaction (RR or Type 1 Reaction) Reversal reaction is recognized by the development of edema and erythema in existing skin lesions. Severe cases are characterized by fever, edema of the hands and feet, and erythema of pre -existing skin lesions , which occasiona lly ulcerate. Reversal reaction s can also involve the nerves. Edema and granuloma formation may lead to sudden nerve damage, with swelling and pain in one or more of the commonly affected nerve trunks. While re versal reaction generally occurs during the first 6 -12 months of treatment, it may occur later, even after drug treatment is complete . Reversal reaction is also seen in untreated HD, and sometimes its onset is the event that makes the patient dec ide to seek medical attention. If a patient remains untreated, the reaction m ight subside after a few weeks . However, a Type I reaction can also persist, with the lesions becoming more extensive. Reversal reaction is an acute exacerbation of the normal cell mediated immune response to M. leprae . It is one of the most clear- cut examples of delayed -type hypersensitivity causing clinical disease. While the precipitating event is unclear, it seems likely that the bacilli residing in Schwann cells are for some reason , suddenly \"recognized\" by the cell -mediated immune system. As a result, the patient's peripheral and dermal nerves are damaged or destroyed along with the bacilli. Pathology reports may show edema, epithelioid granuloma formation, and an influx of lymphocytes , but this is not diagnostic of Type I reaction. B. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL or Type 2 Reaction) ENL typically appears as transient red nodules in the skin, which are often tender and painful. The nodules can appear on almost any part o f the body, including the face, and will appear on previously normal skin. The nodules resolve in 7 -10 days, often leaving a characteristic mottled hyperpigmen tation. Patients with ENL often have fever and experience a generalized illness. There may be associated attack s of painful neuritis, 33 arthritis, lymphadenopathy, uveitis , and orchitis, though it is unusual for all of these to be present at the same time. Edema of the extremities is common. In severe cases of ENL , the patient may have hepatosplenomegaly, high fever and/or a clinical presentation that resembles Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Skin nodules are usually present. ENL may be episodic with attacks occurring every month or two . In some cases, these episodic attacks come so frequently that the reac tion is considered continuous. In such cases, it often persists for 2 years or more. If an ENL reaction remains untreated, new crops of nodules will continue to appear. Edema of the hands and feet is common and neuritis can produce extensive nerve dam age. ENL occurs in patients who have large amounts of circulating anti- mycobacterial antibodies, and is proposed to be a clinical manifestation of antigen -antibody immune complex formation. The immune complexes are usually formed extravascularly in sites w here M. Leprae are present in high concentration, such as skin, nerves, lymph nodes and testes. These complexes elicit an inflammatory response, which results in the clinical manifestations of ENL. It also has been shown that tumor necrosis factor alpha is elevated during ENL and decreases as the reaction subsides. ENL occurs most commonly in patients who are receiving MDT but can occur before treatment or long after treatment is completed . The antigen in this reaction is from dead M. leprae . ENL reaction is characterized by foci of neutrophil infiltration with fragmented M. leprae and associated vasculitis. After a few days, as the lesion is resolving, the neutrophils are replaced by loose collections of lymphocytes. 34 Table 9 Summary: Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) and Type 2 (ENL) Differences Type of reaction Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) Type 2 (ENL) Mechanism Cell-mediated; delayed hypersensitivity reaction Antigen antibody (immune complex) reaction Skin Mild: -red, mildly swollen skin lesions -no lesions on the face -no edema hands, feet or face Severe : -painful, swollen skin lesions -ulceration/threatening ulceration of skin -swollen lesions on the face -edema of hands, feet, faceMild : -minimal pain; or ulcerating skin lesions-common on the face, extensor surfaces of arms and legs.-edema of hands and feet Constitutional symptoms Good.

TREATMENT OF REACTIONS AND NEURITIS Reactions are a major cause of nerve damage; subsequently the focus of management should be on preventing or minimizing nerve damage . Damage to the nerves is caused by inflammation within the nerve due to intraneural M. leprae , which is similar to the process seen in the skin. In untreated HD without reaction, nerve damage is more insidious, while in35 reaction, nerves may be damaged within days . Skin reactions and acute neuritis often occur together. See Table 8 for a s ummary of treatment recommendations for reactions. A. Treatment of Reversal Reaction (Type 1 Reaction) 1. Mild reaction Mild reaction is characterized by the presence of edema and erythema of existing skin lesions only. There may be low -grade fever and some gene ral discomfort. If there are any signs of neuritis such as nerve enlargement, pain, tenderness or loss of nerve function, the reaction is no longer considered mild and should be managed as a severe reaction. The treatment of mild reaction is symptomatic with analgesics such as NSAIDS. However, such patients must be observed closely for deterioration of nerve function which requ ires more aggressive treatment. Antibacterial treatment for HD should be continued at full dosage during a mild reaction. 2. Severe r eaction Severe reaction is characterized by the presence of any of the following: Nerve pain and/or nerve function impairment (sensory or motor) -This is usually but not always associated with nerve tenderness. Edema of the hands and/or feet Fever and syst emic symptoms such as malaise Joint Pain Swollen and tender skin lesions: facial lesions indicate risk of facial nerve damage Ulceration of inflamed skin lesions a. Prednisone In severe reaction s, an overactive immune response causes tissue damage; therefore , treatment i nvolves immunosuppression with corticosteroids. The initial dose of prednisone range s between 60-80 mg in a daily single morning dose. This dose is tapered to 40 -60 mg within 2 weeks. It is gradually tapered until eliminated over a period of 2 -6 months, depending on the severity of the reaction and the response to treatment. Some patients require even higher doses than those mentioned. The main objective is to provide sufficient prednisone to relieve the patient's symptoms and prevent nerve damage. If at any dosage level the clinical signs of reaction persist or recur, the dose is increased 20 -30 mg per day until the symptoms resolve , at which time , slow tapering of the dos age can begin again. Individualized dosing is tailored by clinical res ponse. Patients with co - morbidities, such as diabetes, may need steroid sparing drugs such as methotrexate (see below). 36 Rapid improvement of nerve function occur s most often in situations when the lesion is of recent onset (less than six months) . On the ot her hand, regeneration and recovery of function following severe nerve damage will take many months or may not occur at all. Therefore, lack of nerve function improve ment is not necessarily an indication to increase the dosage of prednisone or prolong the period of steroid treatment. b.Clofazimine In select cases, a trial of Clofazimine 200-300 mg daily for 6 -12 months may be indicated. Clofazimine is not quic k acting in regards to its anti -inflammatory effect. The patient may have to take it for 6 weeks or more for the full effect of this drug to be evident. c.Surgery On a rare o ccasion, if a nerve trunk remain s markedly enlarged and the patient complains of persistent nerve pain in spite of intensive steroid treatment , consider surgical consultation (See Section XIII on Surgical Interventions) . B.Treatment of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL - Type 2 Reaction) The management of ENL will vary somewhat depending on whether the reaction is mild or severe and whether it is intermittent or continuous. 1.Mild re action: When the reaction is mild , the patient develops minor attacks of ENL in the skin, which last for several weeks and then resolve. There may be low-grade fever and malaise, and mild nerve pain or tenderness but without loss of function. Mild reaction s can be managed symptomatically with analgesics. A patient may then be free of a reaction for several months. 2.Severe reaction: These patients often present to the Emergency Room and are thought to be septic. One or more of the following are present: Fever and malaise Elevated white blood cell count Painful and ulcerating skin lesions Nerve pain and/or nerve tenderness with palpation Sudden loss of sensation or muscle weakness in hands, feet, or eyes. Edema of the hands and/or feet Joint pain Orchitis37 Red painful eye (Uveitis, Scleritis) Headaches If the physician is inexperienced in treating this reaction, consider contacting the NHDP 1-800-642-2477. a.Prednisone 40 -80 mg daily is initiated as a single morning dose. After the reaction is controlled, a slow tapering of the dose by 5 mg every 1 -2 weeks is started. If the reaction recurs, the dose is adjusted to control the reaction. Severe reactions, especially those with evidence of nerve damage, may require prolonge d treatment with corticosteroids . In the U.S., many patients with ENL have a chronic and continuous reaction and therefore require continuous steroid treatment. If steroids are required for 2 -3 months, the reaction can be expec ted to persist for a year or longer. Steroid sparing drugs should be initiated as soon as possible to avoid steroid dependency and side effects. During reactions, antibacterial treatment should be continued in full dosage. The one exception to this is patients on daily rifampin who are requiring prednisone to control reactions. Rifampin induces liver enzymes which results in fast metabolism of prednisone and decreases its clinical benefit. Therefore, such patients will usually benefit from switching the rifampin from 600mg each day to 600 mg monthly dose . b. Thalidomide is the drug of choice for ENL . It is a TNF alpha inhibitor. Thalidomide is prescribed based on the severity of the symptoms, but a normal dose is 200 mg taken at bedtime as drowsiness is a side effect. Thalidomide is teratogenic caus ing severe birth defect s if taken by women during pregnancy. Women of child bearing age must use two forms of birth control and take a monthly pregnancy test while on therapy. Thalidomide is tightly regulated by Celgene Corporation Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS ) program. See website: https://www.celgeneriskmanagement.com c.Clofazimine can be given in a divided dose of 200 mg daily for several months, and then reduced to 100 mg daily. The addition of Clofazimine at these doses will usually make it possible to reduce the dose of steroids required, but not eliminate thementirely. Clofazimine is not quick acting and it may take 6 weeks or more for the full effect on the reaction to be noted. Patients receiving larg er doses of Clofazimine will have more skin pigmentation changes and possibly more frequent gastrointestinal side effects. When the patient has required no steroids for approximately three months, the dosage of Clofazimine can be reduced to 50 mg daily. If the Clofazimine is not required for antibacterial treatment, it can be discontinued when no steroids have been required for an additional three months.38 d. Methotrexate Prior to starting Methotrexate, or before restarting after a rest period, pretreatment assessments should include: 1.Full blood count including differential blood count and platelets 2.Liver function tests including serum albumin 3.Renal function tests 4.Exclude Hepatitis B and C if clinically indicated 5.Exclude TB if clinically indicated. Methotrexate dosed weekly is used as a steroid sparing agent. The dose can be titrated upward weekly. The maintenance dose is 15 -25 mg once weekly. Patients should be closely monitored so that toxic side effects can be detected as early as possible. Baseline assessment should include CBC with differential and platelet count, hepatic enzymes and renal function tests. These should be repeated every 1 to 2 months. It is recommended that 1 mg folic acid should be taken daily except on the day of the weekly dose. The medication should be stopped if mouth sores or diarrhea develops . Methotrexate is contradicted in pregnancy. C.Lucio's Phenomenon Patients experiencing Lucio 's Phenomenon are acutely ill. In addition to standard antibacterial treatment, these patients ar e treated similar to those with ENL using a high dose of Clofazimine, steroids and T halidomide. Close attention should be given to skin ulcerations which can cover the extremities. D.Patient Education Regarding Reactions An important part of management of reactions is providing correct information and listening to the concerns of patients and their families. Patients usually fear that treatment has failed, their disease is getting worse and they will suffer permanent disability and disfigurement. In chronic reactions, especially ENL, patients often become depressed. It should be emphasized that a reaction does not indicate a failure of antibacterial treatment or toxicity to drugs. Reactions are due to the immune system reacting to the dead bacteria. Patients can always be reassured that HD and reactions are treatable conditions and that even long standing reactions will eventually end. In the vast majority of cases, the long - term prognosis is good and there should not be any further progression of nerve damage or disability after the initiation of treatment. Patients must understand that discontinuing medication is NOT a good option. 39 Table 10 Summary: Treatment of Reactions Reversal Reaction (Type 1) Mild Symptoms Severe Symptoms -erythematous, mildly swollen skin lesions -no painful or tender nerves -no lesions of the face -no edema of the face, hands or feet-painful swollen skin lesions -ulceration or threatening ulceration of skin -swollen lesions of the face -edema of the hands, feet, or fac e -diminished sensation or muscle weakness in hands/feet Treatment Treatment -analgesics for 1 -2 weeks -Prednisone - 40-80 mg single daily dose 5 -7 days then tapered to elimination in 2 -6 months (Always use prednisone for neuritis) -Clofazimine - in selected cases , trial of 300 mg daily up to 3 months. If effective, continue at reduced dose 200 mg for 3 months, followed by 100 mg for additional 6 months Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (Type 2) Mild Symptoms Severe Symptoms -afebrile or only mild f ever -minimal pain and no ulcerating skin lesions -no painful or tender nerves -no eye problems-febrile systemic illness -painful or ulcerating skin lesions -painful or tender nerves -diminished sensation or muscle weakness or hands or feet -edema of the hands and/or feet -uveitis, scleritis, arthritis, orchitis, proteinuria Treatment Treatment -analgesics for 1 -2 weeks May be repeated several times if reactionremains mild-Prednisone - 40-80 mg daily tapered to lowes t dose required to co ntrol the reaction (Always use prednisone for neuritis)-Thalidomide 300 mg daily in divided doses, tapered to 100 -200 mg daily within 2 weeks, then given 50 -200 mg daily for as long as required to control the reaction-Clofazimine - 300 mg daily for 6 we eks, 200 mg daily 2 -6 months, and 100 mg daily for 1 -2 years Combination s of above regimes may be used. During the prescribed time of treatment, all antibiotics should be continued during all types of reactions. Rifampin reduces the effectiveness of all steroids, including prednisone , so it is necessary to decrease the dosing of rifampin from a daily dose to a monthly dose to obtain an optimal therapeutic response to prednisone. The dose of prednisone may need to be increased on the day that rifampin is t aken. A practical guide for the dose of prednisone in neuritis is that the initial doses should be large enough to relieve the pain and tenderness in the nerves in 24 -48 hours. The maintenance dose should be large enough to prevent recurrence of the nerv e pain. An exception to this would be patients who have had long -standing neuritis with persistent pain probably due to scarring in and around nerves, but whose nerve function status has been stable for a long period. Prednisone is not usually beneficial i n such patients. 40 XII. PREVENTION OF DISABILITY (POD) Images of deformity and disability still prompt the fear and stigma associated with leprosy (HD). Early diagnosis and treatment, before nerves are damaged, is the best prevention of the deformity and t he stigma. If significant nerve damage has occurred, a long -term management program using a team approach is needed . Routine care for insensitive eyes, hands and feet is crucial to minimize or even prevent deformity. The POD team will include some or all of the following professions: physician, nurse, occupational therapist, physical therapist, ophthalmologist, pedorthist, podiatrist, orthotist, social worker, surgeon and pharmacist. Each team member brings specific ex pertise that collectively provides comprehensive intervention to prevent or minimize deformity. The NHDP developed a five step P revention of Disability Program that outlines the components of essential preventative care. The following are the f ive componen ts of the NHDP POD Program. 1. Ey e, Hand and Foot Screening (Appendix F , G, H ) Ba seline and routine evaluation of the eyes, hands and feet is foundational for objectively measuring the patient's nerve status. The goal of screening is to identify sensory loss, muscle weakness/paralysis, anatomical deformity, enlarged/tender nerves and autonomic dysfunction. During treatment with MDT, screen s are performed quarterly to identify changes in peripheral nerve function. During reaction, screens may be performed as of ten as monthly to detect early nerve changes for immediate treatment. Based on results of the eye, hand and foot screens, referral to appropriate medical and therapeutic interventions can prevent or minimize nerve damage and subsequent deformity. 2. Patient E ducation (See Appendix I - Healthy Eyes, Hands, and Feet for a Lifetime) Patients need to be educated on the autonomic, sensory and motor issues associated with peripheral nerve damage due to HD. They need to understand how to protect inflamed nerves, hydra te dry eyes and skin, protect insensate areas and know who to contact at the first sign of relevant problems. It is critical for patients to understand the concept of \"loss of protective sensation\" (LOPS). Without protective sensation, the patient can sustain injuries, burns or ulcers f rom trauma or repetitive pressure without feeling any pain. Patients with LOPS need education on methods to compensate for their lack of pain sensation, such as frequent inspection, protective equipment for the eyes and hands , and appropriate footwear. 3. Daily Self- Inspection Patients with LOPS, anatomical deformities or current/previous history of ulcers are taught to carefully inspect their eyes, hands and feet on a daily basis. They are to seek immediate treatment if they ide ntify areas of redness, swelling, blisters, callus or wounds. Most patients with LOPS need constant reinforcement to develop and maintain effective self -inspection habits to prevent small issues from becoming major problems. While it is ideal for patients to inspect their own eyes and limbs, a family member or friend may need to assist if the patient is physically unable to perform daily inspection. 41 4.Management of Problems Patients with enlarged/tender nerves, LOPS, weakness, deformities, thickened nails/callus and wounds require regular follow -up. A nerve affected by HD may become inflamed and swollen causing tingling, pain or weakness in that particular limb. As a result, a patient may be inclined to move the arm or leg in an attempt to relieve the discomfort or to strengthen the weak limb. This additional movement may cause more damage to the nerve. Advising the patient to limit movement is encouraged, but an inflamed or painful nerve may require splinting to immobilize and protect the nerve from h arm. A.Upper Extremities : Limit repeated movements and heavy lifting; do not sleep with elbows and wrists flexed. An elbow pad, arm splint or wrist splint may be required to impede or prevent movement that would harm the inflamed nerve. Avoid repetitive motions Elbow Pad (top) & Wrist Splint bottom Elbow Splint B .Lower Extremities: An elastic wrap (cautiously wrapped), compression socks, or a rigid walking boot may help to decrease swelling, immobilize the ankle and relieve discomfort in the leg. Elastic Wraps Compressive Socks Walking Boot Routine care may be required to manage thick nails and callus to prevent wounds. An open wound becomes a risk for subsequent infection. Infections that go unnoticed due to lack of sensation can eventually penetrate to the bone and result in progressive 42 shortening of the digits. Offloading pressure is paramount to w ound healing in patients with loss of sensation and deformities. Offloading is accomplished using adhesive felt, casts, splints and other devices. In addition to off- loading, wound management consists of appropriate dressings, debridement of devitalized tissue and management of osteomyelitis. Patients with clawing or foot drop may benefit from specific exercises, splints and education to pre vent contractures and progressive deformities. These patients may also be eligible for reconstructive surgery. To consult NHDP staff regarding non-healing wounds, surgical candidates and difficult cases ( 800) 642-2477. (See Appendix J-O for nail/callus care, wound management, basics of wound care, and offloading techniques such as adhesive felt and toe pillows .) 5. Assistive Devices/ Footwear and Orthotics The patient who lacks sensation can sustain injuries or wounds without noticing, even while performing simple daily activities (i.e. pinching a key tightly in an attempt to open a door, or holding a ceramic mug that has become hot from the microwave or the beverage inside). A combination of modified techniques and assistive/protective devices decrease the risk of injury and maximize independence in the performance of daily functional tasks. Some of these protective devices prevent injury by insulating from the elements or extreme temperature. Other devices prevent injury by increasing the surface area, whic h decreases the pressure on the limb. Some commonly recommended adaptive and safety devices include the following: A.Eyes : Contured eye mask - worn at night protects the eyes from dryness due to Lagophthalmos. Wraparound sunglasses protect the eyes from dust, wind and exposure to UV light. Broad brimmed hat protects the eyes from exposure t o UV light. B.Hands : are susceptible to burns and cuts in the kitchen. Adaptive safety equipment is important for those with LOPS to prevent injuries and subsequent deformity. Long arm oven mitts Insulated mugs Tab grabber 43 C.Feet: Protective footwear cannot be overemphasized. Proper shoes and orthotics, worn as prescribed, can protect the feet from injury and ulceration. Improper footwear, or going barefoot, may lead to serious harm and cause ulceration. An expert, such as a Pedorthist or Podiatrist, must address the footwear and orthotic needs of a patient withLOPS and deformity. Tight shoe Shoe that fits Rigid Rocker Shoe Custom insoles Patient understanding and compliance with prevention protocols is the most important aspect for prevention of injury and disability. For more information on POD, assistive devices, footwear, orthotics and vendors, see NHDP website: https://www.hrsa.gov/hansens -disease . A patient with decreased corneal sensation in the eyes or LOPS in the hands and feet must be monitored indefinitely - even after being released from medical treatment! XIII. SURGICAL INTERV ENTION For appropriate candidates, surgery may be an option to expedite wound healing, minimize deformity and maximize function. Depending on the patient's need and condition, the following surgical procedures may be considered: A.Hands and Feet 1.Debridement - Surgical removal of non -viable tissue including infected bone to promote wound healing. 2.Skin Graft/Flap - Once a wound is devoid of all non -viable tissue, a skin graft or flap may expedite wound healing. 3.Tendon Transfer - A tendon transfer procedure involves moving or transferring the tendon insertion of a healthy muscle to the insertion site of a weak or paralyzedmuscle(s) in order to restore balance and function to the limb. This procedure ismost commonly used to cor rect mobile claw hand deformity and less often to rebalance a drop foot. 4.Nerve Transposition - This procedure is indicated to decrease pain and prevent entrapment of the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel. 5.Tendon Release - A tendon release procedure, such as an Achilles tendon lengthening or toe flexor release may help reduce high -pressure areas that translate onto the foot. 44 6.Arthrodesis - An arthrodesis involves fusing a joint to improve the position of the digit . This procedure is typically used for longstanding paralysis where a contracted digit has resulted in joint subluxation. 7.Amputation - An amputation is a last resort procedure, but is required for uncontrollable sepsis, an avascular extremity or when function will be increased by prosthetic usage. 8.Osteotomy - This procedure involves removal of a rigid and prominent bony deformity in order to decrease high -pressure areas. B.Eyes 1.Tarsorrhaphy - This procedure involves the temporary or permanent joining of select portions of the upper and lower eyelid s. It is indicated to protect the cornea from exposure due to facial paralysis. Lateral tarsorrhaphy is preferable for cosmetic and functional reasons. 2.Laser Iridectomy - This procedure involves creating a hole in the outer edge of the iris, leading to an opening and widening of the angle to allow for improved fluid outflow. It is intended to preserve vision and prevent glaucoma from occurring or progressing. 3.Trabeculoplasty - A trabeculoplasty is used for certain cases of glaucoma to lower intraocular pres sure. 4.Cataract surgery - Cataract removal is a common procedure and often used with intraocular lens implantation. It may be required for HD patients who have been on long -term steroids. XIV. CONTACT EVALUATION A. C ontact : In the U.S., a Hansen's disease \" contact \" is defined as a person living in the same household with a new patient in the three -year period prior to the beginning of treatment. Examination of contacts of known cases is the simpl est and only practical form of active case finding in low incidence areas such as the United States. This examination can be performed by a physician or public health nurse . The patient always has a right to privacy and may refuse to notify a contact that they have been diagnosed with HD. In that case, treat the patient as anyone exercising the right to privacy. If a person becomes aware that they are a contact and wishes to be evaluated, the clinic is obligated to screen the patient. If the contact refuses to be screened, it is not mandatory . B.Contact Examinati ons: 1.Examine the entire skin surface45 2.Nerve function assessment of the peripheral nerves, focusing primarily on the eyes, hands, and feet (See Appendix F,G,H ). C.Contact Follow -Up: C ontacts with a nega tive initial exam do not need follow - up as long as the patient has been educated about the disease and what symptoms should be reported to the health care provider. D. C hemoprophylaxis: The NHDP does NOT recommend chemoprophylaxis for contacts. There are no known intermediate hosts and M. leprae does not survive for long periods outside the body. There is no vaccine available and chemoprophylaxis is impractical in most situations. Thus, at present, there is no practi cal means of primary prevention, (i.e. the detection and protection of persons at risk). Hansen's disease control is based on secondary prevention; that is, the early detection and regular treatment of all detected cases existing in an area. XV.AMBULATORY CARE PROGRAM Individuals living in the United States and its territories (Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa) may receive medical care for the diagnosis and treatment of HD related conditions at one of the federally supported outpatient clinics throughout the USA.

Either elliptical or punch biopsy is preferred (4 mm punch is sufficient) Fixation and processing options: If only histopath ologic examination is desired, fix the biopsy in 10% neutral buffered formalin If PCR testing is desired in addition to histopathologic examination, fix the biopsy in 70% Ethanol. Since formalin damages the biopsy 's DNA, reliable results from PCR testing c an only be obtained from specimens fixed in 70% Ethanol. Paraffin fixed block (both histopathologic exam and PCR testing can be done) 4 unstained slides Send to NHDP: Biopsy in formalin OR ethanol OR paraffin block OR 4 unstained slides Documentation: Request form and basic patient information (including DOB or age) and clinical questions: Patient treated?

Please clearly specify which tests should be performed by checking the appropriate boxes below (test(s) to be ordered) . Please include a copy of any related biopsy reports or clinical photos. Please send blocks with a cold pack. The following are the requirements needed to send a biopsy for evaluation: 1.A biopsy collected with a 4 -5 mm punch. The specimen should be deep enough t o include subcutaneous fat. This depth is important because the most prominently involved nerves will most often be found in the deep dermis. As a general rule, the biopsy should be taken from an active margin of a lesion. 2.After initial fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin (for best PCR results tissue should not remain in formalin for more than 24 hours), process tissue into a paraffin block. *Initial pathology review should also be conducted prior to submitting the case to NHDP. *If using an auto embedder, specimen should be re-embedded prior to sending to avoid plastic cage. 3.Slides of unstained sections - 5 unstained slides are also required for staining & histology review at NHDP. 4.Stained slides may also be submitted for histological review --H&E & Fite stains only. 5.If tissue cannot be processed into a paraffin block, place specimen in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and submit for processing at the NHDP. Expedited shipping methods should be used to avoid prolonged exposure to formalin. Packages are only received during weekdays with the exception of federal holidays. *Please note: pathology services are conducted on a first come, first serve basis and subject to current workload/pathologist availability. Obtaining initial pathology review before sending is strongly recommended. PCR TESTING -- The clinical laboratory is able to conduct PCR testing on the same formalin fixed specimen submitted for histological evaluation. Testing is limited to the identification of M. leprae and M. lepromatosis. Requirements for PCR testing: 1.Paraffin block - required for PCR testing. a.If tissue is too small, PCR may not be feasible and another biopsy may be required. b.Please send blocks with a cold pack to prevent damage/melting during warmer months. c.If auto embedded, specimen will need to be re-embedded prior to sending to avoid plastic cage. 2. Formalin fixed samples may also be submitted for PCR testing if tissue cannot be processed into a block.

NHDP FORM 199 REV JUN 2022 PATHOLOGY REQUEST FORM55 APPENDIX C Preparation and Examination of Skin Smears The skin smear is a valuable, cost -effective tool in the routine management of the patient with Hansen's disease . The smear is a means of estimating the number of acid -fast bacteria present, reported as the Bacterial Index (BI), and is important in determining the type and severity of disease as well as assessing the response to treatment. Initial skin smears are usually taken from 6 \"routine sites\" (both earlobes, elbows, and knees) as well as several typical lesions from the patient. The time interval between repeat smears to evaluate response to treatment isdetermined by the physician, but in general, annual smears are adequate for monitoring response to treatment and during the following -up period to detect any evidence of relapse. All microscopic slides on which skin smears are made should be pre -cleaned in 70% alcohol, acetone, or alcohol- acetone to remove amorphous debris. The slides are wiped dry with a clean hand towel. Razor blades or scalpels that are used in smear taking are likewise cleaned. Slides should be air -dried and NEVER heat fixed. They may be sent in protective mailers to: National Hansen's Disease Progra ms Attention: Clinical Laboratory - Smears Interline Avenue, Baton Rouge, La. 70809, 33 Procedure for Obtaining Smears 1.Unive rsal precautions should be observed in obtaining skin smears. 2.The skin is cleansed with 70% alcohol and air- dried or wiped dry with cotton. (Zeph iran tends to make the skin too slippery and is not recommended.) 3.A fold of skin is made relatively avascular by pinching or mild clamping. If the skin cannot be grasped by pinching, it can be compressed. A surgeon's glove may aid in grasping. 4.Local anesthesia is generally unnecessary. (If ther e is not adequate decrease in sensation, obtain local anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine or Ethyl Chloride spray.) The compression of the skin by pinching aids in the anesthesia. 5.An incision 3 -5 mm long and 2 -3 mm deep is made with an alcohol cleansed, single - edged razor blade. A scalpel with a #15 Bard -Parker blade may also be used. Mild pressure to maintain relative avascularity is continuously applied to the area until an adequate smear has been obtained.56 6.A small amount of blood does not interfere with the reading, but large amounts should be avoided and can usually be controlled by the amount of pressure of the pinch. If excessive bleeding occurs, it can be wiped away with a cotton swab. 7.After the incision is made, and before the blade is withdrawn, the inner surface of thewound is scraped with the blade held at a right angle to the incision. Upon scraping, tissue fluid and dermal tissue are obtained. 8.The material is transferred to the cleaned microscope slide. A moderately thick smear, with a visible uniform opacity is made. The smear is made in a circular manner on the slide, no larger than a pencil eraser (5-7 mm), beginning peripherally and ending in the center, leaving a central \"button\" (2 -4 mm) which can be easily focused upon with the microscope. Slide s should be properly labeled as shown for 3 routinesites. 9.A Band -Aid is generally sufficient to protect the smear site. 10.A single technician takes all smears to insure more uniform and consistent results. 11.The smears are then sent to the National Hansen's Disease Programs for reading. 12.A chart to diagram sites of the skin smears is found in Appendix A, page 3. Staining of Skin Smears 1.Dry the slide with smear at room temperature. DO NOT HEAT FIX . 2.Place slides on a staining rack and flood with 10% formalin for 15 minutes for fixation. 3.Gently rinse well with tap water. All formalin must be removed to prevent the formation of precipitates. 4.Flood slides with Ziehl -Neelsen carbol -fuchsin for twenty minutes. The carbol -fuchsin must be filtered before each use. Filtering can be accomplished by placing pre -cut filter paper strips on the slide prior to the addition of stain and left in place for the full twenty minutes. 5.After removing and discarding filter paper strips, gently rinse slides well with tap water to re move excess stain. 6.Decolorize with 2% acid alcohol for 1 minute. This is best accomplished by placing slide into a two -slide plastic slide mailer filled with acid alcohol. Occasional up and down movement of the slide in the acid alcohol should remove all e xcess carbol fuchsin. 7.Gently rinse slides thoroughly with tap water. 8.Counterstain with alkaline methylene blue for 30 seconds to 1 minute. 9.Gently rinse well with tap water and air dry. 57 NOTE: Positive & negative control slides must be used each day for quality control purposes. Z-N Carbol Fuchsin Stain: Basic fuchsin 95% ethanol 10.0mls. Water, to make 100.0 mls. Dissolve stain in alcohol, and then add phenol/water mixture. Let stand overnight before use. Store in dark brown bottle. Stable for 1 year. Alkaline Methylene Blue: KOH (1 ethanol 30.0mls. Water, to make 100.0 mls. Dissolve the stain in the alcohol, then add the KOH and water mixture and allow to sit overnight. Filter before use. Microscopic Examination of Skin Smears The stained smears are examined with a quality microscope using the oil immersion objective (x100) to determine the total number of bacilli. The same individual should read all smears for the purpose of consistency. The smear will have similar numbers of bacilli throughout. However, four separate quadrants of the smear are examined and averaged to establish the Bacterial Index. Reporting the Bacterial Index The results are reported on a 0 to 6+ semi -logarithmic scale using a descriptive phrase or numerical code. This is an indicator of the total bacillary load of the patient. It falls about 1 point per year during effective treatment as dead bacilli undergo lysis and are absorbed. 58 Very Numerous ( +6 ) over 1000 bacilli per oil +5 ) 100 oil Moderate ( +4 ) 10 oil Few ( +3 ) 1 to 10 oil immersion Very few ( +2 ) 1 to 10 bacilli per 10 fields. Rare ( +1 ) 1 to 10 bacilli per 100 fields. None found ( NF ) No AFB seen on entire site. Very ( +6 ) over 1000 bacilli per oil +5 ) 100 oil Moderate ( +4 ) 10 oil Few ( +3 ) 1 to 10 oil immersion Very few ( +2 ) 1 to 10 bacilli per 10 fields. Rare ( +1 ) 1 to 10 bacilli per 100 fields. None found ( NF ) No AFB seen on entire site. Instructions for Completing the Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Surveillance Form The Hansen's Disease or Leprosy Surveillance Form (LSF) is the document used to report leprosy cases to the U.S. National Hansen's Disease Registry. These data are used for epidemiological, clinical, and basic research studies throughout the National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP), and are the official source for information on leprosy cases in the U.S. Please report this case to your state health department. The NHDP does not report to state health departments. T he information requested on the LSF is used by many clinicians and researchers, and collection of all information is highly desirable. However, the fields that are boldfaced on the form and in the instructions below are considered to be the minimal information needed to register a patient. Failure to provide this information will result in the form being returned which creates additional work and may cause delays in obtaining program services for the patient. 1. Reporting State: Use the abbreviation of the state from which the report is being sent. This is usually the stat e of the clinician's office and not necessarily the patient's resident state. 2. Date of Report: This is date of the initial LSF completion. If patient was previously reported and has relapsed, write the word \"RELAPSE\" next to the date. 3. Social Security Number: Optional; self -explanatory. 4. Patient Name: Self-explanatory. 5. Present Address: Please include the county and zip code which are use d to geographically cluster patients. 6. Place of Birth: Include state and city , if born in the U.S., or the country, if foreign born. 7. Date of Birth/Sex: Self-explanatory. 8. Race/Ethnicity: This information should be voluntarily provided by the patient. If the patient refuses or indicates a race/ethnicity category not listed, check the \"Not Specified\" box. 9. Date Entered the U.S.: For patients who have immigrated to the U.S., provide the month and year of entry. 10.D ate of Onset of Symptoms: This information is usually the patient's recollection of when classic leprosy symptoms (rash, nodule formation, paresthesia, decreased peripheral sensation, etc.) were first noticed. 11.Date Leprosy First Diagnosed: Provide the month and year a diagnosis was made. This usually coincides with a biopsy date if one was performed. 12.How many doctors have you seen for this problem? This will be based primarily on the patient's recollection.
