This causes intracellular components to leak which ultimately leads to cell death. This agent is appropriate for most fungi but some notable in vitro resistance occurs with Please note that liposomal formulations do not lend themselves to testing according to CLSI methods. As the lipid does not add to antifungal activity but rather only facilitates delivery of the parent AMB in higher concentrations to the site of infection, we recommend testing only parent compound when interested in MICs for binds to sterol in the cell membrane disrupting membrane integrity. This causes the membrane it to leak intracellular components which ultimately leading to cell death. NATAMYCIN (NAT) (Pimaricin) CPT 87186 Moulds CPT 87188 NAT is similar to other polyenes but is available only as a topical for the treatment of eye infections. and RNA synthesis. This agent should not be used as sole therapy as fungi are known to rapidly develop resistance CASPOFUNGIN which is a necessary component of the fungal cell wall. These agents (echinocandins) have excellent activity against most Candida spp. but do not have activity against Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, or Trichosporon spp. CAS, ANID, AND MICA have activity IBX inhibits glucan synthesis which is a necessary component of the fungal cell wall. It has activity against most Candida spp. but do not have activity against synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. This drug is widely used for the treatment of yeast infections but both acquired and innate resistance has been noted. This agent is not appropriate for aspergilli, member of the order Mucorales (causative agents of mucormycosis or zygomycosis), or fusaria. ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. This drug is widely used for the treatment of both yeast and mould infections with excellent in vitro activity against the ergosterol, critical component in the fungal cell wall. This agent is effective against both yeast and mould fungi. In vitro activity ergosterol, critical component in the fungal cell wall. This POSA inhibits synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. This agent has very excellent in vitro activity against a wide range of fungi with MIC values usually lower than most other azoles. ISAVUCONAZOLE Yeast CPT 87186, Moulds CPT 87188 ISA of ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. This agent has very excellent in vitro activity against a wide range of fungi. It is FDA approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. Its use is limited to topical applications. (CLOT) (Lotrimin, Mycelex) Yeast of ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. Its use is limited to topical ergosterol, a critical component in the fungal cell wall. Its use is limited to topical synthesis of ergosterol. This agent has activity against many fungi with excellent activity against dermatophytic fungi. In vitro, this agent may enhance the activity of azoles in combination testing against a variety of effective only against dermatophytic fungi and is not an appropriate choice for yeasts or non-dermatophytic moulds.
