Hepatitis B is a virus that attacks the liver. It can cause permanent liver damage and scarring. In some cases it can be life threatening. It is the number one cause of liver cancer in the world. Some people who get hepatitis B are very sick, with fever, a yellow colour skin and eyes (jaundice), vomiting, and pain in the abdomen. About half the people who are infected with hepatitis B never feel sick, and they can spread the disease without knowing it. Hepatitis B is caused by contact with infected blood or body fluids. This can happen in one of the following ways: - through a break in the skin such as a cut, bleeding gums, needle stick, or tattoo - by sharing needles, toothbrushes, or razors - during unprotected sexual contact - during birth, from a mother who has the virus It is preventable through immunization. You cannot catch the virus from sneezes, coughs, or hugs or by using the same dishes as someone with hepatitis B. What Is Hepatitis B Vaccine? Hepatitis B vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine that provides protection against hepatitis B virus. It contains no blood or living virus. It has been in use in Canada for more than 20 years. Who Should Receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine? In Nova Scotia, immunization is offered to children in the School Immunization Program to ensure that they are protected well before they may be exposed to the disease.CAUTION Who Should Not Receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine?
