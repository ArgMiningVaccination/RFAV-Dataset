A Detox, to detoxify or a detoxification process/diet all refer to the same process. Removing unwanted elements from the system. By using diet, herbs and exercise we allow the body to recover from the burden on the modern western diet, in particular - the liver and lymphatic system. A detox will help clean the blood and rid the body of mucus, toxins, heavy metals and other nasties that accumulate over time. Even if we did not eat, breathing alone in a polluted environment can stress our system. Benefits of a Detox At Naturopathy Melbourne we love to help people detox and feel the benefits of increased energy, mental clarity, bright eyes and clear skin. We have no gimmicky products to promote, just gentle, healthy and effective ways to detox using natural herbs, and at a pace, your body can handle. You will discover how you can feel more alive, and be your healthiest weight - without faddy diets. We can help you reach your peak condition at any age. Naturopathic Digestive Care Our naturopath has a special interest in treating problems with the digestive system. Many people do not realise the critical role it plays in general health and wellbeing. An unhealthy digestive system can result in lowered energy levels, a decreased resistance to infections and reduced mental clarity. Do you have the guts to be healthy? Or have you already begun to suspect that your digestive issues could be related to other health problems you are experiencing? Many digestive disturbances begin with feeling tired and bloated. These can over time become more chronic and begin to affect your daily routine. We can help you if you are suffering from abdominal bloating, constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, candida infection or suspected food allergies or intolerances. These types of issues can have a profound effect on energy levels so many people find that treating these problems also has a beneficial impact on their lives in general. There are many other health conditions that can be successfully treated with natural medicines such as PMS, irregular periods, recurrent colds & flu, sinus congestion, eczema, sleeping problems, anxiety, and stress.
