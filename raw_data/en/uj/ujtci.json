Not only is she an amazing person that truly cares you, but she is second to none at her craft. She made me feel so comfortable and at ease. Everything was first class from the moment we shook hands til we said goodbye. The table was comfy and sheets were incredibly soft. I'm not even sure how she did it but her hands are true magic. It was exactly what I needed. To be honest, in the past I may have considered what she does as a little woo woo, but that is until I got informed. And since I had been dealing with different things in my life that made me feel a little off centered I decided to give her a go. Not only did I feel amazing afterwards, but I just felt totally cleared out. I felt like some of the tightness and stuff I'd been holding onto had just dissipated by the end. Could not recommend any higher. Amazing person and amazing at what she does. A true healer. It'd be silly to not work with her. - 3/18/2021 An incredible experience that really relieved stress and opened my body up both physically and mentally. I really enjoy the convenience of in home visits. I highly recommend the 90 minute \"fusion\" as this is the beginners course that really is dictated to what you as the client is looking for. - 6/18/2019 Anita has great active energy, she's got a happy and lively attitude. She truly cares about the well being of all her clients. If you have any questions or concerns she's very knowledgeable and informative. She's got strong and warm hands to get deep into the tissues and continue heat and blood flow. Business owner information Anita T. 6/20/2019 Thank you so much, Priscilla for your kind words and sharing this review with others. I appreciate you and the work we've done together :-) - 5/22/2017 I had some back pains after playing some golf and went to see Anita for some help. She did an amazing job and I felt much better. She was very professional and new exactly how to help my pain. Scheduling time with her was a breeze! Would definitely recommend her services to anyone! - 8/10/2017 I was referred to Anita and her company through a friend because I've been having low back issues and discomfort when I golf. She's come to my house a few times now and my hips and overall body haven't felt this great in years. She's taught me a lot about the body and she gives me \"homework\" and exercises to practice and keep me feeling good after our appointments. - 10/7/2019 Can I just say WOW! I've had several massages from so many different places but Anita, at Mind and Body was by far the most rejuvenating and tranquil experience I've had thus far. Sometimes I feel like my massage therapist doesn't listen to the exact ailments I'm having so it was so nice that Anita took the time to ask me questions about where the pain is and how long I've had it. I came to her with a shooting pain in my right shoulder that two others masseuses tried to work out prior but couldn't alleviate long term. It's now been almost three weeks with no pain at all! I am beyond grateful to have found someone with the knowledge of how to pinpoint a nerve and be able to work it out like she did! I will definitely be back for a relaxing massage in the near future. Thank you again Anita, your a lifesaver! Business owner information Anita T. 10/8/2019 Thank you SO much, Allison, for sharing your experience. I'm thrilled you're still pain free and together we were able to conquer that battle! - 3/20/2017 I just want to start off by saying Anita is the spirit fingers to my back! I suffer from lower back pain along with pinched nerve damage all along the sides of my legs and going in with any type of back injury you are very cautious about what type of treatment you may seek. I must say that i was super pleased from the moment i walked in a simple warm friendly greeting sets the right tone. Everything from the whole set up is super comfortable and it definitely sets the mood to put you in a relaxed state of mind which allows the session to go easy peasy. Not only did i go home relaxed but the stress built up in my shoulders which caused headaches was gone I would definitely recommend and will be going back soon! Thank you so much and keep doing what your doing and keep them spirit fingers going! Your amazing!!! - 2/25/2014First to Review I had a massage for the first time from mind and body by Anita and let me just say it was amazing! She is very professional and gives the bothersome areas the attention they need. Anita had me relaxed from the beginning of the session and by the end I was so relaxed it was hard for me to get up. That night I had the most amazing deep sleep I have had in weeks. I would definitely rank mind and body in my top two places for massages. Can't wait to schedule my next appointment! - 5/4/2014 I've had the opportunity to work with various healers and massage therapists over the years and with Anita, I can truly say there is something really unique and special about her approach. Her touch is instantaneously healing and she is extremely gifted and intuitive. With every session, I can feel her clearing the energy blockages from my body and I always leave feeling at peace and illuminated. She is beautiful and soulful and it is reflected in her caring nature towards her clients. - 10/3/2015 I found Anita on Yelp while on a girls trip there. She was amazing! She was great on getting back to me quickly and working with my schedule. You must schedule a session with her.
