Program Funding Opportunity Description 1. Purpose This notice announces the opportunity for current Health Center Program award recipients to apply for FY 2021 Health Center Program Service Expansi on - School - Based Service Sites (SBSS) supplemental funding. The purpose of SBSS is to expand access to health center services by increas ing the number of patients who access comprehensive primary health care through Health Center Program award recipients' service delivery sites located at schools (preschool1 through secondary school (i.e., high school) . Health centers will accomplish this by adding new Health Center Program service delivery sites at schools or expanding required and additional health care services at existing Health Center Program service delivery sites located at schools . Such sites ( Health Center Program service delivery sites located at a school or on the grounds of a school ) are hereafter referred to as school -based service sites. For purposes of this funding opportunity, service expansion is defined as new or expanded general primary medical care, mental health, substance use disorder, oral health, vision, and/or enabling services provided face-to -face or virtually to health center patients at school -based service sites. Health centers may not use SBSS funding to support services provided on behalf of third party entities, including schools and/or school districts . Health centers must ensure compliance with all Health Center Program requirements, including those described in the Health Center Compliance Manual as well as those relating to scope of project, in operating new or expanded school -based service sites. 2. Background The Health Center Program is authorized by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254b . Existing health centers would receive f unding under this funding opportunity under sections 330(e), (g), (h) and/or (i) of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254b(e), (g), (h), and/or (i)), as applicable. Approximately 35 percent of Health Center Program award recipients currently operate school -based service sites, which provided services to more than 885,000 patients in 2019. SBSS funding will increase the number of patients receiving services through new and expanded school -based service sites. Funding Requirements Your application must demonstrat e how you will use SBSS funds to address unmet needs in your approved service area by increasing the number of patients served at school -based service sites by adding or expanding one or more of the following services at a new or existing school -based service site: General primary medical care, Mental health, Substance use disorder , Oral health, 1 For the purposes of this funding opportunity, preschool is defined as a school readiness program targeted to children ages 3 and up. HRSA -21-093 2 Vision , and/or Enabling services . Expanded services can be made available through establishment of newly proposed school -based service site(s) or expansion of services at existing school based service site(s). Services may be provided to health center patients through face-to -face and/or telehealth visits to students located at school -based service site(s) . However, a school - based service site, by definition, must include some face-to -face services.2 SBSS funds may be used to support varied operational costs , including personnel and supplies, as well as one-time costs related to: Equipment purchases, including mobile units3 and telehealth infrastructure, and Minor alteration and renovation (minor A/R ) necessary for increasing the number of school -based service site patients . Health centers may not use SBSS funding to support services provided on behalf of third party entities, including but not limited to schools and/or school districts. If you propose to establish a new school -based service site, it must be open and operational within 120 days of award. Failure to verify that each proposed new site is operational within 120 days of award will result in the placement of a condition of award, which provides a time-phased approach for resolution. If you fail to successfully resolve a site-related condition within the specified timeframes, HRSA may withdraw support through termination of all, or part, of the SBSS award per 45 CFR \u00a7 75.371 . You are encouraged to consider the cultural and clinical competence of your health center's personnel , as well as children and adolescents ' barriers to seeking care, such as trauma, stigma, and social determinants of health (SDOH) as you develop your proposal . SDOH include factors like socioeconomic status, neighborhood and physical environment, social support networks, community violence, and intimate partner violence. SDOH affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality -of-life outcomes and risks. Addressing SDOH, such as intimate partner violence (IPV) and adverse child experiences (ACEs) , is a HRSA objective to improve the health and well -being of individuals and the communities in which they reside. Telehealth can be an important tool for delivering services and resources to patients . Telehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote, at a distance, health care, patient and professional health-related education, health administration, and public health. Technologies i nclude video conferencing, the internet, the store-and-forward imaging, streaming media, and terrestrial and wireless communications. You are encouraged to use telehealth in your proposed service delivery plans when feasible or appropriate. Additional general information on telehealth can be found at https://telehealth.hhs.gov/ . Information specific to your health center scope of project is available at 2 For more information, see PAL 2020- 01: Telehealth and Health Center Scope of Project . 3 If you propose to purchase and/or use a mobile unit, it must be affiliated with a permanent or seasonal service site (a fixed building location) and staffed by health center personnel. HRSA -21-093 3 https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/programrequirements/pdf/telehealth- pal.pdf . In addition, if you use broadband or telecommunications services for the provision of health care, HRSA strongly encourages you to seek discounts through the Federal Communication Commission's Universal Service Program. For information about such discounts , see https://www.usac.org/rural -health-care/ . Patients may also be eligible for free or low cost mobile or broadband services through the Universal Service Lifeline program at https://www.lifelinesupport.org/ . II. Award Information 1.

HRSA may also consider assessment of risk and the other pre-award activities described below in Section V.3. Assessment of Risk . See section 6.3 of HRSA's SF-424 Two-Tier Application Guide for more details . Compliance Status15 You will not receive SBSS funding if you meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the time HRSA makes funding decisions : Are no longer an active Health Center Program awardee (und er sections 330(e) , (g), (h), and/or (i)), or Have any 30-day conditions on your H80 award related to Health Center Program requirement area(s ). Rural/Urban Distribution of Awards Aggregate awards in FY 2021 will be made to ensure that the ratio of rural to urban target populations is not less than two to three or greater than three to two as set forth 15 See Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight of the Compliance Manual. HRSA -21-093 23 in section 330(e)(6)(A) of the PHS Act. In order to ensure this distribution, HRSA may award funds to appli cations out of rank order. 3. Assessment of Risk HRSA may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial instability that directly relates to the organization's ability to implement statutory, regulatory , or other requirements ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 ). HRSA reviews applications receiving a favorable objective review for other considerations that include past performance, as applicable, cost analysis of the project/program budget, assessment of your management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibility, and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requiring just -in-time submissions. HRSA may ask you to submit additional programmatic or administrative information (such as an updated budget or \"other support\" information) or to undertake certain activities (such as negotiation of an indirect cost rate) in anticipation of an award. However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that HRSA will make an award. Following review of all applicable information, HRSA's approving and business management officials will determine whether HRSA can make an award, if special conditions are required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Award decisions are discretionary and are not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. HRSA is required to review and consider any information about your organization that is in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) . You may review and comment on any information about your organization that a federal awarding agency previously entered. HRSA will consider your comments , in addition to other information in FAPIIS , in making a judgment about your organization's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 HHS Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants . HRSA will report to FAPIIS a determination that an applicant is not qualified ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.212 ). VI. Award Administration Information 1.
