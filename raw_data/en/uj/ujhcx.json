If official documentation is not obtainable from your physician's office, primary or secondary school or military records, the following is recommended: 1. Receive twostep TB testing (see below) 2. Receive a Tdap. 3. Have the following blood tests drawn - Rubeola antibody IgG, Mumps antibody IgG, Rubella antibody IgG. If you have completed the Hepatitis B series also have a Hepatitis B Surface antibody test drawn. 4. If you have had chickenpox, have a varicella antibody IgG drawn. If you have not had chickenpox receive 2 doses of vaccine. Do I have to get a MMR titer if I have documentation of two vaccines? The University of Cincinnati does not require it at this time. However there may be specific clinical sites that would require it. If you can not provide documentation of 2 MMR vaccines, then a titer will be required. If the titer is negative, a booster will required followed by a repeat titer 30 days later. I had the Hepatitis B Vaccine years ago but did not get a titer, what should I do? If you have documentation of all three doses of Hepatitis B Vaccine have a titer drawn to see if you have antibodies (HBSAB). If the test is negative get a booster then retiter in 12 months. If this test is negative, you will have to repeat the series then retiter 12 months later. If no documentation is available from your original series, you will need to repeat the series then have a titer drawn 1 2 months later. I do not have immunity to hepatitis B after receiving 3 vaccines, now what do I do? Not all individuals will have a positive titer result after the initial 3 vaccinations. A protective antibody response is 10 or more milliinternational units per milliliter (>=10mIU/mL). You will get a booster and then retiter 1 month later. If at that point you show immunity, you are considered complete. If you are not yet showing immunity you will be receiving a 2 more vaccines and then a final titer four weeks after your last vaccine. After a total of 6 vaccines and final titer you will not be request to obtain further vaccines. I had chickenpox, do I have to have varicella titer? YES. Most people who have had the disease will develop antibodies, however because there are some that may not, a titer is required. We have found about 8% of our health profession students with a history of disease have negative titers. Some histories are not totally reliable. For these reasons, we have to be 100% certain that we do our part to prevent the spread of this disease, to our patients. If your titer is positive, no further action is necessary. If your test is negative, you will have to get 2 doses of varicella vaccine. I had two doses of Varicella vaccine, do I need to have a titer drawn? No, the requirement is either a positive Varicella titer (VZVIGG) OR 2 doses of the varicella vaccine. A titer after the vaccine is not required. What is a Twostep TB test and do I need it? A twostep TB test is simply having a TB test administered, then having another one administered 1 3 weeks later. If you receive annual TB tests, you can submit your last 2 testing dates to meet the TB requirement. If you have not had a TB test within the past 2 years you will need to obtain a twostep test. Twostep testing is required for the initial skin testing of adults who are going to be tested periodically, such as health care workers. This twostep approach can reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction to a subsequent skin test will be misinterpreted as a recent infection.
